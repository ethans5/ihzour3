i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no 
 the house divide ayes noes 
 question accordingly negative 
 reading 
 relevant document correspondence between the petitions committee and the minister for equalities on conversion practice report to the house on   november   and   december e petition ensure trans people be fully protect under any conversion therapy ban and e petition make lgbt conversion therapy illegal in the uk 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 when my former partner disclose to i that he have twice go through conversion practice facilitate through his family in church and secondly through his work in the church i be shock that such practice still take place in the century the trauma he still carry around with he be immense no number of law can rewrite history but we can pledge as all the main party do in to ensure that no go through the trauma that he and many other still have in the future 
 in recent year we have have petition debate debate in parliament write statement and set of government research consultation and briefing but in year we have fail to do what other country have do in month which be to produce a ban that stop people falsely claim that they can convert people ’s sexual orientation or transgender identity that false hope false advertising as it be be not innocuous and it cause great harm but it be not currently capture in our law despite all the main party agree that this be an area we must act on the issue have be put in the too hard box the government have consult on it and year have pass catch in a culture war where survivor be forget the government ’s bill with its bell and whistle seek perfection but delay have allow the practice to go unimpeded and that be of no use to man or beast 
 i congratulate my hon friend on bring the bill forward to pick up on that point it be strike how long this have take compare with other nation the stalling come from government when surely we be simply seek to protect vulnerable people seem a little obvious do he agree that any ban need to be inclusive of all lgbt+ people 
 i totally agree everyone in the house will know that i be not immune to get stick into this debate we have have spar partner across the chamber on these issue but that have lead we nowhere it have lead to the delay itself and give a green light to many who think this practice might now be acceptable rather than the abhorrence we all think it to be 
 the hon gentleman make the important and strong inference that this be a commonplace occurrence will he give some evidence of the distribution of conversion practice their incidence and who be be affect what be the true datum on the matter 
 i will come to exactly that in a moment but the hon member make valid point that we should address 
 some be worry when i be draw in the private member ’s bill ballot that i would produce as whip put it a batshit crazy bill other be worried that i would produce a bill that would not stop this practice and would have too many loophole but after month of meeting quiet conversation go on bbc politic live offer a meeting to anyone who want and meet colleague across this house all with different view i hope that the word of the same whip say blimey he ’ actually produce something quite sensible will ring in the ear of everyone in this debate 
 i congratulate my hon friend on this incredibly important bill a number of constituent have write passionately to i about it accord to the uk government ’s own research of lgbt people have be offer or have undergone conversion therapy that indicate that in the last year thousand of people have be at risk of harm do he agree that the scale of it must be recognise and that it must stop 
 i quite agree i understand from previous conversation that the government do not outright oppose the bill we will see how the minister respond today as that might have slightly change it be quite right that they do not oppose it because they have put forward this proposal numerous time they be reserve judgment on some of the technicality i have give the government opportunity to propose amendment in the public consultation that i have run they propose no amendment in fact the government agree to do pre legislative scrutiny of their own bill but month later that have not happen 
 on   january   i table an amendment to the online safety bill on conversion therapy we have the number but i tell the government that if they say in a write ministerial statement and on the floor of this house that they would commit to pre legislative security that would be complete by october i would not push the amendment i do not push the amendment because that commitment be give do the hon member agree that we have be bring to this place because the government have not deliver on their manifesto commitment despite have make promise on the floor of this house to conservative member 
 i quite agree that be why it be important that the government support the bill and thrash out the detail later in committee 
 when i meet the secretary of state we talk about track progress get the bill in committee and use it to thrash out the detail and allow the government to keep develop their own plan inform by the committee i hope the government will honour the spirit of those discussion as i have enter into this process i hope we can have a full debate and get to a natural end but if need be with the permission of mr speaker and the deputy speakers i believe that we have the number to divide on a closure motion it would be much well to air the view of the house without dividing and allow this new collaborative tone to sort out the issue in committee 
 i remind hon member that conservative members have table amendment to the criminal justice bill that provide less protection and rather than the fine under my bill prison sentence this be an opportunity to get consensus before far reach measure be push to a vote in this house if this bill be talk out today i will support those measure 
 i will spend the rest of my speech on the technical aspect of the bill and why we have come to the judgment that we have much of that be outline in my explanatory note which my office have draft i be sure that other colleague will want to talk about the experience of their constituent and i be happy to take as many intervention as i can but i will try to make some progress 
 this be not a debate on the wide trans issue that will continue outside the bill or the merit of affirm or exploratory healthcare we have the cass review and other evidence will come forward down the line this be a framework bill on conversion practice it be not the same as the scottish proposal or proposal in other country it address the concern raise in the house of lords and i thank baroness burt for introduce a bill to allow those view to be express i have take they on board i beg member to focus on the bill not the adjunct however interesting the wide debate may be this be a debate about how we ensure that people do not have a premeditate purpose to intend to change someone ’ sexual orientation and transgender identity term that exist in british law today 
 i thank the hon gentleman for give way and i want to put on record that he have be absolutely brilliant in engage with a whole range of colleague he be absolutely correct i appreciate that he do not want the debate to become about the transgender issue as he say but the bill state that 
 conversion practice mean a course of conduct or activity the intent of which be to change someone’s to or from be transgender 
 so the idea of be transgender or the definition of transgender be very much at the centre of it whether the bill accurately define what that mean be key to whether it can be effective 
 that be exactly why i have use word that already exist in legislation we can have that debate on the sentencing act and on the equality act i wish you good luck in that but rather than try to debate thing that this house have already settle let we move forward with how we try to stop these practice 
 i join my hon friend   the member for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates   in her remark about the engagement we have have and i be sure that we will have a civil debate today the hon gentleman refer to the definition of transgender identity as already exist in legislation it do in the sentencing act to which he refer but can he give we further information on that definition as i read it it be simply a reference to whether transgender be an aggravating factor in a criminal offence it do not provide the definition we need so his bill will entrench in law that totally undefined concept 
 i will come to the hon gentleman ’s point and will suggest an amendment that might if he be to allow it to proceed in committee make he feel happy and resolve the situation 
 surely the entire point of the bill be what my hon friend be already address which be that the practice be evil it be evil against gay people evil against lesbian people and evil against transgender people if it be abhorrent for everyone it be abhorrent for everyone so it should be tackle 
 i totally agree 
 in the process of write the bill i endeavour to meet everyone who ask i visit people in their community across the country and i invite people to meet in this place i want to thank various group include stonewall the ban conversion therapy campaign group transactual translucent and the medical profession but i also want to thank people who have very different view from mine who i have meet and listen to the christian institute keira bell and her lawyer the lgb alliance and the gay men ’s network to name a few i have engage with all in good faith i have consider and in most case adopt suggestion that each of those group have make to make the bill well 
 i thank the hon gentleman for give way he be make a very powerful point and i commend he for the amount of work he have obviously do to reassure people i think we be all aware that at the moment the debate around transgender issue have become incendiary and difficult and a lot of damage have be do to a lot of people thing i find about his bill be that if i be read it correctly it aim to be reassure there be no attempt to stop people discuss their sexuality there be no attempt to stop they discuss it with people from whom they might want to take advice and there be no attempt whatsoever to stop they try to explore the issue on their own it be simply protect they from unwanted interference and traumatic attempt to change they 
 that be why the predetermine purpose be so important in the bill rather than have argument about which evidence be well i have seek a way to find a framework that address the real or perceive problem of what it be claim be happen in any direction i think we should all agree that it be abuse and the bill will stop it 
 i understand the nervousness of some in the trans community who have be subject to a decade of victimisation but the bill will protect and support they i understand the wariness of many counsellor and psychotherapist who have be attack in direction or another and who be flee the profession because of the lack of guideline in this area the bill will help to re set the debate with a framework that focus on predetermine purposed it mean that if you explore or support people through a process you will always be protect when people insist that you must have a predetermine outcome in mind at the start of a process you will now have the guideline and can push back say that be not within the scope of what i can do in law 
 i congratulate my hon friend on the bill childline have talk about how young people have contact they feel torn and talk about what they be go through they need a safe non judgmental space do he agree that his bill will do just that 
 i hope it do 
 yesterday all the major counselling therapeutic and health organisation provisionally agree an indicative vote to support the bill with no organisation vote against the british medical association and the royal college of nursing support a ban on conversion practice 
 let we come to the evidence i have be ask for the government themselves do a survey in and more recently commission a piece of work in indicate that this be a live issue accord to the research in people have be subject to someone try to change cure or suppress their sexual orientation or transgender identity more than in people from a religious and faith background and in from a non religious background have experience conversion therapy 
 when   the hon member for devizes danny kruger   attend of my drop in briefing on the bill he ask about the number of young people who have be affect by such practice in a weighted yougov survey use its usual weighting metric of people in of those age over say they have undergo or be offer conversion therapy whereas the figure be for to year old and for to year old shockingly high it show that this be a live issue it be the same with the nspcc as we have hear over young people phone its helpline last year say that they be be threaten with or subject to conversion practice 
 i know that some member would prefer to bring in a ban on sexual orientation conversion practice lgb only and not touch on the transgender element there be a couple of reason why i think that would be a foolish approach the government have themselves carry out review and repeatedly say that we need a trans inclusive ban in fact ministers have say that trans conversion be their main concern they can not say it be a huge concern that people might be convert from be transgender and then say we do not need a ban on either way conversion therapy 
 secondly we must recognise that lgb and transgender be separate but they be interlink people explore their sexual orientation will sometimes come to consider their transgender status to not include transgender would allow a loophole whereby people who want to force someone to be gay but not trans could claim that they be offer transgender therapy rather than lgb therapy which would make the bill useless 
 thirdly there be pretty well establish research on the lgb conversion therapy problem but there be significant and grow research from britain and around the world that conversion therapy be a problem for the transgender community as well in fact the minister for women and equalities   the right hon member for saffron walden kemi badenoch say in a letter on   february   that she have significant evidence that child might be subject to conversion practice for be transgender i have not see the evidence i do not   endorse it per se but i have see significant account from many survivor who have be force not to be transgender all side be say this be happen the direction of conversion be irrelevant but it be an indication that we need to take action and my bill do so 
 my hon friend mention the nspcc ’s report on the challenge that young people be face about sexuality and gender identity the finding include that child and young people in the last year want to talk to counsellor about their worry about sexuality or gender identity some of these child describe instance of emotional abuse in the family home include constant shouting hurtful comment and threat of violence some child have be threaten with or have undergo some form of conversion practice intend to cure their sexuality or gender identity do my hon friend agree that in pass this bill we will help prevent more child from be subject to that and send a clear message that we will not allow people to suffer the painful abuse of so call conversion practice 
 i quite agree this bill stop parent send their child to conversion practice it do not promise to solve the world for lgbt people i can not promise that parent will not shout or be abusive or that people will not say nasty thing i be afraid that be the nature of a democratic society sometimes but what we can do be stop premeditate purpose process course of conduct and activity that aim to do something that can not be do that be what every other bill in the world on this topic have do the bill go in both direction whatever the direction of the conversion it be abhorrent and must be stop 
 some have say to i that the exist legislation cover violent and physical act and of course it do violent abusive and bully coercion and harassment can be catch under current crime but the government ’s consultation say that new criminal law be need to fill the gap between physical abuse and a process that cause long term harm the bill therefore make a clear statement that conversion practice should be illegal and that the most egregious case should be prosecute it avoid clash with exist law focus on harm do so would result in survivor be retraumatise through lengthy court battle and instead look at the intent behind the action to get the balance right the bill clarify that certain action will not constitute an offence 
 the hon gentleman be talk about abusive practice and practice that cause harm of course we all condemn anything that be abusive and as he say the vast majority of those act be already cover by law but the bill do not actually mention abuse or indeed harm there be not a threshold of harm beyond which a practice which could be a speech base activity be unlawful for example a detransitioner he mention keira bell try to persuade an individual not to go ahead with surgery or hormone treatment that would have a permanent impact could be catch by the bill yet many of we would not say that be harmful or abusive in fact it be the opposite would that person not be catch by the bill 
 i do not believe that the bill would catch people who express personal reservation about certain process it would catch people who have prepare programme and activity not ad hoc activity i will come on to that safeguard in a moment that be exactly why we need to get the word and safeguard right and why we need to do so in a bill committee we must not reject the bill because the hon lady might find that we go out of the frying pan into the fire 
 the bill allow ministers in northern ireland and scotland to enact it within their jurisdiction but only with the consent of their respective national legislator it create offence in relation to people be send abroad and it use exist language for the law to provide fine to be issue my aim be not to lock people up but to stop this practice 
 the key to the bill be contain in the definition of conversion practice which must be 
 a course of conduct or activity 
 a course of conduct in english law be something that happen more than once and an activity be not ad hoc but a plan intervention that do not include off impromptu action there must be a predetermined purpose that be a high threshold than just immediate intent the predetermined outcome must have be indicate before the course of conduct or activity start not during it that provision protect people have thoughtful conversation who could of course question people via that process 
 the bill say 
 to change someone ’ sexual orientation or to change a person to or from be transgender 
 include 
 to suppress a sexual orientation or transgender identity 
 i know some have be nervous about that wording but i must be clear that suppression must be at the level of negate the identity or orientation that mean that the very being of their orientation must be change in some way many gay people never have sex many transgender people do not wear gendere clothe those action do not constitute suppression they do not negate the orientation or identity in full or in part it can not be claim that this wording be therefore an overreach 
 the bill would use only pre existing term from other law to describe sexual orientation transgender and transgender identity i have receive an interesting representation in the past few day that we should use the term be transgender rather than the interchangeable term transgender and transgender identity with transgender be more clearly define in the law we have at the moment if that be well wording it be the sort of thing i would willingly accept in committee after we have have the discussion that be a real reason for we to get into committee and work out those detail sexual orientation be of course define in the equality act in term of a person have sexual feeling towards 
 a person of the same sex 
 b person of the opposite sex or 
 c person of either sex 
 that definition be use in section of the sentencing act where transgender be define in subsection 6)(e as follow 
 reference to be transgender include reference to be transsexual or undergo propose to undergo or have undergo a process or part of a process of gender reassignment 
 the term transgender be also use in subsection 1(e which state 
 hostility relate to transgender identity 
 member might not like these term and they might not think they should be in law already but they be it therefore seem strange that we then get catch up in a debate on thing that this house have already decide upon 
 the hon gentleman have not yet refer to clause i would be most interested to know whether he be go to explain how this review would operate it apply in different place with different term and it propose amendment at the moment it look completely unworkable and will put people in a position where they could be criminalise guilty of an offence but at the end of the day the amendment could be then make what on earth do the court make of all that 
 i will come on to every clause as we go through this so the hon gentleman do not have to worry about that 
 this be a contentious area and we have hear in the debate in the other place about how people be genuinely and understandably worried so i have seek clarification on several area i believe that the balance be correct but i of course acknowledge that there be a lot of fear in this area and that sometimes no matter what reassurance can give in law people remain fearful until they realise that the practice actually protect i hope that member will look at the wording and application of these clarification carefully as they cover all the example that i have be send i still have not find that be not clear in this bill 
 on the expression of religious belief i might not like the fact that a priest or another religious figure can stand up on their religious day and say there should not be lgbt people or that they should convert in my view that be not a pleasant thing to say but it be also not conversion practice we have ensure that as long as it be not target to a specific individual and as a course of conduct a repeat activity towards an individual it will never be an offence as lord herbert say in the other place 
 we should never legislate lightly in the religious sphere but parliament have do so before to prevent harm ”—[official report house of lords   february vol c. 
 we should do so again this clause allow full compliance with human right law and do not restrict the general expression of religious belief 
 on freedom of expression we have a similar clause the expression of acceptance or disapproval may be distasteful to an individual but it be not conversion practice even repeat expression to an individual unless they form part of a predetermine purpose that be plan as a course of conduct be not capture in this bill 
 we have hear from practitioner who worry that they be currently work in the wild west particularly in respect of counselling and therapy there be few guideline about how they can conduct their practice in this area and people on all side shout at they say that thing or another be conversion therapy this bill will for the time give health practitioner the   protection they need health practitioner be regulate or oversee by the professional standards authority which be follow their professional judgment the psa be establish by parliament and regulate the statutory regulator and the non statutory register there be non statutory accredited register for counsellor or psychotherapist in the psa with the large be those of the uk council for psychotherapy and the british association for counselling and psychotherapy but the list include small specialist organisation such as the association of christians in counselling and link professions or the uk association for humanistic psychology practitioners health practitioner be free to choose the relevant body to join each accredited register be entitle to develop its own approach to sexual orientation and transgender identity there be already a diversity of view within those body but none have object to the bill go to committee 
 the hon member be certainly try very hard to provide a carve out an exception to allow health practitioner to explore professionally with their client their sexual and transgender identity however the carve out mean that the health practitioner must comply with regulatory and professional standard be he aware that most of the body he list and that be list in the bill include the nhs have sign up to a memorandum of understanding that basically insist that therapist pursue a gender affirmatory approach a therapist that do not pursue a gender affirmatory approach and deliberately set out to help somebody not as he term it become transgender would be in contravention of clause 1(2)(c and therefore catch under the bill 
 the hon member say exactly the right word most but not all therapist who take a different approach will join a different organisation and get the same protection because they will be follow that organisation ’s regulatory approach in fact the uk council for psychotherapy recently release a statement say that exploratory therapy be an acceptable form of practice within the requirement of not have a predetermine purpose the bill do not support or prevent different form of care such as gender affirming or exploratory care that be for the regulatory body to determine what the bill do be stop a predetermine purpose of offer change 
 some people have ask i to remove the pre determined requirement for the health sector they claim that it be circular and already the basis of the bill and that we do not need it but without it the chilling effect that many health practitioner feel in this area hence they be leave it would continue the bill will allow practitioner to explore all form of care while have a framework to respond to someone who say you must say that i be this at the end of my therapy practitioner can now say i can not do that under law i have to explore i have to work with you and support you that be what therapist should do that be what they want to do but at the moment that be what they be struggle to do 
 this be a develop field and we need a framework that allow new evidence to be hear some have claim that we should wait for the cass report or that we should rule out some sort of care that would be dangerous the cass report will not be the end of the   discussion of child and transgender sort of care might be useful for group of people but not for another it be up to the regulated body to produce guideline such evidence should be treat by they not deliberate here in the house 
 the hon member be give a powerful speech on the cass review do he want to highlight the fact that dr hilary cass have say that absolutely nothing in her work should stop a conversion practice bill go through this place 
 exactly i very much welcome that statement in fact the bill produce a framework that dr cass ’s review can inform as thing change and move forward 
 people who be not health practitioner but assist a person undergo a regulated course of treatment such as a receptionist or driver be protect under the bill if someone be question explore or develop cop skill a role often take by teacher or youth worker which be my previous profession they will receive clarity on the range of support they can offer 
 of the most controversial area in the government ’s bill be how it deal with parent it be my view that parent have a darn hard life already raise their child and we should not create new burden for they the bill say that if someone be exercise parental responsibility and consider the welfare of their child as paramount nothing they do will be an offence under the bill we refer to the children act and use the language in well establish body of law we should not be mess with how child be treat in this way 
 i appreciate how much the hon gentleman be give way it allow we to have a proper debate i recognise how he be try to protect parent the definition he just read out state that as long as the parent be act in the good interest of the child they be not guilty of conversion practice nevertheless can he not see that if the police or a prosecutor be to determine that the conversation that the parent be have in essence amount to conversion practice in the form of try to change their child ’s gender identity or sexuality it would be very possible to suggest that they be not act in the good interest of the child and therefore to accuse they of conversion practice i recognise that the hon gentleman be try to do the right thing here and that he have no intention of intervene in family life nevertheless the law that he be propose would very easily lead to exactly the prosecution that he be try to avoid 
 the hon gentleman be right that the wording do not give parent a blank cheque for abuse because the law already do not allow that the law already set the bar for court determination on the welfare of a child the court already have a system to determine if there be a dispute between parent the court or local authority already have a requirement to intervene where there be serious risk to a child that be why i have use that body of law again i do not think that it be our place to meddle with that body of well establish practice law if he feel that there be word   that would make that clear that be a case for send the bill to committee and table amendment and i will genuinely ensure that they get a hearing 
 the bill reflect the limit in exist statute about where parent behaviour can go from support their child through challenging conversation to abuse i be slightly concerned that there be a risk that some who oppose the bill be suggest that if a parent ’s challenging of their child ’s lgbt inherent nature who they be become abuse that be somehow acceptable that be lgbt be a perversion and therefore that someone can be abusive to their child if they be lgbt something they have not choose but be inherent to who they be do the hon gentleman agree 
 i quite agree i have speak to lot of people who have undergo conversion practice often push by their parent almost none of they have say to i that they want their parent prosecute almost all have say that they want the practice to stop that be the difference that be what the bill will do 
 i acknowledge that there be many area in which we may need clarity when the bill be in operation the bill would require the secretary of state to produce full guidance and it would require devolved body to do so if the bill be apply in their area while there be no ability to change the core offence in the bill clarificatory amendment be allow under the affirmative procedure which require a vote in both houses it can never look back but it can change thing go forward when it need to the bill would create an offence of send someone abroad use the same framework as that for female genital mutilation an establish piece of law that be already on the statute book 
 other bills have try to lock people up for these practice to i that seem totally foolish broadly i do not believe in send people to prison if we can find other way to stop the practice therefore i propose a fine not exceed level for conviction of an either way offence in the magistrate court or the crown court depend on the defendant or the prosecutor some ask why not a civil fine rather than a criminal fine it be quite simple the balance of probability be the test in civil law and beyond reasonable doubt the test in criminal law do people want a low threshold or a high threshold i have choose the high threshold to ensure that we get only the egregious case 
 we have see the scandal of the post office and many people have express a fear of activist group on either side use money from america or big donor bring private prosecution and create a chilling effect at the suggestion of the gay men ’s network but support by all the people i have speak to i have prevent that from happen by allow prosecution only with the approval of the director of public prosecutions in england wales and northern ireland if the bill be enact by the scottish government those protection already exist in scotland 
 finally on penalty we have seek to ensure that those with responsibility as charity trustee who be convict under the bill will be debar from hold office be a trustee be a position of trust and these practice often happen in those setting the charity commission could on application remove that debarring if it wish to do so 
 on the review clause which   the hon member for stone sir william cash   mention almost everyone i speak to be clear that the bill be a start but that they want to go far some in direction by give the bill great scope and other in the direction of great clarification i have deliberately write the bill to be narrow in scope it will not have the ability to overreach many people feel that it will not capture all practice but i understand that we must start somewhere and then move forward that be why i include in the bill use wording from the fix term parliaments act a process that we have already use a year review clause require the secretary of state to set up a committee that have a majority of member of this house but also other expert to recommend amendment to the bill of course that committee would not be bind on this house we would still have a vote 
 have meet with numerous people i believe i have create a balanced and fair bill be it perfect no be it a good start to the process yes should we take it to committee and continue our work yes for too long this place have find reason to take no action we have allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good the bill should go to committee and i promise to appoint a diverse range of voice to that committee we should continue the dialogue and find practical solution via amendment and tweak but not the grandstanding that we have have up to this point of which i be as guilty as anyone we should go to committee and suggest amendment and great clarification 
 to frustrate this bill today when we have pledge for so many year to pass this legislation would be an indictment of this place to frustrate this bill today would be to break the pledge of the last prime ministers and the promise make at the last election and before that most importantly to frustrate this bill today would be to let down the survivor and future victim and it be to they that i give the very last word in the last year not in the last decade but in the last month childline have have over testimony from young people i will read from a girl age 
 when i be young i tell my parent i think i be bi and they send i to a counsellor who try to convince i i be straight and that my desire to be different be purely for attention even though that be year ago the effect of the counselling be still ongoing it ’ leave i with a lot of guilt and confusion around who i be and how i ’m suppose to act around other people 
 this bill would stop that it be for those people that we must act today this be our chance to do so let we not let they down 
 i be often ask why i fight for a ban on conversion therapy people say surely there must be some personal connection surely you must have some personal history but i do not in fact there be no in my family who be lgbt we may be the only family in the uk without someone who be lgbt the reason i do it be because fundamentally as a conservative i have a duty to defend individual freedom i believe that the state should stay out of people ’s life but it should protect the most vulnerable defend those who other seek to harm and recognise that the and foremost duty of any government be to protect their people 
 this be not some woke frontier for politician to weaponise for clickbait and i be sham by the debate that be increasingly take place on conversion therapy i remember the debate i secure in this place on conversion therapy it be moderate we sit and debate the intricacy of legislation that be not yet there unfortunately that have change 
 people in position of trust be abuse those who they tell they be sinful broken and need correcting which cause lifelong hate there be survivor in this place in parliament the reason i fight so hard be that so many lgbt colleague do not feel that they can come here and be label as fight for themselves they should be free to do that but sometimes they can not and do you know what?—allyship matter we have a duty in this place to not impose our own personal view on thing but recognise that our right potentially to religious freedom can be protect while we also protect those who live a life different from our 
 the hon lady have make a really important point about lgb people come to this place and feel safe to argue their position on this important matter i have experience the most horrendous bullying in this place because i take a contrary view or a more guarded view than some in the lgb community in fact people in the lgb community be often refer to as bigot transphobe and other slur just because we have concern about legislation such as this and want to make sure that young lgb people be protect and tran people do the hon lady agree that that rule must apply to all side of any debate not just to the side that she favour 
 the hon gentleman be entirely right but there be letter miss in his lgb the letter t. we do not divide the lgbt community in this place member can say that they have concern about what we be do but by remove the t the hon gentleman be suggest that transgender people do not exist he be suggest that they be less than other lgb people and i will not stand for that because it be trans people who stand with gay people at stonewall it be trans people who fight alongside they for lgb right i will happily discuss the intricacy of legislation with the hon gentleman but when he choose to eradicate that be wrong 
 will my hon friend give way 
 no i will not give way on this point because i will not hear more erasure of a transgender community we can discuss the intricacy but that i will not stand for 
 i be not go to go into the argument about the bill because   the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle   do an exceptional job he go out and meet every single person organisation and lobby group and listen to all their view even if he disagree with they and that include the lgb alliance who have also remove the t and i have support he he have do a phenomenal job 
 the hon gentleman have set out what the bill do it protect religious leader who can still guide their flock health practitioner can still support and challenge people and parent be protect that be why all major   faith group back the bill why the royal college back it and why exploratory therapy be protect this be a compromise bill and i say to member who wish to oppose it search within yourself because you have a duty to protect child and a duty to allow professional to do their job and you need to recognise that some people ’s objection be not to the nuance in the bill the only people who fear a ban on conversion therapy be quack and charlatan who profit from bigotry and misery conversion therapy cause lifelong harm this be a moderate bill and a compromise bill and it do not go as far as the government ’s proposal interruption the hon member may chunter and laugh but i be appalled—[interruption i will happily give way to he if he ask rather than chuntere 
 i apologise for chuntering i be simply amuse by the suggestion that this be a moderate bill this be not a moderate speech that the hon lady be make   the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle   make a very good speech recognise that there be legitimate view on the other side of the debate the hon lady talk about erasure but she dismiss the comment of   the hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath neale hanvey suggest that his view be completely invalid i respect her argument and her wish to pursue this bill or this kind of legislation but can we please have a debate with more civility 
 i would suggest that the ultimate failure of civility be to erase a member of the lgbt community to erase an entire group i be happy to discuss the nuanced point but i will not do so if member want to suggest that transgender people do not exist or that we do not really have a definition in law of what transgender people be they exist in law and they exist in this place and they exist in the hon member ’s constituency as well 
 the government should back this compromise bill because love be not a pathology and transgend people be not a pathology they do not need treatment i say very simply to those people you be see in this place and you be hear in this place and very many of we back you and will protect you 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle   for the way in which he introduce the bill he be not know on the opposition benches as the most moderate of character but what he set out today be a moderate bill a bill that seek to find a consensus and a compromise between those campaign for full fat equality and those with gender critical view he have do so with a focus on not take side of the debate or the other but put the victim of this abhorrent and cruel practice that be what each of we on all side should be think about when consider the bill what happen to those people out of sight and often out of mind who be prey on by other who seek to attack they for who they love and who they be 
 conversion therapy be not always in the spotlight it be not someone be beat up in the street it be not someone have paint fling at they it be not someone   be kick out of their family home for who they be it be a practice that be establish and accept in frequently professional forum and in place we go to where we open ourselves up and where we seek the support of institution and professional that be why the bill matter it seek to expose those place where this abhorrent cruel century torture be perpetrate on lgbt people 
 i be proud to be plymouth ’s out mp which i think give i a special responsibility to be vocal about the effect of legislation and of the lack of legislation on community and people like i if we in this house do not have an eye on that effect we turn a blind eye and legitimise the torture and abuse that happen to people we must not do that 
 i be pleased when the government say in their last manifesto that they will ban conversion therapy and i be pleased that my party and every main party do so because it seek to create a consensus that hate and torture be not welcome in the uk regardless of our politic i be proud to be a labour mp and i be proud to be part of a campaigning party and a party of equality but i want every party in this house to be a party of equality when it come to root out abuse which be what this bill offer 
 we have just hear   the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns   make a proud conservative case for stamp out something and i be proud to make a labour case for stamp out hate and inequality i be proud to say that our duty to society mean that we must consider the most vulnerable because that do not attack all of we but lift people to a level where everyone be protect that matter and if a conservative case can sit happily alongside a labour case we should pass a consensus bill 
 the lgbt community have be wait too long for this legislation which have be promise too many time but let we be clear about what would happen if the bill be not pass today we be possibly only week away from a general election in which we know there could be more division than we have see in a long time it worry i deeply that we have allow attack on tran people to be a legitimate part of how we win vote it be never acceptable to attack a minority and it be never acceptable to seek to win vote on the back of the most vulnerable persecute and attack minority 
 with this bill both side of the house have an opportunity to turn our back on that and to say that equality matter from any political perspective because people matter my word people come in all different shape and size which be a good thing it be in celebrate our diversity that we gain strength not by pretend that everyone be the same that would be a dull horrible future it would be a version of britain that erase people that erase the bit that make this country great that we can all be different that we can all be proud and importantly that we should all be protect under law 
 it be important that the bill be draw as broadly as possible cover all aspect of the lgbt+ community i speak in a previous westminster hall debate on this subject as do a number of members present and i describe how remove the t so that the bill protect only lgb people be a trap door as the hon member for rutland and melton say if we allow that trap door people who enjoy protection from torture because they   be lesbian gay or bisexual will simply be tell that they be trans and that loophole will be use to attack people whether or not they have a transgend identity it be a trap door which be why the bill must be as broad as possible 
 i have speak to equality activist and member of the lgbt community in plymouth about the bill and they have ask i to pose question to my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown do the bill include asexual people and secondly do it include non binary people these be fair question and they be important because if we be consider the full extent of the lgbt+ community we must consider those people who might not necessarily describe themselves as transgender and might not especially describe themselves as lgb in some way some clarity in the explanatory note or on the face of the bill would be useful to affirm to those community that they be capture by the measure i understand from what my hon friend have say that they will be but i would be grateful if he mention that when he wind up 
 this house need to consider how we come together rather than how we divide i support my hon friend ’s plea for the bill to go to committee where those who have a legitimate challenge from their point of view can table amendment what i would like to hear in the debate be this in which clause be there a problem in which clause might alternative wording address that problem 
 over the past few month i have see my crazy ridiculous hon friend who normally run headlong into wall to knock they down take his time to be balance calm and considerate i do not know whether it be a temporary affliction or part of a new chapter in his behaviour but i have see he make every effort to speak to people he agree with and disagree with to take on board their view not only be that something that we should for all our sake encourage in his behaviour but it make the bill well because it make it supportive 
 the gravity of this issue can not be overstate recent polling by lgbt anti abuse charity galop find that in lgbt people and more than a of tran people in the uk have be subject to attempt conversion another charity mind which focus on mental health issue find that those who have undergo such practice be twice as likely to have suicidal thought and time more likely to plan to attempt suicide there be real world consequence that have lead mind and other mental health charity nhs body and professional counselling and psychotherapy organisation to define conversion practice as unethical and harmful and to call for they to be ban i agree with they and with the bill 
 however there will be people watch the debate who have perhaps not search out the text of the bill they will be look at the tone of the debate to see whether this house reflect their view and for the lgbt+ community whether it reflect their right to exist that matter the word we choose matter to those lgbt people who be watch this i echo the word of the hon member for rutland and melton they be see they be welcome and they be love i want everyone to be authentically true to who they be there should be no impediment in law no loophole or trapdoor that allow someone who be true to who they be authentically themselves to be subject to abuse   or torture in the way that as we have establish on a cross party basis happen in relation to conversion therapy 
 i completely agree with the hon member about the tone of this important debate but as i be sure he be aware abuse and torture be absolutely illegal in this country and we all support that there be multiple piece of legislation that deal with abuse torture and harmful practice and nobody in this place would reject that the problem for those of we who question the bill be that it contain no threshold for torture abuse or even harm so it will capture practice that be not harmful and for which we should not be legislate 
 i thank the hon lady for her intervention give the risk of run into the same wall that my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown run into i will portray moderation on my side i think that that be precisely why she should give the bill a reading and table any amendment as she see fit to define the matter of concern and make her case in committee i believe that there be currently loophole in the law that allow that abhorrent abuse to go on 
 a number of practice be illegal in this country such as force marriage which be something that the lgbtq community experience include those who may also go through conversion therapy that be wrong do my hon friend agree that the time to tackle that be now the lgbtq community have be wait at least year since the government promise to ban that awful practice 
 i agree with my hon friend people have be wait too long let we ensure they do not wait any long let we also send a message to member of all party until the general election conclude that attack trans people and lgbt people because of who they be be unacceptable that should be call out on a cross party basis it have no part in our politic 
 legitimate debate about improve this bill should define we at our very good the debate so far have be a good because it have allow people to voice their different view and we should continue that in committee allow people to table amendment where require to improve the bill and ensure it do exactly what it say on the tin and stop these abhorrent cruel practice from ever happen again 
 the obligation in this debate be to set out the current threat that be not already cover by exist legislation or that we would want to legislate against the bill also need to do so in a clear precise way that be straightforward to interpret and enforce without cause great uncertainty and trigger a chilling effect on free speech and healthy family life 
 over many year the issue of sex and identity have develop and evolve substantially when i be young i never see these topic on the news it be rare and unusual for they ever to appear in term of be aware of lesbian and gay and the challenge they face in life for any member of parliament for any decent person there be huge concern and sympathy for those   people there be a debate among that community about bisexual join it that be not a straightforward process there be a debate and a dispute over that 
 thing that my hon friend   the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns   touch upon be acceptance of other people and inclusiveness and not impose upon people that be key feature i think in the debate about conversion practice many people for example represent by the lgb alliance be concerned that they feel impose upon society be adapt and learn to understand and appreciate the challenge that change in society bring 
 my hon friend and   the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard   highlight a point about lgb and lgbt identity the hon gentleman then add the plus symbol the a and the i. that highlight the complexity of the issue and the clarity need when some group be be include and other exclude the language be diverse depend on who we be speak to and when we be speak a few year ago this conversation would have be different from how it be now 
 we have to reflect on the number of gender that be commonly use or reasonably frequently use and this be by no mean an exhaustive list bi gendere cross dresser drag king drag queen femme queen female to male or ftm gender bender genderqueer male to female or mtf non op hijra pangender transsexual trans person woman man butch spirit trans agender sex gender fluid non binary transgender androgyne gender gift gender blender femme person of transgender experience and androgynous if people go on wikipedia there will see far far more i have miss out huge number but it serve the purpose of highlight the complexity and involvement of the issue when we be discuss this topic it should be respectful but also we should try to keep society with we 
 the hon gentleman talk about be respectful do he not believe that people should be able to identify in whatever way they choose 
 i do agree with people identify in any way they choose but society be still get to grip with this issue concern be not just individual be able to make choice about their identity for themselves but how other people relate to they that be a huge concern in relation to change the law and impose upon society a set of view when those view and value be evolve over time 
 i will highlight aspect as thing change that be reflect in society for example in architecture parent come to my surgery to raise concern about mix sex facility at a local swimming pool they raise those concern because they be interested in protect their daughter regardless of whether   the hon member for jarrow kate osborne   and other colleague agree or disagree about the issue it be a fact that parent be come to i to say that they be concerned about the architecture of the new health centre in horwich that architecture cement in place a particular form of behaviour everyone together rather than male and female change room and that lend itself to a lot of misunderstanding concern and fear in society that   be express to i by mother of daughter and i as a member of parliament ought to be respectful and concerned about what my constituent be raise with i 
 on transition as i point out before societal understanding have be gradual such topic be very rarely in the news and now they frequently be most day on the today programme we hear about sex and identity as it be on our medium so much we have to reflect on legislation and application but it be only relatively recently in that the transgender or transsexual side of the issue come into the mainstream and the forefront of people ’s understanding i buy at the time the album i be a bird now by antony and the johnsons and it be an interesting listen it be good music with interesting and challenging lyric it highlight some of the challenge that people go through and which many people in society would not know about many people would not know about the transition process and how challenging it be before the debate develop in the way it have most people when hear about trans people would try to be understand supportive and sympathetic and would want to encourage those people on the path they have choose to go down but that be not universal many people be hostile and toxic about that but be at least for i the transition point when trans identity become far more public an issue 
 we have to understand how difficult it be for society to adjust especially give certain aspect of trans for example significant surgery be do to people as part of that process and quite significant pharmaceutical be use in the process these be not easy thing to adjust to for mum dad son daughter brother sister the wide family and the wide community such as perhaps church mosque or other organisation when see and hear that someone be concerned and think about transition how protect be those people from the threat of conversion practice or illegalisation of what they would consider a normal if challenge conversation if someone want to go down a route involve significant surgery and life change drug that might be irreversible especially for a child reach puberty drug that stop the process of puberty can have substantial impact and there should be some understanding of the lifelong impact of take those drug especially if someone want to detransition it be very challenging for those people to make that decision in the place it be challenge for their family watch they try to understand the issue which be far well understand these day than they be previously to say be that the right choice be that the route you want to go down we have to be certain that normal family conversation will not be take through the court 
 my hon friend be make an excellent speech that make clear how nuanced the debate be and how complicated an area it be in which to legislate do he share my concern that the bill could criminalise somebody who perhaps be not a parent but maybe an old friend and mentor to a young person who deliberately set out to try to dissuade they over a period of time from go down a transition route take cross sex hormone and pursue surgery do he share my concern that that person could be catch under the bill in a practice that perhaps he and i would think be not abusive at all but seek to rescue that child from permanent harm 
 i agree the jeopardy for that individual be substantial that issue have not be cover and they be not protect under the legislation as it stand there be a significant aspect to this matter about free will and decision making if a young person be look to go down a certain route again the transformation to someone ’s life if they transition be profound and in many way irreversible perhaps the individual want to be certain that the young person be make the right decision how can someone be certain they be make the right decision way be by ask the young person challenge question such as be you do the right thing for the right reason can you live with the consequence of it have you really though it through i think this chamber represent that idea of debate and challenge and of question be you really intent on do this do you really want to go down this track before you take any drug go to a clinic to get that support or have any surgery have you actively consider all the issue and implication of what you be do 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we have to give space for that free discussion current nhs datum suggest that people refer to gender identity clinic will take about year to be see be year enough time for someone to be sure they have make the right decision 
 concern be the requirement almost for affirmation in the context of the structure in society and the expectation on people if the legislation pass and the framing in which parent family and other be allow to discuss the matter with their own child the route that people go down start a long time before they get to the stage that my hon friend mention we need to understand this and have an open discussion right at the beginning rather than year down the line 
 my hon friend raise the good point about the explosion in demand for support in this area over recent year which be overwhelm the service available through the nhs that itself should cause we great concern about what be go on in our society there be a long waiting list for publicly available help but not for private support so be i not right that somebody could seek private therapy quickly 
 my hon friend be entirely right just because the state service be often slow than private service we should not be satisfied that the year delay be sufficient time for people to reconsider 
 there be a question of equality on this matter and again we have to understand society as it have change a key thing in society which be certainly not a concern when i be grow up be the internet email and social medium social media be powerful and child and young people spend a great deal of time on social medium in other debate in this chamber people would be raise concern about bulimia suicide and other thing that child be influence by on social medium those be the challenging issue raise on social medium parent have to understand that the influence on their child can often be supportive and encouraging but not all the influence on social medium be the bill almost introduce an inequality certain people can encourage and support child young adult and other   to go down a certain track whether they meet in person or online but the people with whom they have personal contact and will spend the rest of their life the family unit their friend and the wide community almost have their ability to communicate with their love curtail 
 do my hon friend also accept that it would be impossible for a criminal trial determine whether an offence have be commit to go through all these variation to work out the nature of the evidence that should be receive it be incredibly invasive it be base on privacy and people be able to talk to other in a mentor context or a manner that would enable the person to understand well what be go on for a trial to determine whether an offence have be commit would be mind bogglingly difficult and very invasive in practice it would be impossible 
 i agree if the court prosecutor and other can go into the family home to find evidence for a successful prosecution that would cause substantial disruption to family life remember that this have to be a successful prosecution for something that be not cover by exist legislation there be already a huge number of protection in law for people right across society as i say this bill ought to be able to point out compellingly and clearly area of life that we want to be protect but be not already cover by exist legislation 
 the punishment allow under the bill be a level fine i be not terribly familiar with the fine category but the house of commons library have provide a bit of information it be an unlimited fine which would be a huge cost to anyone suffer it it be important that family be aware of the category they have be put into level crime include harassment stalking imprisonment control or coercive behaviour and exposure commonly know as flash this bill seek to put family who believe they be have a normal conversation about their child grow up and explore idea about themselves and their identity if they be not clear about what their identity be into that category family have what they consider to be a normal reasonable and balanced conversation with their child be be put in the same category as flasher that be what the level fine doe and that place a serious burden on family 
 i want to reflect on the fact that justin webb fall foul of current legislation for remark that come out early today or perhaps yesterday so it would be challenge for a family member a friend a religious leader or anyone else in wide society if someone who deal with these issue day in day out as a presenter on of the most prestigious news programme bbc radio ’s today programme can fall foul of current legislation we should think about what we be do when we seek to tighten up legislation i appreciate the argument that the hon member for brighton kemptown make he give a powerful dignified speech but if justin webb can fall foul of the current legislation how vulnerable will parent and other be who do not follow the nuance and detail of these issue day in day out there will be a lot of concern it will be damaging in many way for family to feel that they will be scrutinise under the microscope and vulnerable when do what they can to care for their child on that note i oppose the bill but i look forward to the rest of this positive debate 
 undoubtedly this bill be be present with many good intention by a member who feel passionately about the right of lgbt people and all people to live as they choose in peace and without fear or prejudice the vast majority of member of this house and the other place share those aim and intention most will have attend pride and take part in lgbt history month event and debate most see the equality legislation pass here such as the marriage same sex couples act as a positive step towards a more equal and inclusive society 
 the idea of anyone who be gay or bisexual of any age and who be grow into who they be and question their sexuality be coerce into think that they need to change be deeply disturbing and sinister but that be already against the law it be also thankfully incredibly rare to the point of be all but wipe out it be certainly completely socially unacceptable i believe that this propose legislation be not necessary to fix a problem rather it create several serious new one anyone who follow the recent debate in the other place will have hear strong evidence from peer across the benches that the bill be a solution in search of a problem 
 in order to legislate we would need clear legal definition of term that be contentious and vague for example how do define the concept of convert someone to change their true identity a qualified therapist explore a client ’s feeling of gender dysphoria will cause they to question those feeling in order to understand they that be therapy in everyday conversation among friend or family who step in and at what point to decide that those conversation amount to attempt conversion 
 feminist group labour women ’s declaration the gay men ’s network and the lgb alliance be fearful that legislation like this be dangerous and it send the message to those who need to confide in professional or even those close to they that it be not safe to do so and that they will be force to be gay when they might want just to be gender questioning or vice versa the message be that the situation be so bad that we need a new criminal law to deal with it serious legislator should never create flawed and unnecessary legislation merely to send a message that be law create by social medium rather than law that we expect of a government or a government in wait to be uphold by our court this bill be unprosecutable and without evidence of need it bring criminal law into an area that simply need to be regulate by policy and guidance 
 the other aspect as i mention early be the problem that currently nothing can be properly describe give broadcaster be label brutal man who murder as woman and be reprimand if they correctly name a person by their biological sex who be appoint the arbiter of what constitute conversion feminist believe that lesbian should be free to date only woman as they choose however in today ’s toxic climate they be pressurise into date so call lesbian with a penis in other word man in his opening speech   the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle   describe his bill as stop people from be at risk of lose their identity however well intentione and   worthy that goal might be how be that to be define and by who law that can not provide clear definition be just useless piece of paper 
 attempt to convert or coerce anyone away from be who they choose to be or to make they straight if they be gay be cruel and thankfully against the law this bill do nothing to change that it merely suggest that anyone try to stop their daughter cut off her healthy breast as a teenager before long term serious thought and a careful pause be break the law the bill prevent a parent from suggest that their year old son should start on a course of puberty blocker which will render he infertile as an adult instead when he will be entirely without doubt and less confused 
 what understanding be there at the moment about the reversibility of the drug that be sometimes give to child which could be life change 
 as i understand it not be a medical expert we do not know yet because those drug have not be in full use for long 
 be all the members support this bill really willing to decide what constitute conversion therapy and what they deem to be acceptable talking support be they do so because they believe this be serious legislation or be this politic for social medium like in say that i know well what await i on social medium 
 we have a clear divide in the chamber today between the beneficiary of stonewall badge and donation and the group of so call gender critical feminist that i represent but tribe on social medium be not legislator we be write law here and get it right be essential and serious the dumbe down of such important debate for like be not only vacuous but set a dangerous precedent and we need to be well than this when make the law of this country 
 i gently suggest to   the hon member for canterbury rosie duffield   that if she genuinely think that those on her side of the debate be the only one who get abuse on social medium she should look at the treatment of lgbt+ politician in this country when we dare to speak out about these issue she be certainly not alone i do not agree for minute that the abuse that she or anyone who hold her view get be acceptable i have often speak in this place about the toxicity surround these discussion and debate which i believe have only grow with the rise of social medium i absolutely agree with she on that point but we have a duty not to feed into the toxicity we be not support the bill because we think that this be a social medium contest we know full well that we would not win but the evidence be clear 
 i want to pick up on the point make in the previous speech that there be no evidence that conversion therapy be happen because we have ample evidence from the government commission datum that it be happen in people respond to a survey and of they have undergo or be offer conversion therapy some of trans respondent have undergo or be offer conversion therapy per cent say that it be conduct by faith group and say that it be carry out by healthcare or medical professional 
 in the survey to which my hon friend refer what definition of conversion therapy be put to respondent 
 as my hon friend well know there be no definition offer at the time but that be exactly what this bill attempt to do to bring forward a definition 
 i want to pick up on a point that have be make a number of time a number of colleague have suggest that there be an epidemic of people be force to be gay or be force to be tran this be a way bill it do it in both direction 
 do the datum that the hon gentleman refer to come from the self referral survey administer at pride march that be not really research but a survey do he think that a survey conduct in that way be sufficient to inform legislation 
 the survey be only the start it have be back up by research commission by the government year ago it have also be back up by a number of independent organisation include the nspcc mind and galop which have have call about it we have the datum to show it be happen the idea that people would phone a support service such as the nspcc and pretend that they be be offer conversion therapy be i be afraid for the bird 
 i agree with   the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard   about how we be perceive in this place i think back to when this house debate same sex marriage in i listen to the debate obviously not as a member of parliament and i remember how powerless i feel then as a young gay man have my future and my right discuss by a group of people i have nothing to do but sit and watch and listen to some awful thing as   the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle   say that be necessary in a free and democratic society the bill do not seek to curtail free expression via legitimate conversation but we have evidence that harm be be do to people and we do not have the law in place to prevent it 
 i thank my hon friend for be so generous in take another intervention he talk about evidence and refer to the survey which he admit contain no definition of conversion therapy we have hear how many different definition of conversion therapy there could be and how many different definition we all hold from the most extreme awful abuse which be already illegal to talk therapy and persuasion do the definition of conversion therapy not matter intensely to that survey how can it be evidence if there be no definition 
 we have to get the bill to committee so that we can thrash that out my hon friend be absolutely right but that be the point of pass legislation we make definition and we make law the whole point of give the bill its reading today be to create a definition and pass it into law 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for give way i hope he agree that this be a very helpful conversation we have be debate this issue for year as everybody keep say the reason there be no definition be because it be impossible to arrive at the scottish   parliament can not arrive at and we have fail to do so it be not possible to find a definition that be between what be illegal already and what we all think should not be illegal it do not exist the idea that the bill should go to committee for we to continue this conversation be absurd it can not be do 
 i be sorry but my hon friend seem to have forget the point this be the time we be debate a bill we have fail because we have take year to arrive at a position where we can actually debate legislation that be the failure we pass brexit fast than we have discuss this 
 i thank the hon gentleman for give way he be be very generous the fundamental problem be that we have not be able to define the problem there be anecdotal datum from a survey that suggest that some people have report that they have be subject to what they define as conversion therapy but we do not know what it be it be not define what exactly be we legislate about 
 i would like to ask the hon gentleman another question i listen very carefully to his view on other people talk about his sexuality do he think it be acceptable for a gay man to be tell across this chamber what he should do how he should define himself and who he should associate himself with do he feel that that be homophobic 
 i do not think anybody should be tell what they should do that be the entire reason i be back the bill i totally accept that there will be people who will never ever believe that lgbt+ identity be real or valid i do not agree with that and i and other people can find that hurtful but that be what we have to accept in a free and democratic society 
 i have be part of these conversation now for many year and i have see the incredible work that have go in to work across the divide to try to bring people together i see myself when i sit on the women and equalities committee and we conduct an inquiry into this issue how much agreement there be between different side about what need to be do especially on improve the provision of healthcare and mental healthcare they might have different idea on outcome for example some people might think we need to improve healthcare for young people so they do not go down a route of be trans while other people might think we need to do that because waiting list be too long and we want to get people on a course of treatment fast 
 both those view be of course absolutely valid as parliamentarian and as individual we have to accept view that we do not agree with i totally accept as i have say that there will be people who never think that my right to exist as a gay man be valid or that trans identity be valid that might be upsetting and difficult for people to accept but that be what happen in a free and democratic society and the bill do not encroach on that 
 i want to come back to the legal test of predetermine outcome as that be where we must focus that legal test provide the safeguard necessary to address both those set of concern so that we can get to a place where if someone embark on a course of action that   have a predetermined outcome to change someone ’s identity we have a legal mechanism to deal with that but we also provide the freedom for people to express view to engage in legitimate conversation and yes to say thing that other people might find distasteful and hurtful we just have to accept that that be the case but this be what good law be all about 
 i hope that colleague allow the bill through to committee there have be many discussion of what constitute conversion therapy and how we define these concept the hon member for brighton kemptown be right to use exist legal concept but we must be allow to get the bill through to committee so that we can have this discussion in great detail because so far all we have hear be anecdote we have have debate but we have never have discussion on an actual legislative proposal that be the opportunity we have today and it would not be right to let the bill fall at this hurdle we need to get it through to committee so that we can thrash this matter out in more detail 
 i would like to take this opportunity to thank my hon friend   the member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle   for the extent of his engagement with those with vary perspective on the bill we have cross sword on occasion but it be important that the conversation and debate in this chamber be lead with the honesty and integrity that it deserve 
 no want to see pressure or coercion use on people whether they be gay lesbian bisexual transgender or heterosexual i know that all member of this house can agree on that work on the law as we do however we also know that good intention alone be not sufficient to avoid unintended consequence which can arise from any piece of legislation we always see that in this place whatever the issue at hand we have a responsibility here as elect member of parliament it be our job it be precisely why we be vote into this place to interrogate proposal scrutinise legislation and ask the difficult question the what if to ensure that any legislation that pass work in practice for the benefit of the people in this country rather than against they 
 before i become an mp i work in education for year as a teacher the majority of my friend be still in teaching and they have many concern they feel at hand the chilling effect on they of the debate we be have in this house as well as of what have happen in scotland and what be happen in wales that be why i feel a great and deep responsibility to stand up here today to have this debate and to raise the issue that i have with the bill as it stand however i thank my hon friend for open the conversation because engaging be the way forward 
 young people and child be at the heart of everything i do and i base my approach to this discussion on wellbee and safeguard the matter of therapy and treatment for child and young people experience gender distress be a highly complex area which be undergo a review in the uk far from refer to sexual preference or a way of life gender reassignment concern serious potentially life alter medical and surgical intervention   that be often irreversible in recent year there have be a concern increase in the number of child particularly girl become convince that they be bear into the wrong body as someone who be a tomboy as a young girl i know that have i have some of these conversation or have these social media influence on i this would be something that i might have wish for 
 dr hilary cass ’s interim report expose the extent of the failing of the gender identity development service at the tavistock clinic criticise the predominantly affirmative non exploratory approach and highlight a disturbing lack of support for young people with gender dysphoria the report and the subsequent decision to close the gids at the tavistock clinic be evidence that treatment should be provide as part of holistic mental health provision accompany by the consequent nhs interim service specification it recommend a watchful waiting approach advise that clinician remain open to question and explore a gender distressed child ’s feeling and the range of available treatment option that may well address a patient ’s need before affirm their self diagnosis that be to ensure that if a young person do pursue medical transition they do so with informed consent and a realistic understanding of likely outcome 
 if it follow the evidence the future direction of treatment for child experience gender dysphoria should be psychotherapeutic and exploratory but i have concern that the bill as draft risk far impact standard of care by threaten medical professional and clinician who use an exploratory approach my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown have make effort to reflect those concern in the bill yet despite the exception in clause 1(2)(c for health practitioner its focus on predetermine purpose and intent still risk criminalise health professional who engage in exploratory conversation with their patient legitimate clinical practice will sometimes have a predetermined outcome where a confident and clear diagnosis be make should a clinician have publish research indicate a preference for psychotherapeutic approach that could alleviate a child ’s distressed alienation from their body so that they come to accept themselves as enough as they be such research could be cite as evidence of predetermine intent of an outcome the clinician would then be at risk of prosecution if he or she do anything other than affirm a child ’s diagnosis 
 what be more the bill do not require proof that any harm be intend or cause by the clinician ’s conduct it be highly irregular to criminalise motivation alone in the absence of demonstrably harmful behaviour professional must be able to question and explore a gender distressed child ’s self diagnosis without fear of prosecution or even accusation of such behaviour in recent year countless clinician have speak of the flight of professional work with young people experience gender incongruence the interim cass report highlight that professional already feel under pressure to take an unquestione affirmative approach that be diametrically oppose to standard practice in all other clinical encounter fear of prosecution would exert further pressure on professional work in an already sensitive and culturally fraught area and would risk accelerate their departure from the field my concern be that the bill could leave unquestione affirmative treatment as the only option 
 the hon lady be give a superb speech i completely agree that clinician be already under pressure to use an affirmative approach be of the problem not that many of the professional body include the nhs have sign up to that approach and therefore even with the safeguard provide in the bill those therapist would be commit an offence if they take a predetermined course let we say to prevent a patient from go down a transgender route 
 i thank the hon member for her question that be what we need to be able to discuss and look at in further detail and to thrash out in committee we need to ensure that clinician particularly those in the nhs we need they to stay in their field do not face a chilling effect the risk of that chilling effect should not be understate it could make the holistic therapy that be recognise as critical by the cass review hard to access our priority absolutely have to be the legitimate and workable protection of the provision of good evidence care for child and young people 
 i believe that the bill should go to committee we need sunlight on it to make sure that if it pass it have be subject to detailed consideration of its wording and an understanding of what those word mean for people on the ground work in our nhs teach the child in our school and work in safeguarding and for parent who be a priority 
 it be a pleasure to follow   the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi reflect on her word and in particular how she sum up her point our parliament our democracy our way of make law work well when friend disagree well move the bill into committee be absolutely the right thing to do it be a step in the right direction in what be acknowledge right across the house as a complicated issue i believe that we be do it some justice today 
 i congratulate   the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle   on promote this much need bill member throughout the house appreciate all the work that he have put in this issue be very complicated he have go to great length to build as many bridge as possible and to get the ball roll on this serious matter 
 the bill set out a clear objective to tackle and prohibit practice that seek to change someone ’ sexual orientation or their gender identity take this step will go a long way towards protect tran people and indeed lgbt people from correspondence i have receive and through the surgery i have have with member of the trans and lgbt community i know just how important and impactful the issue be for my constituent throughout my time as an mp i have be consistent in my opposition towards all form of conversion practice and in my support for a trans inclusive ban on conversion therapy so i be pleased to speak in support of the bill 
 to be clear i welcome the work and the progress that this conservative government have make in advance the right of the lgbt community my hon friend   the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns   be not in her place but she clearly make the conservative case for protect the individual for championing people ’s   individuality that be why i speak today as well ensure that those in the lgbt community be able to live freely and happily be something to which i know even my ministerial colleague be utterly committed 
 on some specific i welcome the bill ’s clear framework in define what conversion practice be and the nature of the new offence i accept there be more to do but a framework be where we start the hon member for brighton kemptown be right to focus on the highly organise plan activity and operation where a huge amount of harm take place by have that type of focus i think we can well measure the success of the measure in the bill should it become law 
 have comb through the bill it be clear that great care have go into make sure that a range of group include different faith have be properly hear that be vital in consider the complexity surround the issue and the need to make the new offence completely watertight member will know how incredibly difficult it be to strike the right balance on an issue such as this and to maintain religious freedom while crack down on harmful conversion practice i believe that the bill successfully tread that path 
 by take a tough stance on the very bad conversion practice we can help to ensure that lgbt people be able to live their life free from the suppression of their gender and sexual orientation no in this country should be subject to the erosion and undue manipulation of their own identity i hope that member in all part of this house support the hon gentleman ’s bill and that we do not delay any far in get it through to the next stage for further deliberation on the fine detail 
 let i begin by tell a little story that may surprise some member who have make assumption and judgment about my position on policy of this type 
 when my party leader alex salmond introduce equal marriage to scotland it be do in a collaborative and supportive way involve proper engagement with all member of the community all the church be involve through an assembly process it be a smooth and positive campaign that deliver real meaningful change i have not avail myself of it because i be happy to stick with the old style civil partnership my partner and i be very comfortable with that but for those who want a marriage ceremony it be brilliant 
 after the introduction of equal marriage at the beginning of the equality network which have lead the campaign for it organise a consultation on what the priority should be for equality campaign in scotland so i trundle off to edinburgh on a cold dark march evening to sit in a room with a large group of people transexual people transgender people and gay people i be the only politician who have turn up on that cold evening and i be full throated in my support for advance disability and inclusion right and the right of transgender people what i have never sign up for however be the insinuation of queer theory into the right movement and the equality movement and the pernicious effect that it would have i have not realise how dangerous and disruptive that movement be until i speak up very politely and say a simple thing woman be not be listen to in the trans debate
