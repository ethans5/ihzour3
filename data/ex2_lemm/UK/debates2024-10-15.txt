i thank the hon member for his intervention and indeed for his contribution to the debate that be not a commitment that we be in a position to make it would be for the new leader of the opposition to nominate for peerage those whom he or she wish to nominate in the normal way 
 a number of member include   the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart talk about wide reform of the house of lords as set out in the labour manifesto the government be commit to replace the house of lords with an alternative chamber that be more representative of the region and nation of the uk that would be a major change to the functioning of our parliament and our constitution so it be right that it should be precede by a significant period of detailed consideration and consultation the government will set out further detail of that process in due course include how we will seek the british public ’s input on how politic can well serve they however that should not prevent progress on other important and long overdue reform include through this bill and other initial reform to help deliver a small and more active chamber the government ’s manifesto make it clear that the measure in the bill would be introduce to implement immediate reform which be what we be set out to do 
 the hon member for richmond park sarah olney too talk about wide reform i thank she for take the time to meet i and the minister for the cabinet office to talk about her concern and her ambition for further reform i be grateful for that engagement i want to stress that this be a new government with a fresh mandate and a set of manifesto pledge that we be commit to implement this bill deliver immediate reform as my right hon friend mention in his opening speech part of the reason why there have be no further progress over the last year be the argument that nothing should be do until everything have be do we firmly believe in take this step as a matter of priority and it be right that we take time to consider how good to implement other manifesto commitment that the government have previously set out we will engage   with peer and the public where appropriate over the course of this parliament and update the house in due course 
 the hon member for north west norfolk james wild   make a point about the commencement of the bill the bill will remove the remain hereditary peer at the end of the parliamentary session in which it receive royal assent the timing of the bill ’s implementation ensure that the business of the house will not be undermine by the sudden departure of a number of hereditary peer in the middle of the session subject to the timely progress of the bill we will give notice to exist hereditary peer to give valedictory speech 
 the hon member for bridgwater sir ashley fox   raise some concern about the balance in the house of lords if this bill be pass it be important to point out that no political party have hold an overall majority in the house of lords in recent time and this bill will not change that the role of the lords be to scrutinise and hold the government to account in the context of the primacy of the house of commons the hon member be right to say that the bill decrease the number of peer on the opposition benches but the share of the opposition ’s seat in the lords will reduce from around to around give that the conservatives will remain the large party in the chamber i be sure that hon member will agree that the bill be hardly a power grab 
 i very much look forward to engage with the shadow spokespeople from the opposition party i have welcome discuss this matter with the hon member for richmond park and members of other party who make time to discuss the bill at drop in session last week i look forward to far engagement with all those who attend the committee of the whole house especially give the important view that have be express today 
 i stress again that this bill be about finally remove an outdated and indefensible principle and not about individual as my right hon friend the minister for the cabinet office mention at the beginning of the debate the current hereditary peer and their predecessor have make notable contribution to the other place the merit of which we have hear in this house today this be the step in reform and not the last the other reform set out in our manifesto be more complex and it be right to take the time to properly consider their implementation i know that the leader of the house of lords have outline her commitment to meaningful dialogue with member of the other place on further reform to bring about a small and more active chamber 
 the government remain committed in the long term to replace the house of lords with an alternative chamber that be more representative of the nation and region and of how the public can have politic well serve they as the manifesto make clear it be right to start with this immediate reform complete the work that we begin year ago i commend this bill to the house

 hello it be a pleasure to follow   the hon member for mid and south pembrokeshire henry tufnell and i extend my warm regard to all the members make their maiden speech today 
 i would like to acknowledge my predecessor duncan baker he be an attentive and hard work member and i wish he well in his future pursuit in industry before he norman lamb serve in this house for year and leave an extraordinary legacy in the realm of mental health a cause that he continue to be a dedicated advocate for it be in no small part norman ’s commitment to speak the truth to power and give a voice to the voiceless that make he such a hero to the people of north norfolk and which attract i to politic fully year ago when i be elect as a county councillor and i draw member attention to the register of members financial interests in connection with my continue role there 
 i be immensely grateful for the trust that resident across north norfolk have show in i trust to represent they here but also trust to play a part in the deep transformation we need in our politic if we be go to make positive change for society this be an extraordinary place but i can not do what i have promise to do for my constituent we can not really do what we have be elect to do without give it the shake up that be long overdue 
 when people in the beautiful constituency of north norfolk can not live well in good accommodation with access to transport and employment and healthcare as part of a vibrant society it be all of we who be fail they i be think of the former resident i meet on the train just last week who say to i i just want to come home but there be n’t the job and there be n’t the transport i be also think about kit who make i my wonderful liberal democrat tie and about the need to protect the precious norfolk broad that she live   near about lisa in north walsham who be live in constant anguish because of the supply risk to her life dependent medication and about don a year old in sheringham who be pin his hope on a new kind of politic for the sake of his grandchild 
 the bill introduce much need reform of the house of lords which we liberal democrats of course support but we know that it do not go far enough we must establish a fully elect upper house elect use a fairer voting system as soon as possible 
 the house of lords be only part of our broken system which need to see urgent radical reform the structure and organisation of government itself must evolve to be fit for the modern age and that transformation must extend beyond government to the wide public service and administrative system that serve our citizen continue with the current siloe structure of government be to ignore the technological advance of the past year and fail to embrace the logarithmic advance in the future we be already live in this evolution be about bring policy and service delivery close to the everyday life and need of people at every stage of their journey through life 
 the current structure be have a very real impact in rural area like mine where our public service be in dangerous decline benjamin court a re ablement centre in cromer have fall into the gap between silo social care manage by the local authority and health service oversee by the nhs lead to its closure that be not to mention the desperate need for a properly network rural public transport service which be key to enable access to everything from employment to healthcare but it be out of those department scope and be instead leave languish at the bottom of the pile of priority by a near bankrupt county council these problem make the life of my constituent hard every day we can not go on like this 
 but there be a solution we can bring the design and delivery of service close to the need of citizen and there be plenty of precedence to go on here in the industrial revolution thomas edison make a profound contribution to rewire the way that industry be organise prior to electricity generation which he help to develop there tend to be only motor in a factory industry have to be organise around a single source of power usually a steam engine with every machine that need power connect directly to the central drive shaft in the ceiling above component could be make yes but they then have to be transport elsewhere and assemble usually by hand 
 energy be the central organise principle of industry but electricity make it possible to pipe power to anywhere on the factory floor it mean that machine could be place wherever they be need become more precise efficient and specialised and it lead to mass manufacturing with the product as the central organise principle of industry 
 over the past few year we have go through another revolution that be potentially even big the communication revolution it be power not by the invention of electricity but by datum since the advent of the consumer web in the 1990 people have come to expect a high degree of personalisation in their interaction with organisation and service datum gather from a wide range of source not just digital be drive innovation and enable more    tailor proactive experience for user this ability to be more pre emptive and personalised do not even need people to be digitally enable 
 data have enable the rewiring of industry not around the production line or the product but around the citizen or user experience that have cause profound change in the overall architecture of many modern organisation but it have have limit impact on the way that government and the state be structure there be great innovation take place to try to integrate service and make they more patient or user centre but without fundamental change in the underlie structure of power and public service their effect will be limit 
 from tackle climate change and prevent sewage spill into the sea to help people get work and get about let alone get a dentist appointment so much of the change this country badly need be not limit to pillar of the state but cross cut different department perhaps it be time to move away from the traditional silos of secretaries of state for education health and transport and instead adopt a more citizen focus model imagine secretaries of state for the citizen experience for wellbeing and prosperity for child or for datum and privacy 
 if people in north norfolk be to get the change they deserve to our rural health and social care provision to access and prosper in the job of the future and to trust politician as the custodian of our natural environment we need to be prepared to rewire the structure of politic and public service delivery around the need of the people they and all of we in this house serve

 we have be discuss constitutional reform extensively in this debate and pembrokeshire have always be interweave with the story of our individual but united nation the welsh monk asser summon by alfred the great to leave the great settlement of st davids to advise he at court the birth of henry tudor in pembroke castle who would later return from exile to land his army near dale and march to bosworth field and the siege of pembroke castle by oliver cromwell in almost the final act of the english civil war begin a period of year of the protectorate reign supreme 
 since my election on   july some of the more charitable correspondent have take the opportunity to observe that i be a slightly unusual person to be a labour mp i come from a farming family and there be not many vote labour poster around where i grow up but time have change and as the son of a fierce strong and wonderful welsh woman who be in the public gallery today i be proud to be part of the red wave that subsume pembrokeshire wales and our united kingdom my wife and i choose pembrokeshire as our home i choose to join the labour party and now perhaps to my father ’s despair i choose to vote and do away with hereditary peer i say sorry to my dad who be sit in the public gallery today but i be here to serve the many not the few

 as with the history the experience and the tribulation of the great figure of pembrokeshire ’s history our county have see its fortune rise and fall the fishing industry be once the large in our united kingdom the establishment of the royal naval dockyard during the napoleonic war in pembroke dock cement our county ’s military legacy which live on to this day in brawdy barrack and castlemartin range 
 the latter part of the century see the rise of the oil industry and the transformation of pembrokeshire ’s economic fortune with oil refinery on stream by the early 1970s oil have give way to gas and the port of milford now have liquefy natural gas terminal gas fire power station and oil refinery more than of the uk ’s energy come through the port with the rise of renewable energy and the potential for float offshore wind in the celtic sea we be in a unique position to give true meaning to the term a just transition we have the talent the skillset the resource and i will use my voice in this house at every give opportunity to ensure that pembrokeshire will not only benefit from but spearhead the industry of the future 
 on the subject of fortune rise and fall i wish to pay tribute to my predecessor simon hart and stephen crabb both be dedicated servant of the good people   of pembrokeshire and have long and successful career in this house they fly high with both serve as secretary of state for wales and hold other cabinet position their most notable act be stephen ’s bid to be prime minister and simon ’s unenviable task of hold together a fragmented tory party as chief whip i wish they both well and i hope that simon the quintessential countryman can find time for his alternative pursuit give that his favoured sport have become something of a bête noire for my party 
 as i bring my maiden speech to a close i wish to paraphrase the word of a man great than i and who have already be mention in this debate the inspirational and history make harold wilson he say that the party on the government benches be drive every day by a moral crusade and that without that mission that purpose and that cause we be nothing in my county where we have the high child poverty rate in wales those word be as true now as they be then i will use my time in this house to fight for fairness to deliver real change and to stand up for all the people who live learn and work in the wonderful community that send i to parliament the work be urgent the time for action be now and i be here to serve 
 thank you madam deputy speaker it be the privilege of my life to give my speech in the house of   commons as the labour member of parliament for the filton and bradley stoke constituency have be a candidate since it still feel rather surreal to be on this side of the election and to say those word and in truth i hope that stand here in this awe inspire place will always feel at least a little surreal 
 i could not be more grateful to fellow resident for the time that thousand of they have give in speak with i and my volunteer team on their doorstep over the year already and for put their faith in i to serve they well but no matter how people vote i will work hard every day to serve all resident as an active impactful and approachable mp that they can be proud of 
 i come from a family of teacher nhs worker and raf service member and their sense of public service run deep in i i have spend my life work with and for those who too often do not have enough of a voice on issue that matter to they on global poverty on opportunity on the environment and on the housing crisis 
 i be at my core a campaigner and advocate i whole- heartedly believe in the power of community and that live experience be as valid in shape policy and public service as hold multiple degree in that same subject i see this role which i be honour to hold for a time as be a vital jigsaw piece join together with other to make life fair for people across our community and our country the nhs worker the charity worker the teacher the carer the innovator and the volunteer i could go on be the one who bind we that be certainly the case across our rich tapestry of town and village just north of the city of bristol in glorious south gloucestershire 
 i be determined to put the whole of the filton and bradley stoke constituency name after the old and young town at the time of its creation and include many distinct and vibrant community on the map it be the home of concorde and the future of flight with our aerospace company set the standard nationally and internationally it be the home of the lifesaving nhs blood and transplant the innovative university of the west of england and the vital ministry of defence abbey wood it be also home to wallace and gromit more place call stoke then could count after a few great local cider and a palpable belief that well day still lie ahead 
 people in my constituency do not ask for too much we want security stability and fairness and to know that if we work hard we have the same chance as anyone else to fulfil our potential we want to know that we will be able to provide for our family through good wage earn from decent job and to enjoy life and give back in our own way i be incredibly grateful for the fact that even though they have be up against so much in recent year people in my community choose to keep their faith in well i will work hard every day to repay that trust 
 with that in mind while it be almost impossible for any people let alone of we across a constituency to agree on everything all the time i will always be up front with fellow resident will listen and will share what decision i be make and why i believe that how we do thing in politic matter almost as much as what we do i appreciate my part my responsibility in do politic differently and have well conversation 
 on that note i give thank to my predecessor jack lopresti champion defence and i know that he will be glad of this government ’s continue support for ukraine before recent boundary change some local resident be serve by luke hall and briefly by my hon friend   the member for bristol north east damien egan when he be the last member for kingswood my true thank to they and their predecessor for their service 
 i also want to give my personal thank to other former member of this house who have be important in my journey to this place sally keeble be the near labour mp to i when i be grow up in a village that still do not have a labour mp she take i under her wing and encourage i to think about stand to serve in this place i also thank tony blair whom i have the privilege of work closely with for a few year at his institute for global change his approach to consider and considerate leadership have teach i a great deal it be the last labour government ’s response to the make poverty history campaign that show i that politic at its good can be an unparalleled force for good and that significant change can happen when people power meet political power that be when i find the labour party 
 i get into politic like many to make a difference but i be drive every day by the simple belief that someone ’s background should not determine their life chance and life choice that be why it feel fitting to give this speech today in a debate that be fundamentally about how we make our parliament well and fairer while i be a great supporter of british institution and tradition there be clearly no place in a modern parliament for people largely man who can vote on legislation as a birthright because their father do as a new officer of the all party parliamentary group on financial education for young people and as a soon to be member of the upcoming group focus on political and media literacy i will work hard and across the divide to help other to feel as confident capable and comfortable as anyone else in these space i hope to show that if i can stand here today a girl from a village who have and still have a simple belief in make life fair so can anyone 
 i be fully commit to serve local people well put our priority at the heart of the agenda and break down barrier to opportunity so that everybody have their chance to thrive i end by thank my family friend campaign team and community who inspire i every day

 that an humble address be present to his majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there be lay before this house a return of a report date   october entitle independent inquiry into the issue raise by the david fuller case phase interim report funeral sector.—(taiwo owatemi 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step his department plan to take to improve health outcome in the east midland 
 lord darzi ’s report conclude that the health service be in a critical condition across the country include in the east midland where healthy life expectancy have decline in the past decade waiting list in the region stand at slightly below the national average for week wait at compare to the national average of 
 with third of people have to wait more than hour at lincoln county hospital ’s a&e department and with horror story from my constituent of people wait up to hour do the minister understand that if we be to save the nhs and give people the timely appointment they need we must unleash the full power of the private sector 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for help to underline the shocking inheritance from the previous government he be absolutely right we be committed to cut waiting time and serve constituent like mine by deliver the long term reform the nhs desperately need the government be commit to the funding model we be not go to change it he try this every time but we be commit to the funding model as it exist 
 a really important part of improve health outcome in the east midland and across the country be the use of diagnostic the rosalind franklin laboratory which be set up in my constituency be close down just a few month ago at a cost of £ do my hon friend agree that of the most important thing   we could do be to restore good quality diagnostic to   our nhs 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we be committed to improve diagnostic as part of our reform of the health sector analysis of waiting list show that of people will end up with a hospital admission most as a day case to improve waiting time the focus must be on early prevention diagnostic and consultant review at an early stage 
 what assessment his department have make of the effectiveness of nhs urgent and emergency care service 
 the recent independent report by lord darzi make it absolutely clear that urgent and emergency care service be also struggle with the late datum publish last week show that in patient spend over hour in a&e. we be committed to return to service standard that patient rightly expect through our ambitious year plan to reform the health service 
 in september victoria hospital in deal lose provision for blood testing after a long campaign by resident it be agree that it would return however that have stall in the tendering process will the minister meet i to discuss how we can move this forward 
 i commend my hon friend for champion this issue on behalf of his constituent i understand that he have raise it with the chief executive officer of his local trust he will appreciate that commission decision be a matter for the local integrate care board in this case kent and medway icb but i be of course very happy to meet he to discuss it far 
 i wish the minister well in her effort to address this issue because it be extremely serious there be very often more than ambulance queue outside treliske hospital which have a serious impact on expectation for patient will the minister please look at the potential for urgent treatment centre to take pressure away from emergency department such as the urgent treatment centre at west cornwall hospital in penzance which really need to be re establish on a basis that would make a real impact 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his good wish it be indeed a huge task we have before we we will maintain ambulance capacity throughout this winter he make a valuable point about alternative model to hospital admission and treatment in the community that be a matter for the local icb as i   know he know it need to look at which model be the good fit particularly in rural area to reduce the pressure on frontline a&e service 
 intermediate care for people face homelessness which be recommend by the national institute for health and care excellence can reduce rough sleeping by around that be life change for people who have be sleep rough and it play a significant role in relieve pressure on hospital a recent evaluation of intermediate care for people face homelessness in county in england find a reduction in a&e visit and a reduction in emergency admission what exist currently be a postcode lottery how can we embed the nice approach in every integrate care system across england 
 my hon friend have highlight an issue that be often overlook homelessness have rise to shocking level in the last year when it be address under the last labour government people be move off the street and there be decent care at the front end of the hospital system and support in the community my hon friend be right there be good example across the country and we would like to see they embed as part of our overall goal across government of reduce the scourge of homelessness in society and once again support the front end of the health service 
 i recently meet representative of the royal college of emergency medicine who tell i that the inadequate state of social care be result in the deterioration of people ’s physical health lead to more presentation at emergency department do the minister agree that if social care be properly fund pressure on our hospital would be reduce 
 what we see at the front end of the system be a result of the deterioration throughout the system and the flow of patient from the community through discharge and indeed through social care our ambitious year plan will involve examine the entire patient pathway to ensure that care be provide in the community close to home prevention be a key part of that as be the look that we be take at social care 
 what step he plan to take to reform adult social care 
 after year of tory neglect and incompetence adult social care be on its knee the number of people receive long term care decrease between and and there be a staggering staff vacancy in the system last thursday recognise the central role of our amazing care workforce we take a critical step by introduce the groundbreaking legislation that will establish the ever fair pay agreement for care professional i think it fair to say that this government have do more for our adult social care worker in week than the last lot do in year 
 give unfunded scheme such as the propose national care service give the new negotiating body ’s aim of establish a minimum pay floor and give what clearly amount to an expensive top down reorganisation of the care system can the minister explain how he will maintain and enhance the role of local authority include buckinghamshire council in target and deliver care and how he plan to maintain day to day spending alongside this grand plan for reform without raise taxis 
 it beggar belief that opposition members should lecture we on fiscal discipline when there be a £ in year black hole we be commit to consult widely on the design of a fair pay agreement and we will engage with all who may be affect we be keen to ensure that all voice be hear so that the financial impact on the adult social care market local government and self funder can be consider but in a week in which this government have attract £ of investment and just day after the publication of the employment rights bill we be see a government who be pro business pro worker and pro growth 
 adult social care be under extreme pressure in hospital bed be occupy by patient with dementia will the minister commit himself to the delivery of a dementia strategy in the current parliament 
 that be an extremely important question i recognise that dementia be a huge issue that impact on the entire country and indeed many member on both side of the house we be absolutely committed to the research that be fundamental to address the problem and our fair pay agreement be about not just pay but training and term and condition we will be ramp up dementia training for our adult social care workforce 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the labour manifesto speak of the need for a consensus on social care and the secretary of state have say that he want to reach out across the political divide although the message do not seem quite to have reach the minister yet during health and social care question in july the minister say that there would be announcement in the near future but since then we have hear nothing we be ready to talk when will the government be ready 
 i be not sure if the right hon gentleman be listen to my previous answer we have just set out a groundbreaking piece of legislation to settle the issue of adult social care pay which be more than the last lot do in year we be absolutely committed to build cross party consensus we know that we need a process that will be sustainable and fix adult social care for the long term that absolutely include engagement and dialogue across this house because we want to build a consensus that work we recognise that successive government have fail to get a grip on this issue but we recognise the vital role that adult social care will play it be go to be a hugely   important part of our year plan for the future of the nhs and i look forward to engage with all hon member on this issue 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of treatment for post sepsis syndrome 
 i thank the hon member for raise awareness of this important issue he have speak powerfully about the experience of patient in his constituency and his wife ’s personal battle with sepsis the long term complication of sepsis can have a devastating impact long after discharge from hospital through the national institute for health and care research the department be fund research to improve outcome for sepsis survivor 
 last year abbi hickson from ashfield lose both her hand and her low leg to sepsis the local hospital be very slow to diagnosis her condition and since then she have be suffer from shortness of breath fatigue and a lack of sleep this could be post sepsis syndrome yet nobody at the hospital have speak to she about it do the minister agree that every single sepsis patient and survivor should be advise about this condition 
 i absolutely do and i pay tribute to abbi a beautiful woman whom i be privileged to meet after the westminster hall debate last week although care after sepsis will vary hugely on a case by case basis we need to make sure that the need of each individual be meet in this case it sound like they have not be meet if the hon gentleman want to meet i to discuss this issue far i be more than happy to do so 
 give that last month be sepsis awareness month will the minister join i in pay tribute to the courage of john snow and his family in my dartford constituency tragically he have just experience a quadruple amputation due to sepsis he have receive amazing support from the dartford community who have rally around to help fund support for his family will the minister use that as a spur to improve treatment for sepsis more generally across the country 
 i pay tribute to john snow and indeed my hon friend ’s constituent who have rally around he at his time of need this matter highlight the need to have well join up care to ensure that people who have sepsis receive the good care possible that those who tragically lose limb as a consequence of sepsis be able to have good quality aftercare and that we continue to raise awareness of sepsis and the risk it pose 
 we think that about people a year lose their life to sepsis but the truth be that we do not know because the data be inconsistent will the minister look   at establish a national registry to track sepsis case so that performance can be measure publish and improve 
 give the national standard and framework that have be put in place in this regard i hope very much that the nhs will be able to do precisely what the hon gentleman want it to do 
 yesterday be allied health professions day which raise awareness of profession include physio speech and language therapist and radiographer do the minister agree that all the hard work of those professional be really important for   patient care 
 my hon friend make a really important point the wonderful staff we have work across health and care ensure that our constituent receive within a very tightly constrain health service the good possible care that we can give they the nhs be break we have to fix our break health service and have good quality staff at the heart of it be how we be go to achieve that aim 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of patient waiting time 
 wait time be wholly inadequate in our country that be because the previous conservative government take a golden inheritance of the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in history and leave behind the bad crisis in the nhs ’s history what be more they accept no responsibility and can not even bring themselves to say sorry 
 i pay tribute to my own family gp dr islam at the east hull family practice who go above and beyond for his patient however i know that gps be trouble by the amount of time patient have to wait to see they the disparity between gp number in different area be utterly shocking in kingston upon thames for example a gp look after patient but in kingston upon hull it be more than double that number what be my right hon friend do to sort out the tory mess of the last year 
 may i through my hon friend say thank you to dr islam and to gps right across the country who against the backdrop of the extraordinary challenge they be work through have none the less manage to deliver more appointment now than when there be thousand more gps my hon friend be right to point out that we do not have enough gps in this country that be why within week of take office this government find just shy of £ to   put into the frontline to employ more gps who will be see patient before the end of this financial year that will make a real difference and the shadow secretary of state should have the humility and to grace accept that 
 patient waiting time be reduce dramatically through the recruitment and retention of more gps so will the secretary of state welcome the work of the anglia ruskin medical school in essex and perhaps have a conversation with myself and neighbouring mp about how that medical school could be expand to do much more to support the recruitment and training of more mp more gps in essex 
 i be sure that the right hon lady do want more conservative mp in essex she have raise an entirely constructive point which i strongly welcome this government be commit as we be in opposition to double the number of medical school place and that mean real opportunity for local medical school such as her as ever i would of course be delighted to meet she to talk about what more can do with her local university 
 the news that we be recruit more gps be very welcome i spend an afternoon shadow a local gp and see just how stretch the service be will the secretary of state give a commitment that we be move towards investment in primary care service and move from a national health service to a focus on neighbourhood health service 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that question when in opposition i be delighted to spend time with a whole group of gps from across sheffield who show we what primary care reform could look like we be committed to increase primary care as a proportion of the nhs ’s budget which will be important and also to build exactly the kind of neighbourhood health service she describe with more care close to people ’s home general practice have a key role to play in that 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 what we measure be often what we end up improve and of the great asset of lord darzi ’s report be the technical annex with its analysis it be incredibly useful it be a baseline will the secretary of state make sure that it be update yearly 
 that be a great constructive challenge i be absolutely committed to transparency and to keep that dataset update in the way that the hon lady request we be not go to get everything right and sometimes we be not go to make progress as fast as we would like but where that be the case we be never go to duck it or pretend that thing be well than they be the reason that we will succeed where the previous government fail be that we be willing to face up to the challenge in the nhs rather than pretend that they do not exist 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the prime minister have repeatedly stress the importance of prevent people from take up smoking as of his priority to improve the nation ’s health reduce waiting list and lessen demand on the nhs and we   agree the government like to talk about the record of their day in office but accord to datum from action on smoking and health child under the age of take up smoking in england each day that be child in england during the secretary of state ’s day why have he not yet reintroduce our tobacco and vapes bill how many child need to take up smoking before he make this a priority 
 perhaps the shadow minister would like to give we the figure for the entire year that his party be in government by the way just to set the record straight not only do i propose the measure in that bill during an interview with the times early last year but if it be such a priority for the opposition why do they leave the bill unfinished why have it only have its reading and why do we go into the general election with that bill unpasse i will tell he why because his party be divide on the issue and the then prime minister be too weak to stand up to his own right winger who be now call the shot in his party the smoking bill will be back it will be strong and unlike the previous government we will deliver it 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 my constituent mel lycett have terminal cancer after repeat visit to her gp she be refer to a week urgent pathway in may she be not diagnose until the end of july and she still have not start treatment every single target for her diagnosis and treatment be miss that be not uncommon in shropshire and it be not uncommon in the rest of the country can the secretary of state reassure i of what he be do to deal with this terrible legacy leave behind by the conservative government how will he ensure that cancer patient be treat in a timely manner 
 i welcome the hon lady to her role i be afraid that this case be just of countless story of people whose life might have be save have the nhs be there for they when they need it it be bad enough when people receive a late diagnosis that equate to a death sentence it be bad still when people in that position be not give the fighting chance of urgent life extend treatment 
 the inheritance we have receive be truly shameful i assure the hon lady as a cancer survivor myself because the nhs be there for i when i need it that we will work tirelessly through a national cancer plan to make sure that we deliver the cancer waiting time standard that the last labour government meet and that be sorely need today 
 if he will make a comparative assessment of the adequacy of access to primary care service for man in a england and b scotland 
 as lord darzi identify in his nhs review primary care be break with few fully qualified gps than in we recognise that man can face particular challenge in access service   which be why we be commit to fix the front door to the nhs bring back the family doctor and shift the focus of care away from hospital and into the community health be devolve in scotland but i welcome opportunity to share learn across our nation 
 in my paisley and renfrewshire south constituency the rate of premature death in man be high than the uk average accord to national records of scotland the number of people who have die by suicide in renfrewshire as a whole have increase to the high level in year do my hon friend agree that this be a damn indictment of the snp government ’s record on health will he commit today to hold a summit in november with movember to raise man ’s health up the agenda 
 those statistic be both damn and shocking health inequality in any part of our united kingdom need to be tackle and the snp government have real question to answer on these shocking statistic for man in my hon friend ’s constituency and across scotland i will take up her challenge a summit with movember and with she and other interested member to talk about man ’s health issue be a crack idea and i will get straight on to it when i get back to the department 
 i appreciate that the secretary of state be unlikely to comment on the chancellor ’s forthcoming statement but he and his front bench colleague have already mention funding issue a number of time this morning so will he confirm that it be the policy of his government to take step to increase the uk ’s health spending to the average of other country in north west europe that would lead to an increase of around £ for the national health service and would help address some of the issue refer to by   the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter 
 order question ought to be link to the subject be deal with which be access to primary care i be sure that the hon gentleman mean to ask will there also be fund to improve access to primary care which i be sure the minister can answer 
 this labour government be elect to tackle health inequality fix our nhs and ensure that more people live long healthy life that will require a concerted government effort which be why we have the health mission board in place my right hon friend the secretary of state be make the case for investment and reform at every opportunity but let we be clear every single labour government have leave the country with a well nhs than they inherit and this labour government will fix our nhs once more 
 what his department ’s timetable be for announce the outcome of its review of the new hospital programme in relation to the propose redevelopment of whipps cross hospital 
 i must declare an interest because whipps cross hospital serve my constituent as well as those of the right hon gentleman on that basis i be well aware that we desperately need the propose redevelopment of the hospital that be why in common with so many member across the house i be furious that the previous government ’s new hospital programme have a timetable that be a work of fiction and money that will run out in march the assurance i can give to the right hon gentleman his constituent my constituent and the constituent of every right hon and hon member across the house whose constituent be wait for news on the new hospital programme be that we will deliver on a timetable that be credible and a programme that be fund give our constituent the clarity and consistency they deserve and rebuild by place   the government among our construction industry supply chain 
 the secretary of state know that we have campaign together for the redevelopment of whipps cross hospital and whether that be deliver by a labour or conservative government make no difference to i i want to drag he to the reality of a specific point about the hospital it be grant £ towards undertake a business case which it receive in august but that money have run out a total of £ be require to be ready when the decision be make if it be not available the hospital will lose the architect and builder will he go back to the department and ensure that the hospital receive that money so that manager can be ready with the full detailed business case the moment the decision be make otherwise it will cost £ extra over the next year to get the architect and builder back i beg the secretary of state i literally beg he to look at that carefully 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question those practical consideration be very much part of the review i say to the poor project manager across the country who have have to deal with the previous government ’s stop start approach that we be not go to make that mistake we be go to come forward with a credible plan that be also fund not the work of fiction or the £ black hole that the shadow secretary of state leave in her wake 
 whipps cross hospital be in my constituency and it be my constituent who have have to endure year of the previous government organise photo opportunity after photo opportunity not put the contract in place for the project to be up and run and ready to go do my right hon friend agree that only a fully cost long term approach from this labour government can deliver the modern healthcare that my constituent need 
 my hon friend my constituency neighbour be absolutely right he have be do an outstanding job of represent the people of leyton and wanstead since his arrival what our constituent and indeed constituent right across the country deserve be honesty clarity and consistency that be how we will turn the new hospital programme from a press release into reality and how in do so we will restore trust in   politic and for business the construction industry and the supply chain restore confidence in public sector procurement 
 many leicestershire resident be concerned about the government ’s review of the new hospital programme which would have see new hospital a midwifery lead unit and a multi storey car park in the city what representation have the minister make to the chancellor to retain this vital investment for the nhs in leicestershire 
 the hon gentleman ask what representation i be make to retain the funding if only that be the case the funding be not there the conservative party go into the general election with a programme timetable that be a work of fiction and a claim to have a fund programme that be simply not true what we arrive to find be a timetable that be a load of rubbish and a £ hole in the public finance that the party hide from the country because it do not want to confront the hard truth this government be face the fact and answer the challenge 
 i be probably the only mp in this current chamber who have recently use whipps cross hospital which also serve my community in walthamstow because i have both my child there so i know at hand how desperately it need redevelopment and how poor the facility be that the amazing staff be have to use do my right hon friend agree that finally get this project move under a labour government will also deliver thousand of much need home in our local community it be a win win situation which be why it be such a travesty that for year conservative ministers come and take photo but we never see any digger or spade in the ground do he agree that labour can change that 
 my hon friend be absolutely right this be about not just the necessary hospital project but the growth that will come through construction get these project up and run and of course the role that the nhs play as an economic anchor institution in community as some of these project will necessarily unlock new housing site and a local transport infrastructure we be mindful of all of that the most important thing be that we come forward with a timetable that be credible and a programme that be fund and that be exactly what we will do 
 we look forward to get the land in chorley on that basis 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of district hospital in provide service that meet the need of local community 
 lord darzi ’s report conclude that the health service be in a critical condition across the country district hospital have a vital role to play in meet the need of their community and this    government will support they to reduce waiting time to improve urgent care and to play their part in build a neighbourhood health service 
 critical care at furness general hospital in barrow have be temporarily downgrade mean that those in most need of the high level of care be now expose to potentially life threaten delay during a mile transfer on difficult road will the minister please look at this worrying decision by the university hospitals of morecambe bay nhs foundation trust and do everything to enable the reopening of this service as soon as possible 
 my hon friend be a doughty fighter for her constituent i be aware that the decision she mention be an interim measure make by the critical care network the lancashire and south cumbria integrate care board and the nhs trust the decision will be keep under review and patient impact will receive the appropriate support the government recognise that more must be do to improve the sustainability of the nhs both nationally and in rural and coastal area 
 service at chase community hospital in my constituency in whitehill and bordon be be run down by the icb this be base on a promise that a brand new health hub will be build in place which be much welcome it have the support of the defence infrastructure organisation which own the land east hampshire district council and the community but the icb be suffer from inertia can the minister speak to the icb and suggest that it either build this new health hub or refurbishe and renovate the chase community hospital 
 i have every sympathy with the case that the hon gentleman have put forward this government want to see a shift of health service from hospital to community from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention but these decision be not take through inertia they be take because of the government ’s inheritance from the conservative party we have have year of run down our health service with needless reorganisation that have destroy and set back the progress that the last labour government make on the nhs this government will fix the nhs include in the hon gentleman ’s local area but he have to recognise that the root cause of many of the problem face by member across the chamber lie at the foot of the former secretary of state and the last government 
 we have hear about the challenge face whipps cross hospital the secretary of state ’s decision to pause capital project across the country and put they under review have cause worry and uncertainty for staff in hospital nationwide can he say when the review will be complete so that we have certainty about when thing will go ahead 
 the review will be complete when all the information have be analyse the hon lady should not just be a little more patient she should be a little more apologetic for the fact that the government find a hospital rebuild programme that be not worth the paper it be write on because the ultimate paper we need the cash be not there 
 what assessment his department have make of the effectiveness of the nhs dental contracting framework 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for the excellent work he do for the people of doncaster east and the isle of axholme the scale of the problem that he point out be massive of the most shocking statistic i have discover since take up this position be that the most common reason for child age to be admit to hospital be tooth decay that be completely and utterly shocking truly dickensian we can not fix the matter overnight but we be committed to reform the dental contract and work with the british dental association to focus on prevention and on the retention of nhs dentist we be also work at pace to ensure that patient can access an additional urgent dental appointment 
 the horror story i hear in my constituency be just awful from the mum on the isle of axholme who could not find an nhs dentist after year and who carry out her own treatment on her son to a gentleman in doncaster east whose tooth be crumble due to illness cause he horrendous pain and who can not get an appointment the government ’s pledge to provide more emergency appointment be great but i know that it will take time to rebuild dentistry can the minister reassure i that people in my constituency will be give the priority they deserve 
 my hon friend be right south yorkshire have the high level of hospital tooth extraction in england and i want to assure he that we will target intervention at the area of great need for example integrate care board have start to advertise role through our golden hello scheme which will drive recruitment of graduate dentist to area of great need for year we have inherit a mess and we be work at pace to clear it up 
 the minister be right to underline the issue for child but can i remind he of the issue for those above the state pension age which be increase to include for lady in particular when it come to certain benefit such as attendance allowance will he look at the contract for those who be elderly and in receipt of such benefit 
 we be in a situation where a staggering of the country—13 people have a need that be unmet by nhs dentistry there be so many issue that we need to resolve we be look at the contract with the bda and i be more than happy to look into the issue raise by the hon gentleman 
 last month the secretary of state for wales tell the labour party conference that this labour government will take inspiration from labour run wales on dentistry that be the same health system in which less than of dentistry course be be complete in comparison   with pre pandemic figure a rate that be far low than in england do the minister agree that the secretary of state for wales be right and that wales be a blueprint for what a labour government will do in england or will they drop the bluster get serious and commit to the dental reform set out in the dental recovery plan include a tie in to nhs dentistry for graduate dentist 
 i find it extraordinary that yet again we see a total lack of humility and contrition from the opposition the key difference that we will see in how our united kingdom work be that we now have some grown up in charge in westminster who will work with colleague in cardiff bay to ensure that a rise tide lift all boat and we improve the state of nhs dentistry across the united kingdom 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of access to nhs mental health service 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of access to nhs mental health service 
 our mental health service be on its knee thank to year of tory neglect and mismanagement a staggering people be wait to access mental health service and vacancy rate be around the high across the nhs this government be commit to fix our break nhs so that people can be confident of access high quality mental health support when need that include recruit more mental health worker introduce specialist mental health professional in every school roll out young futures hub in every community and modernise the mental health act 
 patient tell i they can not get access to community mental health nurse put huge pressure on gp practice and lead to people go to a&e in desperation can the minister confirm whether the extra mental health staff pledge in labour ’s manifesto will include much need nurse in the community 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend who be do excellent work for the people of north durham i would also like to take the opportunity to thank our mental health nurse who do such vital and valuable work the government be commit to shift from hospital to community and that of course include the mental health sector i can assure my hon friend that we be work with nhs england on how good to deploy those additional mental health worker 
 i wish to pay my respect to the family of jamie pearson the year old blackpool man who sadly take his own life in a local hospital in august after wait nearly hour to see a mental health worker in a&e. jamie be in a mental health crisis but get himself to what should have be a place of safety what step be the minister ’s department take to ensure that no be leave to suffer in a&e because they    can not access mental health treatment in their community and will he meet i to discuss that tragic issue so that we can make sure that it never happen again 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that deeply tragic case word can not express the heartbreak cause to jamie pearson ’s friend and family i hope it might be some small comfort to they to know that all acute hospital should now have a mental health liaison service in a&e and we be look at how good to take forward the government ’s suicide prevention strategy for england we will do everything in our power to ensure that the tragic circumstance of jamie ’s untimely death be address and that lesson be learn i be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that far 
 those provide child and adolescent mental health service in south cumbria do an outstanding job but they be without a dedicated crisis team unlike the rest of lancashire and south cumbria nhs foundation trust that be devastating and dangerous for my constituent will the minister use his power to intervene with the integrate care board and lancashire and south cumbria to make sure that young people in our community have access to a crisis team 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question and the passion with which he put it we be commit to roll out young futures hub across the country and of course we need to prioritise area of particular need i would be happy to meet he to discuss that far 
 a recent review of child ’s mental health service in my local authority the london borough of richmond find that staggeringly child with mild to moderate need in tier wait on average month before receive treatment and those with more severe need wait on average month the minister do not need i to tell he that during that time child ’s condition get bad they need great treatment and sadly too many present at a&e self harm and attempt to take their own life as well as commit to mental health professional in every school will he put some money into acute provision so that child do not end up in a&e 
 we be absolutely committed to the shift from hospital to community from sickness to prevention and from analogue to digital the sickness to prevention aspect be important in the question that the hon member raise treatable mental health condition such as anxiety and depression should be identify early to prevent they from develop into something more serious and into a crisis so i absolutely share the sentiment behind her question they will be at the heart of our year strategy for the future of our health 
 what step his department be take to improve access to gp appointment 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of patient access to primary care service 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of patient access to primary care service 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of patient access to primary care service 
 as identify in lord darzi ’s review primary care be break satisfaction with gp service have fall from a peak of in to just last year a truly damn indictment of year of tory failure we will rebuild general practice we have invest £ to recruit new gps we have launch our red tape challenge and we be commit to improve continuity of care and end the am scramble on primary care more broadly we be commit to boost the role of community pharmacy enable patient to be treat for certain condition by their local pharmacist without the need to see a gp 
 the arborfield green community in my wokingham constituency have around resident in new home with many more to come but there be no local primary care provision to see a gp resident must travel to neighbouring village which be often inaccessible because of a lack of public transport what step will the minister take to guarantee that there will be enough gps in any major new development that come down the line 
 the hon member be absolutely right there be seriously under doctored area of the country give the finite resource that we have we must focus on area with the great need i would be more than happy to meet he to discuss how that might well be reflect in his constituency 
 access to gp appointment be consistently raise with i in cumbernauld a number of constituent have inform i that have make complaint they have be remove from the list of the general practice at which they have be patient for many year will the minister raise the matter with the scottish government ’s cabinet secretary for health and social care so that we can get some resolution for my constituent 
 patient have an absolute right to complain about nhs service and they should not be remove from a practice ’s list because of a complaint they have make health be of course devolve but i have ask official in the department to engage with their scottish government counterpart on that matter to ensure that patient in my hon friend ’s constituency be treat with the respect and compassion that they deserve 
 resident in mickleover have be queue from be to get an appointment with their gp and healthwatch say that in people   in derby find it very difficult to book appointment that be the legacy of the previous government with new home be build in and around mickleover we need even more additional capacity do the minister agree that gp capacity must be a priority 
 we be absolutely committed to the challenge of cut red tape and reduce the administrative burden for staff to help patient get the care that they need an important element of our plan will be streamline access to registration in order to move it online and we be work at pace to make online registration available in all practice i be very happy to come back to my hon friend on the constituency issue that she raise 
 lord darzi ’s report on the nhs state that people be struggle to see their gps prevention be well than cure and intervention to protect health tend to be far less costly than deal with the consequence of illness both financially and in term of outcome early and quick access to primary care be therefore crucial i accept that it be not always necessary to see   a gp an appointment with a nurse may suffice but what step be be take to ensure that patient in my wolverhampton west constituency have quick easy and direct access to gp surgery 
 i note that wolverhampton west have see a decrease of full time equivalent gps since which of course massively exacerbate the issue to which my hon friend refer we will introduce a modern booking system to end the am scramble and make it easy for patient to contact their gp in particular we be committed to increase the use of the nhs app to view patient record and order repeat prescription all of that will take pressure off the booking system 
 last week nhs suffolk and north east essex integrate care board announce plan to scrap the super surgery in north essex to say that my constituent be incandescent would be an understatement many of they have wait since for a replacement to close surgery in bramford claydon and great blakenham many have to use needham market surgery which be also await plan to move to large premise with increase capacity will the secretary of state meet i to discuss how we can expedite plan to expand primary care in north ipswich and the surround village 
 i thank the hon gentleman for set out a list of all the failure of the past year he be deal with that mess thank to member on the benches he sit on i strongly encourage his constituent to get actively involve in the year plan that we will launch there will be an important national engagement exercise on shift from hospital to community from sickness to prevention and from analogue to digital because give the total and utter chaos that we inherit we need systemic reform 
 i recently meet representative of martins oak and oldwood surgery in my constituency both surgery have ambitious plan to move to big premise so that they can see more   patient but they face numerous challenge include the gap between the lease length that the integrate care board will support and those that gp practice can get developer to sign up to there be other challenge that i be sure the minister can help unpick so will he meet i to see whether we can help bring those ambitious plan for new surgery to fruition 
 the hon gentleman have considerable expertise in this area give his background i would be happy to discuss that issue with he but i remind he that although there may well be specific issue there be a generic problem the total and utter failure to ensure investment reform and strategic thinking about our system 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 today i be publish the full finding of dr penny dash ’s review of the care quality commission her interim report make it clear that the cqc be not fit for purpose with few inspection be carry out urgent follow up be neglect and patient safety be put at risk today she make recommendation for improvement and i have make sure that the cqc have begin urgently put they into practice we be also publish a review of the cqc ’s deeply flawed single assessment framework today sir julian hartley will shortly begin as its new chief executive with my full support

 after the performance i have to put up with when the right hon lady be at the government dispatch box she have some brass neck complain at the opposition dispatch box that i be not answer   her question she will know that we be work at pace to stand up more appointment every week as our step as promise in our manifesto and we will deliver more than that we will go into the next election with a record of which the right hon lady can only dream 
 after year of opposition and a half of which the secretary of state spend on the front bench and travel around the world fund by other government to look at their healthcare system and more than day in government the right hon gentleman do not even know the start date of his own flagship policy he be no action man he be anchorman 
 let we deal with labour ’ cruel decision to slash winter fuel payment which will add pressure not only to patient but to the nhs the nhs ’s deputy chief operating officer 
 order i have get a lot of people to get in member on both front benches must be quick 
 after labour ’s cruel decision to slash winter fuel payment which will add pressure to the nhs its deputy chief operating officer warn that this winter our health service will not have the extra capacity or funding that it need which the conservatives have previously provide why have the secretary of state

 i call the liberal democrat health spokesperson 
 in england child have not see a dentist for at least a year meanwhile in shropshire telford and wrekin integrate health board £ of dental funding go unspent in the system be clearly break when can we expect the secretary of state to fix it 
 it be precisely because of the situation the hon member describe the poor service and ironically the underspend in the dentistry budget that we will work not only to stand up the urgent and emergency dental appointment we promise but to do the prevention work for child in our school 
 many people in my constituency be grateful that slough will soon be home to a £ community diagnostic centre which will help to reduce waiting list but many be also concerned that the local trust may be contract out service for mri scan do the minister agree that instead of just outsourcing local trust should whenever possible try to increase expertise and capacity in house 
 we be committed to expand community diagnostic capacity to build an nhs that be fit for the future however we be clear that independent sector provider have a role to play in support the nhs as trust partner to recover elective service 
 i welcome all effort to increase the number of gps throughout england resident in new and grow town such as wixams in mid bedfordshire need a gp surgery my local council have be tell that they need to put up the capital to deliver cause concern about cash flow and borrowing cost will the minister meet i to discuss a new capital investment programme to ensure that resident in new town such as wixams do not have to wait for developer contribution to get the service they need

 ingleside the only birth centre in the city of salford be temporarily close in amid an acute midwifery staffing deficit across greater manchester will the minister be kind enough to meet i to discuss what he can do to ensure that that unit reopen safely as soon as possible 
 my hon friend be right to raise the crisis of midwifery service we have already have debate in westminster hall about this and the issue affect the entire country it be a priority for this government and i be of course happy to meet she to discuss her constituency issue

 the royal stoke hospital be lead the way when it come to treatment for stroke patient but as with so many illness prevention be well than cure can the minister set out what this government be do to minimise the number of people affect by these life alter event 
 i agree with my hon friend which be why we have set a goal for few life be lose to cardiovascular disease we will make it easy for people to have check in the comfort of their own home through for example the digital nhs health check and the new workplace trial 
 labour ’s cut to the winter fuel payment will cause cold pensioner to seek nhs treatment accord    to the end fuel poverty coalition do the government agree with those figure and if not what be their own estimate 
 the decision on the winter fuel allowance be not that the government take lightly but we inherit a £ hole in the nation ’s finance we continue to stand behind vulnerable household by increase the state pension with the triple lock deliver the warm home discount and extend the household support fund to support the most vulnerable pensioner 
 prevention be the most important intervention to improve health outcome yet since the public health grant have fall in value by and by in york will the minister say what he be do to restore the value of the public health grant

 urgent question to ask the foreign secretary to make a statement on the situation in gaza and lebanon 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald   for raise this important question we be deeply concerned about the continue violence we must avoid this conflict spiral far out of control and into a wide regional war which be in no ’s interest 
 the uk be the g7 nation to call for an immediate ceasefire between lebanese hezbollah and israel and for the implementation of a political plan that will enable civilian on both side to return to their home the prime minister have speak with international leader include prime minister netanyahu king abdullah of jordan president macron and chancellor scholz to press the case for a ceasefire this build on extensive discussion by the foreign secretary and the prime minister at the united nations with regional leader 
 we be gravely concern to hear that un peacekeeper have be injure by the israel defence forces we reiterate that attack on un peacekeeper and un member of staff be unacceptable all party must take all necessary measure to protect all un personnel and premise and allow the un to fulfil its mandate the uk co sign a joint statement by united nations interim force in lebanon contribute country condemn recent attack call for such action to stop immediately and be adequately investigate 
 the situation in lebanon be worsen by the day civilian casualty be mount and more than of the lebanese population have be displace on humanitarian need in lebanon i announce £ of support to lebanon to respond to the widespread lack of shelter and reduce access to water hygiene and healthcare this be in addition to the £ that we have already provide to unicef 
 it be clear that a political solution consistent with resolution be the only way to restore the sovereignty territorial integrity and stability of lebanon this require an immediate ceasefire between lebanese hezbollah and israel now and immediate negotiation to re establish security and stability for the people live on either side of the israeli lebanon border 
 while the world turn its attention to lebanon we must not forget the situation for the people of gaza they be in a truly intolerable situation currently and winter will make they increasingly vulnerable include to communicable disease all of gaza ’s population now face the risk of famine access to basic service safe drinking water shelter and healthcare be become hard by the day 
 we be gravely concern by the situation in northern gaza in particular very little aid have enter northern gaza since   october evacuation order continue to be issue across northern gaza but civilian be struggle to move to safety and we be worried that the idf designate humanitarian zone be overcrowded and unsafe israel must comply with international humanitarian   law and allow unfettered aid access the message from this government be clear israel could and must do more to ensure that aid reach civilian in gaza it be unacceptable to restrict aid 
 we have not lose sight of the destabilising role of iran across the middle east through its support to militia include hezbollah hamas and the houthis iran must halt its attack on israel to that end we have place a number of sanction designation and i welcome the question 
 order the response should be for minute please can we try to stick to that i call andy mcdonald who will give we a fine example of a two- minute speech 
 i thank the minister as israel cut off northern gaza from essential supply it continue to strike palestinian civilian while demand their displacement the attack such as those on the al aqsa hospital in central gaza on sunday night show that there be nowhere safe to go the sight of a patient on an iv drip burn to death in the flame of an airstrike on the tent of refugee will be the abide image of this genocide the or so civilian leave without food or supply in northern gaza be increasingly subject to airstrike artillery and small arm fire from israeli force some child have be kill in gaza in a year that be classroom full of child every day for a single year in lebanon we see israeli strike kill civilian and now we hear that in addition to invasion of unifil post united nations interim force in lebanon position there be report of attack on unifil force of a chemical nature
