my hon friend make an excellent point she have be a long run champion of the steel sector and its importance to her constituent of course we want a smooth transition between blast furnace and electronic arc steel make technology steel remain incredibly important to the defence sector take the type almost of that be british steel that be tonne per ship that underline why it be so important that in constituency such as my hon friend ’s we continue to support the steel sector 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of uk arm sale to israel on a civilian death and b compliance with international humanitarian law in gaza 
 all export licence application be assess on a case by case basis against the strategic export licence criterion this government will not use any export licence to any destination where application be not consistent with the criterion 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer but since the horrendous hamas attack on   october innocent palestinian civilian have be kill and third be woman and child the un secretary general have describe gaza as a graveyard of child today an israeli airstrike on a united nations relief and works agency school have kill people the indonesian hospital in gaza be currently surround by israeli defence forces tank can the minister confirm whether arm sell by the uk have be use in violation of international humanitarian law and will he explain why arm sale to israel have not yet be suspend 
 the hon lady be right to describe as terrorism the horrendous and heinous attack by hamas without which this would not have start we call on all party the israelis include to ensure that they act within international humanitarian law it will interest she to know that our defence export to israel be relatively small just £ last year and as i mention in my initial answer they go through a very strict criterion before anything be export 
 what step he be take to encourage de escalation of the conflict in israel and gaza 
 we be work with partner across the wide region urge all side to de escalate tension facilitate the supply of humanitarian aid and tackle all form of extremism 
 we be all absolutely heartbroken—[interruption 
 order member must sit down again once another member be speak we can not have member on their foot at the same time 
 we be all heartbroken by what be happen in the middle east as israel work to root out hamas terrorist will my right hon friend work to ensure that aid get to civilian and that israel work in a way that be compatible with international law as the   government work to get hostage free will they also work for increasingly long humanitarian pause that can build towards a just and last peace 
 my hon friend be right about try to do everything we can in the region that be why i send a royal navy task group to try to de escalate tension include rfa lyme bay and rfa argus those facility along with other be do everything they can to help lower the tension and certainly act as deterrent and to ensure that we can get aid into the region he will be interested to hear that we have have tonne of aid deliver so far and there will be another flight later this month 
 there be thousand of orphan and displace family amid an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe what be the government do to ensure that unrestricted aid be reach all the people who desperately need it and importantly to ensure that israel lift the siege condition 
 as the hon lady will know we be in favour of see pause in the action some people i know call for a ceasefire but i would point out that there be a ceasefire on   october the problem be that it be break by hamas who work this carnage on the middle east we be do everything possible to help get that aid in with the royal navy taskforce infantry and other personnel in the region we now have an uplift of about personnel in the wide region who be all help to ensure that we get the aid in and across the border once we have get it to the region itself 
 i welcome the defence secretary to his place behind hamas sit iran behind iran sit russia and increasingly behind russia sit china that be the geopolitical backdrop that will define the next decade with grow authoritarianism impact on our security and our economy be it now time to increase the defence budget to 
 my right hon friend will know that we have indeed pledge to increase defence spending to as economic condition allow this year it will probably be around so we be make good progress prior to get this role i talk about my own desire to see high defence spending because we be live in a much less certain world with many more variable he be right to point out iran ’s action with hezbollah in lebanon syrian militia in iraq and houthis in yemen very much drive the situation 
 the reality be that neither the long term security of israel nor justice for the palestinians will be find through bomb and bullet as an international community we need to be do all we can to move to an endure cessation of the violence but while we be do that can the secretary of state say how the uk armed force will be utilise their capacity to help those get aid into gaza to get much big quantity in than be happen at the moment 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right about the uk ’s desire to do that and i have talk about how we have deploy a large increase in personnel   in the region to work with various government i have personally speak to most of the middle eastern government and on those call the thing they have do be welcome our deterrent and the fact that we have bring such a large amount of aid now £ to help the palestinians it be not just the hostage themselves who be be hold hostage the population of gaza be be hold hostage by hamas and therefore the solution be to deal with hamas themselves 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 after nearly month it be very good to finally welcome the defence secretary to the dispatch box for the time he reflect the deep concern about the humanitarian catastrophe in gaza and the risk of wide escalation labour totally condemn hamas terrorism we back israel ’s right to defend itself but require it to meet its duty under international law and lift the siege condition and we want to see the break in fighting extend to get much more aid in and the hostage out we back the military deployment to the region to support wide security but with attack against us personnel rise what action be the defence secretary take to increase protection for uk personnel in the middle east 
 mr speaker it be good to be at the dispatch box opposite the right hon gentleman i thank he as well as yourself and other for their condolence when i be not able to attend the defence question 
 in term of protect our own personnel i have ask the chief of the defence staff to review their position i make reference to the additional personnel who have move to the region but do not mention that several have be move to tel aviv beirut and jordan all with the aim of protect both british military personnel and british citizen in the region we keep that matter under constant review 
 would the defence secretary agree that over the past decade there have be an international failure to pursue a palestinian peace settlement and tackle the hamas threat middle east escalation risk be not mention in the government ’s defence command paper update nor be hamas or palestine with threat increase be the defence secretary pursue that defence plan in full include further deep cut to the british army 
 the right hon gentleman be right to say that nobody include the israelis see what hamas be about to do come that point to the need for much great surveillance but also much wide than that the need to pursue the state solution which be official british policy and be something that the world must do as this conflict we hope come to an end 
 the answer to the right hon gentleman ’s question about be able to deploy british troop and indeed asset be that when i ask the question the answer come back immediately yes we can do it and there be more that we could do should we need to i be satisfied that we cut our cloth in order to react to event around the world which of course come on top of what   we be do in kosovo and elsewhere we will certainly make sure that we maintain the resource to carry out those important mission 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of service accommodation for armed force personnel 
 what step he be take to improve service accommodation for armed force personnel 
 currently of the service family accommodation meet or exceed the government ’s decent home standard only those property should be allocate to service family the government continue to invest significant sum to improve the quality of uk service family accommodation the defence infrastructure organisation receive an investment of £ over this financial year and the next as part of the defence command paper refresh mean that the forecast £ for this year be more than double last year ’s investment in maintenance and improvement 
 the minister will be aware that this time last year almost home of armed force personnel be affect by black mould and damp which obviously include many property that have child in they a year on too many of our service personnel and their family still have this problem no matter whether it be house or house can the minister set out how he be go to tackle this problem quickly our armed force personnel and their family deserve well than what they have be get to date 
 the hon gentleman ask an excellent question we be aware that what happen last winter be not good enough too many home be affect particularly by damp and mould that be why we have prioritise get the investment in and it have more than double in the current financial year i be pleased to confirm to he that last week i set out our winter plan it show that home in the defence estate would benefit from significant work on damp and mould which be about of the total number that require that work 
 a constituent of mine who live in clive barrack at tern hill in shropshire have report that he live in rat infest accommodation sometimes with to soldier live in the same room as a result shipping container have be place in the ground about at the end of august and kitte out like budget hotel accommodation for those soldier to live in can the minister provide any reassurance that these servicemen will be provide with somewhere appropriate to live in the near future 
 i be obviously sorry to hear about that case i would ask the hon member to write to i with the detail and i will look into it with the dio the key thing be that wherever we be talk about whichever specific barrack or base if we be go to get on with the work we need the money there and we   have get that we have put in place the extra £ and as i set out in the winter plan thousand of force personnel will now benefit from that work 
 the dio be not fit for purpose and the future defence infrastructure services accommodation contract have be a disaster include completely unacceptable delay in issue and check gas and electricity safety certificate no private landlord would get away with this without be sue the secretary of state have a good run out at the defence committee last week and say he be potentially look at radical reform in this area can i urge the minister and his boss to do precisely that to honour our service personnel and their family in a way they be not be honour at present 
 i be very grateful to my right hon friend he know that i share his passion for see genuine step change improvement in our accommodation that be why we have announce the spending that we have on the performance of the contractor which the dio ultimately oversee of the important aspect of the winter plan be a significant increase in staff man the telephone service so that we see well service to personnel we expect the average waiting time for of those call to go from minute to second it will be very important to service personnel that when they make those call they get answer in good time 
 the minister may be aware that early this year of the accommodation block in hms collingwood in my gosport constituency be shut down all together because it just simply be not fit for human habitation there be also some issue with the accommodation block in hms sultan could i invite the minister to come to gosport to have a look at some of the accommodation on offer for our service personnel it be simply not good enough and they deserve well 
 i would be more than happy to do so 
 i call the shadow minister 
 there be a new defence secretary but it be the same old story in service accommodation with report of broken boiler black mould leaky roof and painfully long wait for repair last christmas service family tell i that they go without a working boiler for week and be force to live in a hotel over christmas and new year can the minister assure i that no who serve our country in uniform will go without heating or be force out of their home this winter because of the dire state of their military accommodation 
 i be grateful to the hon member and i repeat the point we recognise that performance be not good enough last winter which be why the secretary of state make it an absolute priority to get the extra investment in have do that i be pleased to say that the winter plan do include boiler and heating upgrade for about home 
 what discussion he have have with his us counterpart on increase awareness of a non combat incident and b jurisdictional constraint affect the armed force 
 defence ministers have close relationship with our us colleague and discuss such issue on a case by case basis 
 i thank the minister for his answer it be fast approach the anniversary of captain dean sprouting be kill in a road traffic accident in while on operational duty by us servicemen the us guardsman do not adhere to any standard operation procedure or health and safety regulation drive unsuitable and poorly maintain vehicle on an unnecessary journey captain sprouting ’s death be both avoidable and preventable and it would not have occur have the us servicemen involve adhere to the regulation despite the continuous effort of his widow linda for the ministry of defence to highlight the complicated jurisdictional procedure involve in blue on blue incident linda and her boy continue to suffer the consequence on a daily basis what i would like to ask the minister be give that the defence minister in the lords 
 order i think the minister must have get the gist by now and be able to answer with something interruption just to help   the hon member for falkirk john mc nally i have to try to get through a list of what be mean to be question i give he a long time to ask a question and it be not forthcoming if i do not do this i will not get through the other people who wish to ask question 
 the hon gentleman raise a very complicated case and the widow to whom i send my condolence be obviously keen to see the matter resolve i suggest that the hon gentleman and i meet to discuss the issue in appropriate detail 
 i be happy to look at an adjournment debate if that help but we have to have short question to get other people in 
 what step he be take to support veteran 
 what step his department be take to support veteran 
 the ministry of defence deliver a range of service to veteran and their family include the administration and payment of armed force pension and compensation and tailor advice and assistance through the veterans welfare service defence transition services and integrate personal commissioning for veteran 
 when veteran and their family be compensate for the detrimental impact their service have have on their life that be unjustly class as income when apply for mean test benefit render veteran and their family ineligible for welfare support under uk government control the most significant of which be pension credit as a result thousand of veteran miss out on almost £ every year will the minister pledge his support for the royal british legion ’s credit their service campaign and will he work with the department for work and pensions and his other cabinet colleague to ensure that compensation award to veteran be disregard when apply for mean test benefit 
 of course the mod work with the dwp on a range of issue compensation be set in the full knowledge of how it will be deal with under the benefit system in the uk by most measure the armed force compensation scheme and the war pension scheme be feel to be sound and appropriate for award significant amount of money to those who have serve our country and who unfortunately have be disadvantage as a result 
 will my right hon friend join i in thank the veterans charity in north devon for their poppies to paddington operation which see wreath from the great western railway region reach paddington for remembrance day and for their incredible work to help support our wonderful veteran across the uk 
 i absolutely will and i add my congratulation to my hon friend ’s in thank the veterans charity in north devon i also congratulate she on the extraordinary support she give to our veteran in her constituency and elsewhere particularly as we come out of the season of remembrance which i know you be heavily involve with too mr speaker it be important to reflect on those who give so much in the service of our country 
 i call the shadow minister 
 over the past year the number of veteran claim universal credit have increase by which be nearly a do the minister recognise that the king ’s speech fail to help veteran in receipt of universal credit to cope with the increase cost of living cause by his government ’s economic failure and do he far recognise that some of the long term sick who his party have be attack in the medium over the last few day be veteran with physical and mental health challenge what advice have he give his colleague about the conservative party rhetoric and about lend their full support to our veteran and all those who have serve 
 the hon gentleman will know that universal credit be an in work benefit within the system there be allowance that we offer to our veteran that can be improve as he know that be why we have institute the quinquennial review and the independent review of veteran welfare service which we will be respond to shortly 
 if he will make an estimate of the annual maintenance and run cost of the trident nuclear programme 
 the ministry of defence co ordinate a range of interdependent programme to support maintain and renew the nuclear deterrent the expect cost of the combine defence nuclear enterprise will be set out at supplementary estimate in february 
 the estimate cost of trident ’s renewal stand at the moment at £ with a furth £ earmark for contingency we know that containment of nuclear material be a problem for the ministry of defence and we also know from recent report that a vanguard class submarine nearly have a collision over the weekend our party put in a freedom of information request ask about transportation of nuclear material through scotland and that be rebuff the uk government may be content to play fiddle to the us on weapon of mass destruction but can the secretary of state explain the lack of transparency on wmd movement in scotland and justify scotland ’s be keep in the dark be it not time to abandon this costly and dangerous bomb and get it out of scotland for good 
 order let we help each other to get through the list please 
 i profoundly disagree about this be the time to abandon the deterrent i could not think of a bad time the policy of the hon gentleman ’s party be not just to abandon the deterrent but to withdraw from nato i could not think of a more reckless policy to undertake in the face of russian aggression we support the deterrent and we will continue to invest in it 
 do the minister share my relief that both main party in the house of commons support the retention and renewal of the nuclear deterrent do he also share my relief that in july when the vote be hold on whether to renew the nuclear deterrent there be a massive majority of in favour of do that that send a message to the scottish nationalist about how unrepresentative their view be 
 i be extremely grateful to my right hon friend for that remark i be delighted that those on the labour front bench show their agreement by nod when i give my previous answer i be delighted that there be consensus i think we all agree that particularly at this time the country need the security of a deterrent to deter what would be the most aggressive threat to our nation ’s freedom 
 i welcome the shadow minister to her place 
 may i confirm again that labour ’s support for our nuclear deterrent which we maintain on behalf of our nato ally be total however follow report in newspaper   about a malfunction depth gauge on a vanguard submarine at sea can the minister explain what step he have take to ensure that such an incident never happen again 
 i be delighted to hear confirmation of labour ’s total support for the deterrent that send a very powerful message to our adversary about our national endeavour to support the deterrent and its renewal on the specific story that the hon lady mention she will not be surprised to hear that we do not comment on operational matter in respect of our submarine 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 this will break the convention 
 let i also welcome the secretary of state to their position the nuclear enterprise have an uncapped budget and after the demise of hs2 be the large single public procurement project on these island for those of we on the snp benches at least that be money spend on a weapon system that be design never to be use which not only bleed money from the conventional mod budget but suck it from hospital school and social care on a day when the preview of the autumn statement in the financial times read 
 stagnation nation govern the uk when there be no money 
 can the minister advise the house what step his department be take to ensure that there be no further cut to conventional force or elsewhere because of the uncapped runaway trident budget 
 the hon gentleman talk about budget and cost i can be open about the figure that matter that be the combined death toll in the and world war we have not have a world war and we be profoundly lucky and i put it to the house that it be not a coincidence 
 we know from the official history of the submarine service by peter hennessy and james jinks that during the transition to vanguard contingency be make in whitehall for the possible alteration of the continuous at sea deterrent to take account of the complete breakdown of or more hull this involve dive a polaris submarine into loch long to remain there on a quick reaction alert can the minister advise the house on what discussion his department be have on the contingency that we now see arise from an almost year old vanguard fleet 
 the hon gentleman too will not be surprised to hear that we will not comment on that other than to say that we have have a continuous at sea deterrent since we should all be proud of that and i be delighted to see that member on both side of the house who support our union also support the nuclear deterrent 
 what step he be take to increase the number of raf aid flight to the middle east 
 what step he be take to increase the number of raf aid flight to the middle east 
 defence asset continue to be ready to supply humanitarian support to the region as the hon gentleman know the delivery of aid be impede by the many challenge around gaza but so far we have airlift tonne of aid to the country 
 as i have say previously i want to see an end to the violence in the middle east although i acknowledge that neither israel nor hamas agree to an immediate ceasefire while negotiation to deliver an endure peace be ongoing we must urgently accelerate the delivery of aid via the raf to alleviate human suffering on the ground can the secretary of state explain why within week of the earthquake in turkey and syria nearly tonne of aid be deliver there yet since the israel hamas war break out more than a month ago only tonne have be deliver by the raf 
 i can the difference be a war zone when i say that we have deliver to the country i mean of course to egypt from there we have to get the aid across the rafah crossing which for all the reason of complexity be not always open or available there be many restriction to get that aid in but i be work very hard on that the problem be not a lack of resource we have put in £ more than double the exist £ and i can assure the hon gentleman that there be further flight leave later this month 
 for more than a month we have witness a distressing humanitarian disaster unfolding in gaza it be welcome that the raf be fly uk humanitarian aid to the region but so far we have see only raf flight when will the government increase the number of flight and the amount of aid give to palestinians who have suffer so much and who deserve at the very least the basic essential to try to survive 
 the issue be not get the aid to the region we could fly more aircraft the issue be get the aid into gaza itself and in that regard we have the problem of hamas a terrorist organisation not in the least bit interested in look after the citizen of gaza and of course the problem of the rafah crossing which be open and close on a fairly arbitrary basis however i can assure the hon lady that we be work very hard with all the different body and government in the region to get more of that aid in as quickly as possible the capacity constraint be not fly it to the region 
 what step he be take to support afghan citizen who be eligible for the afghan relocation and assistance policy 
 some eligible person and their family be now in the uk under the arap scheme we be determine   to deliver on our commitment with many hundred more arrival in the uk plan before the end of the year 
 in the light of pakistan ’s brutal crackdown on undocumented and temporary visa bear afghan refugee and its forcible deportation of those people back to afghanistan can the minister confirm the security of those eligible for the afghan citizen resettlement and arap scheme in pakistan include many whose claim have be unprocessed for year can he expedite those claim to stop people be throw back into the clutch of the taliban 
 may i gently encourage member on both side of the house to change their tone when describe the government of pakistan in relation to these matter we would not have bring out thousand of people have it not be for the support of the government of pakistan and we continue to enjoy their support and co operation in our effort to bring out many thousand more as the hon lady well know because it have be well cover in the medium the government of pakistan have seek to accelerate the deportation of those whom they consider to be there illegally but our excellent team in the high commission in islamabad be work day and night with the government of pakistan to ensure that that do not happen to those who be in pakistan under arap and acr we be move at our good pace to bring people back with the full co operation of the government of pakistan 
 what step his department be take to provide military support to the ukrainian armed force 
 we continue to support ukraine we provide £ of military support in the last year and will go on do so because putin must not win in ukraine 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer and for the consistency of support the british government have show and the way they have lead our nato ally in support of the ukrainians right from the start how be we go to maintain that lead in the face of another war in the middle east a certain amount of disarray in the congress and indeed some visible wavering among our european ally 
 my right hon friend be right that the uk have lead and we must continue to do so i have visit ukraine twice this year i host a ukrainian family for a year in my own home and the government have set up the british lead international fund for ukraine which be on its way to deliver i think nearly £ of support we have also be with tank with ammunition with long range missile and with permission and we intend to be with this war go forward 
 it be vital that we continue to give military aid to ukraine and to show our steadfast support and leadership in europe have the secretary of state have a chance since he come into office to meet with representative of the defence industry to talk   about how we maintain that level of military aid to ukraine and if he have have such a meeting what be the outcome 
 yes on several occasion include in kyiv and more recently last thursday at the mod where i meet with large medium and small defence company to discuss exactly that issue there be a whole range of measure in place to increase the amount of arm particularly arm replenishment that can come through via uk company have support ukraine from the beginning we must support they all the way through to the end and we intend to do so 
 what step his department be take to ensure that the armed force have the skill require for the future 
 what step his department be take to ensure that the armed force have the skill require for the future 
 in june the ministry of defence publish the haythornthwaite review of armed force incentivisation multiple team be be stand up across defence to implement all recommendation work to establish a reward and incentivisation architecture that will attract and retain skill meanwhile i be delighted to say that the army have just be name the uk ’s no employer of apprentice for the consecutive year 
 i be aware that the mod be the big single employer of apprentice with more than soldier currently on the programme and i have see the excellent training and development that take place at the army foundation college which as my right hon friend know be locate in harrogate do he agree that the apprenticeship scheme be not only bring in future talent but ensure that those individual have the skill for the remainder of their life 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and i enjoy my relatively recent visit to harrogate more than of all non commission recruit across the armed force be offer apprenticeship map to their training as he rightly say that benefit not only defence but the individual and the wide economy 
 give that the defence of our united kingdom be reserve and education and skill be devolve what discussion be my right hon friend have with the devolved administration to ensure that the skill need by our british armed force be be develop across our whole united kingdom 
 the ministry of defence actively engage with the devolved administrations to align education skill and development and will continue to do so use the uk wide pan defence skill framework which ensure that the armed force skill requirement be meet across the country and contribute to the wide economy that we share 
 i thank the minister for that response beyond the battlefield an independent charity in my constituency do incredible work with veteran who be homeless give they accommodation and some skill i have extend an invitation to the minister to come to northern ireland to visit beyond the battlefield so i will extend that again i think he will be impress i know i be and he will see that what we do in northern ireland can be do elsewhere in the united kingdom 
 it be always a joy to visit strangford of the most beautiful place in these island if i may say so i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s invitation i have it at the front of my mind and when i be in northern ireland i will ensure that i visit 
 what step his department be take to recruit armed force personnel 
 we remain committed to maintain the overall size of the armed force and recognise the importance of recruitment to achieve that we be respond to immediate challenge with a programme aim at increase the breath of potential candidate and drive efficiency in recruitment meanwhile the service continue to meet all their operational commitment keep the country and its interest safe 
 since my election i have meet many new recruit during visit with the armed force parliamentary scheme and i have always be incredibly impress by their sense of duty their commitment to serve their country and their recognition of the great career that lie before they but we know that there be still shortage in recruitment how can my right hon friend ensure that all part of the armed force recruit the right number of people with the right mix of skill and experience to keep our nation safe in these increasingly dangerous time 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that recruitment to the armed force be mixed some of it be good some of it less good across the western world we be struggle to recruit people into our armed force and we must redouble our effort that be why we have have the haythornthwaite review and the tri service recruitment model which i be convince will plug the gap that we have in skill and overall number 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of the operational mgs employment contract on application for promotion in the ministry of defence guard service 
 there be no evidence—[interruption 
 order look i do not need member make signal to i on take question it be quite obvious that i go from the government side to the opposition side 
 there be no evidence that the operational mod guard service employment contract have have a material bearing on workflow recruitment and retention however it be not possible to conduct an accurate assessment of the impact that omec have have on application from staff seek promotion because of the way application be file that say the mod guard service be encourage by the volume of application receive for vacancy through fair and open competition no doubt encourage by the fact that omec term and condition of service remain highly favourable when compare with private sector security company 
 i thank the minister for his response but respectfully i do not find it sufficient my constituent have provide more than a decade ’s service within the ministry of defence guard service he report that he and his contemporary be disincentivise to apply for promotion because it would mean switch to the new omec contract from their legacy contract and an extra hour work a week many be leave will the minister promise to investigate this issue thoroughly 
 i be grateful to the hon lady the new way of work be pass through the trade union consultation process of course and in term of pay pension leave and sickness benefit and working hour the mod guard service perform well as i have say against private security company that be why we appear to be recruit and retain well 
 what step his department be take to help ensure stability in the indo pacific region 
 the tempo of our engagement and operation in the indo pacific grow all the time on land sea and air we be also strengthen regional resilience among our partner to uphold freedom of navigation deter security threat and build support for international law throughout the indo pacific 
 i agree that relationship with several south east asian state have reach new high as a result of partnership in area such as space and cyber as well as air and maritime capability do my right hon friend agree that we should do more to ensure that the united nations convention on the law of the sea be maintain in the south china sea work closely with our partner in the region 
 my hon friend hide his light under a bushel because as a trade envoy in the region he will have have much to do with the improved relationship we enjoy there furthermore hms spey transit the straits of malacca only this weekend demonstrate the uk ’s and the royal navy ’s commitment to uphold freedom of navigation in the south china sea and around 
 do the minister believe the appointment of lord cameron as foreign secretary strengthen or weaken the prime minister ’s stance that china pose an epoch define challenge to global security 
 it greatly strengthen the prime minister ’s position 
 what step his department be take to help support the medium sized helicopter industry in the south west 
 helicopter form an important part of our integrate operating concept through past and current investment in rotary capability the uk industrial base remain well place to support exist and future helicopter platform positive progress be be make towards the next stage of the competition with the downselected supplier airbus helicopters uk leonardo helicopters uk and lockheed martin uk 
 can my hon friend confirm that the invitation to negotiate for the medium sized helicopter will indeed be issue by the end of december 
 i be grateful to my hon friend we be keen to get on with this and that be certainly our intention at the moment we be in the process of secure final cross government approval as i say that be our aim but i can not absolutely guarantee it 
 what step his department be take to support defence job across the uk 
 the most recent estimate show that mod investment support more than job in industry across the uk and continue investment in defence along with the change we continue to make as part of our defence and security industrial strategy be contribute to further economic growth and prosperity across the union 
 i thank the minister for his answer as a member from north east wales i be interested in how we promote defence spending in all region of the united kingdom mean that there be some balance with defence job and investment not concentrate in the same part of england every time what can the minister do to assure my constituent in delyn that they will have as much opportunity as those in place such as the south west of england 
 my hon friend make an excellent point obviously we strongly want to see defence expenditure benefit every part of the union i can confirm expenditure with industry in wales amount to about £ just to reassure he and show he how importantly we regard wales the week before last i hear i hold my small and medium sized enterprise   forum in cardiff at space forge a brilliant welsh sme that we be support with half a pound of funding to develop in space manufacturing of semiconductor that be a strong example of how we be support welsh sme in the defence sector 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of raf surveillance aircraft on uk strategy and operation overseas 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise the work of the slightly less glamorous part of the royal air force that do long distance surveillance mission they be an important part of the uk ’s defence strategy and our ability to monitor and observe what our adversary be do their work over the past year above the north atlantic and the high north the baltic the black sea the eastern mediterranean and across the middle east have be central to defence operation the team at raf waddington and at lossiemouth should be congratulate 
 we understand that uk surveillance asset such as rivet joint be provide surveillance support to israel i appreciate that for reason of operational security the minister can not comment on the operational specific of this activity but will he rule out the possibility that these platform be be use to support target acquisition 
 while i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his initial question he also give i an opportunity to make an important clarification rivet joint be not fly in support of israel it be fly to observe the risk of escalation in the region to inform decision making in the uk mod and for nothing else 
 be my right hon friend concern about the volcanic activity in iceland at the moment the p-8 regularly use keflavik airport near reykjavik could that be interrupt by the threaten volcanic activity 
 to the relief of people everywhere hop for a christmas getaway i be tell that this particular volcanic ash be not the same as that of last time and thus do not pose such a threat to aviation however we be of course monitor it carefully and have contingency 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 my month as defence secretary have strengthen my long hold belief that we need to strengthen our national defence as the world grow ever more dangerous with the challenge in ukraine the middle east and the indo pacific these be more contest time than any since the cold war the serviceman and woman of our   armed force be our great asset as have be mention as we ask they to do extraordinarily difficult thing around the world and they do deserve comfort back home that be why i have put service accommodation at the forefront of my mission 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer will he add his thank to volunteer such as trevor simcock mal mullet and chris smith who work with the commonwealth war graves commission locally in stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke ahead of the armistice weekend i be proud to join they at burslem cemetery with my daughter amelia to clean the headstone of of our brave and fallen hero will he add his thank and come to visit those great volunteer

 i commend the hon gentleman for raise this important matter for his constituency and i be pleased to work with he on what we offer his service personnel i have say that last winter be not good enough but this year we be ramp up massively we have at time withhold profit from contractor where they have not perform but what i want to see from they above all be delivery we have put in place the £ and i now want to see that deliver as improvement to house include work be do on boiler and on damp and mould thousand of home will be support this winter and hopefully we will be in a far well position 
 do my right hon friend agree that we be more secure as a country when the world be a safe and more peaceful place and that a successful state solution for the israel and palestine question be therefore a part of our own national security too 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about that the way that we can start along that path be that hamas could release the innocent civilian that they be hold hostage which include some brit that would open the door to start to be able to get a resolution that be what they should do but sadly i doubt that they be about to

 will the minister confirm that the ministry would never put serve personnel at risk by put an open camp for illegal migrant in a serve base and therefore any undertaking about that be worthless that the most we will get at raf catterick be a closed detention centre

 i be grateful to the hon gentleman and i be see a bilateral committee with veteran and the nepalese ambassador on wednesday this be an ongoing process the hon gentleman will be aware that pension scheme be extremely complicated and in many case the gurkha pension scheme and offer to transfer subsequently represent good value for many of our brave gurkha veteran i be certainly in discussion with the interested party i be afraid that i can not offer any promise at all but nevertheless discussion be ongoing

 we must ensure that putin do not win we must co operate and help with the reconstruction of ukraine be it not time that we start seize russian state asset to help pay for the reconstruction of ukraine 
 a long time ago when the war start i be transport secretary we seize quite a lot of yacht and aircraft which have still not be release to ensure that they do not benefit from their closeness to putin the hon gentleman be right that over time we must keep crank up the different way by which we ensure that money be not flow to that regime and we will continue to keep that under review 
 i believe that the ability to make virgin steel be crucial to the uk ’s defence capability do my right hon friend the secretary of state agree 
 my hon friend make an excellent point she have be a long run champion of the steel sector and its importance to her constituent of course we want a smooth transition between blast furnace and electronic arc steel make technology steel remain incredibly important to the defence sector take the type almost of that be british steel that be tonne per ship that underline why it be so important that in constituency such as my hon friend ’s we continue to support the steel sector.[official report   november vol c. 6mc 
 the secretary of state and his predecessor rightly call out the wanton and unlawful destruction of civilian infrastructure in ukraine home hospital and school why can they not show equal uproar at what be happen to civilian in gaza 
 there be a principle in international law that a country can defend itself ukraine be attack for absolutely no reason whatsoever while we call on israel both privately and publicly to protect civilian in whatever way it can hamas be use civilian as human shield and deliberately use the infrastructure on top of they to hide behind i would have think that the hon gentleman could see the difference 
 do the secretary of state agree that it be vital that his counterpart in the us administration realise that if putin do not lose in ukraine the peace and security of the whole of europe be call into question so it be in their short and medium term interest to make sure that putin be see to fail 
 my right hon friend be characteristically correct about this but i would widen that point we be talk about the security of not just europe but the indo pacific and indeed the entire world putin must not win 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement on level up this government be commit to level up and create opportunity across all region and nation of the uk last year we set out our levelling up mission in the levelling up white paper all principally aim at tackle regional inequality because we believe that people ’s opportunity should be the same wherever they live be it in a city or town on an island or in a rural or coastal community i be proud to say that since this conservative government have commit over £ of local growth funding to level up through the levelling up fund the town deal the uk share prosperity fund the future high street fund and much more we be regenerate town centre and high street improve local transport fund heritage asset and boost productivity job and living standard 
 our recently announce long term plan for town be provide long term investment for town and the money be to be spend on local people ’s priority we have launch our investment zone programme investment zone across the uk will grow key industry of the future and increase job that include west yorkshire ’s investment zone announce early today which will focus on life science 
 we have also make excellent progress on freeport all freeport in england be now open for business and we have announce a further in wales and scotland as levelling up minister i have be lucky enough to see at hand how we be use this transformative funding to unlock the potential of local economy and improve the everyday life of people across the uk we recognise the good that this funding can do so we have embark on an ambitious plan to simplify the funding landscape for local authority lead by my right hon friend the secretary of state 
 our simplification plan describe how this government will deliver our levelling up white paper ’s commitment to streamline fund in phase of reform there will be an immediate simplification of exist fund secondly we will establish a funding simplification doctrine by which central government will abide finally we will implement further reform at the next spending review we have already deliver much of the phase for instance we have give local authority great freedom to adjust their town deal future high street and levelling up fund project we have also invite local authority to become part of the fund simplification pathfinder pilot which will give they great flexibility to move money between different fund by increase local flexibility we will reduce bureaucracy and inefficiency within the delivery process 
 the phase of our funding simplification plan will see the government launch a new funding simplification doctrine which will change how central government give funding to local authority it be clear that funding competition can drive value for money and help identify the good project for certain programme so we will continue to deploy competition where they make   sense but we also recognise that bidding into multiple competition especially in parallel can place a dispro-    portionate burden on local authority the new government doctrine will therefore ensure that we consider fully the impact on local authority when design new fund finally we have commit to further reform at the next spending review include give our trailblazer mayoral combined authority in greater manchester and the west midland single department style multi year settlement 
 of course our work to give local authority the right lever to spend funding efficiently be only part of the picture of equal importance be the funding itself as i mention early since we have make more than £ available to local place as part of that across round and of the levelling up fund we commit £ to project across the country we have listen to feedback from the round of the fund and my right hon friend the secretary of state announce in july that we would take a new approach to round as a result we decide not to run another competition for this round instead we have draw on the impressive pool of bid that we be not initially able to fund through round 
 today i be delighted to confirm the allocation of the levelling up fund ’s and final round we be invest £ in project across england scotland and wales copy of the successful allocation have be make available in the vote office the sheer number of high quality bid be testament to the enthusiasm for level up across our country and the hard work of so many hon member in support their local area to develop strong plan for renewal from chorley mr speaker to elgin and from doncaster to rhyl these local infrastructure project will restore pride in place and improve everyday life for local people 
 we have target funding at the place most in need as identify through our levelling up need metric we have also ensure a fair geographic spread across great britain include £ across project in scotland and £ across project in wales that mean that across all round we have invest more than £ in scotland wales and northern ireland exceed our original funding commitment it also mean that across all round of the fund the north east and the north west will have receive more per capita than any other region in england they be follow closely by the east midland and by yorkshire and the humber 
 our round investment double down on of our key levelling up mission pride in place and improve transport but we also recognise the key role that culture play in level up we invest £ on project with a cultural component in round and and as part of this round we be set aside a furth £ for culture project to be announce in due course 
 we want to get delivery happen quickly we will work closely with local authority to confirm that their project remain viable and we will provide ongoing support to ensure that local place be able to deliver we be commit to give local area the funding and power they need to deliver transformative change within their community we have commit more than £ of local growth funding for community the length and breadth of our country we have invest in pride in place and reverse decade of decline we be take long term decision for a bright future for our country i commend this statement to the house 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement i start by congratulate all those area that have be successful in their bid include chorley mr speaker commiseration to all those area that have miss out once again although the truth be that even the area that have win will find that this money be a drop in the ocean compare with the £ cut from local government funding since only week ago there be report that council face a £ shortfall in their budget for this year alone how do today ’s announcement help they face that existential threat 
 at least the government appear to have finally accept that local authority be force to spend disproportionate sum in previous round to get bid prepare although we appear to have lurch from extreme to the other this time council have not be involve in any dialogue on the bid and be possibly not even aware that their bid be be consider will the minister tell we what discussion have take place with local authority before decision be make give that the proposal be approach be a couple of year old what assurance will he give we that they still reflect local priority 
 the government ’s methodology note say the department cap bid for regeneration project outside priority area by local authority and region do any project that meet the department ’s threshold not get fund for that reason and which one be they 
 please do tell we what on earth be mean by a funding simplification doctrine”—is it an elaborate way of say sorry do it apply to all government spending decision or just to this department because it have so patently fail to get a grip on spending that it have to have its own doctrine be it be do to address the concern of the national audit office and the public accounts committee that billion of pound be be waste because the department have engage in a programme without any understanding of its impact as the ippr north say level up have be a 
 litany of miss deadline move goalpost and dysfunction 
 although to be fair it could have be talk about any government project when it say that 
 do the minister accept that the new approach announce today mean that the concern level against the department be in fact valid with this late iteration how do the minister expect anyone to keep up with what this government want when they flit around so much the prime minister announce new priority this morning be the project select in line with those priority or will they all be change again to reflect this week ’s prime ministerial thinkin 
 of course where do this leave the hundred of project that still have not be successful there be no mention of any future round in the statement in fact i think the minister say that this be the final round of bidding so where do that leave all the place that have be unsuccessful so far what be the plan to address those community that be crumble and those high street that be empty be this the end of any hope of level up for they 
 even in those area that have attract funding we know that these crumb from the table be not enough to reverse year of neglect street that be once   burst with pride be shut down rent be rise mortgage be soar and insecurity be still bake into the workplace tackle those thing would be genuine levelling up and labour believe in give those community the power resource and flexibility to tackle such issue in the way they think well that be a true way of allow people to take back control 
 the statement offer no path ahead to deal with those issue it just rearrange the deckchair of what have go before we have be leave with a fail experiment an illusion that last as long as the press release it have not go unnoticed that the number of conservative mp stand down at the next election have go past they know that after year of stagnation they do not have a record to defend they be not level up they be give up 
 the hon gentleman misjudge the mood of the house he talk about local government finance last year we give local authority an uplift of more than £ he ask whether any project be ax by the methodology that we use no they be not as i say we set out the methodology online and i will ensure that there be a copy in the house of commons library 
 the hon gentleman ask what conversation there be with local authority ahead of any announcement we have area team on the ground in all local authority area which confirm with council that project be still a priority they also confirm with council whether project could still be deliver by the deadline no project be identify through those conversation that do not qualify this time around 
 far to that the hon gentleman ask about funding simplification and why we be embark on that he mention the nao ’s concern some of its concern be legitimate but we look at its report and many of the figure date from march we have spend £ on local place since march we announce the funding simplification plan in july in response to the commitment we make in the levelling up white paper to simplify the funding landscape 
 finally the hon gentleman describe £ of levelling up funding as crumb that say it all about the labour party it do not recognise the value of anything we be invest £ in local priority and labour describe that as crumb i leave it to the house to determine what it think of that 
 i be well accustomed in this place to rejection and after round and of the levelling up fund it be disappointing not to see brixham and paignton recognise however i be delighted today to see that brixham harbour and the epic centre in torbay business park have be recognise with £ of support which will make a huge difference can the minister reassure i that that money will come in good time and good order so that we have the ability to deliver as quickly as possible in our coastal community 
 absolutely we be delighted to be fund high tech fish and chip in brixham this announcement come on top of additional funding pot that we have be able to give torbay include the levelling up partnership on which i be work well with my hon friend the members for totnes anthony mangnall   and for torbay kevin foster the funding will come in due course and we will work with local authority to ensure that they can still deliver the project on time and to plan 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 some members may have an advantage on i in that they have see the detail of the allocation which i have be hand just this so i will give a completely constituency neutral response to the minister ’s statement 
 however hard the tories try to hide the truth the fact be that these day the word most people will apply before britain be break most people support genuine levelling up who could argue with it?—but when the prime minister ’s constituency get more than the whole of glasgow last time around and when most people think their high street be get bad rather than well we have to ask what the real agenda be 
 will the minister confirm how much of the money he boast have be commit since have actually be spend how do it compare to the overspend on hs2 for example 
 the scottish government have decade of experience scottish government of various political persuasion by the way in successfully allocate eu funding for example in true partnership with local authority what discussion do the uk government have with the scottish government give their statutory role in culture and transport and their role in pride in place before he make today ’s announcement what discussion do they have with the convention of scottish local authorities to get a consensus view on what scottish local authority need or be this decision just be make by somebody in a ministerial office in whitehall who be as out of touch with scotland today as they will be out of office next year 
 the hon gentleman describe be out of touch with scotland he also mention glasgow i should tell he that glasgow have receive £ in this round so i suggest that it be he who be out of touch with scotland the government have a responsibility to all people business and community across the whole united kingdom across all round of the fund as i mention in my statement we have invest £ of levelling up funding in local authority in scotland wales and northern ireland the hon gentleman should consider his argument it seem somewhat bizarre that he be frustrate at the funding that we be spend in scotland he should focus on what the cash be deliver rather than on who be deliver it 
 i be thrilled that the department for levelling up housing and communities have fund the green innovation corridor in my constituency the government have invest ten on ten of million of pound in wolverhampton which be desperately need however speed of delivery be an issue will the minister meet i to discuss how the council can be encourage to deliver the project quickly 
 i commit to meet my hon friend to discuss that matter she be a fantastic champion for her constituent in wolverhampton which be a key place where we be see level up in action include the relocation of dluhc ’s office to wolverhampton i be   pleased that we have be able to fund my hon friend ’s project in this round and i be delighted to be work with she on it 
 i call the chairman of the select committee 
 the minister have say a lot about input but what be important in the end be output and the change that be make will the minister say which indicator have show a reduction in inequality between the south east and the north since this funding begin and in particular whether the productivity gap have reduce at all 
 finally i be surprised there be no mention of the trailblazer project in manchester and birmingham and their roll out to the other mayoral combine authority i understand that they will be roll out but with reduced power for the rest of the combined authority will the minister tell we exactly what the situation be please do not ask we to wait for wednesday ’s statement i read about it in the financial times on saturday and if the financial times can be tell on saturday i be sure this house can be tell today 
 i be very grateful to the chair of the select committee as i say in my statement across all round of the fund the north east and the north west have receive more per capita than any other region in england he ask about the specific on productivity improvement and so on and i will write to he and his committee about that regard the trailblazer deal i have not read the piece in the financial times but i will do so as soon as the statement be finish i would encourage he to wait until wednesday 
 the mid cornwall metro be a levelling up infrastructure project to upgrade railway connectivity across cornwall it will bring huge benefit both economically and socially i be pleased to hear the minister say that the government be keen to get on with deliver the project i ask he to use his office to work with the department for transport the treasury and cornwall council to get the final business case over the line and the funding release so that we can get on with the project 
 absolutely there be few great champion for cornwall in this house than my hon friend and i shall work with he to ensure that the business case be sign off as soon as possible and that we be able to see level up in cornwall i be delighted that i will be visit cornwall in the very near future to sign a devolution deal 
 i be not sure whether the minister live in some parallel universe but he come to the dispatch box today to talk about the simplification of the process a process that both he and the secretary of state have be implement as though it be nothing to do with they 
 county durham have successful bid in the round which happen to be in bishop auckland surprise surprise the constituency of the former levelling up minister in round durham county council be ask to put in bid and spend hundred of thousand of pound of taxpayer money do so once the bid be in it be tell that they would not be consider because it have have a successful in round will the   minister compensate durham county council for the money it have waste not through its own inefficiency but because he seem to chip chop and change the rule when he like 
 the right hon member talk about the process that be own by my department as i say we be embark on this ambitious funding simplification agenda purely on the basis of some of the point that he have raise local authority member of this house and the select committee be concern about the number of competition that be involve in various government fund we be address that through our funding simplification doctrine 
 the right hon gentleman talk about durham i simply say to he that the international territorial level region for the tees valley in durham have receive project across the round of the levelling up fund that equate to £ per capita in the region which be of the high amount i would ask he to welcome that 
 bolton be open its new £ institute of medical sciences which follow an early £ levelling up fund investment will my hon friend confirm that the late £ of funding for bolton town centre for which i be very grateful be not the end of his commitment to the people of bolton 
 it could not be the end of the levelling up commitment in bolton because of the effort of my hon friend who work so hard for his constituent i be delighted that bolton be receive money in this round and i will work with he to ensure that level up continue in his part of the world 
 in his statement the minister refer to scotland wales northern ireland the north east the north west the east midland and yorkshire and the humber there be no mention of the south west how can this conservative government claim that they want to level up community when conservative run devon county council can not even level up the pothole 
 i be delighted to confirm for the hon member that the south west region have receive project across the round of the levelling up fund to a total value of £ that work out at about £ per capita i thank the hon member 
 may i warmly welcome the announcement of over £ to regenerate gosport ’s historic waterfront it will drive job attract visitor and drum up a huge amount of economic prosperity for the area which have such a rich cultural heritage but have be overlook for so long this excellent bid be of course submit under the previous conservative lead administration the council have since change hand and it will be for the liberal democrat leadership to deliver on it this be a lib dem leadership that have already pay back £ of brownfield land release funding to the government because it be unable to spend it what message do   the minister have for the council to ensure that the money be spend in a timely way to level up gosport and drive prosperity for the region 
 i be delighted that gosport be able to receive funding in this round the funding in gosport must be spend on the project priority the council be unable to reallocate that funding to some other random lib dem project that it have in mind it have to deliver on the priority that my hon friend mention there be an adjustment process that local authority can work on with my department to ensure that challenge around inflation for example can be meet however the project aim must still be meet and i shall work with my hon friend and her local authority to ensure that they be 
 can the minister confirm that rochdale receive no funding in this round in either path can he also explain to my constituent why even if we have a successful bid which we would have welcome it would have be dwarf by the cut make to health education and of course our local authority those be the thing ultimately that be destroy the quality of life in my constituency 
 i would not accept the hon member ’s synopsis as i say early we give council an uplift of £ last year to meet priority in their area i can not answer the hon member ’s question today on rochdale but i shall write to he as soon as this statement be over 
 i particularly welcome the £ for the chambers institute in peebles the £ for walk and cycleway in clydesdale and the £ for transport in dumfries and galloway but i pay particular tribute to the trustee of the annan harbour action group for its compelling bid which secure £ to regenerate annan harbour these be all essentially rural project do my hon friend agree that rural area across the united kingdom must be at the core of level up 
 there be no great champion for level up in rural area than my right hon friend i be delighted that we have be able to give dumfries and galloway a chunk of money in this round and i be sure that he will work to ensure that his local authority put it to good use i be delighted to be work with he on do just that 
 i confess that i be very disappointed by today ’s announcement because we have be try to get some money for the rhondda tunnel which would be an enormous enhancement to the top end of the rhondda fawr successive government ministers have tell i personally that we should apply under round and then tell the local authority that it could not apply under round i be then tell personally that we should apply under round and now it turn out that there be no such thing as a round so we never have an opportunity to make a bid at all of any kind whatsoever i be hopeful that the minister will now say that the government be not close the door on the rhondda tunnel and that there will be another   chance for we to make an application to the government for the £ that we need for of the poor area in the country 
 i understand the hon member ’s concern to be absolutely clear i have not make any such commitment to he level up be an agenda that the government be focus on this be not the end of the road for level up and i would be delighted to come to rhondda not least because rhondda receive money through round of the levelling up fund a total of £ 
 the minister know full well how much bingley have be neglect and let down by labour run bradford council largely because i keep tell he about it bingley need regeneration and it particularly need a new swimming pool so can he tell i what the government will do to help bingley receive the swimming pool and the regeneration that it desperately need i be afraid that the people of bingley can not trust bradford council to deliver those for they 
 i understand the plight of the people of bingley because as my hon friend say he raise it with i at every possible opportunity i will work with he to see what funding stream be available to tackle the mess leave behind by labour run bradford council and to fund bingley swimming pool 
 people in northern ireland will be angry tonight that not penny of a fund that the minister describe as create opportunity across all region and nation of the uk and aim at tackle regional inequality be allocate to northern ireland he give the flimsy excuse that it be because the northern ireland executive be not up and run the northern ireland executive do not have any input into the previous round and would not have have any into this round of course they would not even have need to seek new allocation because no new application be need be this not a case of blatant pathetic transparent economic blackmail to try to get the assembly up and run again without address the reason why it fall and of pour the money into key conservative marginal constituency to bolster party support 
 i share the right hon gentleman ’s frustration that we have be unable to fund project in northern ireland this time around as i indicate to he that be because of a lack of an executive in northern ireland i assure he that we have set aside what northern ireland ’s allocation would have be in this round and i commit to work with he and his colleague to ensure that northern ireland receive the full benefit of level up 
 i thank my hon friend for his statement i have lose my voice cheer for the £ for swadlincote town this be the time in year that government money have be put into regenerate that area which be the heart of south derbyshire and i thank he very much indeed i have have a word with the chief executive of the new labour council and i will sit on the board that ensure we have spade in the ground i thank the minister very much 
 i be delighted to be able to give my hon friend ’s constituency the funding this time around she be an extremely efficient champion for the people of derbyshire and i be delighted that we have be able to fund the project 
 i can be of this government ’s sharp critic often justifiably but today i thank the minister and his predecessor   the hon member for bishop auckland dehenna davison whom i harass relentlessly since the round bid for denton be reject i be so pleased that today destination denton the project that we put forward will receive nearly £ give that i be the constituency member of parliament and be involve in put the bid together what assurance can the minister give i that i will be involve in ensure that the project come to fruition 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his kind word we expect local authority to work with their member of parliament who be key community stakeholder in deliver the bid a project adjustment request process be available to local authority if project need to be adjust because of change in inflation and so on a key thing that i ask for be that members of parliament be consult in that process and i will ensure that the hon gentleman be consult at all turn 
 i congratulate the new minister on the energy and purpose that he have bring to the vital task of level up the country and particularly small city and large town which be largely overlook by the labour government during year of focus on metropolitan city the £ award to the greyfriars and eastgate project in gloucester will deliver a new shopping centre indoor market and much more besides as well as put a roof for the time in year on the beautiful century greyfriars friary that will make a huge difference alongside the king ’s quarter project that have already be fund by the local council and the government do the minister agree that if the shadow levelling up minister   the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders want to see an example of give up in this country he be welcome to visit the car park buy by a previous labour administration for £ and later sell for £ that be why gloucester like the rest of the country need to keep regeneration in the right hand 
 gloucester could not have a well champion than my hon friend he be a fantastic champion for it when i take on this job of my conversation be with he about the urgent need for levelling up funding in gloucester i be delighted that we have be able to fund his project this time around as he say it be important that we keep gloucester in conservative hand 
 my goodness what a con this be early this year we hear from the national audit office that of the £ allocate in the round only £ have be spend perhaps the minister can say how much have be spend now be this not much like any other tory slogan meaningless in reality once again there be nothing for ross skye and lochaber we hear from   the right hon   member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell   about the importance of rural area but there be nothing for the portree harbour bid which would have make such a difference 
 i invite the secretary of state and his ministerial team to my constituency we will drive around and look at all the site of the project that be fund by the european union road bridge harbour sport facility that money would have come if we have stay in the european union as scotland vote to do we be miss out on € that the eu be invest in regeneration and once again we be get nothing zip from this tory government 
 the right hon gentleman be wrong i shall write to he follow the statement on exactly how much uk share prosperity fund his area have receive and i hope that when i do he will come back to the chamber to update the house on the fact of the matter he ask how much money have be spend since the national audit office release the figure in march £ have be spend since then but i would be delighted to come up and visit the humble crofter ’s constituency 
 pardon i for have an unfashionable thatcherite point of view but much well than government taxpayer fund levelling up be private sector level up although i thank the secretary of state for have release some money for gainsborough £ of private sector level up namely for raf scampton be at risk in my constituency will the minister meet i after the court case to ensure that whatever its result we get on with level up for instance the roof of the officer mess alone will cost half a pound the roof of the hangar be decay the site will not be viable unless private sector investment be unleash and the home office get on with it 
 i would be delighted to meet my right hon friend but of the key way to unlock private investment in the greater lincolnshire area be to progress with the devolution deal i shall be delighted to meet he to discuss that far 
 what consideration have the minister give to the formation of development corporation to deliver specific project as he may be aware i represent a durham constituency that include of the poor community in the country there have be a failure to leverage investment into the county most notably in round but also in round and to resolve some very serious structural problem i can identify lot of problem in the abc street in easington and the numbered street in horden and peterlee town centre we have very successful development corporation may i remind the minister that durham be run by a coalition of conservatives lib dems and independent that be fail to deliver 
 i hear the hon gentleman ’s plea for more development corporation we be obviously on an ambitious journey with the north east to devolve   far through the new mayoral north east combined authority that will be a key way to help ensure level up in his part of the world
