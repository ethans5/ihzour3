 raise the amount of collective bargaining be indispensable if we want to drive down poverty and inequality and that be what this bill will do this bill will allow union to get into more workplace and tell more worker why they should join a union no employer need to fear union if they be confident that they act fairly towards their worker and that their site be safe so we will legislate to make sure that union can get into every workplace after all do we really think that ambulance would have be at those sports direct warehouse time in year include for a woman who give birth in the toilet if there have be union check safety on that site that be why union need the right to go into workplace as a side note the rule on access have to be practical so i gently say to my right hon friend that the access agreement as draft in the bill give rogue employer just a few too many way to keep union out and i hope we can sort that this be not just about get union into workplace it be about get union recognise and have the right to negotiate as equal at the table with the boss on wage condition and more the change on recognition be fantastic and be to be celebrate i hope we can go just a little far and end the year lockout follow a fail recognition ballot that have keep union out of the workplace just as gmb worker be keep out of amazon 
 the work class be the backbone of this country contrary to what opposition front bencher say worker be the dog not the tail we all deserve security at work and a decent wage i will be so proud to vote for this bill

 it be with great privilege and a deep sense of responsibility that i stand before you today madam deputy speaker as i take my place in this historic chamber i be acutely aware of the profound trust place in we by the constituent of our great nation i wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to the people of leicester east for elect i to represent they in parliament 
 my story like that of many in leicester be of heritage resilience and opportunity my parent arrive in leicester from kenya and india in the late 1970 bring with they cultural and faith tradition and a remarkable work ethic they make rushey mead their home and i be bear and raise there from herrick primary school to soar valley college and de montfort university leicester have nurture i every step of the way and for that i be deeply thankful 
 as be customary i pay tribute to claudia webbe my immediate predecessor who serve the constituency to the very good of her ability claudia follow in the   footstep of keith vaz who alongside paul boateng and bernie grant break new ground in the representation of people of colour in parliament in the election i have the unique experience of stand against both claudia and keith a testament to the vibrant political landscape of leicester east 
 leicester be a city of remarkable history and diversity leicester host the large diwali festival outside india it be home to the uk ’s long running comedy festival it be of england ’s old city so much so that we find a king under of our carpark for those who do not know of our early king king richard iii be find under a carpark in leicester the university of leicester be the birthplace of dna fingerprinting leicester be also home to the national space centre and we be proud of our contribution to the art science and sport 
 we have get it all go on in leicester but if member remain unconvinced that leicester have influence their life because perhaps they be not a former monarch or a scientist in their spare time leicester have also give britain icon like the late lord richard attenborough and very much live sir david attenborough gary lineker and peter shilton our city be where walker crisp be bear and where fashion guru gok wan grow up leicester ’s influence even extend to music with entertainer like engelbert humperdinck and showaddywaddy so whether you have tuck into a bag of ready salt go to the cinema to watch jurassic park or boogie on down to hey rock and roll you ’ve get leicester to thank 
 this be what true diversity look like in fact in leicester be describe as the most multicultural city in the uk today of people live in leicester be from ethnic minority group and be bear outside the uk but most relevant to today ’s debate be employment and business in my constituency leicester be locate at the heart of england and local business be the lifeblood of our city leicester be recognise as the uk ’s most entrepreneurial city a title that reflect the resilience creativity and determination of its people our entrepreneurial scene be not just about number it be about story of those who dare to dream big hustle hard and turn their idea into reality 
 the employment rights bill threaten to undermine that spirit before those entrepreneur have even make their £ the additional cost and regulation propose will act as a barrier to entry discourage the very innovation and hard work that have earn leicester that title we must be cautious not to stifle the ambition of small business owner who be the backbone of our economy our journey be of innovation and community a story of people come together across different sector and background to build something truly remarkable 
 in a city as diverse as leicester many rely on flexible work to balance family commitment faith observance or job by impose blanket regulation that do not consider the unique need of our community the bill risk alienate the very workforce it aim to protect we must ensure that employment regulation support business and worker alike impose regulation that add cost without offer support will harm the very people labour claim to champion for our small business in leicester many of which work with razor thin margin the burden impose by the bill will be   overwhelming it be thing to champion worker right but quite another to do so in a way that risk the survival of the very business that provide the job 
 let we not forget that successful business be the good way to secure meaningful long term employment our decision in this house will shape the future of our country for generation to come it be imperative that we approach these challenge in a spirit of collaboration transcend partisan divide to serve the good interest of all our constituent with our nation face economic challenge the bill risk raise cost for consumer and worsen the cost of living crisis particularly in community like leicester east where many be already struggle to make end meet we must find solution that protect worker without penalise local business and their customer

 as we debate the future of worker right i want to say on record that the p&o ferries scandal which affect so many of my constituent must never be repeat that be why i fully support this bill 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what discussion she have have with the scottish government on the potential merit of devolve the power to introduce a scottish visa scheme 
 the hon gentleman have raise this issue on a number of occasion he will be aware that we be not introduce a scottish visa scheme or devolving control of immigration policy and this have be make clear to the scottish government instead we must together address the underlie cause of skill shortage and overseas recruitment in different part of the uk which this government be do 
 i thank the minister for her tiresome and repetitive response she will know that scotland have a whole range of demographic and population difficulty that need to be urgently address with every sector from social care to hospitality include business leader call out for drastic action even her scottish labour colleague be begin to understand the enormity of this task today we find that labour ’s grotesque child benefit cap be now have an impact on scotland ’s birth rate instead of slap down her scottish colleague and reject this idea out of hand why do she not work with we just to see if it might actually work 
 the hon gentleman know that net migration must come down it treble under the last government largely drive by overseas recruitment immigration be a reserved matter work in the interest of the whole uk previous scheme along the line that he have suggest have succeed only in restrict movement and right and create internal uk border add different rule for different location would also increase complexity and create friction when worker move location 
 scotland be a diverse place some area be see depopulation but area such as east lothian which i represent be see unprecedented population growth will the minister commit to work constructively with the scottish government on their woeful population strategy which in year have comprehensively fail to address scotland ’s demographic challenge 
 we be commit to work with the scottish government on this and all issue indeed many of the lever to address depopulation in scotland be in power that the scottish government already have at their disposal the reason for local worker leave particular area must be address through investment in job in infrastructure and in public service and many of these be issue that we must tackle together 
 what step her department be take to tackle fraud and economic crime 
 fraud account for of all crime accord to the england and wales crime survey and it be the most common type of crime in the year end march it be a crime that destroy life and we be commit to work with law enforcement and industry to well protect the public and business from the fraud threat they face 
 we know that of all report crime be fraud and many of those offence be carry out by serious organise crime gang the national crime agency be task with protect my constituent from foreign origin fraud and serious organise crime but a recent report from spotlight on corruption find that after year of conservative government the nca be on its knee spend million of pound on consultant and fail to retain investigator what step be the minister take to ensure that the nca be able to protect my constituent from financial crime 
 let i take this opportunity to pay tribute to the nca for its operational leadership and its focus on tackle economic crime through collaborate with jurisdiction at risk we make it hard for organise crime group to target uk victim the national fraud squad run by the nca ’s national economic crime centre and the city of london police with new officer by next year have boost the ability to tackle the high harm international offender we be work to deliver a workforce strategy to address retention challenge for fraud this be important work that impact on all our constituent and it be a priority area for this government 
 the minister will know that online harm go beyond fraud it can impact people ’s life through suicide site that signpost people to unregulated site that lead they to a place none of we want to see they go to he will know that the european commission be currently investigate facebook and instagram the united states be introduce the kid online safety act which if it be pass by congress will make a huge impact why be it leave to parent in the united kingdom in england wales scotland and northern ireland wherever they be to take their own litigation against these big tech company be it not time the government do more 
 we be do more and i can assure the right hon gentleman that this be a key priority for the department not least because of fraud have an international element particularly online approximately in adult be victim of fraud in the year end march the noble lord hanson lead on this for the department and he and i be work closely with other government departments include the treasury and the department for science innovation and technology this be a priority and we need to do more 
 what step her department be take to improve neighbourhood policing 
 what step her department be take to improve neighbourhood policing 
 what step her department be take to improve neighbourhood policing 
 what step her department be take to improve neighbourhood policing 
 neighbourhood policing be the bedrock of the british policing model yet in many area of the country it have be decimate in recent year this government be commit to rebuild neighbourhood police by put officer police community support officer and special constable back in our community with new power to tackle antisocial behaviour and local crime 
 my constituent rightly want to see more neighbourhood police team on their street i welcome the government ’s commitment to bring in more neighbourhood police officer but can the secretary of state assure i that west london will get the neighbourhood police team we need 
 my hon friend be right that we now have thousand few police officer and pcso on the street than we have a decade ago this include the previous government halve the number of pcso and cut the number of special constable by third this newly elect government be work at pace to introduce a new neighbourhood policing guarantee put police officer and pcso back on the street we have also announce funding and support for the college of policing to begin the national roll out of specialist training for neighbourhood officer in order to professionalise and strengthen the work they do in every corner of the country 
 i welcome the home secretary to her place my community in harlow have be let down by the lack of neighbourhood policing what will the home secretary do to address this issue both through police on the street and through the resource they have 
 my hon friend make an important point this be a challenge we be face across the country the proportion of people say that they barely ever see the police be now nearly half up from a quarter when the conservatives come to power in this have be deeply damaging to public confidence and we need the police back on the beat but they also need the power to act that be why we will also bring forward new power to tackle shoplifting and antisocial behaviour especially in our town centre 
 resident in bracknell be concerned about the increase number of drug user and dealer on our street i raise this issue when i recently meet our neighbourhood policing team what more support can be give to local police and other local service to get drug dealer off our street 
 my hon friend make an important point drug dealing drug misuse and other form of antisocial behaviour and crime be a real challenge in   many community we need to get neighbourhood police back on the beat to address these challenge secondly neighbourhood police need great power and we will introduce respect order that allow the police to take action against repeat offender and to make sure that our street and community can be keep safe 
 in ealing southall religious organisation be spend their own money protect worshipper from antisocial behaviour and crime in the early morning sri guru singh sabha gurdwara for example be spend £ to £ a week on patrol and security measure i recently call a crime summit and although the police be try their good the community need more police on the street and a return to neighbourhood policing what progress have be make on recruit the much need new police and community support officer we need to restore trust in the safety of our community and town centre 
 order can member please speak through the chair 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for ealing southall deirdre costigan   for the leadership she be show in her community the point she raise be partly about increase neighbourhood police number which be part of this labour government ’s plan it be also about ensure that we have partnership between the police and local community rather than community feel that they have to do this alone such partnership between the police and community be at the heart of the british model of policing by consent which be what we need to restore and rebuild after the damage that have be do 
 the cost of rural crime shoot up by in the south west between and while of respondent to a recent national farmers union survey say that rural crime be negatively affect farmer mental health how be the department support neighbourhood officer and rural beat to adequately deal with the heighten level of rural crime 
 the hon member make a serious point we need to increase neighbourhood police in rural area and to recognise the additional different challenge that rural area can face both because of the geography and the particular kind of crime that affect farmer and farming equipment that be why we have set out our intention to draw up a new rural crime action plan alongside our plan for neighbourhood policing 
 under the last conservative government exclude fraud and computer misuse crime fall by 50%—[interruption i be pleased to say that in beverley and holderness as across the rest of the country it be community group local people and the police work together who help to do that work with the local community the cherry tree centre help to reduce antisocial behaviour in the st nicholas area of beverley by year on year by last summer what will the secretary of state do to ensure that such community co operation lead to further cut in crime which be so welcome under the conservatives 
 i caution the right hon member against exclude of the most common crime in the country from his figure some of the crime that impact town centre at the heart of local community most heavily such as shoplifting street crime and street theft have soar in recent year but there be no response at all by the previous government we be make those crime a priority as part of our plan to change some of the law around shoplifting and assault on shop worker as well as get more police back on the beat 
 of the big problem face by the neighbourhood police team in cheadle be antisocial behaviour and the scourge of off road bike what be the secretary of state do to help greater manchester police tackle off road bike in our community 
 the hon member be right that off road bike be a total nightmare in some community i have talk to resident who have be drive mad by the scourge of dangerous off road bike that be use to harass and intimidate people we be look at way to strengthen the law on off road biking to give the police the power they need to tackle that kind of damage antisocial behaviour 
 give the home secretary ’s great concern about shoplifting and antisocial behaviour will she make an assessment on the put it right scheme for young offender that have be successfully pilot in my constituency 
 i welcome the point the hon member make to tackle shoplifting we need to ensure that strong enough law and police partnership be in place and that we do prevention and follow up work with young people as she may know we be set up a new young futures programme which be all about the great work we need to do to prevent young people be draw into crime in the place i encourage she to tell we more detail about her local work to tackle this issue 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the last conservative government stand with our brave police officer and emergency service worker we introduce tough sentence for those who assault they and the elizabeth medal to recognise those who lose their life in the line of duty and we be look to recognise those who be discharge from service as a result of injury on the frontline will the secretary of state continue that work will she meet with i and former policeman tom curry who have be lead an excellent campaign on this important issue 
 i have long be a strong supporter of the elizabeth medal i pay tribute to bryn hughes and other for their work campaign for recognition for police officer and other emergency worker who have be lose in the line of duty and who have give so much to support other people and keep other safe i have attend the police bravery award every year for   the last year exactly because it be so important to support brave officer i be absolutely determined to ensure that we not only continue with that work but go far to support brave officer who put their life at risk i be very happy to continue cross party work on this issue 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in greater manchester the right care right person approach be recently introduce since a police response to a mental health relate call be not always the right fit there be grow concern though about unclear line of responsibility between mental health service and the police which may cause case to be mishandle what step be the government take to ensure that co ordination between the police and mental health service be as clear and effective as it can be so that those who most need support do not fall through the crack 
 the hon member raise an important issue that co ordination between police and mental health service can be crucial in some of the most serious case where people be a danger to the public for reason perhaps link to a mental health crisis but also in many case where someone be not a danger to the public and mental health professional may be far well able to respond than police officer significant work have be do but she be right that we need far close work between police and mental health service across the country that have also be part of the work that my right hon friend the health secretary be do in the nhs and the department of health and social care on improve mental health service 
 what step her department be take to tackle criminal gang facilitate small boat crossing 
 what step her department be take to tackle criminal gang facilitate small boat crossing 
 can i ask the home secretary please to look at i occasionally it would help 
 apology mr speaker i always like the chance to be able to look towards you 
 the criminal smuggling and traffic gang that organise small boat crossing be undermine our border security and put life at risk it be truly tragic that a little baby die in the channel this weekend those gang have be get away with this for far too long that be why the government have set up a new border security command lead by former police chief martin hewitt to work with other country to go after the gang 
 small boat crossing be an issue raise by resident but we know that organised crime stretch beyond people smuggle in my portsmouth north constituency we recently see the sentencing of a criminal gang that attempt to smuggle tonne of   cocaine into the city from colombia can the secretary of state expand on how we be tackle organise crime relate to smuggle drug and dangerous weapon into our port to ensure that those thing do not hit our street 
 my hon friend make an important point there be many different threat to our border security which be why we have set up the border security command to draw together the work of different agency include on dangerous drug smuggling and organised crime bring together border force the national crime agency the intelligence and security agency and local police force the border security command ’s priority will be to deal with the dangerous boat crossing that be undermine security and put life at risk but as part of its work it will be deal with the wide threat to our border as well 
 i thank the home secretary for her answer about the criminal gang people in bristol north east also ask i about deterrence what reassurance can i give they that this action be be back up with measure to stop illegal working by people who do not have a right to work here 
 my hon friend make an important point about how employer have exploit illegal migration as a result we set up a major programme through the summer include raid pursue illegal working in different place across the country we have also substantially increase our work on return include redeploy additional staff to work on return and enforcement to make sure the rule be be properly respect and enforce that have lead to an increase of more than in enforce return this summer 
 give that dangerous foreign criminal have be use the european convention on human right as a loophole to remain in the uk do the home secretary agree that it be time to leave the echr and restore the sovereignty of our own border 
 the purpose of set up a border security command be to strengthen the security of our border we will do that by work with other country it be crucial that we do so to tackle the gang and the boat before they reach the french coast in the place we have increase our co operation with new agreement in place with the g7 europol and italy and we be work on new agreement with france germany and belgium those agreement would not be possible if we be somehow abandon international law 
 as the house will be aware there have be recent crossing be the home secretary consider reopen hotel to house asylum seeker and if so will she commit to keep the house inform about the methodology for choose those hotel and ensure that constituency member be inform at the appropriate time 
 ensure that constituency member be inform be something that i take seriously it often do not happen in the past but it be important and it need to happen the overall situation that we inherit   include an asylum backlog that be increase because asylum decision making have totally collapse we have now increase that decision making so that we can clear the backlog and end hotel use sadly that will take time because of the soar backlog we inherit as a result of the collapse in decision making but we be determined to ensure that we can clear the backlog and save the taxpayer hundred of million if not billion of pound 
 give the home secretary ’s claim that she would smash the gang with £ to upgrade the manston centre asylum hotel reopen rapidly and small boat crossing since she take office be that the plan that she have for her new border commander might it be fair to say that it be not go very well 
 i gently point out to the hon gentleman what we inherit from the previous government in the month of the year there be the high number of boat crossing on record because of the total failure of their programme include spend £ on a scheme to send people volunteer to rwanda as for the contract he may be interested to learn that the manston contract notice be issue on   december   under the previous home secretary for £ for year with no suggest break clause the new contract be not only substantially cheap because we have make saving but also include break clause so that we can close change or reduce the contract to save the taxpayer money which the previous government fail to do 
 what step her department be take to increase public trust and confidence in policing 
 what step her department be take to increase public trust and confidence in policing 
 what step she be take to monitor and maintain standard of police conduct 
 restore confidence in policing be of the core aim of the government ’s safe street mission that mean ensure robust response to the crime that devastate life and corrode our community we be also committed to improve police standard and will announce step to strengthen the police misconduct and vetting system shortly 
 it be almost year since warwickshire police issue a community protection notice against warwickshire hunt month later it be mysteriously replace by a secret protocol the police and crime commissioner who receive financial support from the countryside alliance claim that he know nothing of the protocol the chief constable refuse to give i a copy and now she have resign claim retirement trust in the pcc and the leadership of warwickshire police have be seriously damage will the minister   meet i to discuss the need for a truly independent inquiry as oppose to the sham be undertake by the pcc 
 i thank my hon friend and as a local to warwickshire i take a keen interest in those matter myself of course i will meet he along with the minister for policing fire and crime prevention my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson it be vital that the public can trust that those who police we and who be in charge of our police be hold to account as everybody else should be 
 despite town and city council in cornwall employ street ranger and antisocial behaviour officer and have shopwatch radio fund from their precept or business improvement district shop manager still struggle with shoplifting and asb the record under our conservative pcc on answer and respond to call be poor and those crime be chronically under report shop worker feel powerless and there be a desperate need for more neighbourhood police can the minister explain how trust in police and the rule of law will be restore to retail staff and shop manager 
 as the home secretary lay out extra neighbourhood policing be important not just because we need more police on our street but because when our constituent shop worker and those who own business call the police if they get no response confidence drop the neighbourhood police that there will be across the country include in cornwall will help with confidence not just with crime 
 i thank the minister for her answer we have see a toxic culture in some police service include whatsapp message that be racist homophobic and sexist display deep prejudice will she clarify when the multiple recommendation from the home office review into the process of police officer dismissal will be action include change the law so that those who fail re vetting can be more simply dismiss 
 i could not agree more that we need to strengthen this area with woman especially feel less confidence over the last few year we will announce in due course i promise the hon lady that we be work on this at pace how we be go to ensure that police conduct and vetting system be fit for purpose to bring back some of the trust that have be lose 
 although i welcome the home secretary ’s response on antisocial behaviour involve e scooter and bike i wish to reiterate the concern of my resident in blackburn will she consider not only additional power for the police but civil power for local authority to combat hotspot area before somebody be seriously hurt 
 as the home secretary outline on neighbourhood policing we will bring in respect order to ensure that antisocial behaviour in particular area be target in a way that it simply have not be in recent year 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 the operational independence of the police go to the heart of public confidence in policing as foreign secretary i see where political interference in policing be rife and that be not a direction that the uk should travel in so do the home secretary believe that it be right for minister to overrule the threat assessment of the police and security service do she believe that some free concert ticket be the appropriate price for scrap police independence and after the appalling result of recent negotiation with the british medical association the rmt and mauritius have she consider recruit taylor swift ’s mum as a government negotiator 
 as it fall to i to answer this let i say that the right hon gentleman know fine well that operational decision for police fall to the police in this situation and in every other i would certainly welcome it if taylor swift ’s mother stand for the leadership of the conservative party she would really offer something that be not currently available the substantive question be about confidence the confidence of woman in policing and its ability to keep woman in our country secure dive under the previous government so confidence definitely need to be restore 
 that do not answer the question at all 
 order we do not want squabble afterwards i call james cleverly to ask his question 
 when i be home secretary on numerous occasion i have to deal with foreign vip demand or request a level of protection that we do not feel be appropriate do the home secretary recognise the difficult position that she have put her own foreign secretary in when such future request come in and they have to be deny as those individual will pray in aid the protection package put in place for a rockstar 
 i remind the right hon gentleman and the house that concert be cancel in vienna because of a terror threat that the cia identify could harm ten of thousand of people i sit in this very chamber last week in front of figen murray the mother of martyn who be kill at an event in manchester the idea that we should not take that security seriously be i be afraid something that i simply do not agree with 
 what step her department be take to help prevent young people from become involve in violent crime 
 knife crime take far too many young life in this country so the government have set a mission not just for the government but for police and local community right across the country to halve knife crime over the next decade as part of that we have already implement the ban on zombie knife and zombie style machete and we will now act quickly to ban ninja sword follow the campaigning by pooja kanda after the death of her son 
 i thank the home secretary for that reply on knife crime i welcome the government ’s commitment in the young futures programme to prevent young people from be draw into crime a number of gang associate girl be draw into crime and although rape and sexual exploitation be such a traumatising experience many of those young girl do not see themselves as victim fantastic organisation such as abianda and milk honey bees work to support woman will the department consider provide tailor support for young woman through the young futures programme 
 my hon friend make an important point i know that she have champion that issue over many year the young futures programme will include youth hub to draw together service around young people i use the concept of a teenage sure start to bring young people ’s service together we also need youth prevention programme across all area she be right to highlight that this must be about young girl as well as young boy to ensure that we tackle the threat to young people ’s safety from violent crime 
 help young people to stay safe and to have somewhere to go and crucially someone to talk to be key to their transition in life particularly to prevent they from be draw into antisocial behaviour retail crime and knife or gang relate crime could the home secretary confirm that through devolution there will be continue support for police and crime commissioner such as katie bourne in sussex who can provide a direct link between resident concern about their young people and work with local police to take preventive measure 
 police and crime commissioner have a crucial role to play as part of the mission to reduce serious violence as do local authority the hon lady be right that local partnership will well be able to target young people who be at great risk and ensure that proper prevention programme be in place as we know many of those service have be hollow out over a long period and it be important that we have partnership work to rebuild they i hope that we can work cross party on that not just with police and crime commissioner but with mps across the country 
 if she will commission an independent review into the adequacy of legislation on the policing of protest 
 like my hon friend the government value the role of peaceful protest as part of our proud democratic tradition the government regularly review the adequacy of exist legislation 
 the right to protest and the courage of people take to the street to demand change have give we many of our cherished social advancement from the suffragette demand vote for woman to the race relations act but the sheer number of power to restrict protest be result in peaceful protester be   arrest and sentence to lengthy period in prison the previous government push through a range of such law despite opposition from senior policing figure and from member across all party when will a comprehensive review of the state of protest take place with a view to repeal power that unnecessarily restrict the right to peaceful protest 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that important issue as she know there will be post legislative scrutiny of the legislation pass by the previous government as the previous government agree it will be consider in due course 
 recent footage of metropolitan police officer say that the description of hezbollah as a terror group be a matter of opinion be alarming the officer in question be deploy to a march in central london where support for hezbollah be openly display yet many offender be only identify by photo on social medium after the event will the minister ensure that all officer be fully brief on the proscribe status of hezbollah hamas and other terrorist organisation so that offender be arrest on the spot and not allow to spew antisemitic hate on our street 
 we be all clear that hezbollah be a proscribe organisation the police take great care when they police protest there be a great deal of briefing for officer beforehand however the way that those protest be police be operationally independent i have be to see and talk to officer who be on the frontline at those protest and i know that it be a difficult job we should all say a big thank you for the work that they do there have be many protest over the last month that the police have deal with and many officer have have rest day cancel to ensure adequate policing on our street 
 southwark police officer recently tell bermondsey safety action group that they struggle to prevent or solve crime due to extraction duty when they have to police repeat protest elsewhere in london do the minister believe that the met need new power to refuse permission for some repetitive protest in the capital or should it use exist power well to resolve and reduce extraction duty and increase safety in my community 
 police number be an issue which be why this government be clear about recruit more neighbourhood police officer to increase that presence on our street i recognise that what my hon friend have say about extraction be an issue for the metropolitan police in particular when deal with protest clearly we want all criminal to be deal with by the police and we need sufficient number of police officer to do that 
 although we respect and would protect the right to peaceful protest antisemitic and islamophobic offence have be report at many recent protest those have contribute to an astonishing and shocking increase in religiously aggravate hate crime in this country as   be reveal last week the community security trust report an almost rise in antisemitic incident and tell mama have record the high ever number of anti muslim incident can the minister reassure we on what the government will do to help the police continue to keep community safe and police protest in a way that do that 
 the figure that the hon lady set out be shocking this government be clear that there be no place in our society for antisemitism or islamophobia there be already meeting about how we can tackle that rise it be shocking and it will not be tolerate in some recent protest the police have clearly have a difficult job to do but i commend their work to tackle antisemitism and islamophobia we know that the police take their responsibility seriously and that they do so without fear or favour 
 if she will increase funding for police in the london borough of havering 
 the government be of course commit to ensure that the police have the resource that they need to tackle crime effectively as i be sure the hon gentleman know fund beyond this year include for the metropolitan police service will be confirm follow the upcoming multi year spending review 
 give the increase pressure on the police service do the minister accept that officer morale retention recruitment and ability to solve crime be severely compromise with police officer overwork underpaid and subject to unprecedented rise in bureaucratic process often deal with thing that police do not traditionally deal with such as mental health care and social work interruption will the minister explain how the government plan to address those critical issue especially in term of improve officer retention recruitment crime solve capacity and the overwhelming level of bureaucracy so that constituent in romford can feel safe in their own town again interruption 
 order mr rosindell you should know well i do not cough twice for my own benefit it be mean to be for your 
 the hon gentleman be a very experienced member of this house he have support year of conservative government that have leave we come into government with a criminal justice system include policing that be in grave difficulty i take the point that he raise but he need to recognise the role that he and his party have play in get we to this point our aim now be to recruit more police officer as the home secretary have say and to increase neighbourhood policing as the bedrock of police in this country 
 we all want to see more funding for our police in havering and hackney and across london   but a reduction in crime would also help they what conversation be minister have with mobile phone manufacturer to try to drive down phone snatch by people on bike and reduce such street crime which be really grow in london 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for raise that point those conversation be ongoing later this month conversation will take place on what more can be do to ensure that the manufacturer take their responsibility seriously and do everything they can to stop the trade in part which be a particular issue with mobile phone 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential merit of remove georgia from her department ’s list of safe country for removal in the context of the recent passage of legislation on lgbt right in that country 
 mr speaker i suspect i might be cough almost as much as you but for a completely different reason 
 we constantly update our assessment of lgbt right and other factor affect the safety of different country work closely with the foreign office and inform by regular independent report from the chief inspector of border and immigration the late update for georgia be publish last month and be available on the gov.uk website 
 the safe state designation that the previous government introduce be intend to allow georgian and indian national to be return without any individualised assessment of the safety of the country for each person in both country persecution of certain minority be on the rise that make their inclusion on the list particularly wrong but also highlight the wide danger of blanket inadmissibility of asylum claim base on nationality what step will the government take to ensure that individual asylum claim be always properly assess 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue and bring her concern concern that i share to the attention of the house we regularly monitor and review the situation in country of origin work closely with the foreign office and our result country policy and information note be publish on the gov.uk website should we assess that the troubling new law to which my hon friend refer or any other change fundamentally affect the justification for georgia ’s designation we will seek to remove it from the list use the correct parliamentary process 
 in georgia in particular but also in other country there be an evidential base to prove that the persecution of christians and ethnic minority and other human right abuse be take place it be also important that lgbt right issue be engage with have the minister have the opportunity to address those issue directly with georgia ’s government 
 address such issue be more of a foreign office responsibility which be why we liaise closely with the foreign office when consider the production of information note if law that be pass and put into effect in other country lead to persecution or a well found fear of persecution for individual that be of the context we use to make a decision that include lgbt right but also other right 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 organise immigration crime put life at risk and threaten our border security we have agree a new anti smuggling action plan with our g7 partner to strengthen collaboration in area such as intelligence information exchange and the pursuit of criminal finance the uk work will be lead by the new border security command as evidence of our close collaboration with other country this weekend at the request of the french authority a border force vessel rescue people and return they to france 
 accord to research by uk feminista over a of female school pupil have be sexually harass while at school much of this can be trace back to misogynistic online influencer and the harmful impact of pornography will the home secretary tell the house what she be do to prioritise woman ’s online safety and how she be engage with counterpart in the devolved administration to ensure that no woman or girl be leave behind when it come to end sexual harassment and the exploitation of woman 
 my hon friend make an extremely important point the mission for safe street that the government have set include a really ambitious mission to halve violence against woman and girl in a decade we know that that be immensely difficult and i hope that all the devolved administration as well as local community and organisation will want to be part of it my hon friend be right to prioritise woman ’s online safety and that be why my right hon friend the secretary of state for science innovation and technology be prioritise action on online deepfake abuse 
 we now come to the shadow home secretary 
 in her statement to the house on   july the chancellor say that asylum accommodation cost be draw down from treasury reserve be unfunded and undisclosed”—a description that i reject can the home secretary now confirm to the house that asylum accommodation cost will be disclose and more importantly fund from her departmental budget and that she will not be draw down from treasury reserve to pay for asylum accommodation cost will she reject the chancellor ’s description and say that she will fund those cost in the same way that i do 
 the former home secretary the current shadow home secretary now seem to be admit to the totally chaotic state of asylum accommodation finance he have to continually seek last minute reserve claim because his government have underfunde the asylum accommodation problem that they have cause by let the asylum backlog soar as a result the taxpayer end up foot the bill this government will be make saving from asylum accommodation by get the system back in order i know that the right hon member have be kick out of the tory party leadership contest because he can not count 
 order i say to the home secretary that i expect short answer these be topical if there be question where she want to go long she should do so early otherwise it be not fair to the back benchers i represent on both side of the house we will now be stay here long than she probably expect james cleverly let we have a good example of a short topical 
 will she be draw down from treasury reserve yes or no 
 this government have already be put in place the funding to try to make good the total chaos that the right hon member ’s government leave we with they spend £ to send volunteer to rwanda and how much do he spend on a flight 
 refugee woman and girl who be often already survivor of gender base violence be at significant risk of abuse coercion and bad when house in hotel pende the processing of their application as i know the home secretary be aware from her substantial work on the issue will she please update the house on what step the department be take to end the use of hotel accommodation for woman and girl 
 my hon friend be right that we have an extensive challenge with the backlog which mean that very expensive hotel be too often use as asylum accommodation we need to clear the backlog and ensure that we end hotel use but that also mean address the serious challenge around violence against woman and girl 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 this be black history month and we honour the windrush generation who be let down shamefully by the previous conservative government by the appalling windrush scandal itself but then by their failure to fully implement the williams review and the compensation scheme the parliamentary ombudsman have now find that the home office be wrongly deny compensation payment so will the home secretary commit to urgently appoint a windrush commissioner as she promise back in june to lead on right these wrong 
 we will be appoint a windrush commissioner this be something i feel strongly about the hon member will know that as the select committee chair i ask many question about the windrush   scandal it be a stain not just on the home office but on the british state and it be important we right those wrong 
 in year of tory government police number be decimate across our country include in my constituency durham constabulary lose officer a of its strength what step will the government take to put police officer back on our street 
 as have be say a number of time this afternoon the neighbourhood police guarantee mean police officer pcso and special back on our street to keep we all safe after the reduction in police officer number of i think over by the conservative party 
 the recent london stalk review publish by the london victim commissioner reveal some pretty alarming statistic in our capital of stalk victim feel compel to withdraw from the justice system and say that no action be take on their complaint by police what specific measure be be take to well support victim of stalk be there plan to offer specific training to officer to deal with these case 
 we be absolutely look at how we can strengthen stalk protection order we will look at our stalk law in the round but also at how police handle all case of violence against woman and girl and at the training that will be need 
 after year of conservative government we hardly see police officer on the beat across my constituency night policing cover in uttoxeter and rural area be virtually non existent what step will the minister take to put more officer on the beat and what be the timeline for that 
 again there be the neighbourhood policing guarantee and importantly for my hon friend there will be a name police officer in the community so people know who to go to when they need assistance that work be happen now and we be keen to see the officer in place in the next few month 
 in rural crime action week do the secretary of state agree that in bedfordshire where we have major urban area such as bedford and luton border by rural community it be important that the funding formula be review so that equal attention can be pay to tackle crime in our rural village and town 
 i gently remind the hon member that his party ’s government fail to review the funding formula for very many year however he be right that the issue of rural and urban area be immensely important which be why we have commit to a rural crime action plan 
 i agree with the hon member for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson despite the previous government ’s promise to reform funding settlement as usual they fail to deliver do the secretary of state agree that we must review the current situation reform the police funding formula and finally deliver fairer funding for local people 
 as part of the spending review we want to consider police funding in the round include how police funding be allocate to force the sector include the association of police and crime commissioners and the national police chiefs council be engage in the process 
 the home secretary be benefit from some of the measure on legal route for migration bring in by my right hon friend the member for braintree mr cleverly when he be in government which have cause the number of people able to come to the uk to halve what further measure have she take to ensure that legal migration be cut far 
 the government be commit to bring down legal migration we will do so by make sure that british worker be upskille in key sector with new requirement for employer to address skill shortage and by introduce new training and workforce plan so that overseas recruitment do not remain the default for fill skill shortage in the uk 
 i have listen in absolute amazement to the outrage from opposition members about the careful consideration of security for taylor swift ’s concert in london a week after her vienna tour be cancel due to a terror plot do the home secretary think that be cynical opportunism from conservative members or have they lose all sense of reason 
 i think it be a matter for we all to take the security of people immensely seriously and to ensure that terrorist extremist and criminal threat do not win in their attempt to pose threat not just to life but to our way of life 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 thank you mr speaker and i thank the house for put its confidence in i to chair the home affairs committee i look forward to work constructively with the department on home affair matter in that vein may i welcome the news that the government will recruit new personnel to process modern slavery claim can the secretary of state confirm whether those personnel be new head count how long the training will take and whether she be confident that the head count will survive the forthcoming budget and spending review 
 i congratulate the right hon lady on her new position it be a great job and i look forward to give evidence to she as she do to i we will see what price i have to pay as the role be reversed she ask an important point about modern slavery number we be recruit additional member of staff and i will happily provide she with more information about that crucial policy area 
 part of the data protection act impose unnecessary obligation on the police and require they to redact personal datum for information transfer to the crown prosecution service those obligation delay and obstruct the swift progress of the criminal justice system the police federation of england and wales have propose a new clause that if introduce would facilitate the free flow of personal datum between the police and the cps will ministers urgently look at reform that unnecessary red tape to allow more police time on the street in my constituency of south ribble 
 that be an important point and we be actively explore all way that we can improve guidance around redaction streamline current process make well use of technology and ultimately reduce unnecessary burden on the police and prosecutor so that they can get on with their primary task of keep the public safe and put away criminal 
 the home secretary tell the house that by end the retrospective element of the duty to remove she be save £ in year the impact assessment assume that all those subject to the duty would have remain in britain at a cost to the home office but in his letter to i her permanent secretary say that the sum include the cost of send the same migrant to rwanda i write to the home secretary about that on   september   and i have raise it with the minister for immigration in westminster hall but i have not have an answer can she explain that double counting and if she can not will she apologise for use that statistic in the house of commons 
 as the hon gentleman will know the impact assessment be provide by the home office and what we inherit from the previous government be not simply the incredibly costly rwanda programme but also the retrospective element of the illegal migration act which be so damaging that the shadow home secretary when he be in the job do not implement many of the measure that retrospective element have cost the home office hundred of million of pound and those cost would go forward into the future 
 we want to support genuine refugee but will the home secretary provide an update on the progress on return and deportation of illegal migrant and say how the new command arrangement improve on the arrangement of the previous government 
 my hon friend make an important point to tackle the chaos in the asylum system the rule need to be properly respect and enforce that be why we have increase by more than the enforce return over the summer of those who have no right to be here we have also increase the number of charter flight include the big ever charter flight return 
 give that the turnout for the devon and cornwall police and crime commissioner election in may be just will the minister look to scrap that role and instead invest that money in proper community police in rural constituency such as mine of north cornwall 
 the government have no plan to scrap the role of police and crime commissioner we think it be a valuable role that can enable the mission that this government have set out to be enact locally include the safe street mission we need to work with the pcc to make sure that mission happen in the different force area around the country pccs also have a role to play with their other partner local authority and the voluntary sector 
 noisy off road bike speed around neighbourhood such as chapeltown in my constituency deliberately disturb and intimidate resident will the home secretary commit to properly tackle off road bike by give the police the right power to crack down on this issue 
 my hon friend make an important point and i thank she for stand up for her community we want to strengthen the law to give the police more power to tackle the nightmare of dangerous off road bike 
 when last year the now home secretary call on the then conservative government to use counter terror legislation to proscribe organisation such as the islamic revolutionary guard corps she will remember that i support she publicly since then iran and the irgc have get even more dangerous have she change her mind and if so why 
 i have huge respect for the right hon gentleman but i gently point out that he be ask the government to do something that the previous government do not do in year i can say to he that we be lead work on counter iranian state threat make use of the full breadth and expertise of our intelligence service and law enforcement agency we keep the list of proscribe organisation under very close review i can assure he that work continue apace to identify further way to tackle the threat 
 uk university have experience a fivefold increase in antisemitic incident since the   october   terrorist attack at a recent meeting of the union of jewish students i hear distressing example of the iranian regime organise on our campus and stir up hatred against jewish student can the minister tell the house what step the department be take to deal with the threat pose by tehran here on british soil 
 we have be clear that the behaviour of the iranian regime include the action of the irgc pose a threat to the safety and security of the uk and our ally the government continually assess threat to the uk and take the protection of individual right freedom and safety incredibly seriously wherever those threat may originate 
 in the home office commission the fairfield review into the independent office for police conduct it deem the delay in the iopc as unacceptable indeed of my constituent have be wait a year after the death of her daughter to have a case officer assign do the home secretary agree with the review and will she comment on when she will implement its recommendation 
 i have meet the iopc chair to talk through the issue face that body the hon gentleman be right that we need to speed up the decision make process he will also recognise that there be considerable challenge in the system that we have inherit

 i would be delighted to 
 after a bungle fraud investigation by renault crédit international it together with renault nissan uk ltd move to seize the asset of a business in my constituency mackie motors brechin ltd. this cost my constituent half a pound and of his order book value will the secretary of state meet i to discuss the fine point of this clearly very dubious act by a uk bank 
 i be concerned to hear about the case that the hon gentleman raise and i would be happy to meet he to discuss it far 
 i put on record my gratitude to the home secretary and her team for release the home office commission report the historical root of the windrush scandal which conclude that year of racist immigration legislation cause the windrush scandal those now on the opposition benches spend year try to suppress that report will the home secretary meet i other mps and civil society representative to discuss its recommendation 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that issue it be a shocking report and that the previous government refuse to publish i would be very happy to meet he and other hon member to discuss it 
 do the home secretary share my deep concern about tier justice give that some people who say some bad stupid thing on social medium can be arrest charge and jail within a matter of week but some people who brutally and violently assault police officer have not even be charge many month later 
 the hon member will know that in this country we have operational independence for the police and independence for the crown prosecution   service and the court i strongly support police officer who have face case of the most disgraceful violence and attack it be important that we support our police in the face of those attack and ensure that they have the whole community behind they 
 the home secretary may be aware of the datum that the internet watch foundation release last week on the increase amount of ai generate child sexual abuse content available to everyone on the internet find that it have increase in the last month alone that be clearly illegal so what be the uk government do to stamp down on that horrific crime 
 let i make it clear that the new government intend very swiftly to set up new taskforce to ensure that across department in this case with our counterpart in the department for science innovation   and technology we do everything we can to end the scourge of online child abuse and child abuse not online 
 i call jim shannon or be you not stand 
 i be always stand mr speaker what effort have be take in school to show the opportunity available in the police force to enhance career opportunity for young people 
 i ’ll be watch you 
 it be always a pleasure to answer the hon gentleman that work will be ongoing we want to recruit from the wide possible group in our community and to encourage young people to think about a career in policing 
 urgent question to ask the foreign secretary if he will make a statement on the new immigration arrangement between the uk government and st helena 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i have be ask to reply as the minister for the overseas territories i know that these be issue of keen interest to you mr speaker 
 the house be aware that a political agreement have be reach with mauritius about the long term future of the british indian ocean territory once any treaty with mauritius come into force follow its proper parliamentary scrutiny mauritius will be responsible for any migrant who arrive there however we need to find an interim contingency solution for the period before that agreement come into force give that there be no permanent population biot have never be an appropriate long term location for migrant due to the logistical challenge of provide appropriate care in such a remote place without civilian infrastructure 
 on   october a new memorandum of understanding be reach with the government of st helena so that any new migrant arrive in the interim period will be transfer to st helena the intention be for that agreement to last until the treaty with mauritius come into force recall that in practice no new migrant have arrive on diego garcia since 
 we be hugely grateful to the st helena government for their assistance their chief minister have say 
 this arrangement present a unique opportunity for a british overseas territory to be in a position to assist the uk and we be pleased to be able to work in close partnership with the uk government towards a mutually beneficial solution 
 the uk government have agree to provide off funding of £ to st helena to improve health and education outcome and upgrade government infrastructure this be consistent with our long term support to the community in st helena which be of course crucial this be a long term consistent partnership we will support st helena by provide technical support and fund the transfer and subsistence cost for any migrant affect of course this be not the time that st helena have support the wide uk family the agreement be testament to its integral place in our family we thank it for its support 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question i must say that i be disappointed that once again the government have choose to make an important announcement outside this house not within it as they should 
 follow on from the government ’s shameful decision to fast track and capitulate on negotiation to hand over the british indian ocean territory to mauritius it be clear that the policy announce over the weekend be a rush consequence of a deal that do not serve british taxpayer well this aspect of the deal have not be properly scrutinise by this house and there have be no announcement on how we will scrutinise the wide issue of the transfer of sovereignty of the british indian ocean territory to another country 
 during the treaty negotiation be this plan discuss if the government be so keen on sign away sovereignty why be it not part of the deal that mauritius would take responsibility for illegal migrant and take they to mauritius from day be chagossians consult on the plan the foreign secretary say that they be update throughout but parliamentary question have reveal that not to be the case 
 finally how much will the deal cost and what department will be responsible will there be a drawdown of treasury fund or will the money come from foreign commonwealth and development office budget will the cost be add to the overall cost estimate for the sovereignty deal with mauritius do this plan signify a change of heart on the policy of offshore as a whole before labour mp stand up to espouse the deal and say how good it be they should remind themselves that in the election campaign they write in their leaflet that the offshoring of british citizen be immoral do this plan represent a change of policy from this government 
 i be sorry that the hon gentleman have take that tone i set out very clearly in my statement the answer to a number of point that he raise matter have also be set out very clearly by the st helena government they have indicate their full agreement in fact they be fully part of the process and there be full consultation with they this be a mutually beneficial win win for the uk government and st helena as i say the chief minister of st helena have say that it be in a unique position to help the uk government and this will strengthen its reputation and enhance its partnership with the british family 
 the hon gentleman ask a lot of question about the arrangement with mauritius the foreign secretary speak at great length about the arrangement with biot recently the agreement will go through this house in the proper way as have be set out and will face proper parliamentary scrutiny i be sure that it will attract scrutiny and that be only right as i explain this be a contingency agreement for the period before any agreement with mauritius come into place after that it will take any migrant the situation on biot be not suitable long term for migrant we have explain that at great length 
 i have to say that the government inherit a mess and we be take pragmatic sensible and proactive measure to address the situation i be hugely grateful to st helena for the role it be play this be a mutually beneficial win win the hon gentleman ask where the fund will come from they will come from the fcdo we already have a long term establish partnership with st helena and it have hugely welcome this plan it will help it to deal with a number of ongoing issue i have set out the detail fully the full detail of the agreement be also available from the st helena government 
 it be welcome to hear st helena mention in the house the money go there amount to an increase of about in financial aid from the uk this year which be sorely need in a community that be so challenge but will the minister explain how he will convey people from biot to st helena give the travel   difficulty and tell we what conversation he have have with the chief minister and her ministers about where these people will be accommodate if they do arrive 
 i thank my hon friend for her interest in st helena which have be long standing i understand that she visit the island recently and i welcome she ongoing engagement with the people and the government there we have make it clear that we would support the transfer of anyone who do arrive but let i reiterate that no have actually arrive on biot since this be a contingency measure only and of course it be not a safe place for people to attempt to go to this be about close that route and ensure that if anyone do make that attempt they could go to a safe place and be properly support the st helena government have make clear how they would accommodate and integrate people in that community 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for hamble valley paul holmes   for raise this important matter the whole house will welcome the government ’s sudden conversion to offshore even though this plan be not announce in the house in accordance with your specific instruction mr speaker i may be of the only members to have have the privilege of visit st helena along with the hon member for hackney north and shoreditch 
 i have 
 and you of course mr speaker we may have be the only members to survey the island ’s new airport which will in time relieve the british taxpayer of cost and open up the island to a very bright future with connectivity massively enhance 
 while i be in st helena i meet the oldest mammal on the planet bear a few year after napoleon ’s death jonathan the tortoise i also visit the island ’s impressive hospital which provide very good healthcare but be a small facility whose function have be specifically tailor to serve the commensurately small community of st helena the cohort of people who might arrive from diego garcia be likely to have medical need indeed as experience show quite complex medical need that will place additional pressure on st helena ’s healthcare infrastructure what will the minister do to help st helena with that 
 there be some disquiet among resident of st helena at the thought that an influx of migrant could have an adverse impact on social cohesion and social provision in this very tightly knit community what be the estimate number of migrant who will be send there bear in mind that the entire population be less than will the minister impose a limit admittedly low but nevertheless a limit have he make an assessment of how much this transfer policy will cost the british taxpayer of course conservative members do not oppose the principle of offshoring but we be perplex by the government ’s choice of destination a small british overseas territory thousand of mile from diego garcia   not least because a number of asylum seeker who land on the british indian ocean territory have already be transfer to rwanda labour have of course scrap the rwanda scheme so can the minister tell the house whether the government ’s approach have change and whether they welcome offshore as a means of inject deterrence into the complexity of illegal migration 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his comment and question he have always take a keen interest in the overseas territory and st helena in particular i be surprised that he be perplexed because he and his fellow ministers be grapple with these very decision and issue in the last government we be provide pragmatic and practical solution to respond to the situation that we inherit there be no comparison with the rwanda scheme he will have just hear the home secretary say that spend £ of taxpayer money result in volunteer for that scheme this be a mutually beneficial win win agreement between the united kingdom and of our overseas territory i have set out the cost very clearly £ for the contingency arrangement and then the cost for anyone who do arrive let i reiterate however that no migrant have arrive on biot since this be a contingency arrangement that be absolutely necessary but of course we hope that no will choose to take such a dangerous route 
 the right hon gentleman refer to the healthcare position that be exactly why st helena be a more suitable location for any theoretical migrant to be relocate to facility on that level do not exist on biot he mention that there be allegedly disquiet in st helena but that be simply not the case i read out very clearly what the st helena government and chief minister have say and there be huge benefit to this plan st helena be a wonderful place i have not have a chance to visit it but i have have a chance to experience its culture food and people and i look forward to welcome the chief minister to the joint ministerial council in due course 
 i be interested to hear how offshoring be be rebrande the rwanda scheme be a huge failure do the minister agree that any comparison between this plan and the rwanda scheme be rubbish the latter cost £ and result in volunteer be send to rwanda this be a far well scheme 
 my hon friend make the point himself in his question this be a mutually beneficial win win agreement between we and st helena whereas the other scheme cost £ and send volunteer to rwanda there be no comparison 
 we come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal democrats have already put on the record our concern about the deal that be strike with mauritius and how it exclude the voice of chagossians we also have concern about the term of the agreement what will happen to the individual who have be move to st helena after month elapse we can not just abandon they will the   minister update the house on what will happen if an agreement with mauritius have not be reach by the end of the month period 
 can the minister also update the house on the asylum seeker who have be detain on diego garcia such as the sri lankan tamils they be not in the scope of the agreement will the government support those individual in claim asylum where they need it 
 finally it have be report today that there be an investigation under way into a major hack of the british high commission ’s phone during the chagos island talk what action be the government take to address this potentially major security breach 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question as i say the foreign secretary answer question about the agreement with mauritius on biot early but the hon gentleman ask for further detail of the arrangement with st helena under the arrangement if any migrant arrive on biot in the future they will be transfer to st helena they will remain free to depart and to return to their country of origin but they will not be able to stay on biot st helena would take responsibility for accommodate those individual and if appropriate process asylum claim 
 the hon gentleman mention exist migrant on the island they be not include in this arrangement and we continue to work at pace to find long term durable solution i will not go into the detail that would be inappropriate give the legal complexity around the small group of individual who be there on his point about the medium coverage of alleged hack those be subject to an ongoing police investigation in mauritius so i do not want to comment but my understanding be that the allegation be historical rather than relate to the recent negotiation period 
 i really welcome the statement and the clarity that have come with it who will ultimately be responsible for people when they find themselves in st helena 
 i thank my hon friend for his question fundamentally as a result of this agreement st helena have agree to take responsibility for any theoretical migrant who arrive but i draw he back to what i say early mauritius would take responsibility for any migrant who arrive after the agreement of the treaty which we will seek to finalise follow parliamentary scrutiny 
 the minister really should understand that the british overseas territory be self govern democracy and they must make decision about their own island governance have the legislative council of st helena vote in favour of this agreement have the people of st helena be consult what impact will the influx of people potentially have on this small island territory of only people and will the agreement have any impact on tristan da cunha and ascension island which as the minister know form part of the overall british overseas territory 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i know he take a very keen interest in this matter we have discuss the overseas territory on   many occasion and he know how seriously i take their democracy and autonomy that be why it be important to reiterate to the house that this agreement be freely enter into by the government of st helena they have publicly welcome it profusely and explain why it be beneficial obviously they be responsible for their internal process within st helena we will continue to work with the government of st helena their representative and indeed their attorney general as we move forward with the agreement if i may i will come back to the hon gentleman on the point he raise about tristan da cunha and ascension but the agreement be primarily about st helena because of the facility that be available there 
 do the minister agree that the uk ’s new agreement with mauritius will close a potentially dangerous illegal migrant route 
 my hon friend be right biot be not a suitable place for migrant to be present there be no permanent population and there be not the necessary education and health facility that be why we need to put in place that part of our agreement with mauritius to ensure that during the interim contingency period be any migrant to arrive as i say none have arrive since they could go to a place where there be hospital education and an economy and a community to support they we thank st helena for its help in this matter 
 i call the father of the house
