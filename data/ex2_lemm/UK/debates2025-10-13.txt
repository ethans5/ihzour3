we know the very basic fact which be that the director of public prosecutions ask for a statement from the government to clarify that at the time of the offence china be a threat to national security he say in his   letter that such an assurance or evidence or a statement from the government be not forthcoming we know that the government withhold that vital element of the case the minister be shake his head but who decide that in the word of the dpp it would not be forthcoming somebody decide that he seem to be say that it be the deputy national security adviser who be somehow accountable for make those decision but i question that point to whom be they accountable if not the national security adviser 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to build more social and affordable home 
 what progress he have make on meet social housing target 
 what step he be take to build more social and affordable home 
 it be a privilege to be appoint as secretary of state for housing communities and local government may i start by pay tribute to my predecessor and former deputy prime minister my right hon friend   the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner for all she have do since the general election last year on worker right local government and building council home she make a real and lasting difference 
 in july the labour government publish a step plan to deliver the big increase in social and affordable housing in a generation and to transform the safety and quality of social home the affordable home programme will deliver to affordable home under the new £ social and affordable home programme we have set an ambition of new home over year we will set target after the initial bid 
 i be lucky enough to grow up in a council house in rochdale in a stable and secure home with an affordable rent but sadly that be an opportunity and a childhood deny to far too many child in my constituency today why because under the last year of the conservative government the number of family on the housing list treble do the secretary of state agree that reduce the number of child in temporary accommodation should be not just the mission of this government but the moral mission of this government 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight this incredibly important issue and for always champion his constituent in rochdale he be quite right to highlight the appalling record of the conservative party on temporary accommodation for family and child and on homelessness and rough sleeping our drive to build more social and affordable home will tackle its failure head on we will reduce homelessness level and the need for temporary accommodation by provide more secure and affordable home up and down the country with a particular focus on social rent include record number of new council home 
 i welcome the secretary of state to his position and declare an interest as a volunteer member of the cornwall community land trust the secretary of state will be well aware that a perfect storm have hit the construction industry as far as the delivery of social housing be concern tender forecast   be not encouraging homes england ’s scoring matrix be prove to be inflexible and the cost value ratio use by registered provider be not help and be provide a disincentive to deliver in the most deprived community there be thousand of home that community lead clt and other could be deliver now will the secretary of state meet i and fellow member of the community lead housing sector otherwise we will be wait another year to get shovel ready affordable home off the ground 
 i be always happy to meet the hon gentleman and other on issue as important as this i have the pleasure of visit newlyn in his constituency not so long ago and some of those issue be make apparent to i by people live in the area we announce top up to the affordable home programme in the autumn and the spring and in march we announce £ as a downpayment for the new social and affordable home programme which be now open for bid homes england can and do vary grant rate on the basis of bid from social housing provider importantly the available £ cover a range of tenure include community lead housing i would expect and hope to see increase in the way that he have describe 
 the only way to solve the housing crisis be as my right hon friend so articulately put it to build baby build in my constituency of east worthing and shoreham the median wage be £ but the median house price have soar to more than time that what will the government do to ensure that social and affordable home be build for my constituent who desperately need they 
 i thank my hon friend for his work on this issue and i be sorry he be not wear the red cap i see he wear in liverpool recently highlight this very important issue the government have commit £ to a new year affordable home programme that will deliver around home with at least for social rent the most affordable tenure we have commit to the big boost to social and affordable housing in a generation and we be back council and housing association to build at scale so that community such as his in east worthing and shoreham get the home they need at cost that people can afford to pay 
 there be over family on gosport borough council ’s waiting list for social housing yet despite take power a few year ago the liberal democrat council have not build a single extra council house meanwhile the complaint i get in my mailbag about the substandard quality of council accommodation grow more and more every single week what be the secretary of state do to encourage such inadequate council to build a great quantity and well quality of council accommodation 
 the hon lady will be aware that the government have reintroduce home building target that be scrap by the previous government it be important that we have those target and that they be achievable and council will be hold to account to achieve they i be work on an acceleration package to encourage more building in which local authority   will be key partner and we will make announcement on that in due course of course the hon lady will be aware of the change we be make to drive up standard in council and other social housing which we will insist be enforce and carry through 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it fall to i to open the bowling for the opposition front bench so i congratulate the right hon gentleman on his appointment and welcome he to his place today 
 the previous government award the mayor of london almost £ of funding to build a total of affordable home in london the tranche of that money amount to £ which be to build home between and to date only have be complete with of those home be acquisition rather than newly build what plan do the secretary of state have to hold the mayor of london to account for this lamentable failure 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his kind word but i think it be disingenuous to blame the mayor of london for failing that be the fault of the previous conservative government and i be afraid current conservative borough in london such as bromley which be a shocking behind its house building target we can not tolerate that 
 the previous government choke off house building everywhere by scrap house building target and crash the economy send mortgage through the roof so that people could not afford to buy new home of course the shadow secretary of state   the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly be a major cheerleader for the prime minister who carry that through in the last year of the previous government housing consent collapse by it be this government who will take the step to remediate that situation this government who will get new home build and this government who will work with local government partner across the whole country include here in london to ensure that the home this country need be build 
 the whole house will have hear that the secretary of state have no plan to intervene on the mayor of london under section of the greater london authority act the secretary of state have the power to direct the mayor of london to review and revise specific policy of the london plan if they be see to be hinder housing delivery there be a plethora of policy include an obsession with dual facing and twin staircasing and a bizarre aversion to corridor that developer be unite in say be massively hinder development in the country ’s large city which have the high demand for affordable housing the secretary of state be hold all the card and the purse string why will he not intervene 
 i do recognise the challenge the hon gentleman have outline they should concern we all and i thank he for raise they he will be aware that we be make legislative change right now with the planning and infrastructure bill that be go through parliament to speed up the planning system that be   hold back so many home from be build we will be table further amendment to the bill to tackle some of the challenge the hon gentleman be talk about 
 i be work with the greater london authority and the mayor of london on an acceleration package that target london in particular we will make announcement on that within week and the hon gentleman will then see the action that we intend to take here in the capital city to ensure that home building continue apace we will also be look nationally because every region of the country need new home build to meet people ’s dream of have somewhere affordable to rent or buy 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in ming campbell launch the liberal democrats campaign for not just affordable but decent home for our military i congratulate the secretary of state on his position will he join i in congratulate the force family who back my amendment to provide they with a decent home standard and will he agree that they deserve nothing less 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his kind word i agree that the change that have be make we have manage to come to a consensus on this be very important and will make a big difference to force family and veteran which we all want to see i congratulate and commend the hon gentleman on working cross party to ensure an outcome that will be satisfactory to everybody who be concerned about this issue as he be 
 what information his department hold on the proportion of people grant asylum status live in the private rented sector 
 my department do not hold datum on the proportion of people who have be grant asylum status live in the private rent sector in england 
 it be extraordinary that the minister do not have that answer too many asylum seeker be arrive in our community far too quickly because the government have fail on their promise to smash their gang people have have enough and this labour government do not seem to have any answer what action will the minister take to support local community and public service to deal with the grow number of asylum seeker in our community 
 i be afraid i will take no lecture from the hon gentleman as it be the previous conservative government in which he serve as a minister who lose control of our border and preside over the complete breakdown of the asylum system this government be restore order to that system speed up decision make and reform the appeal process to cut the asylum backlog and remove those with no right to be here at a much fast rate than the previous government our country have a proud history of provide sanctuary to those flee persecution   genuine asylum seeker who have be grant refugee or humanitarian protection status should be welcome the hon gentleman would have say the same some year ago and it be a sign of just how far his party have fall that he can not now bring himself to do so 
 i call the shadow minister 
 despite that answer it be clear that thing be get bad our council be battle with the cost of this government ’s border failure the rise in small boat arrival combine now with chagossians arrive in rise number throw themselves at the mercy of our local authority as they escape starmer ’s sell out be stretch council housing budget to breaking point the government have refuse to answer my write question about what financial support they provide to council housing asylum seeker and refugee who be grant asylum in their area can the minister tell the house how much of the propose rise in council tax be for the cost of the government ’s asylum failure and will he publish the full cost and support in the interest of transparency 
 the hon gentleman be conflate separate issue genuine asylum seeker who have be grant refugee status and who can stand on their own foot and work will rent in some case in the private rent sector and in other case in market housing some dispersal accommodation for those seek asylum will of course be in the private rented sector and that can add pressure to local rental market that be why decision must be make in co ordination with local authority and take into account local housing pressure more importantly that be why the reduction in hotel use need to be proceed with in an ordered and manage way not the chaotic way that the conservatives have be call for 
 what step he plan to take to ensure that new housing development have adequate access to infrastructure 
 the national planning policy framework set out that 
 the purpose of the planning system be to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development include the provision of support infrastructure in a sustainable manner 
 we make change to the framework in december last year that will support the increase provision and modernisation of various type of public infrastructure local development plan should address need and opportunity in relation to infrastructure and identify what infrastructure be require and how it can be fund and bring forward 
 in my constituency we have see promise of new school and clinic repeatedly break but in every case it be not the developer or local council that let people down but national body such as the department for education and integrated care board they do it to save money by cram more kid into exist school and more patient into pack clinic in the light of the   extra house that have just be announce by the chancellor for horsham district will the minister meet i to discuss how we can legally ensure that key local infrastructure promise be meet 
 the hon gentleman know that i be always happy to sit down and talk to he about these and other issue it must be say that when prepare a local plan plan practice guidance recommend that local planning authority use available evidence of infrastructure requirement to prepare an infrastructure funding statement local authority be not do that in all case which be why the chief planner write to all local planning authority recently to remind they of their statutory duty to do so we can discuss that and other issue when i meet he 
 new housing development agree under the previous government have be build on the green belt around village in the shipley constituency such as burley in wharfedale wilsden denholme and cullingworth often without the vital investment in infrastructure such as gp practice school and other council service will the minister reassure my constituent that as we build the much need affordable and social home we will prioritise brownfield and ensure adequate investment in the community 
 i can give my hon friend that assurance ours be a brownfield policy she highlight an important point the previous government release vast swathe of the green belt in a haphazard and chaotic manner we be take a strategic approach to green belt release prioritise the release of the low quality grey belt and we be ensure that where that happen subject to our golden rule we see high level of affordable housing and infrastructure it be a much smart approach the previous government do not adopt it and they should stop carp about it now 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential merit of require water company to be statutory consultee for new housing development 
 water company be not statutory consultee on individual planning application but they be consult as part of the preparation of local development plan on   january the government declare a moratorium on any new statutory consultee and announce a review of the exist statutory consultee arrangement a consultation on proposal design to limit the scope of statcon to where advice be strictly necessary and to remove entirely a limited number of they will be publish in the near future 
 outdated sewer system mix clean rainwater with sewage pollute river and place strain on outdated infrastructure if the government be intent on not make water company statutory consultees a national rainwater management strategy mandate rainwater harvesting on new home and major renovation would ease the pressure on infrastructure   and reduce the likelihood of sewage overflow what recent conversation have the minister have with the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs about introduce a national rainwater management strategy will he consider make rainwater harvesting a mandatory requirement on new housing development 
 the hon gentleman raise an apt point i regularly meet colleague from the department for environment food and rural affairs to discuss a range of issue include water efficiency and management i draw his attention to the consultation we launch just last month to review the water efficiency standard in the building regulations as part of that we be investigate how we can bring technology such as rainwater harvesting into new development safely 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of devolution on economic growth 
 devolution to strong local leader who understand the economic opportunity and challenge in their patch have clear economic benefit it can drive high productivity boost local economy and put more money in people ’s pocket for example greater manchester which be far along in its devolution journey have of the uk ’s fast grow local economy 
 i be pleased to see that the government be press ahead with their commitment to implement new strategic authority may i press the minister to consider how those new strategic authority can grow their local economy by provide support for thing like community business and social enterprise in town centre help to regenerate and renovate the neglect high street we see across the country 
 my hon friend be completely right to highlight that there be a huge opportunity for strategic authority to support community business co operative and social enterprise to help regenerate and revitalise our town centre and build community wealth we be already see that across the country we see it in liverpool city region where significant investment be go into community business we be keen to build on this opportunity and to unlock it across the country 
 devolution be start off well in north yorkshire but north yorkshire council be really concerned about the upcoming local government settlement which will obviously be challenge for all council may i urge the secretary of state in his new role to look carefully at the most rural county in england and the particular challenge that it have in deliver service 
 we be look closely at every area we know that local government be go through the process of reorganisation at the same time as we be   do devolution we be do that at pace but we be do it in strong collaboration work closely with individual area 
 we welcome devolution in london but the ability of local council like mine in wandsworth to tackle growth could be undermine by the change propose in the fair funding review in wandsworth of resident and of child live in poverty after housing cost will the minister consider make adjustment to the propose funding formula to properly account for housing and child ’s service and ensure that no council be bad off as a result of the review 
 we have consult on the fair funding review my colleague the minister for local government and homelessness be look at proposal at the moment and we will report back in due course 
 devolution can have huge benefit for local people use £ of funding from the last government stockton on tees borough council have bring forward proposal to change yarm high street but the council have completely fail to properly consult and work with local resident and business in develop the proposal so what could be an opportunity have become a nightmare do the minister agree that such change should be do with local resident and business and not force upon they 
 per cent devolution offer the opportunity to put community in the drive seat and give they genuine power for example this government ’s pride in place programme put community right at the centre because we think that be how to ensure that community come together to drive the change that they want to see in their area we encourage all council to work closely with their local community to make that change happen 
 what step he be take to support the building of social housing in rural town and village 
 the £ social and affordable home programme will support a wide range of social and affordable housing include council housing support housing community lead housing and of course rural housing the government will also consider how planning policy can well promote rural affordable housing through our work on national policy which will be bring forward for decision making later in the year 
 i thank the secretary of state for that response cornwall have be give an ambitious annual target of home and i sincerely hope that a large proportion of those will be for the cornish family on the housing waiting list i meet so many constituent in social and private housing who have be leave high and dry by dodgy developer who go into liquidation before they can deliver vital infrastructure   such as road and sewerage work will the secretary of state please meet i to discuss the enforcement tool that local authority need to properly hold those developer to account 
 i certainly recognise the problem that the hon member describe it be an issue in north cornwall and right across the country on the developer contribution we be look at how we can strengthen enforcement so that where commitment be make they be deliver on and local community be not strand and leave high and dry because the vital infrastructure to support the home never appear 
 what step he be take to bring long term empty home back into occupation 
 welcome minister 
 thank you very much mr speaker the government want more empty home bring back into use across the country include through the step we outline in the english devolution white paper to strengthen local authority ability to take over the management of vacant residential premise 
 i welcome the minister to her new role will the government consider introduce a policy whereby long term empty property bring back into use as home will count towards a district ’s housing target 
 local authority have a number of power to deal with empty home the hon member raise an interesting point which i will take away and consider with official 
 there be long term empty property in the community of park end in my constituency park end desperately need regeneration so i be delighted that the government have award it £ of pride in place funding for the community to use for regeneration over the long term will the government commit to work with i to make sure that the local community get the good from that funding 
 absolutely i be really encourage by the way that local community be seize the opportunity of pride in place funding and take it forward to deal with an issue that affect every council across the country 
 whether he plan to include community lead housing within the long term housing strategy 
 the government recognise that community lead housing deliver a wide range of benefit we strengthen   support for it in the revise national planning policy framework publish last year and in march we announce a year social finance investment to provide capital funding for community lead housing as part of the development of our long term housing strategy we be consider how the government might far support the growth of the sector 
 redwood housing co operative span floor of social housing in the iconic oxo tower on the south bank of the river thames give that redwood be run by its tenant charge some of the low rent in central london and offer some of the good view should not every community have a redwood 
 my hon friend have long champion co operative and i recognise his commitment to expand co op in london and across the country with that example he draw our attention to the benefit that they can provide we be consider opportunity to legislate to establish a legal framework for a co operative housing tenure which would help formalise the right and responsibility of both co operative and their tenant and make co operative housing a more attractive option as my hon friend will know i be more than happy to discuss the matter with he far at a suitable opportunity in the near future 
 in my chichester constituency a lack of available land drive high density scheme in rural village that lack the necessary infrastructure and the scheme quickly become unpopular locally community land trust such as the westbourne land trust gain local support and deliver affordable home and that give community a real stake in that development do the minister agree that community buy in be essential if the government be to reach their target for building home what step be be take to help community land trust go from the planning phase to building home 
 the hon lady outline another benefit of community land trust get local buy in the availability of land be an issue for clt i have already set out some of the way that we be support they through new investment as the secretary of state say early the new social and affordable housing programme will be design with the flexibility necessary to support a great diversity of social and affordable housing supply include community lead housing 
 what assessment he have make of the potential merit of the capital funding request from the coalfields regeneration trust 
 we recognise the excellent work be do by the coalfields regeneration trust and remain committed to work with it as my hon friend will know the current fiscal position remain challenge it be in that context that we be consider funding request 
 the coalfields regeneration trust be ask for £ to support local initiative that deliver training course and community cohesion at ward level i have speak to the trust about support constituent of mine in ex coalfield community in swadlincote by improve the confidence of people on long term benefit so that they can build towards get pay work and about provide activity that support community cohesion i recently visit bloomin gardens landscapes in church gresley people there tell i that they be concern about the lack of interest in career in gardening and horticulture what can the minister do to help i help my constituent by ensure that they have opportunity in gardening and horticulture and can improve their community 
 the government remain committed to support ex coalfield community such as those in my hon friend ’s constituency and to tackle the decline and neglect we see under the conservative party it be our party that establish the coalfields regeneration trust in and we be commit to work with it to support our coalfield community that come alongside our wide effort to invest in community that be hold back under the conservative party through our trailblaze pride in place programme 
 rise 
 i be intrigue to hear how coalfield regeneration relate to the hon gentleman ’s part of northern ireland i call jim shannon 
 thank you mr speaker i thank the minister for that answer the fact be that there be coalfield in northern ireland there have be an opportunity 
 order so the hon gentleman be say that he have coalfield in his constituency interruption okay i be go to allow the question but i ask that we think about whether issue be relevant to our constituency 
 the question of who benefit from coalfield in the past be always relevant to people in northern ireland other part of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland have experience coalfield regeneration and people have come back from those area on the mainland to northern ireland can we ensure that everyone have an equal opportunity to benefit from this these benefit have be bring forward in england bring they forward in northern ireland as well 
 i be not sure that that be relevant 
 we recognise that we need to support community across the country who have be hold back we be work with the northern ireland office to make sure that support be available for community to renew and regenerate so that they have the power to drive the change that they want to see 
 what step he be take to reduce youth homelessness 
 what recent progress the inter ministerial group on homelessness and rough sleeping have make on the development of a cross government strategy to end homelessness 
 the government inherit a homelessness crisis there be record number of people in temporary accommodation and rough sleeping have double that be why my predecessor get together the inter ministerial group on homelessness very quickly it have meet time and have establish the principle of the strategy have seek full input from across government that strategy be on its way but just last week the government announce a furth £ in this financial year to support people who be sleep rough or who be homeless 
 the minister ’s announcement be welcome but last year in england and wales of the people who be find to be at risk of homelessness or be experience homelessness be age just to that number be far too high will the minister agree to meet the ymca and the youth homeless chapter collective to discuss the action need to support young people and reduce homelessness for good 
 i congratulate my hon friend on share those figure with the house because even though it be quite hard to hear they it be important that we do not look away from this crisis i will of course meet she and the charity she mention 
 as the minister may know milton keynes use to be call tent city we reduce the number of rough sleeper down to when i be deputy leader at the council we be able to do that because we understand that rough sleeping be more than just a housing issue it be a whole person issue be she willing to meet i and the other officer of the all party parliamentary group on rough sleeping as well as back bench members who have experience in this area while shape and deliver the rough sleeping strategy 
 i be aware of my hon friend ’s work and the work of milton keynes council and other in the city to bring down the number of rough sleeper we will take that whole person approach in the homelessness strategy i never knowingly avoid a meeting with an appg so i be sure that we will get that arrange shortly 
 reduce youth homelessness rely on have an effective work housing market of course my right hon friend   the member for north west essex mrs badenoch   understand that and that be why she have pledge that a future conservative government will abolish stamp duty on primary residence she have also say that she be   happy for the idea to be steal and adopt by other party it would reduce the cost of house buying in beverley and holderness by around £ a real boost for young family try to get on the housing ladder will the minister say to the secretary of state and indeed the chancellor adopt this policy and do it now 
 the party of liz truss just do not learn do it the conservatives be happy to make tax policy that be absolute fantasy people need real home to live in not this kind of thing and the conservatives simply will not get a hearing until they look at their record and learn to say sorry 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i welcome the secretary of state and his ministers to their position i very much look forward to welcome they to meeting of the select committee we be a fair and robust committee the minister highlight the inter ministerial group which the former secretary of state chair and see as be very important the issue cut across all departmental group it be important because within month as we go into the next year and in the next financial year we will see over young child in temporary accommodation in homelessness that should worry all of we the inter ministerial group have meet time can the minister confirm that the group will continue to be convene and if it will who will chair it 
 the chair of the select committee make the case extremely well if anybody in this chamber be not worried about temporary accommodation they be not pay attention that be how serious this be it be terrible for our kid and for the taxpayer because it be so expensive i will follow up with she a lot of work have already be do on the homelessness strategy we want to get it confirm as soon as possible i will engage fully with the select committee on the strategy to ensure that we get it right and we will come back to she shortly with the detail of how we will do that together 
 every night over child be homeless in my city they be either in temporary accommodation or even bad off do the minister agree that this be totally unacceptable for a modern society and that the government must bring forward its cross departmental plan to tackle youth homelessness 
 i refer the hon gentleman to what i just say to the chair of the select committee but let i confirm again that any child in temporary accommodation particularly b&b accommodation who have not get enough space to do their homework pay the price not just through what they be go through today but in the future we can not accept that we can not stand for it and we should work together across this house to bring this to an end 
 thank to the action of the previous government and council up and down the country of rough sleeper be get off the street at the beginning of the pandemic   and half year ago tragically since then most of those people young and old have return to rough sleeping in constituency like mine street homelessness be not so obvious people be live and sleep in wood ruin and so on yet the tragedy be still there what lesson can the minister and the government learn from that rapid removal of homeless people from the street in so that they can implement it again 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point homelessness can be about rough sleeping but there be also hide homelessness our forthcoming strategy need to consider all that in the round he ask i what lesson i take from what happen a few year ago and i would argue from how we reduce rough sleeping in the past i would say that politics be about choice we take the choice last week to invest in year an extra £ in prevent and address homelessness that be the right thing to ensure that everybody in this country be safe and have a roof over their head 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the minister to her place youth and overall homelessness have increase since the government take office and charity have be harm by policy such as the national insurance rise impose by the chancellor we welcome the additional money that the government have allocate for tackle homelessness this winter but it be an admission that they have fail in their pledge to reduce homelessness the former minister have a novel touch and send the figure the wrong way i will ask this minister the same question that i ask in the previous session do she accept that homelessness have rise under this government and will she commit to eliminate it by the end of this parliament 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his word of welcome i refer he to the comment that i make to colleague the homelessness strategy be on its way i be afraid that we could not overturn year of wrong choice in the time that we have have in office that be not realistic but our strategy on its way if there be cross party support for go much far to reduce the use of temporary accommodation and ensure that everyone have a roof over their head i will happily work with he to do that together 
 what step his department be take to support local authority to build social housing in buckingham and bletchley constituency 
 the government have take decisive action to improve the capacity of all local authority include those in buckingham and bletchley to build more social housing include through our new £ social and affordable home programme the new year social housing rent settlement and right to buy reform so that we can reverse the decline see under the previous government 
 the on time on budget delivery of new council home for local family on the lakes estate in bletchley be a good demonstration of what labour can achieve in local government be my right hon friend willing to visit bletchley over the come week and month to discuss how further investment from the social and affordable home programme could help ambitious pro housebuilde council like milton keynes to go even far for local people 
 i be sure that it will come as no surprise to my hon friend that i wholeheartedly welcome the delivery of new council home in his constituency i fully agree that the lakes estate demonstrate the ambition of milton keynes city council to build the home that its community want and need i also value such council support in help the government to meet our ambitious housebuilding target which include target for the big boost to social and affordable housing in this country in a generation 
 what step he plan to take to ensure that new housing development in cheadle constituency have adequate access to infrastructure 
 as per my answer to question the change that we make to national planning policy last year be intend to support the increase provision and modernisation of various type of public infrastructure when it come to ensure that necessary infrastructure be fund and bring forward in cheadle or any other part of the country we look to local development plan and infrastructure funding statement to address need and opportunity 
 resident in cheadle have contact i about the huge number of speculative development application come through particularly in cheadle hulme and woodford we be now be tell that a home new town will potentially be situate on the constituency border gps be completely oversubscribed in woodford we have not have a sunday rail service in over a year and the bus service be completely inadequate this have be raise time and again by my constituent will the minister meet i and the leader of stockport council to talk about this issue and how the government can get developer to start invest in infrastructure before they develop home 
 the hon gentleman have raise a number of issue the good way in which local planning authority can protect themselves from speculative development be to have an up to date local development plan in place he touch on developer contribution we remain committed to strengthen the exist system to ensure that new development provide the necessary affordable home and infrastructure we will set out further detail in due course 
 when it come to the prospective new town that the hon gentleman mention i gently point out that it be not the government but the independent expert new town taskforce that recommend to the government that adlington and other location in england should   be the site for the next generation of new town on   september we commence a strategic environmental assessment to understand the environmental implication of new town and that will support final decision but no final decision have yet be take 
 order i should say that that be the adlington in cheshire not lancashire 
 what step he plan to take to reform the leasehold system 
 what step his department be take to increase leaseholder protection 
 the government continue to implement those reform to the leasehold system that be already in statute and to progress the wide set of reform necessary to end the feudal leasehold system for good we have bring into force a number of provision in the leasehold and freehold reform act with more in the pipeline and we remain on course to publish an ambitious draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill later this year 
 leaseholder in my constituency face unfair practice such as management fee triple in as many year stretch family beyond their mean yet there be also a great number of responsible agent include l&a lettings base in ashmore park can the minister set out how the government ’s leasehold reform will strike the right balance protect leaseholder from poor practice without overburden responsible agent who already provide a transparent and fair service 
 we know that there be good manage agent who work hard to ensure that the resident they be responsible for be safe and secure and that home be properly look after but we also know that far too many leaseholder suffer from poor service at the hand of unscrupulous managing agent in our recent consultation on strengthen leaseholder protection over charge and service we consult on power to appoint a manager or replace a manage agent as well as on mandatory professional qualification for manage agent in england we think that those proposal strike the right balance but we be analyse all the feedback we receive to that consultation 
 i thank the minister for his answer to the previous question in my constituency of bury st edmunds and stowmarket leaseholder be face soar service charge and fall standard some have tell i that they be consider withhold payment do my hon friend agree that much great regulation of property manager be urgently need to ensure accountability and standard 
 my hon friend highlight that as many of we know the reality of home ownership for so many leaseholder fall far short of the dream we absolutely agree that we need to strengthen the   regulation of manage agent to drive up the standard of their service we be look again at lord best ’s report on regulate the property agent sector particularly in the light of the recommendation in the final grenfell inquiry report we have set out a number of specific proposal in the consultation that i refer to in my previous answer our preferred approach in implement mandatory professional qualification be for agent to belong to a designated body but all final decision will be take in due course 
 as the minister will be aware some freeholder find themselves trap in a leasehold like situation the wide estate that they live on be manage by a management company and not adopt by the local authority they be fleece in exactly the same way by exorbitant management charge and there be often unadopted road and poor sewerage will the minister meet i to discuss how we can provide protection for freeholder who find themselves in that leasehold situation 
 we remain committed to protect residential freeholder on private and mixed tenure housing estate from unfair charge of the type that the hon lady describe we will consult this year on implement the act ’s new consumer protection provision for the home that be subject to those charge we be committed to bring those measure into force as quickly as possible 
 thousand of my constituent in stratford on avon now live in so call fleecehold development often with a lack of transparency in how service charge be set and a lack of maintenance of public open space include drainage infrastructure will the minister reassure my constituent that any leasehold reform will include tackle fleecehold and that the reform will be apply retrospectively 
 i can assure the hon lady that we will tackle the injustice of fleecehold as part of the ambitious change that we intend to make to the leasehold system with a view to bring it to an end in this parliament the consumer protection provision in the act which i have already mention will ensure that homeowner who pay an estate management charge will have well access to the information that they need to challenge the reasonableness of charge at the tier tribunal there be other power as part of those protection and as i have say we will consult on they shortly and bring they into force as quickly as possible thereafter 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 my no priority be to get britain build again we will build baby build that mean put britain on a path to end the moral stain of homelessness and rough sleeping that double under the previous conservative government grow our economy with good secure job and rise income   in every region of britain and put the key to home ownership in the hand of more people across our country under the conservatives the british dream of home ownership become a nightmare and out of reach but with this labour government it will become a reality once more 
 my constituent in oldham east and saddleworth be delighted to learn that oldham have receive a £ award from the pride in place programme will the secretary of state expand on the transformational change that the award will mean to place like oldham where government support be decimate under the conservative in particular what difference will be make by local people have a say in how the money will be spend 
 i thank my hon friend the chair of the work and pensions committee for her work in support disadvantaged neighbourhood in oldham and her strong support for the pride in place programme which offer a significant amount of long term flexible funding and support to area like oldham good of all it be local people who will take the decision about what the investment need to look like to make a real difference to their high street public service and public transport so that they can take back pride in the place they belong 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 nobody but nobody believe that home will be build under this government although the minister for local government and homelessness   the hon member for birkenhead alison mcgovern spend a lot of time at the dispatch box she do not answer the question about whether the treasury will be ask to scrap stamp duty we know that people say that they would consider downsize if stamp duty be abolish free up family home of all size she would not answer so i ask the secretary of state directly will he ask the treasury to scrap stamp duty yes or no 
 i know that the right hon gentleman be a strong supporter of liz truss when she stand for leadership of the conservative party but surely he can not have forget what she do she make multibillion pound unfunded spending commitment that crash the economy and send wage down and price mortgage and rent skyrocket the last thing this country need be ten of billion of pound of more unfunded commitment crash the economy again and destroy people ’s dream of home ownership 
 order there be lot of back benchers who wish to speak and this be topical question i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i ask for a simple yes or no but the right hon gentleman struggle to give that the truth be that we have outline exactly where the money could come from and we have make it clear that if those on the labour front bench have the gut to take on their back benchers they will have the support of conservative members in make the expenditure cut that be need the london school of economics have estimate that £ of economic activity come with   every house purchase so if he will not agree to cut stamp duty will he at least agree to not put up property taxis 
 i have to say again that the right hon gentleman ’s devotion to trussonomics be admirable particularly give that we have already see it fail once we hear from the shadow chancellor that the conservatives would put up income tax if they win the general election they put it up to the high level since the world war we be not go there 
 tory cut to local authority cruelly cause lasting damage to many community what a contrast to the government ’s pride in place programme award to park end and thorntree in middlesbrough which will change life for the well do the secretary of state agree that council tax equalisation and a new child ’s formula be essential element to fully deliver for those community that be totally overlook by the conservatives 
 it be important that we get that right and we will have further discussion about it shortly i might disagree with my hon friend on the importance of pride in place which will turn around some of the decline create by the conservative party 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in june the department make the welcome announcement of legislation to allow proxy voting and remote attendance which will help to drive up the diversity of councillor across the country but the government have not yet set out a timeline will the minister advise the house on when a timeline will be share and whether the government have consider include the change in the english devolution and community empowerment bill 
 the government be commit to an election bill which will be come in due course very shortly i imagine and i be sure the hon member will be able to explore those issue far at that time 
 in tory run dudley council enter an agreement with a social housing developer but later pull the plug and sell off the land so we may not get those much need home what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that council maximise opportunity to build affordable and social home on land own by council 
 i be sorry to learn about the loss of social rent home in that instance i can assure my hon friend that the government be commit to reinvigorate council house building and i direct her attention to the point plan that we publish in july to deliver a decade of renewal for social and affordable housing 
 whether essex end up with or authority under the local government reform my constituent will certainly come under an authority that be no long local as part of the reform will more power be devolve to town and parish council that be able to understand and properly reflect their local resident 
 local government reorganisation will create opportunity to improve public service efficiency and clarity the final proposal from council in essex be submit by   september and we anticipate launch a statutory consultation in november i be sure we will discuss the right hon gentleman ’s point in detail over the week and month to come 
 across the sheffield city council area include my penistone and stocksbridge constituency people be wait for council home that be a legacy of the conservative government in coalition make it more difficult for empty home to be bring back into residential use will the minister work with sheffield city council and i to ensure that it have increase resource and power to expedite bring empty home back into use so that my constituent and those across the authority can stay near but go far 
 as i iterate early we want to see more empty home bring back into use in sheffield and across the country as we outline in the english devolution white paper we intend to strengthen the ability of local authority such as sheffield city council to take over the management of vacant residential premise 
 we in leicestershire have if not plan for our reorganisation with no agreement we also have a county council run by reform which have already have not but reshuffle lose its cabinet lead for social service and finance while of its budget be spend on social service and special educational need and disability what assurance can the government give i that my constituent will get those service and that those service will be protect when there already seem to be chaos in the council 
 as i mention some moment ago reorganisation create an opportunity for simple and clear local service i look forward to work with member across the house to get it right particularly in tackle some of the issue that the hon gentleman mention 
 another vape shop open on of my high street in bassetlaw last week and yet another open in a vacate bank less than a month ago people tell i and i tend to agree with they that nobody know how those shop will sustain an income to keep they go what be the government do to take on rogue trader 
 my hon friend be completely right to raise this issue that be why we be give local community great power to control the proliferation of gambling and vape shop it be also why through our pride in place programme   we be give community the funding and tool they need to shape their local high street so that those community can have the shop they want in their place 
 my constituent steve dally be charge £ by liberal democrat control waverley borough council for the apparent crime of build a home extension i meet the housing minister early this year to talk about abuse of the community infrastructure levy could he update the house on his plan to stop it 
 as the right hon gentleman know i agree that we have see unintended consequence of the cil regulation they have unfairly penalise some homeowner i can only reiterate the commitment i give he during that meeting in principle we be commit to find a solution to this issue and i be more than happy to meet he again and update he on the step we have take in the interim 
 up and down the country people be be price out of their community by sky high rent and extortionate housing cost in wandsworth the rent for a bed flat will cost the average londoner almost half of their monthly take home pay do the minister agree that we must put an end to this situation and make housing affordable again 
 we absolutely need to make housing affordable of the primary way in which we can do that be to build more home of all tenure which be precisely what we be commit to do we can also boost the supply of social and affordable housing which our social and affordable housing programme worth £ over year will do 
 winter be come and nearly household be live in fuel poverty which be an absolute scandal the long await warm home plan can not come soon enough but give that previous piecemeal programme prioritise private profit and leave we without the change that our constituent so desperately need will the secretary of state commit to fund a public body to co ordinate monitor and evaluate a nationwide programme of home insulation to hold cowboy builder cowboy contractor to account and deliver energy saving for all 
 i will refer the hon lady ’s comment about the warm home plan to the secretary of state for energy security and net if she wish to write to i with detail of any particular cowboy builder i would be more than happy to read what she have to say 
 it be great that we be transform leasehold property but many leaseholder be now stick in a gap with their freeholder when it come to betterment if they want to green their home through new roof new insulation and electric vehicle charging they have to pay a huge extra cost will the minister and if necessary ministers from the department for energy security and net meet i and my constituent to discuss this issue there be a real gap when it come to achieve green improvement 
 i would be more than happy to do so 
 in april the government describe their decision to approve a major scheme to unlock over home next to cambridge north station after year in planning as nationally significant just month later the government scrap the whole thing how be that consistent with the secretary of state ’s announcement that he will back get britain build 
 i be afraid that i be unclear about which particular site the right hon gentleman be refer to again if he wish to write to i i would be more than happy to engage with he on the particular of that case 
 cornwall ’s economic potential be vast cornish renewable energy and critical mineral can power the uk ’s transition away from a fossil fuel base economy but economic development funding through the share prosperity fund have come to an end can the secretary of state reassure the people of cornwall that our economic growth will not be limit by the fact that cornwall can not and will not join a mayoral combine authority 
 we recognise the uniqueness of cornwall we be commit to work with the local authority to ensure that we unlock the economic opportunity in the area and build on its exist devolution deal 
 the secretary of state and the other ministers on the front bench have to great fanfare today talk about responsible governance but basildon council and its labour leader have repeatedly fail to meet basic housing standard worse than that its leader have go live on social medium to admit to count postal vote and use that information to influence a recent by election when he be hold to account will minister agree to throw he out of their party 
 i be unclear about the exact detail of what the hon member be raise but if he would like to write to i or the secretary of state provide detail we will make sure that he receive a swift response 
 south shore in my constituency be of the most deprived area in the country it have just be name by the independent commission on neighbourhoods which outline mission critical neighbourhood as no for hyper local need will the secretary of state meet i to discuss how we can improve south shore in blackpool 
 i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss his concern 
 what commitment can the minister give to my constituent in thurmaston syston queniborough and nearby village who wish to remain in the county of leicestershire and have service provide in leicestershire that they will not against their wish be absorb into the city of leicester as advocate by labour ’s city mayor in the context of local government reorganisation 
 i respond to the right hon member ’s colleague from leicestershire   the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans just a moment ago and i refer he to that answer we have a process under way and i will be engage with colleague right across the house on it if the right hon member would like to get in touch with i directly i would be happy to receive his representation 
 i be pleased that everton east in my constituency will receive £ in pride in place funding do my hon friend agree that the pride in place programme not only talk about devolution but deliver it 
 my hon friend be completely right we have a decade and a half of decline and neglect under the last government this government be get to grip with it i thank my hon friend for her enthusiasm and for work together to make this impact and to drive the change we want to see across our community 
 the government have now delay their decision on local government reorganisation in surrey can the minister assure i that the government be use this delay to protect my constituent in esher and walton from the tory debt of neighbouring council with which they might be group will the plan election in may go ahead 
 as i have say a number of time on different aspect of this policy the process be under way if the hon member would like to write to i directly i will make sure that she receive a response 
 i know that minister do not comment on ongoing planning application but may i draw the minister ’s attention to an inconsistency currently the department for environment food and rural affairs be change its guidance on heather burn on deep peat because of climate change concern but there have not be a concurrent change to plan guidance on building on peat will the minister agree to look at that so that my constituent can be sure that any development be safe and take account of climate implication 
 i thank my hon friend for bring that matter to my attention he be right that i can not comment on individual planning application but i will certainly look into the matter i wonder whether he would write to i with further detail in that regard 
 do the government accept that it be possible to bring in elect mayor and new strategic authority without forcibly merge county and district council in unwanted cumbersome and remote unitary authority 
 there be process go ahead the devolution process drive by economic imperative to unlock the growth prospect across the country and the reorganisation process which be be do to ensure that we have more streamlined and effective public service we be do those in tandem because the last government fail to get a grip of local government structure and the funding pressure across the piece we be get on with it and we be drive it forward both process be be drive with huge collaboration from local authority across the country 
 i thank the secretary of state for take the decision to invest £ through the pride in place scheme in my constituency for year community woodrow and greenlands have be forget while inequality in health job and skill have rise do the minister agree that the right people to decide where that £ will go be those who know their community well 
 i thank my hon friend for his enthusiasm he be absolutely right we be put right the neglect and decline that we see after year where community have be hold back because the last government fail to invest we be put community at the very heart and i look forward to work with colleague across the house to unlock the potential to change our place 
 resident of rutland overwhelmingly want to join stamford but the council be press ahead with an unwanted leicestershire merger resident of south kesteven do not want to join a mega lincolnshire council but be be push towards it and in leicestershire my constituent do not want a leicester city takeover what reassurance will the government give that democracy will not die under these reform and that local people ’s voice will be hear 
 i can certainly confirm that democracy will not die i know that official in the department will have hear what the hon lady have say and i will accept her question as representation on the issue of local government 
 in my kind and inclusive city of york those who be put up flag and express support for they have be embolden to perpetrate racism and intimidate community they have beat people up and hang a death threat on our city wall what further support can the government give my local authority to enable it to get those flag down give that even contractor be be intimidate 
 the flag be something that we must reclaim and reclaim proudly we know that in some community flag be be use to intimidate and divide and we be work with local authority throughout the country to ensure that they have the support that they need to make those judgment call but i return to the fact that the flag be ours we need to reclaim it and we need to stand up against those who want to divide our community across the country 
 the proceeds of crime act be never intend to be use by local authority as an addendum to planning enforcement the secretary of state may well have see recent medium report about this issue will he undertake to look into it and to issue guidance to local authority explain that while they have many tool at their disposal the proceed of crime act be not of they 
 the hon gentleman have raise an important point and i be happy to arrange a meeting with the appropriate minister so that he can share his concern and we can come to a resolution 
 with permission mr speaker i will make a statement about the terrorist attack on   october   and the action that the government be take in response let i start by call this attack what it be an evil act of antisemitic terrorism that target innocent worshipper on yom kippur the holy day in the jewish calendar which be carry out by a terrorist pledge his allegiance to the warped ideology of islamism i pay tribute to the man who be kill on that day melvin cravitz and adrian daulby their bravery save countless life on behalf of the whole house i offer my deep sympathy to their family and their friend may their memory be a blessing 
 a further man be seriously injure in the attack i know that all our thought be with they and with all those who be catch up in these terrible event i also wish to thank those whose bravery save life worshipper staff and volunteer from the community security trust and the emergency service who act with speed and the utmost professionalism this be a moment of profound national sorrow an attack on our jewish community be an attack on this entire nation and it call on we to assert once more our determination to tackle extremism antisemitism and hatred wherever they appear 
 although the event of that day be painful to recount it be important that we do so on the morning of   thursday october a terrorist drive a car at worshipper outside the heaton park hebrew congregation synagogue in crumpsall manchester the driver then leave his vehicle arm with a knife and resume his attack he be wear what be later determined to be a fake explosive device although it should be remember that all present have every reason to believe that that bomb be real when the call to the emergency service come in greater manchester police declare a major incident and firearm officer be deploy within minute of that call the attacker have be intercept and shoot dead melvin cravitz be kill by the attacker tragically initial finding now indicate that adrian daulby sustain a gunshot wound during the armed police response 
 as be standard in such case an investigation be be carry out by the independent office of police conduct but there be thing that i can say it be important to note that the iopc have confirm that the officer involve in the response be be treat as witness secondly it must be remember that the police act in a situation in which they believe a terrorist be likely to detonate an explosive device the necessary process must now take their course and i expect the iopc to complete they as quickly as possible 
 there be no ambiguity around who be responsible for the death and injury that take place on that day member will be aware that the attack be carry out by jihad al shamie a year old british citizen of syrian descent we know that he come to this country as a child and be register as a british citizen while still a minor he be never refer to the prevent programme nor be he know to counter terrorism   policing or the security service he have however recently be arrest on rape charge for which he be on bail at the time of the attack 
 investigator believe the attacker be influence by extreme islamist ideology evident in a call that he make during the incident in which he pledge allegiance to islamic state people be arrest follow the attack and be release without charge be subsequently re arrest and have be bail i know that there be many question that the public rightly demand answer to as do members of this house those answer will come but for now the investigation be ongoing and we must allow that work to take its course 
 we know that voice in the jewish community have long be warn that this day would come and that jews who have long feel safe in this country in their country now no long do now that this awful day have come to pass we must learn from it so that we do everything within our power to ensure that it do not happen again 
 our immediate priority be to enhance security visible officer patrol have be step up at synagogue and other site in manchester and across the country additional support have be make available to more than location and although there have be long stand security arrangement in place with £ of funding each year for the community security trust it be clear that more must be do we will provide our jewish community with the protection they deserve because no should be force to live a small jewish life in their country because of the event of   october 
 our posture at religious site be of maximum vigilance that apply to the jewish community and it also apply to british muslims i know that member from across the house will have be disturb by a suspect arson attack that take place at a mosque in peacehaven east sussex last week the policing minister visit the mosque and meet those who be force to flee for their life in terrifying circumstance and we have discuss this with my hon friend   the member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven chris ward who i know also visit the mosque on friday 
 let i be clear violence direct at any community be they jewish or muslim and of all faith or none be an attack on our entire country i know this country be unite in our condemnation of those who seek to divide we because of the great achievement of this country have be our tolerance our ability to accept and embrace difference and our generosity towards those who may not look the same but be encompass comfortably within a single national identity it be for that reason that i be so affront by the protest that take place in the day after the attack these be a clear source of fear to the jewish community who be grieve just day after an unspeakable tragedy the same be true on the anniversary of the   october   attack i describe those protest as un british and i stand by that because those protester show none of the generosity of spirit that i love about this country and they most certainly do their cause no good whatsoever 
 the right to protest be a fundamental freedom but it must be balance against the right the public have to their safety and security in my conversation with community leader and the police in recent day it be clear that balance have not be strike for that reason   i can confirm to the house today that we will amend section and of the public order act the police will be able to take account of the cumulative impact of frequent protest when consider whether to impose condition this will mean that protest that follow the same route time and again can be force to change their route or the time of a protest i be also review all exist legislation to ensure our public order power be fit for purpose and be be consistently apply 
 the right to protest must and will be protect but of all the freedom we enjoy none be more precious than the right to live in safety the government ’s responsibility be to keep the public safe since the security service and the police have disrupt more than plot and this work have save countless life through our counter terrorism strategy contest we continue to tackle threat to this country include those pose by islamist terrorism which remain our primary domestic threat through programme such as prevent we seek to stop the slide into extremism that be draw in far too many young people today 
 once the investigation into this attack be complete we will know much more about how it take place but the reality be we now face a domestic terrorist threat in this country that be more complex less predictable and hard to detect than ever before that threat will never be defeat unless we address the hate that fuel it that mean act on the rise tide of antisemitism in this country i be horrified when i hear our jewish community talk about their fear in a country that once offer a rare island of sanctuary in an all too often hostile world we have in the day since the attack step up our effort to tackle antisemitism wherever it be find challenge misinformation and hatred in school call on vice chancellor to do more to protect jewish student at university and call on local authority to use their power to protect the community as well as review the clearly inadequate regulation that protect jewish staff and patient in the national health service 
 while these be important step more must be do antisemitism be the old hatred and we must now redouble our effort to fight it once more terrorist seek thing to divide we they hate a society like ours where different community live together in harmony unite by a common identity that transcend the colour of our skin or the nature of our faith this attack have raise question that must be answer about the security that we provide to our jewish community about how we address a rise tide of antisemitism and about how we bring community together rather than allow some individual to separate off into dark corner include how we tackle the continue threat of islamist extremism and those who be pull towards its warped ideology 
 however at the same time we must not let this attack defeat we nor forget who we really be because the real face of this country be not that of the vile monster who conduct this attack it be those who stand up to he and save their fellow worshipper and the emergency service who sprint towards danger to bring the attack to an end the real face of this country be not those who take to the street and protest the very next day but rather those who be horrify by the attack stand with their jewish neighbour and choose the path of solidarity over division the antisemitic   terrorist attack of   october   be a horrifying act in response to it i hope the whole house can be unite in a simple message those who seek to divide we by pit against another will fail no act of terror will ever defeat we i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 i thank the home secretary for advance sight of her statement 
 at am on the morning of yom kippur the holy day in the jewish calendar we see the sicken terrorist attack on worshipper at heaton park synagogue in manchester by an islamist extremist the brutal attack leave man dead melvin cravitz and adrian daulby and more injured our thought and prayer remain with the victim and their family whose life be so wickedly tear apart on that holy morning 
 i want to thank greater manchester police and other in the security and emergency service for respond so quickly and the brave worshipper inside the synagogue who stop the attacker from enter i join the home secretary in say that i hope the iopc complete its work quickly and that its conclusion reflect the fact that the police officer act with courage in what be a very dangerous unpredictable and fast move situation 
 sadly we know that antisemitism be at record high in the uk the community security trust record over antisemitic incident across the uk in the half of this year the high level ever and jewish people in our country tragically face far high rate of hate crime than any other community we must stand with this country ’s jewish community and fight with all our resolve and energy the ancient evil of antisemitism wherever it be find it have no place on these shore not ever 
 to be clear attack base on race or religion be totally unacceptable the recent attack on a mosque in peacehaven be appalling and i know that we all unreservedly condemn it everyone in this country in all community include the muslim community must have the courage to stand up to extremism wherever we see it stand by and say nothing when encounter extremism be complicity that be why the antisemitism that be rife on university campus must also be fight the home secretary mention that in her statement but will she work with her colleague in government to withdraw funding from university that do not do enough to fight antisemitism 
 we must do more than just call out extremism anyone espouse extremist view or who express support for terrorism or racial or religious hatred of any kind include antisemitism who be not a british citizen should be remove from this country will the home secretary commit today to use her power under the immigration act to remove from this country any foreign national who express extremist view or sympathy for political violence terrorism antisemitism or any other form of religious hatred whether or not the criminal threshold be meet she could make that commitment now will she show that she be serious about fight extremism by do so 
 i agree with the home secretary that the protest on   october   this year the anniversary of the terrorist murder by hamas and just day after the manchester   attack be appalling—“un british in her word which i agree with the protest have continue even after the recent peace agreement relate to gaza be sign and of course they start before israel ’s military action in gaza in principle i support her propose introduction of a new cumulative impact test to section and of the public order act but will she also consider expand that test to also account for intimidation feel by other community as a result of protest do the home secretary also agree that anyone express support for a proscribe terrorist organisation or who incite violence for example by call for jihad or intifada should be arrest and prosecute 
 since the attack the police confirm the attacker pledge allegiance to islamic state and be influence by extreme islamist ideology as the home secretary acknowledge islamist extremism be sadly a threat we know all too well in the united kingdom in july we remember the people murder by islamist terrorist in the bombing which take place year ago the deadly terrorist attack commit on british soil we also remember sir david amess also murder by an islamist extremist and the victim of the manchester arena attack also murder by an islamist extremist 
 we should not be afraid to call out this extremist ideology wherever we see it it have no place in this country will the home secretary pledge to drop any definition of islamophobia that would make call out islamist extremism any hard the fact be that of mi5 ’s terrorism relate caseload be relate to islamist extremism and the vast majority of terrorist murder in the past year be perpetrate by islamist yet only of the prevent caseload be islamist related what do the home secretary propose to do about that 
 britain give perpetrator jihad al shamie a home when he arrive here from syria he then carry out a brutal attack on a synagogue deliberately target at jewish people on the holy day of the jewish calendar we need to reflect very deeply on the implication of that 
 today we must all stand together and fight the hatred of extremism and terror attack like this be an attack on our whole nation we will never change our way of life and we will never allow our fellow citizen to be threaten or attack simply because of their background i know that the whole house will want to send out that message today 
 i thank the shadow home secretary for his response and for the way in which he make it i look forward to work with he and with all member across the house as we deal with what i hope will always be a shared issue and a shared problem where there be agreement and consensus in this house on the measure that we should take i hope we will be able to progress those matter quickly 
 the shadow home secretary ask specifically about university he will i hope have see the comment make by my colleague and right hon friend the secretary of state for education who have make clear to university what their responsibility be it be important that she do that engagement before consider what measure to take if university fail to take all step to protect jewish student on campus this government be very    clear that university already have responsibility and they need to demonstrate that they be reflect those responsibility and take appropriate action 
 the shadow home secretary ask a range of question on other crime that be be commit he will i hope recognise that this government have work very closely with policing despite lot of disquiet in some quarter to ensure that we have absolutely no tail off in our response to those who support a proscribe terror organisation he will have see that there have be many hundred of arrest as long as people continue to show support for a proscribe organisation they will face the full force of the law every time they do so 
 on immigration power i be consider all immigration issue the shadow home secretary will know that this government have quite significantly increase the deportation of foreign offender who have be find guilty of commit a crime in this country compare to the situation we inherit i note his point on the wide power of the immigration act which i be review i will say more to the house on that in due course 
 the right hon gentleman also make a number of point on our propose amendment to section and of the public order act i hope that when we bring those measure forward they will receive support in this house i be happy to write to he on any further detail about the public order act i be go to review the wide landscape of public order legislation particularly in relation to the cumulative impact of repeat protest we be already go to take step on impose further condition and make explicit that cumulative impact be something that the police should take into account but i be also go to look at the wide framework again i will return to the house in due course with further update on that legislation 
 the shadow home secretary rightly note that the protest have continue both before and after the peace agreement in the middle east i think we can conclude that not all those protest truly wish to see peace in the middle east but it be for they to answer on what their motivation really be we be very clear that although the right to protest be a fundamental freedom in our country enjoy by people of all background it be often the cause of grave offence to other people who live in this country and it must be balance against the right of all people to be able to live in safety 
 the shadow home secretary mention islamist extremism in particular let i be clear to he and to the house that this government and i as home secretary have a clear eyed view of where the threat that face this country be come from it be true that within our domestic extremism landscape the large cohort of work that keep our security service and counter terror policing busy be relate to islamist extremism we will not shy away from confront those issue and deal with they in the appropriate way 
 what happen in manchester on   october   ask a big question of all of we this threat be something that we have be live with for some time and we have not yet defeat it i commit myself and the government to do everything in our power to stand up to this particular threat without fear or favour and to destroy it for good i also note that the people that islamists   often suppress hurt and damage be their fellow muslims it be in everyone ’s interest to fight islamist extremism wherever it be find 
 as the shadow home secretary note there be a wide and more complex domestic extremism picture in relation to extreme right wing terrorism and the emerge threat of those who do not have a fixed ideology but who be fixate on violence it be important that all of our response be measure and follow where the risk be come from and that we be always ask ourselves what action will ultimately be effective in deal with the threat we will redouble our effort to interrogate the assumption that have be make in the past and to assess whether they need to be change and what new effective action must be pursue i hope that in that task we will have support from member across the house 
 i thank the home secretary for her statement and i be sure that the people of crumpsall where this atrocity take place will welcome it the only point i would add be that while these act of antisemitism and violence be un british they be also inhuman i think that be a well way to describe they rather than un british 
 i thank the home secretary and the prime minister for come to manchester on the day of the attack which be much appreciate the home secretary have a chance to meet the hero because while there be violence and tragedy there be certainly hero not least the member of the congregation of whom lose their life who protect other member of the congregation from what would undoubtedly have be more death the home secretary also meet the community security trust the police and the fire brigade who all play an excellent role in get to the site of the violence as quickly as they could 
 i have live in this community within a stone ’s throw of the synagogue for most of my adult life and i have no doubt that the community will remain resilient it have always be resilient the film crew who throng about the area after the violence be amazed that muslims jews sikhs christians and people of no religion be all console each other there be no hostility at all on the street 
 the final point i want to make be not as heartwarming there be hurt and anger within the local jewish community they have know for some time that an attack like this be come obviously they do not know when or where but it have arrive they feel that there have develop a hierarchy of racism that somehow jew hatred be not as important as other kind of racism they feel that not enough have be do to protect they the extra security that the prime minister and the home secretary have announce be welcome but what the community be look for be extra action to deal with religious extremist who be involve in illegal activity to get to the heart of the violent activity against the jewish community 
 the final point i will make be that in sense take action against illegal activity be the easy part but partly because of what have happen in gaza many people now think it be okay in casual dinner party conversation we have probably all hear it and witness it to make antisemitic comment it be not okay it be also not okay although it be not against the law for   artist if i can use that word like bob vylan to be operate and spread their hate on campus like manchester university will the home secretary look forward with i to a future not only free of antisemitism but where i do not have to walk or drive past jewish school with security guard outside they 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend who be an assiduous constituency member of parliament i see for myself at hand his deep link in the community that he represent in the house and how he have be a source of real strength in bring people together in that part of manchester 
 as a member of an ethnic and faith minority myself of the thing that i most hate about our political discourse and national conversation be the hierarchy of racism i hate how minority community feel like we be pit against another in a fight for attention and recognition of the difficulty that we might face as individual group racism in all its form be abhorrent and i will be as assiduous in fight the scourge of antisemitism in this country as people might expect i as a muslim to be in fight islamophobia in this country we be all safe when we be all safe and i will not stand by and watch our community be force to compete with another and force to explain again and again why they be suffer and why they do not feel safe to i that be unacceptable in century britain i will not stand for it and it will not be the policy position of this government 
 the person who bear responsibility for what happen on   october   be the terrorist attacker himself i will not name he again today but there be no doubt that event in the middle east have cause tension here at home and some have seek to exploit those tension it be incredibly important that we be clear eyed in hold the line between what could be a legitimate critique of the israeli government ’s action in the war in the middle east and antisemitism you can be a critic of policy in the middle east without become antisemitic hat jews and hold jews in this country to account for thing happen in a country elsewhere that be nothing to do with they it be incumbent on all of we to hold that line and to be clear where that line be so that we speak with voice and give confidence to our minority community here at home 
 of the most devastating thing that i hear when i be in manchester on the day and in the aftermath of the attack be our jewish community express how they now feel unsafe in their own country and that they might never see a time when their child do not have to have security when they go to school although it be important that in the immediate aftermath of the attack we consider security matter enhance the police presence and deepen our work with the community security trust i will not stop until people in this country can go to a synagogue or jewish school without have to go through a security cordon 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the home secretary for advance sight of her statement this be my duty as my party ’s home affair spokesperson i only wish that it be not in response to such a tragedy my party ’s thought be with the family of adrian daulby and melvin cravitz who be tragically kill our thought   be also with those who be injure the congregation and the wide jewish community which be the target of a vicious attack on its holy day yom kippur 
 we must all be clear that the attack do not happen in a vacuum antisemitism be widespread on britain ’s street and british jews have be live in fear particularly since hamas ’s horrific terror attack of   october the liberal democrats be commit to ensure that our jewish friend and neighbour feel safe walk the street and worship in their synagogue those who spread antisemitic hatred or incite violence against jews whether online at march or elsewhere must be stop that be never acceptable
