bill read the time and pass without amendment 
 reading oppose and defer until   monday july   at o’clock standing order no 
 before we begin i would like to take a moment to remember lord tebbit the former right hon member for chingford who die yesterday he be of the giant of the thatcher era before his political career be cut short by the attack on the grand hotel in brighton the thought of the whole house be with his family and friend 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to reduce the crown court backlog 
 what step her department be take to reduce the crown court backlog 
 what step her department be take to reduce the crown court backlog 
 the government inherit a record and rise court backlog we be invest more than the conservatives ever do and fund a record allocation of crown court sit days—110,000 day this year which be more than during the last government but we must reform too sir brian leveson will soon present his recommendation for deliver once in a generation reform and swifter justice for victim 
 in essex of case be stop after a defendant have be charge because victim be drop out and withdraw their support with some waiting year for their case to get through the court be it any wonder that they give up on justice do the secretary of state agree that we need radical action now to stop the backlog from get any big in place like my constituency of harlow 
 my hon friend be absolutely right victim on many occasion feel retraumatise by the criminal justice system because of the long delay defendant know that case be take too long to be hear too many of they think that they can game the system and that if they wait long enough victim will drop out that be why we be determined to deliver swifter justice for victim it be why we have deliver a record number of sit day in the crown court this year and it be why we will do once in a generation reform of our court after sir brian publish his review 
 thank to the massive court delay inherit from the conservatives as the secretary of state say resident in dartford continue to face huge delay in get case involve they to court what assurance can she give that the delay will reduce and that for my constituent it will not continue to be a case of justice delay be justice deny 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that the old adage justice delay be justice deny have come true we know that we need bold reform we have to get the backlog down and we have to deal with the rise and record demand come into the system as well that be why we have make a record allocation of crown court sitting day but we also need bold once in a generation reform his constituent and the country deserve nothing less 
 the people of newcastle under lyme want thug and criminal to be hold to account and to feel the full force of the law and victim of crime to get the justice they deserve in the west midland my home region and the lord chancellor’s the crown court backlog have increase by over case since it be clear that we need an overhaul of the system and to speed up justice will the lord chancellor tell we thing when do she expect the leveson report to be publish and what may it mean for the future of jury trial 
 the publication of sir brian leveson ’s review be due very soon my hon friend will understand why i can not give any the exact date but once sir brian have publish his finding the government will consider they in due course and we will come to the house with our full response 
 jury trial will remain a cornerstone of our justice system in the most serious case but we have to recognise that they take time long than case hear in magistrate court and magistrate court already hear of all criminal trial with victim wait so long for their day in court we must ask whether there be case be hear by jury today that need not be hear by jury in future 
 the rise in the crown court backlog in be additional case that be extra case on the backlog every month the figure for march show an additional rise over month of that be additional case on the backlog every month not only be the position get bad under the lord chancellor ’s leadership but the rate at which it be get bad be increase can she explain to the house why the rate be get bad and why when in november the lady chief justice offer additional sit day she do not accept every single of those 
 i be rather surprised by that question from the hon gentleman because he be normally across the detail let i tell he point of detail that be miss from his question he know that the demand come into the system be rise we have record number of case come into the system which be a good thing because it mean that victim be seek justice but the system have not be able to cope with that demand secondly he should know that there be a difference between judicial capacity which be what the lady chief justice have speak about and system capacity unless he and the conservatives have suddenly discover a system that will 3d print new judge lawyer prosecutor and defence barrister overnight i think he will recognise that there come a point at which additional money do not buy we the ability to go fast that be what i have to reckon with as lord chancellor i have set the sit day at because that be the max for the system and that be fully fund we will consider once in a generation reform to get to the bottom of this problem and fix it once and for all 
 hannah contact i for the time in august last year after numerous stalk incident online abuse and violent threat from a member of her family he be still at large almost a year on despite arrest the court date keep be put back due to the backlog there have be further breach of the bail condition and a restraining order issue but we have hear that a trial will be delay until at the early what be the lord chancellor able to do to help victim who be already in the system and who continue to be abuse by a perpetrator 
 i will happily look at the detail of the case that the hon lady raise some of that relate to charge and what the police and other be do but i will ensure that she get a full response from across government on some of the specific let i observe that we make a whole range of victim support available to victim as they navigate the criminal justice system and we will continue to do so i recommend that she recommend some of those mechanism to her constituent we have make a record allocation of funding to the crown court but we recognise that we need to go far as we will after the publication of sir brian leveson ’s report 
 the crown court backlog stand at approximately case annually and rape and sexual assault trial in leicester crown court face delay of up to year what step be the department take to reduce that backlog and ensure that serious offence be bring to trial more efficiently to prevent further trauma for victim and the miscarriage of justice 
 the hon gentleman be right that the delay in the system and the long wait for trial be cause huge amount of trauma to victim who regularly tell i he and other member from across this house that they feel retraumatise by the criminal justice system when they seek justice i be not willing to tolerate that which be why i have make record funding available i recognise right at the outset that the system can not carry on as it have do for all these year we need to ask a big question about the sort of case in   our system that get a jury trial and those that do not this government will pursue once in a generation reform of our crown court 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 last year magistrate court trial and crown court trial have to be cancel because the defendant be not bring to court on time by prisoner escort contractor we expect sir brian ’s report very shortly which will have a range of proposal on how to reduce the unprecedented backlog in the crown court do my right hon friend agree that however effective those reform prove to be they will be undermine from the start unless the performance of contractor such as serco improve 
 my hon friend be right that the performance of contractor need to improve he and i have discuss that and the issue regularly come up in oral question in relation to the contract for electronic monitoring we monitor those contract regularly we be determined to pursue once in a generation reform but my hon friend will know that the whole system need to become more productive and efficient that be why there will be a part to sir brian leveson ’s work which will report later in the year and which will look at productivity and efficiency across the criminal justice system i regularly discuss these matter with the criminal justice board as well 
 of the most important thing we can do as the lord chancellor seem to indicate be reduce the number of case go into the system by reduce reoffende where possible include intergenerational reoffending give that of boy with a parent in prison will go on to offend what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that the child of prisoner be properly identify and support so that they do not become the next generation of people in prison 
 the right hon gentleman raise a really important point and i be grateful to he for do so focus on the child of prisoner be a manifesto commitment of our party because exactly as he say there be a cycle there that society need to break particularly for the child of male prisoner and especially their son we be lead work on join up information sharing across government to make sure that those child be identify properly support and able to break the cycle of offend in their family we must do so in a way that do not stigmatise those child and push they away from those who want to help they sensitivity and delicacy be require but the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to recognise the problem which we be work on with colleague in other bit of government 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal prime minister william gladstone be right when he say 
 justice delay be justice deny 
 he would look on the inheritance that this government receive from the conservative government as a matter for great shame while creative solution be require to    tackle the backlog the jury trial which we hear may be at risk for some be a critical safeguard on state power and be key to a liberal and free society ahead of the leveson report which be come out very soon can the government tell we how they will increase the overall capacity of the court system to dispense justice as oppose to potentially undermine justice altogether 
 i thank the liberal democrat spokesperson for that question but i would challenge he on point i do not think we be undermine justice in this country when he himself recognise that justice delay be justice deny we be try to properly think through what be a good system for we to proceed with in this country as he know of all criminal case already go to the magistrate court that be why we will pursue the reform that we have set out 
 what step she be take to ensure that private contractor deliver justice service be hold to account 
 we inherit a set of contract from the previous government some of which be not perform as we would like particularly in the area of maintenance and electronic tagging the prisons minister in the other place be grip this situation and drive progress with regular meeting to review performance 
 in serco be fin £ for overcharge the government for electronic tagging but it be still award the new £ contract in give the secretary of state ’s comment in march that the performance of serco be not good enough can the minister explain what a private company actually need to do for the government to see it as unfit to hold a contract such as this 
 while the performance of serco have be unacceptable as the hon gentleman say we have make progress and performance be improve we have impose fine for poor performance and will not hesitate to employ further contractual remedy or other measure should they be require but this be a contract that we inherit from the conservative party and we be do our good to make it work 
 i thank the minister for that response and this government be do their good to make thing work but channel have reveal that the contract with serco be fundamentally fail in the answer to my write question in june serco ’s performance be still deem to be unacceptable so where be we with bring serco around to perform properly if it do not do so will the government consider cancel that contract and bring those service back in house 
 all option be always under review but as i have say performance under that contract be improve the prisons minister in the other place be grip this issue and we will get to where we need to get to 
 what step she be take to help provide access to legal aid to people in rural area 
 people must be able to access legal aid regardless of where in the country they live and this government have make substantial new investment on the civil side in housing and immigration we have announce uplift worth £ in respect of criminal law criminal legal aid solicitor will receive an additional £ a year the legal aid agency work hard to ensure that the supply of and access to legal aid be secure across the whole of england and wales 
 from the lack of a rural crime strategy to reduce access to legal aid our rural community be be leave behind in harpenden farm alone have report fly tipping incident in year with the injustice that the most recent incident be cost the farmer around £ proper legal support for victim of rural crime could make a world of difference so how be the government ensure fair access for our rural community include face to face legal aid support 
 the hon lady be absolutely right that we need to ensure access to legal aid for those who live in rural area the legal aid agency be satisfied that legal aid service across all category be adequate in her constituency of harpenden and berkhamsted digital technology be transform access to justice through remote consultation and government fund website such as advicenow i encourage her constituent to access legal aid through those mean as well as through local provider 
 what progress she have make on review term and condition of service for prison officer 
 i pay tribute to the essential work that our prison officer do day in day out this year ’s pay award deliver another real term pay rise for our frontline prison staff we be committed to effective training and development of exist staff as deliver through the enable programme alongside the provision of extensive wellbeing service 
 i be in correspondence with the minister of state for prisons probation and reducing reoffende last october but he sit in the other place in january i be advise by the minister in this place that the secretary of state be await advice about the range of term and condition issue for prison officer i be also advise later in the spring again from the dispatch box that it be right that the situation be be keep under review i thank the minister for the thoughtful and sincere way in which he have engage with i in recent month but give that i have be ask about this issue for month can he provide an update today on progress with the advice and on exactly what be be review 
 the hon member and i have a useful meeting a short time ago to explore all these issue and i can reaffirm that the lord chancellor and the department be fully engage with the prison officers association on this and other issue 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 there have be a spate of attack on prison officer in recent month by islamist terrorist study even reveal that terrorist inside prison be teach organise criminal how to make bomb it have get so bad that former governor believe that the threat pose to frontline staff by radicalise islamists be now intolerable can the minister tell we what his assessment be of the threat from islamist gang and what on earth he be do about it 
 we be work hard to enhance security and ease crowd in order to curb violence include through a new £ investment to stop contraband which put our hard work staff at risk assault on staff and the other issue that the right hon gentleman mention be unacceptable that be why we be firmly and securely take action we be mandate the use of protective body armour in the high risk unit and on the long term high security estate which hold some of the most dangerous prisoner we be take action while the previous government fail 
 what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of lower the pension age of prison officer on prison officer morale 
 prison officer benefit from the civil service pension scheme which offer excellent public sector term low employee contribution and a employer contribution but we recognise that pension age be an important issue for prison officer that be why we be fully engage with the union on this issue 
 the last government hike up prison officer pension age to and then walk away from negotiation that be set up to partially reverse that unfair and unrealistic policy this devastated morale which be now bad than ever especially with violence against staff at record high be this government prepare to do what it take and clean up yet another tory prison mess will ministers finally get back around the table with the prison officers association to negotiate a fair pension deal for its member 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to point to the fact that this be yet another tory mess that we have inherit as i have say we value the work of the poa and we recognise the significant work of prison officer and the strength of feeling on this issue we will continue to engage with the poa and other to try to find the good way forward 
 there be a problem in our prison across the united kingdom it be a spectrum problem in that there be an increase in turnover with prison officer leave   early while the problem of the pension continue can the minister increase the intensity of discussion with the poa to try to reach a more satisfactory outcome to which the department and the prison officer concern be amenable 
 the hon gentleman make a fair point we need to make progress on this issue and we be determined to do so 
 what step she be take to support victim of violence against woman through the criminal justice system 
 we be fund police support service such as independent sexual adviser and domestic abuse adviser we have launch domestic abuse protection order in select area and as recommend by the sentencing review we be explore the possibility of expand the use of domestic abuse specialist court we have ask sir brian leveson to conduct a review of our criminal court with the ambition of reduce the time for which victim wait for justice 
 a woman from winchester write to i say 
 it feel as though every department that should have protect we have instead fail we 
 after year of high risk domestic abuse she go through a cid investigation to prove that she need financial separation but the police miss the crown prosecution service investigation deadline and no charge be bring she be now unable to secure child maintenance her abuser remain in financial control which be effectively enable by government system what discussion be the minister have with colleague in the department for work and pensions and his majesty ’s revenue and customs to ensure that perpetrator of domestic abuse can no long use financial system to maintain power and control over their victim 
 the hon member have make the important point that this be not just a criminal justice problem to be solve but a problem for every single department that be why we have a cross government strategy on tackle violence against woman and girl which include economic abuse along with the safeguarding minister i regularly meet treasury and dwp colleague in order to get to grip with the problem and we will publish our strategy in the come month 
 i welcome all the work that the secretary of state and her team be do in this important area for instance through the women ’s justice board at least of woman in prison and on probation be victim survivor of domestic abuse and in many case their alleged offending be directly link with their experience of that abuse what consideration have the minister give to the introduction of an effective defence for domestic abuse victim who use force against their abuser and for those who be coerce into offend 
 i know that my hon friend care deeply about this issue she will be aware of the work that the women ’s justice board be do with the    department some of the review by david gauke include specifically the sentencing review and baroness casey ’s recent rapid review of groom gang all that work be connect with defence for victim we be actively consider this matter and i will happily work with my hon friend and the centre for women ’s justice to develop further policy 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the whole house will remember the murder of sarah everard and the national debate about violence against woman and girl that it provoke sarah ’s parent susan and jeremy have many positive experience of the criminal justice system but they be deeply upset by the restriction that be place on what they could say in their victim impact statement i think that be wrong the domestic abuse commissioner think it be wrong and the victim commissioner think it be wrong do the minister think it be wrong 
 i have be proud and privileged to meet the everard as well as other family who be member of justice for victim to discuss how we can improve the criminal justice system for victim by put they back at the heart of the system as the shadow minister will know we debate this issue heavily in committee during the victims and courts bill and the department be consider it actively to ensure that the voice of victim be represent in court and at sentencing i will happily update he on our discussion about how exactly we can do that and what be the good way of do it 
 i welcome that commitment but the minister fail to mention that we table an amendment in committee which she vote against along with a number of other labour member give what she have just say will she commit herself now to ensure that an amendment be table during future stage of the bill to prevent restriction on what victim and their relative can say in their impact statement 
 let i say yet again that as the shadow minister will know we vote against that amendment because victim impact statement be currently class as evidence in a court of law and they have to be quite specific we be aware of the concern of victim what we need to do be put forward workable realistic possibility for how we can well represent their voice in the courtroom we be get on with action whereas the conservatives dither and delay for year we be make sure that victim be represent in our criminal justice system 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i have a constituent who be a survivor of violent economic abuse which have involve her abuser occupy of her property without consent and vandalise it with mound of human excrement render it unrentable at huge financial cost the photograph be disgusting delay in civil court proceeding have force my constituent to live with this for nearly year what step can the government take both to support survivor who be   live in this kind of hell and to speed up the legal proceeding that be currently prevent my constituent from be free once again 
 will the hon gentleman please pass on my sincere thought to his constituent that be a horrific situation that no should have to face the hon member will be aware of our manifesto commitment to look at co habiting couple right to ensure that victim survivor and every party have equal access to these right we be currently develop that policy work as well as work across government with the ministry of housing communities and local government the treasury and dwp to look at how we can tackle all element of violence against woman and girl include economic abuse and i will happily update he on those discussion in due course 
 what step her department be take to support victim of groom gang through the court system 
 the sexual exploitation and rape of child by groom gang be of the dark moment in this country ’s recent history in the crime and policing bill we have make groom a statutory aggravate factor in sentencing for child sexual offence and we have accept all of baroness casey ’s recommendation include change the criminal law to ensure that adult who penetrate child under be charge with rape 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for her response thousand of child across the uk have be abuse by groom gang yet charity still warn of victim blame by police and those in authority we should be clear that the problem be not child it be those who prey on they what be the government do to ensure that victim be properly support and receive the justice they deserve 
 the hon gentleman raise an incredibly important point that be pick up by the casey report all the recommendation of which the government have accept and i have no doubt that the national inquiry will be very cognisant of the issue that he raise through the criminal justice board we will ensure that every part of the criminal justice system from police right through to prison probation and court be aware of how we deal with victim with fairness and justice 
 i call the shadow minister 
 sohail zaffer rap a child he receive month manzoor akhtar rap a child he be sentence to and a half year ramin bari be convict of rape he get just year just year per rape these man be sentence but not punish do the justice secretary think these sentence represent justice if she do not like most people in this country will she change the law so that rape gang perpetrator receive full life sentence 
 the right hon gentleman will know that i can not and will not comment on individual sentence i urge he to live up to the responsibility of be the shadow lord chancellor because comment in the way that he regularly do on individual sentencing decision strip of context and without all the information be wrong those be independent decision make by the independent judiciary in individual case 
 what step she be take to increase prison capacity 
 we take immediate action to prevent the collapse of our prison system the last government add just place to our prison estate over year whereas the previous labour government add around place over year we intend to match the ambition of the last labour government not the last conservative government which be why we be commit to build new prison place by the end of this parliament we will have more people in prison than at any time in our history 
 every week bring new concern about crime in bournemouth and i will pick up this issue with the police and crime commissioner for my area in my boscombe office on friday increase prison space keep dangerous people away from the public and punish serious crime increase prison space stop reoffende and i thank tim from athelstan road for his creative suggestion to achieve that which i have forward to the relevant minister can the minister outline the step that he be take to stop reoffende especially where it apply to violent crime 
 my hon friend be right public protection be our no priority but we be also tackle reoffende with proper programme in place in prison we also need to support people when they come out of prison and probation be part of that solution 
 in the light of the pressure on prison place what assessment have the minister make of the government ’s early release scheme under which nearly a quarter of those release reoffende again within just year do he believe that the criterion use to determine eligibility be fit for purpose and will he share they with the house 
 due to the circumstance that this government find when we come into office we have no option but to introduce a temporary change to the law to allow prisoner serve an eligible standard determinate sentence to be release on licence this have many more constraint to it than the early release scheme operate by the previous government which be rush out just before the election actually the datum have not yet be publish so the right hon gentleman will have to wait for that 
 what step she be take to support probation officer 
 i again mr speaker we be determined to back our hard work probation staff by invest up to £ which be a increase in funding we have already exceed this year ’s target by recruit over trainee we will recruit another more probation officer in 
 an effective probation service be crucial for the rehabilitation and resettlement of prisoner to reduce reoffending although i welcome the number of new probation officer to be recruit napo report that probation workload be unmanageable staff turnover and sickness be high and probation officer be often manage case belong to colleague when evidence suggest that prisoner on licence be less likely to be recall if they have have the same supervising officer from the day of their release can the minister please outline the step be take to address these issue so that morale be improve and probation officer have sufficient time for and attention to give to individual case 
 my hon friend be right that we need to ensure that prison officer have the time to do the job they come in to do which be to spend time with offender and turn their life around in addition we have invest an initial £ in technology and launch a new programme to develop a sustainable work process that will allow probation staff to focus on the work they join the service to deliver 
 i thank the minister very much for that answer i have the opportunity a few month ago to visit the probation office in newtownards to get an idea of what it do i be very impressed by the quality of the staff secondly by the fact that they be involve in restorative justice issue relate to perpetrator and victim and thirdly by the importance they give to ensure that young people have opportunity can the minister tell we from his discussion with the probation board for northern ireland what have be do to ensure that what happen here also happen back home and that what happen back home also happen here 
 i thank the hon member for his question as he know we have regular discussion in the nation group to ensure that good practice be share issue be address together and we learn from each other 
 what step she be take to improve prison security 
 this year we be invest over £ in physical security across prison which include anti drone measure to prevent drug and other illicit item from enter prison start this month we will trial the use of taser by specialist staff and we be increase tactical staffing resource to strengthen prison security 
 there have be a spate of attack at swinfen hall prison which hold young offender in my constituency drug phone and weapon be often drop in by drone the family of prisoner be concern for their safety and prison officer be at risk what step be the government take to prevent drone and to tackle the high level of violence in our prison 
 i thank my hon friend for her question under the last government between and drone sighting around prison increase by over as i have say we be invest £ in bolster security measure in our prison and we be currently trialle new anti drone netting on the long term high security estate to tackle drone incursion 
 prison staff be face record level of violence and work in such a toxic environment that accord to the rademaker review worker be too afraid to raise complaint about bullying and harassment do the lord chancellor therefore welcome today ’s relaunch of the update safe inside prison charter by the joint unions in prisons alliance a coalition of trade union represent the vast majority of prison staff if so will she join we this evening to hear more about safe system of work in prison 
 i believe the prisons minister may well be attend the event that the right hon member mention i will happily pick that up in my regular conversation with trade union official she be right to highlight the scale of violence across our prison system we be already take measure and i hope that the combination of sentence reform and investment in our prison will bring down the level of violence we be currently see 
 what step she be take to tackle the backlog in the court 
 what step she be take to reduce pre trial waiting time 
 this government inherit a record and rise court backlog from the previous tory government across every jurisdiction whether for a victim of crime a parent a business or an employee backlog mean waiting year for their day in court we have take swift action to invest in our court and court in every jurisdiction be sit at or close to maximum judicial capacity we have announce record investment this year of £ across all court and tribunal which will make a real difference to clear up the tories mess 
 in my constituency of horsham i have be ask to support a woman leave in limbo regard the trial of her ex partner on a domestic abuse charge when she be finally give a date the trial be pull as a result of an administrative error as she sit wait in the courtroom a new date be set for a whole year later she suffer emotional distress and have to take   time off work which cost she £ she instal cctv at her own expense and endure month of further intimidation will the minister undertake to set clear guideline about maximum waiting time for trial to solve the problem now and in the future 
 i be terribly sorry to hear about the case of the hon member ’s constituent which exemplify exactly why we be so determined to grip the backlog in our crown court that be also why we have ask sir brian leveson to recommend a once in a generation reform to deliver swifter justice for victim such as the hon member ’s constituent ultimately get the backlog down so that we can look she in the eye and say we can deliver swifter justice will make the real difference 
 i work closely with fantastic local business across leeds north west and i know they already have a lot to contend with so i be concerned to see a pattern of crime on our high street from burglary to other form of vandalism that leave owner in horsforth and adel feel unsafe at the same time like most hon member i be very aware that the government have inherit a significant backlog that undermine the sense that justice will be serve how do the minister plan to address that so the individual responsible be deal with and small business owner know that we be on their side 
 my hon friend raise an important point the impact of the crown court backlog be be feel by domestic abuse victim and small business so we have a real job to do to restore confidence in our criminal justice system that be why we grip the crisis by put in place an extra crown court sitting day a record number we understand however that we will need fundamental reform to address the backlog and that be what we have ask sir brian leveson to look at 
 what step her department be take to support the rehabilitation of people convict of knife crime offence 
 halve knife crime be a moral mission for the government every young person catch with a knife be refer to a youth offending team and turnaround be very successful in divert youngster on the cusp of crime away from offend alongside that the government will roll out prevention partnership and young futures hub 
 i welcome the minister ’s answer knife crime ruin life and devastate community rightly those responsible must be hold accountable if we be serious about prevent reoffende however we also need structure credible rehabilitation the focus of which must be on prevention and diversionary activity as chair of the all party parliamentary group on boxing i have see how grassroot boxing club offer something different structure community and hope that be of particular benefit to young people i ask the minister to meet i to discuss how boxing can be a key part of successfully rehabilitate offender 
 my hon friend be right to point to the range of diversion that can help the rehabilitation of young offender include box club i be happy to meet he 
 what step her department be take to restore the legal aid agency 's digital service 
 as the house will be aware the legal aid agency suffer a criminal cyber attack across its system it have work tirelessly to ensure that those who rely on legal aid have not see that legal aid stop and that provider be not leave out of pocket in short it have keep the show on the road with a series of emergency contingency measure let we be in no doubt however that it suffer that attack because its it system have be leave in a fragile state by the lack of investment from the conservatives we will learn from the crisis and build back well with additional investment 
 of my local firm mjc law and nottingham law centre have contact i about this issue mjc law say 
 this have leave legal aid law firm often small business to decide whether to take on the risk of case and hope they will be approve and pay retrospectively 
 cash flow could become a genuinely serious issue for such firm so what step be be take to support they for how long do the minister envisage firm deal with this situation finally on gdpr notice be it sufficient that the laa have simply provide a notice on its webpage 
 i pay tribute to the legal aid provider across the country who have keep go through this difficult time and who do vital work in the sector as part of the package of contingency business measure we have delegate more decision making to provider and we have commit to backdate criminal legal aid application i must assure the house that we will turn the system back on only when we can be sure that they be secure and we can guarantee that we be protect people ’s datum 
 what step she be take to ensure she can refer parole board decision in case of serious offender to the high court 
 work to implement the power to refer case to the high court be well advanced and we expect to be able to fully update the house later this year 
 the secretary of state be decline to take the power to refer to the high court on unduly lenient parole board decision in case of manslaughter like that of robert brown who kill the good friend of my constituent hetti barkworth nanton will the minister meet i to discuss this decision and explore how we can   ensure that the secretary of state have all the power necessary to ensure that violent killer like brown be not release early 
 that be a horrific case my thought remain with joanna ’s family and friend specifically diana parkes and hetti barkworth nanton who i meet last year and who the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for pontypridd alex davies jones meet this week the previous parliament carefully scrutinise the referral power and the offence that should be in scope i be very happy to meet the hon gentleman on this matter 
 with the case of of the killer of james bulger jon venables come to the parole board again the need for the voice of victim family to be hear in the justice system be come right to the fore my constituent sue who be in the gallery today be be support by the james bulger foundation her son die needlessly he be not support by the people with he who could have offer he aid and get he medical help will the minister meet i and sue to hear the tragic detail of this case and discuss the option for change the law to ensure that victim family be properly represent in the justice system 
 my hon friend draw attention to another horrific case i think the good way of proceeding be to take up his offer of a meeting 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of deport all foreign criminal on prison capacity 
 removal under this government have be high over the past month than under the conservatives we be go far by expand the early removal scheme so that prisoner with no right to be in this country will be deport and ban from ever return to the uk after serve of their custodial sentence 
 uk prison be at full capacity and of prison place be occupy by foreign national will the secretary of state look to deport all foreign national who commit offence in our country to free up that space 
 as i say we have already deport more people in the year of this government than be the case under the previous government so we be go fast on foreign national offender removal from our prison estate the legal change we be make will bring more offender into scope early in their sentence make they eligible for deportation 
 will the lord chancellor update the house on the conversation she have with international partner on the european convention on human right during her recent visit to the council of europe in strasbourg 
 i have very positive discussion with partner country across europe when i visit strasbourg where i make a speech about how the european convention on human right be a live instrument and therefore must keep up with the time that be a positive conversation and that this government will be continue in the come month 
 what step she be take to improve the quality of prison education 
 ensure that prisoner have access to education be essential for rehabilitation in order to ensure that prison produce well citizen not well criminal new prison education service contract will be launch later this year which aim to strengthen the quality of delivery and provide consistent assessment of prisoner last week i hold a roundtable bring together expert to drive improvement and strengthen current education provision in young offender institution 
 i thank my hon friend for his response however of prison and young offender institution have be rat as require improvement or inadequate by ofsted on education skill and work provision despite that the prison education service still outsource the same poorly perform contract to poorly perform provider and prison educator be pay less than educator in further education setting cause a crisis in recruitment and retention accord to the education committee when we will see the great insourcing in a generation and will the minister consider insource prison education with proper pay term and condition for prison educator 
 all option be on the table his majesty ’s prison and probation service introduce a head of education skill and work into every prison to ensure that across the estate a senior member of prison staff be responsible for improve the quality of education provision my hon friend be right to draw attention to ofsted report but there have be an increase in the overall number of good rating achieve through the inspection this be work in progress we need to do well as she say and that be what we be determined to do 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 it be a little over a year since this government be elect and ever since i have be clear up the mess create by the previous government who leave our prison day from collapse i be ensure that we can never run out of space again we have already open around new prison place with the aim of create by we have accept most of david gauke ’s sentencing review and i will increase funding for the probation service by up to £ in our court we be reverse year of under investment that leave we with a record and rise court backlog i have fund a record number of   crown court sit days—4,000 high than the conservatives manage and sir brian leveson will soon propose once in a generation reform make no mistake unlike those on the conservative benches i will do what it take to bring down the backlog and deliver swifter justice for victim 
 under the snp the number of suspect criminal in scotland be let off with a slap on the wrist have increase by in a year accord to the late datum now the labour government here seem to want to copy the snp why will the labour government not put victim instead of do what they be do now let dangerous criminal off with short and weak sentence 
 what absolute nonsense let i tell the house the definition of soft justice it be what the tory party do build only prison place in year in office that be why we be in this mess and that be the mess that i be clean up 
 last month a devastating report by woman ’s aid reveal that a total of child have be kill over a year period by a know domestically abusive parent in circumstance relate to the court use of the principle of the presumption of contact of those child jack and paul sykes be the son of my formidable constituent claire throssell all these death be preventable will the minister update the house on the progress of the government ’s review of the presumption of contact 
 the killing of jack and paul be horrendous crime and i would like to pay tribute to my hon friend and to her constituent claire for their tireless campaign on these issue i be sure that she would agree that the guide principle for any reform must be child ’s welfare that be why we have request a review of the presumption of contact we will be publish finding and next step very shortly 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in the year since labour take office can the justice secretary tell we how many individual have be prosecute for smuggle people in on small boat 
 i do not have those figure directly to hand but i be sure that if they be available i can write to he with the detail 
 i ask the justice secretary a very simple question about of the big challenge face our country right now and the whole house can see that she do not have a clue this be about not just the pathetically low level of prosecution under her watch but the fact that she have wave through guideline to shorten sentence for immigration offence under the nationality and borders act the most serious offence for facilitation carry a life sentence but she be water that down to between and year instead of smash the gang she be slash the sentence why will she not do something for once and stop this 
 honestly the shadow justice secretary really ought to pay more attention to his day job rather than to the job he be look for which the conservative party might give he have he pay any attention he would know that prosecution do not fall to the ministry of justice they be deal with independently through the crown prosecution service we will of course publish the statistic when we get they and i will happily write to he with the detail we be make sure that across government we be take all the action necessary to protect our border he be misrepresent what the immigration guideline do i have pick he up on that before i will happily write to he again but maybe he could actually read they and learn something 
 peopleplus have just win the contract for prison education in scotland and england peopleplus be sell to talent international a subsidiary of swipejobs in which us and australian base venture capital firm clearsign capital have a stake accord to the university and college union can the minister explain why venture capitalist be make money out of educate british prisoner 
 my hon friend ask a good question in england prison education contract be award follow a rigorous commercial process that award provider on merit i understand that peopleplus have be award education contract for scottish prison but that would be a matter for the scottish government 
 i wish to raise the case of my constituent whose year old father be subject to serious abuse through a lasting power of attorney it take year and significant legal cost to get the power of attorney remove through the court of protection the father tragically die homeless and penniless do the minister believe that the current lpa protection be sufficient to prevent such abuse and will the government consider an urgent review and reform of the system 
 i be very sorry to hear about the case of the hon member ’s constituent we need to put this into some context as of march over lasting power of attorney be register in england and wales they be a really useful instrument although concern about misuse do exist the sort of abuse that the hon member highlight be in context rare the office of the public guardian investigate around case last year we be look to strengthen safeguard and add more identify check as part of a modernised service last power of attorney be a really important tool and we do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater 
 during my recent visit to pennine domestic abuse partnership in huddersfield i hear about how long delay between cps charge and trial date leave abuse victim in limbo the delay not only retraumatise victim but put a huge strain on support service that provide long term care so i join colleague in ask the government to reduce the delay as soon as possible so that victim of domestic abuse can access justice swiftly 
 my hon friend outline exactly why we have ask sir brian leveson to conduct a review into the criminal court the ambition be to reduce the length of time victim have to wait for justice we be expect the recommendation of that review shortly we be support victim by fund key support service to make sure that victim continue to be engage with our criminal justice system and we be expand the use of specialist domestic abuse court where train staff can support victim directly 
 i   recently   meet ruby hamill a young activist who nearly die in a government run prison when her severe eat disorder be ignore ruby be not a constituent she want to talk to i because i chair the eat disorder all party parliamentary group will the minister meet i and ruby ’s family to ensure that there be eat disorder guideline in all prison and that the guideline be appropriate and implement across all prison healthcare provider 
 i be sorry to hear of the case that the hon member outline and i would be very happy to meet she to explore the issue far 
 in a recent report the victims commissioner say that she fear that the delay in victim get justice 
 will drive some victim to give up on seek justice altogether a injustice compound the 
 this be completely unacceptable and at ipswich crown court the backlog of open case have more than double since what be minister do to reverse the harm inflict by the conservatives not only on the justice system itself but on victim confidence that justice will be serve at all 
 my hon friend be right that we be see an increase in the number of victim pull out of the process because they no long have confidence in it because it be take so long we have fund an additional sit day this year and have ask sir brian leveson to recommend once in a generation reform precisely so that we can deliver swifter justice for victim 
 the hon member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball raise the issue of the presumption of contact i have a constituency case where parent have abuse their child and the other parent have have to pay for the supervision of those child the presumption of contact be not work in case where domestic abuse have happen so i echo the call from the hon member for penistone and stocksbridge for an urgent review of it 
 the hon member will know that a staggering of case that go through our family court involve some form of domestic abuse or allegation thereof that be why consideration of the operation of the presumption of contact and wide consideration of domestic abuse allegation in our family court be so important it be why official and ministers be take the process really seriously 
 derbyshire victim services do really important work support victim include those who have experience sexual assault and domestic violence but give the court backlog inherit from the conservative government the service have tell i that many of the victim be in need of support for long with many have complex need that public service can struggle to meet what step be the department take to help support service to provide support to victim with complex need that be exacerbate when justice be delay 
 i place on record my thank to all the brilliant victim support service that do tremendous work in incredibly difficult circumstance to ensure that victim get the support they need to stay engaged with the criminal justice system we have protect dedicated ministry of justice spend on victim of violence against woman and girl by maintain the funding level ringfence sexual violence and domestic abuse support for this year and commission a rape and sexual abuse support line provide victim and survivor with access to vital help and information whenever they need it we be carefully consider how good to allocate the current budget from the spending review to look specifically at vawg alongside other departmental priority 
 my   constituent andy from offerton often play a caring role for his adult son as his son have serious mental ill health during his son ’s recent stay in prison andy struggle to get quality information from the prison about his son ’s health situation and living condition what more will the government do to ensure that parent carer such as andy get the information they need and deserve during a child ’s stay in prison 
 the hon lady be right it be important that parent carer get the information they need that help with rehabilitation and get thing to the right place if she want to write to i about that particular case i will look into it and write back to she 
 survive be a york base charity provide specialist service and trauma specific intervention to survivor of sexual violence and abuse however it have have to close its waiting list because it do not have the capacity to meet the demand will the minister look at provide additional funding so that we can get those vital service to survivor and victim now and they do not have to wait 
 my hon friend have contact i and write to i on this issue she will know that we in the department be look at the spending allocation follow the spending review however we have protect and ringfence special support for sexual violence victim because we know that there be huge demand come through the system and we need to keep those victim engage in the criminal justice system to ensure they get their day in court and justice be serve 
 i read a recent bbc article about an asylum seeker who have violently rap a teenage girl he have be convict and give a sentence of year in   prison follow by year on licence after which he will need to be deport i be concerned that such individual during their period on licence pose a risk to british woman and girl do the lord chancellor agree and will she ensure that people go straight from prison to deportation where appropriate 
 i thank the hon lady for raise that important point it be why we be reduce the threshold for the early removal scheme and look carefully with the home office at the gauke review ’s recommendation of effectively sentence to deportation to deal with the very type of case that she have raise 
 i welcome the government ’s effort to reform sentencing follow the sentencing review i be confident that those step will end the chaos leave behind by the previous government i be particularly interested in rehabilitation as a priority in sentencing a troubling statistic remain study have show that of prisoner in the uk be diagnose as dyslexic and there be probably many more who be undiagnosed mean that the number be much high will the minister tell i what step be be take to support dyslexic people in prison and to prevent reoffende follow release 
 my hon friend be right to emphasise the importance of rehabilitation in the panoply of thing that we do in the criminal justice system she be also right to highlight the number of prisoner and people in the criminal justice system who have dyslexia which be of the many neurodiverse condition in the prison service every prison have a neurodiversity officer who co ordinates activity to address that in each prison but if she want to write to i about the issue i would be happy to respond in more detail 
 the secretary of state will be aware of the deeply troubling revelation over the weekend of the so call halal bride website do she agree that such practice have absolutely no place in britain 
 the regulation of website and content fall either within home office responsibility for criminal law or with the department for science innovation and technology and i will happily pick up with they the detail around the regulatory issue that be raise by that case 
 when i visit hmp onley the near prison to my constituency i have the great privilege to be give a tour by the governor mark allen and to see the excellent work of the staff i wonder whether the secretary of state would comment on the importance of offering by organisation and company such as greene king which provide cafés and restaurant so that prisoner can be rehabilitate while they be in prison 
 greene king do outstanding work as do other organisation in our prison service they be important partner in deliver well justice 
 the lord chancellor rightly reject murderer alan jermey ’s parole board request for open condition for which his daughter and i be extremely grateful i understand   that mr jermey be now legally challenge the decision so will the lord chancellor revisit my request for a meeting with she about this issue 
 the hon member will know that with a judicial challenge there will be some constraint as to what i can say publicly and indeed even privately in a meeting i will take advice to ensure that nothing compromise the legal process 
 the sentencing guidelines pre sentence reports act have now receive royal assent and i congratulate the lord chancellor on her swift action but it would never have be necessary if sentence guideline be not the preserve of an unelected undemocratic quango in the form of the sentencing council do she agree that we need a democratic lock or even a vote in this place to approve new sentencing guideline 
 i have say many time at this dispatch box that that whole episode reveal a democratic deficit i be review the role and power and we will come forward with legislative change in due course 
 in the light of the tragic loss of young mother sarah montgomery who be month pregnant due to violence which have leave young girl without a mother and impact the entire community of donaghadee in my constituency do the government agree that early intervention particularly through early education be essential furthermore can we look at intensify our effort to prevent domestic violence against woman and young girl and at increase sentence to deter that type of crime 
 i thank the hon member for raise this case which will have hit all of we incredibly hard it be horrific and just go to show that violence against woman and girl be at epidemic level in every corner of the united kingdom not just in england and wales i be due to meet my counterpart across the devolved nation shortly to figure out exactly how we can well join up to tackle this issue as a whole because it will take a societal response if the hon member want to meet i to discuss this far i would be happy to do so 
 the minister will be aware that the recent pathfinder family court pilot have be see as largely successful this be an opportunity to put child at the centre of these case and to end the presumption of contact which put partner and child of abuser at risk will she please advise i as to the next step in this process 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s question and i be grateful to he for raise the pathfinder court these pilot be prove incredibly successful they front load a lot of the evidence gathering they put the safety of child and family arrangement right at their heart and they be prove a really successful    model which be why we plan to roll they out far as part of that as he have hear we will be publish our response to the presumption review very shortly 
 the backlog of case in the isle of wight coroner service be the bad in the country cause pain and distress to too many family some of whom be wait day to find out what be happen to their love one will the minister offer any comment or support to those family and will she agree to meet i to discuss how we deal with the problem of the isle of wight coroner 
 i thank the hon member for his engagement on this issue he have write to i and we have have quite productive conversation about it i recently meet the chief coroner to discuss the specific issue on the isle of wight because we know that the delay be cause untold turmoil to family in an already awful traumatic process i will happily meet the hon member to discuss a way forward but i be reassure by the action be take by the chief coroner to address the issue in the isle of wight directly 
 a constituent of mine who recently flee france because of domestic violence and abuse after be a habitual resident for just day have be order to return to france next week under protective measure what more can the government do to protect woman flee domestic violence in relation to the hague convention and the child abduction act 
 the hon member will know that i can not comment on specific case but if he want to write to i i will happily look at that i recently have productive conversation about the hague convention and other and we will happily develop those conversation far 
 may i associate myself with your remark mr speaker at the outset of these proceeding about the passing of lord tebbit lord tebbit be a great friend of northern ireland particularly of the many fellow victim of ira terrorism 
 may i return the lord chancellor to the subject of the backlog in our crown court in northern ireland we have the bad of all record it take an average of day to conclude a crown court case murder trial have be stall since last september with no new start date we have a minister of justice locally who talk the talk but never walk the walk and particularly do not walk the walk in settle the ongoing remuneration issue that be hold thing up would the lord chancellor bring some pressure to bear on the local justice minister to sort this matter out 
 the hon and learn member will know that for devolved matter it would of course be deeply inappropriate for i to try to influence or put pressure on the minister of justice in northern ireland on a cross uk basis we regularly meet our fellow justice ministers in the devolved administration and i will happily pick up those conversation in a constructive way 
 with permission mr speaker i will update the house on the government ’s resilience action plan 
 we be live through a period of profound change upheaval in the international order conflict rag in the middle east a war be wag on the continent of europe and old norm overturn on what feel like a daily basis against that backdrop the government ’s duty of keep the public safe become all the more important resilience be a measure of deep strength and at the same time a measure of insurance 
 by deep strength i mean fundamental such as a good nhs a strong spirit of community a secure energy system and good flood defence all those thing increase our national resilience we see the vulnerability expose by the covid pandemic in the nhs and in the different impact it have on different worker ethnic minority and member of the community resilience have to be for all not just for some 
 by insurance i mean the emergency system scientific capability scale up capability and other measure we would need in a crisis everyone know they need insurance but we also know that no spend their whole income on it that be true for a country too by definition preparation for the bad have to sit alongside the week to week provision of the essential service that government run there be no perfectly correct answer to the balance between those thing what be certain be that the government have to think through the scenario and try to ensure that the country be as well prepared as possible 
 today we set out how we will do that with the publication of our resilience action plan a chronic risk analysis and an update on the uk biological security strategy no government can stop every risk from materialise every member of this house understand that we live in a world where we be susceptible to a much wide range of risk than we be even a decade ago cyber attack on household name trade measure that can trigger fluctuation in the price of food or household good power outage the possibility of another pandemic these risk be real and be all different 
 the answer to those share challenge lie in make all part of society well prepare our economy our defence our health system our infrastructure our border our industrial base and our energy security much of it come down to the unglamorous work of deliver improve public service that be what we might call deep resilience”—an nhs that be strong enough to cope an energy system that do not leave we as expose to the spike in the price of oil see in the aftermath of russia ’s invasion of ukraine and a science base that can be call into action quickly it depend on the whole of society business the public sector local national and devolved government civil society local resilience forum and every member of this house all share in the burden and pull in the same direction 
 the action plan set we up to do that with a focus on area assess on a continuous basis how resilient the uk be so that we can effectively target intervention and resource when and where they be need secondly enable the whole of society to take   action to increase its resilience which will rely on we change the culture around resilience by make it part of our everyday life in practical and simple way be it the owner of a business introduce new cyber defence or a more informed public that know what to do in order to prepare for different emergency and thirdly improve core public sector resilience we have thousand of frontline public sector worker who be integral to our resilience at a local and national level from the employee who keep the energy grid run to local emergency responder i pay tribute to they all 
 the action plan bring together a range of policy we have already set out our proposal to increase defence spending we be earmark £ of funding for new flood defence and £ to secure the uk ’s telecom network and open a new resilience academy in north yorkshire that will train people every year from the private and public sector later this year we will have the large ever national pandemic exercise that will test the uk ’s readiness for future pandemic we be also develop a risk vulnerability map for public servant apply of the principal lesson of previous tragedy which be that all too often it be the most vulnerable in our society who be hard hit in the event of an emergency 
 on top of each of those step the action plan and our update on the biological security strategy set out new additional measure include a nationwide test of the uk ’s emergency alert that will take place at around pm on   sunday september and it will involve a notification go out to mobile phone at once it will be the time we have use the test on a nationwide basis it will last for around second the mobile phone alert system will play a critical role in make sure that we be ready for all kind of future emergency in the run up to the test we will work with stakeholder include domestic violence charity to ensure that the public have as much warning as possible as well as the alert we will be push ahead with activity to promote the government ’s prepare website to help individual household and community understand how they can be ready for a range of different emergency we continue to support local resilience forum in england because they be essential in plan for and respond to incident whenever they occur 
 our biological security strategy include £ from the integrated security fund to help address capability gap across government and beyond that be in addition to the £ of investment that we unveil a fortnight ago for a new network of national biosecurity centre to strengthen our defence against biological incident accident and attack the defence and security accelerator also include £ for project with university such as queens university belfast and cardiff university my colleague the health secretary will publish a pandemic preparedness framework explain how the government be bring together the vital scientific research need to prepare for any future pandemic i be also able to announce that soon the national situation centre and the devolve government will sign a memorandum of understanding to ensure that every part of the uk have the good datum to prepare and respond to crisis 
 those practical step will help the uk to meet the moment when an emergency come resilience be not a button to press it come from the realisation that we   need deep strength and the ability to scale up quickly when the situation require it that be why the government ’s investment plan announce in the recent spending review and the action outline in this plan be so important we will not be resilient unless we invest for the future a strong nhs more and well housing well energy security utilise our deep research and development base and on top of that have the capability to get go fast in an emergency that be what this plan set out i commend it to the house 
 i thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for advance sight of his statement and the associated documentation i also thank he for the date on which the uk emergency alert will be test he can only have choose it to notify the country that it be my birthday i shall very much look forward to the alarm at pm 
 i understand why the government want to plan for resilience it be understandable that the government would want to come forward with a plan face with the collapse economy a collapse government capital flight spiral borrowing cost and the office for budget responsibility ’s warning this morning that the chancellor ’s late u turn have leave britain more vulnerable and less able to respond to future crisis as the minister say the plan publish today build on the work of the previous government on the roll out of the national emergency alert system the expansion of biosecurity preparedness investment in flood protection and ensure well cross departmental collaboration on resilience and emergency preparedness 
 the minister say in his statement that he be look for an assessment on a continuous basis the report set out the intention for data collection in this area but it would be useful to hear by when that new datum framework will be available for we to scrutinise he say that he wish to enable 
 the whole of society to take action 
 but i rather wonder how he intend the whole of society to find out about this the plan call on the ministry of housing communities and local government to provide guidance on develop cohesion strategy and to monitor tension however that do not sit easily with the fact that the government be not currently tackle islamist extremism properly that they drag their foot on a national inquiry into grooming gang and that they seem to be bring forward a highly controversial definition of islamophobia 
 the minister refer to 
 improve core public sector resilience 
 that be certainly to be welcome particularly on a day on which it have be announce that resident doctor have vote in favour of strike which will result in industrial action in january it be notable that the plan do not mention an ability to deal with widespread industrial action be the government planning for the eventuality of a general strike 
 the minister also mention the increase in defence spending which we know be a form of smoke and mirror we understand that the in addition to the hypothetical include thing such as tunnel and   road but we have not be provide with a baseline for what be currently spend in those area how will we know when the government have get to or indeed whether they be at already 
 as the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster set out the previous government take step to extend our capability and publish the uk biological security strategy i be interested that in this strategy there be a reference to explore the utility of waste water analysis which have great success during the pandemic do the minister intend to bring that back on a wide scale it would be welcome if that be the case 
 i be pleased that the government be press ahead with the biothreats radar which be a conservative idea but year after our announcement there be still no go live date this could be a major asset to national resilience but we need to know when it will come online the cdl also tell the house that a fully operational radar will give we near real time warning of emerge pathogen but the world health organisation be still remind china to hand over its basic virological datum on covid-19 can he guarantee that the radar will allow the uk to independently verify when a state actor choose to withhold or delay information 
 i be interested to read about exercise pegasus the preparation for pandemic exercise however as the minister will know different type of pandemic behave in different way which pandemic be test in pegasus which be test in alkarab it be important that the house understand what the government be look at in that regard 
 i be grateful to the opposition spokesman for his question several thing have contribute to the need for a fresh look at all of this the experience of covid the change geopolitical situation and the change threat picture it be important to be both flexible and dynamic when consider resilience 
 let i turn to the shadow minister ’s specific point in advance of his birthday on   september i wish he many happy return he ask about data collection that do not have a date it be a constant effort the capacity to use datum in a well way today than perhaps we could have do in the past be an additional weapon in our armoury 
 in term of the whole of society find out about this we have good sensible advice on gov.uk/prepare i encourage the public to look at it and i hope that these preparation measure become normal for people in the future the strength of community be very important in community resilience 
 the shadow minister refer to strike in the nhs we have give the nhs significant financial support and make a very fair pay offer we very much value the work that doctor do we hope that everyone in the nhs realise that we be a government who support the nhs and want to work with the staff and that industrial action will contribute nothing to that goal 
 the shadow minister refer to biological security we be make important investment into that include the opening of the new weybridge lab announce by my right hon friend the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs a couple of week ago 
 exercise pegasus have not happen yet it will happen in the autumn however the shadow minister be right on thing it be important not to fight the last war and assume that the next pandemic will behave in the same way as the last we have to be flexible in our response and ensure that we plan for different kind of scenario 
 i welcome this statement the point about exercise pegasus remind i of exercise cygnus the finding of which i be sadden to say the previous government ignore in advance of what then become the pandemic we face in recent week we have see attack on marks spencer the co op and other and the fire at heathrow so this action plan be incredibly welcome it state that the government will develop a 
 consolidated data drive picture of our resilience baseline 
 to show how resilient the uk be at any moment and a new cyber resilience index that highlight the critical national infrastructure at great risk will my right hon friend give the joint committee on national security strategy which i chair access to those index and may i suggest that we help he in develop they 
 i be grateful to the chair of the joint committee on national security strategy for his question the national cyber security centre have be work closely with marks spencer and the other victim of recent cyber attack i look forward to appear before his committee in a few day and work closely with it in the future 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for advance sight of the statement the world be now less stable and more insecure than at any time since the cold war consequently the government must ensure that the british people and the united kingdom be prepare in the event that our country or an overseas territory be threaten the liberal democrats therefore welcome any measure to strengthen our resilience especially to the cyber security threat a new and evolve threat against which we must be arm 
 while the liberal democrats welcome the alert test we call for a wide public information campaign to support resilience building across the uk and to ensure that the public be properly ready for any potential future conflict or disaster perhaps we could take lesson from our scandinavian neighbour who be always work to address future threat and provide information to their citizen information should be provide through a number of different mean include leaflet and traditional broadcast 
 while we welcome the alert test website and text alert will miss million of british people those without phone or without signal or battery so we need to be ready on all front and not just rely on single text alert will the government accept the liberal democrats call to launch a national awareness campaign that draw on different mode of contact 
 i welcome the talk about be more resilient to climate emergency we have all see the horrify picture and upset story from the flood in texas   in recent day and in this country we have have of the hot start to a summer in uk history it be vital that the government be not catch unawares as the temperature rise last week i have a meeting in my constituency with thames water which tell i that it be prepare drought mitigation measure the regular supply of water to people ’s property business and agricultural land be vital to livelihood and everyday life what step be the government taking and perhaps put in their new action plan to ensure that any drought mitigation measure will not significantly impact the country in the come month 
 i welcome the hon lady ’s question and join she in extend our sympathy to all those affect by the terrible event in texas where we see the power of nature and see so many innocent life lose 
 i welcome the hon lady ’s comment on the alert test the test will be publicise well in advance include through work with domestic violence charity and other so that everybody know what be come information for the public be available on the gov.uk/prepare website 
 i agree with the hon lady that dialogue with the public on resilience be important in many other country that be absolutely normal perhaps it have be a little less normal in this country but we should change that on risk in the immediate term our excellent cobra team in the cabinet office scan the horizon constantly for these thing and it be always prepared and ready to go in any emergency 
 i thank the minister for his statement as a former leicestershire county councillor and as a health scrutineer before during and after the pandemic it be clear to i that local knowledge from our public health team and nhs service play an important role however they know that they could have go far and do so much more will he reassure i and my constituent that insight from local resilience forum and local expert will feed into planning and preparation for any future pandemic 
 that be a good question it be really important that we learn from the experience of the pandemic a few year ago but we must not fall into the trap as i say of assume that the next emergency will be exactly the same we have to be flexible in our response the next emergency and indeed the next pandemic may be quite different in character from the that we go through a few year ago 
 will the preparation take into account the last disastrous consequence of lockdown and the blither absurdity of face covering 
 the preparation should take everything into account 
 i thank the minister for the statement i welcome the announcement that the government will undertake a full national test of the emergency alert system in september how will they ensure that rural area such as church eaton in my   constituency which be still wait for its phone mast to be activate and maer which have have long term difficulty with mobile reception can receive the message my understanding be that the alert be dependent on g access 
 my hon friend be right about of the population be cover by g or g access and we be work constantly with the telecom company to improve that coverage that be an ongoing effort 
 i welcome the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster ’s commitment that resilience must be for all not just for some the people of shetland will hold he to those word a few year ago we suffer a catastrophic power outage for about day in winter storm leave many of my constituent rely on copper wire phone line for their connection to the outside world if that copper wire be withdraw without sufficient resilience be build into its replacement the consequence for my constituent could be catastrophic will he through his office engage with private sector organisation when they be make these strategic decision for we all 
 the right hon gentleman represent perhaps the outermost part of the uk and when he say that resilience should be for all he be absolutely right we have see the effect of long term day be long term”—power outage include in recent time during storm éowyn he make a good point about ensure resilience when system change and new technology come in and we will certainly have a dialogue with telecom company about that 
 i thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for his statement i be pleased to hear he reference the £ that the government be invest to secure our telecommunications network will that extend to our undersea network of cable which face perpetual threat from the russian shadow fleet and other who be under a thin veil of plausible deniability if those network be disrupt it will create chaos in the uk 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that important question subsea cable be vital to the working of our economy and our defence and those who wish we harm know that it must be part of our national defence and our defence think to defend our international communication structure under the sea 
 the tier exercise that cdl mention in response to baroness hallett ’s recommendation in module of her report on covid be much to be welcome however he will be aware that part of the problem with exercise cygnus in be that the result be not make public at the time and a lot of it remain classified in the light of what have be say today will he ensure that the government ’s approach to this exercise be different and that the result be make public quickly so that they can be interrogate 
 any national exercise of this kind will show up both strength and weakness it be important that we communicate the learning from these exercise both the strength and the weakness 
 the national risk register identify cyber attack on critical national infrastructure as be of moderate likelihood but potentially catastrophic in impact the national audit office have identify key government system that have substantial cyber resilience gap what more can the government do to plug those gap and ensure that our system be secure 
 this be very important there be no doubt that there be gap in cyber defence and there be an ongoing battle to get up to speed many legacy system that have be in place for decade be difficult to replace because new have be build on old we be invest but it be an ongoing effort to close the gap to stop those who would undermine the vital public service that rely on those system 
 of the vulnerability that we see in the pandemic after the invasion of ukraine and even during the beast from the east winter storm be to food supply but i do not hear the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster refer to food in his statement finland ’s national food supply can sustain the country for up to month it include strategic food reserve and grain stockpile germany advise citizen to keep a day stockpile of food and water our reliance on import make our food supply vulnerable to global event such as pandemic and geopolitical instability what action be the government take to increase our food security 
 the gov.uk/prepare website refer to have a supply of food and water in case of an emergency we recently strike an agreement with the european union that will remove a huge amount of the cost bureaucracy and delay in ensure the free flow of food to and from the european union that be a good agreement for food security 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement as he rightly say plan and respond to these kind of incident whether it be the pandemic storm flooding or major water outage like the that happen in my constituency early this year require people across all level of government to work with community how will the resilience plan launch today encourage close work between the devolve government and the uk government 
 my experience in the year since the general election be that on matter such as this co operation and joint working between the uk government and the devolve government be good i be pleased to say that this be an area where party politic be usually leave outside the door and i think that be right my hon friend be absolutely right when an emergency hit we need good co operation and dialogue with either the devolve government or local authority and local resilience forum which i refer to in my statement 
 the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster reference the considerable spending on flood defence over the next few year he will be aware that the port of immingham and much of the south bank of the humber be severely affect by a tidal surge in although much work have be do in recent year can he give an assurance to business and resident that the south bank of the humber will remain a priority for increase flood defence expenditure 
 we have set aside some £ for investment in flood defence the detail of when and where that will be spend will be set out by my right hon friend the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement of the most striking conclusion from the covid inquiry be that vulnerable people be the hard hit what step be the government take to ensure that support will reach vulnerable people much more quickly in the event of another incident 
 that be a good and important question as i say resilience have to be for all not just for some this be take very seriously at the national situation centre as datum get well as for example energy company get a well map of their vulnerable customer we be get to a well place when it come to know exactly where the government should direct their effort when an emergency hit it be a really important part of community solidarity that people of all income group know that the government be there for they when an emergency hit 
 will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster confirm that climate relate emergency be a core part of this resilience strategy climate breakdown have the potential to threaten our core infrastructure and pose risk to our core support system such as food and water and the climate change committee say that we be woefully ill prepared for climate relate change so do he agree that the issue should be not a political football instead it should be central to the government ’s resilience plan for protect our citizen 
 i welcome that question if the hon gentleman want a full list of what be on the risk register it be a public document so he can look at that i refer several time in my statement to energy security to get the energy security that we need we will have to invest in a lot of new kit and equipment around the country it be really important that we be allow to build that without people object to it at every turn 
 i have call for a responsibility revolution in which all business organisation and individual play their part in the national interest i have see that in my constituency on a visit to the national gas station which be a part of the critical infrastructure and when talk to the wolston and brandon flood action group will my right hon friend set out what step the government be take to provide well information to the public so that they can play their part in make our country more resilient 
 i very much agree with my hon friend this issue involve the public understanding the risk and i think we should make this conversation normal that be why it be right that we do the emergency test of the system we have use it a few time in live scenario in storm that pose a real risk to life during last winter and in or more localise situation the public be become more aware but we will continue to make more information available so that people have a great awareness of these situation and what they might be able to do to increase their own resilience
