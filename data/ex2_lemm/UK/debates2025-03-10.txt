 i want to make a statement about saturday ’s security incident the safety and security of all who work on and visit the parliamentary estate be my top priority i have ask for a review to be undertake of saturday ’s incident and will ensure that lesson be learn from it i thank all those who be involve in help to ensure that saturday ’s incident be resolve safely an individual have be charge and the house ’s sub judice resolution now apply finally i remind member that we do not discuss the detail of security measure in the chamber i will not be take point of order on this matter if member or other have concern they should contact the director of parliamentary security of course i be always available to discuss these issue with colleague 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of exceptional funding for school 
 i be proud that while this government have make tough decision we have protect key education priority there be additional investment in breakfast club we be rebuild and improve our special educational need and disability system and we be do much more after year of decline dither and delay we be put education back at the heart of national life and break down barrier to opportunity for every child in every community 
 in response to the hon lady ’s specific question exceptional funding will continue to be allocate through local authority on a case by case basis 
 chesham grammar school in my constituency have receive exceptional funding from the department for some year to facilitate the hire of the neighbouring leisure centre ’s sport hall for pe lesson this year the school ’s application have be deny despite its circumstance not have change it still have no on site sport hall and it still need to fund the £ hiring fee each year will the minister meet i to discuss this particular case to ensure that the student of chesham grammar school have access to the pe curriculum the school be require to provide come september 
 i would be happy to arrange a meeting for the hon lady to discuss this matter far buckinghamshire request for a local authority own facility to be fund and in line with the publish guidance rental cost for local authority own facility be out of scope of the exceptional funding however local authority should organise such provision within the cost availability for school i would be happy to discuss the matter far 
 too many child in southall go to school hungry so i be delighted that the chancellor and this labour government have choose to triple investment in breakfast club and that some of the free breakfast club will open at blair peach and wolf fields primary school in my constituency do the minister agree that child learn well with a full stomach 
 my hon friend be absolutely right which be why we be focus our investment on breakfast club which will ensure that child get not only a good start to the day with a full belly but the support of a club that will help they to achieve and thrive 
 how many school leave the breakfast club early adopter scheme prior to february 
 last month labour announce the wave of primary school set to offer the new free breakfast club we be delighted that more than school apply to be early adopter with start to deliver from the summer term mean that child will start the day ready to learn and parent will save up to £ while conservative member can not bring themselves to welcome the club labour be boost parent work choice and child ’s life chance 
 primary school have be force to pull out of the pilot or take a financial hit to participate in it do the secretary of state really believe that the basic funding rate for breakfast be 60p 
 no i do not because that be not actually the case i be afraid that be not the only area where the hon lady be mistaken the conservatives should swallow their pride and welcome these breakfast club which will transform the life chance of child across our country be incredibly popular with parent and will ensure that all our child get a brilliant start to the school day 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests i welcome opposition members interest in breakfast club can the secretary of state confirm that all primary school and all primary school student will have breakfast club by the end of this parliament 
 i recognise the incredible work that the early adopter will be take forward but it be the case that all primary school will offer a universal free breakfast club under this labour government opposition member can raise the previous scheme   that they leave behind all they like but those scheme be far less generous this labour government be treble investment in breakfast club 
 what progress her department have make on establish regional improvement for standard and excellence team 
 labour ’s rise team have hit the ground run the wave of adviser professional with a prove track record of drive up standard be now draw up improvement plan with school the tories leave more than stuck school teach over child with no plan for improvement labour will drive high and rise standard turn those school around and create a system where every child can achieve and thrive 
 in my area the government have identify stuck school in cheshire east and in cheshire west can the secretary of state explain the support that will be make available to they to drive up standard what lever do rise team have if school choose not to follow their advice 
 universal support will be available to all school to drive up standard but we expect all school to engage in mandatory target rise intervention we will not hesitate to act where there be concern unlike the last conservative government we will not stand by as child pass through school that be not deliver year after year 
 the attainment gap in the south west be the large in england across the primary and secondary sector in the past local authority have play a big role in improve education what plan do the government have for local authority to be involve in close that attainment gap 
 the hon lady be right to identify the disadvantage gap that exist in many part of the country and the challenge in her part of the country we believe that local authority have an important role to play work with trust leader and other to drive up standard that be why through the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill we be bring forward measure to ensure that the system work together more effectively include in area such as admission and place planning 
 when she expect the interim report on the curriculum and assessment review to be publish 
 under the tories young people feel underprepared for their future and employer agree that too many be leave school lack the skill need in the modern workplace and ill equipped for an ever change world through the independent curriculum and assessment review labour will bring forward a cutting edge curriculum   that ensure that all our child leave school ready for work and for life the interim report will be publish in the spring 
 parent and pupil will think that minister be on another planet when they hear such answer sat in year and mean that primary school can be hold accountable and that we can measure progress datum through secondary education but the national education union say that sats do not benefit learn and want the government to abolish they will the minister rule out abolish sat in primary school yes or no 
 assessment clearly have an important role to play in support achievement and development within school we will consider how the reform curriculum and assessment will affect school we recognise the importance of support school through any change that come forward in the interim and final report 
 from the rise of andrew tate to the re emergence of tommy robinson lot of young people i speak to are concerned about the extremism and conspiracy theory that they be encounter online last month an important report from public and the pears foundation highlight the need to do more to empower school and teacher to tackle those thing in the classroom how will we use the curriculum review to make the most of this moment to empower young people to feel safe in online space 
 my hon friend raise an important point we already provide guidance and resource to help and support teacher to recognise some of those challenge to intervene swiftly where necessary and not to tolerate a culture that excuse harm and the experience of woman school must be place where all young people can thrive and be ready for work and life we will ensure that the curriculum and assessment review reflect that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 reason why england ’s school rise up the international league table in recent year be that they spend more time on core academic subject such as english and math have fall sharply under the last labour government the share of pupil do double or triple science at gcse have also go up from to can the minister reassure the house that time will not be take away from the core academic subject and that their content will not be cut back as a result of the curriculum review 
 the government enter office to unprecedented challenge include crumble public service and crippling public finance in the face of a significant financial black hole we be take tough decision to fix the foundation but we be protect key education priority rebuild school and roll out breakfast club and we will continue to do so 
 what step she be take to increase funding for send provision 
 what step she be take to ensure adequate level of high need block funding 
 the government inherit a lose lose lose send situation the tories even describe it as such in their own word with the deputy chief whip say that they should hang their head in shame over what they leave behind since enter government labour have restructure the department to put send at its heart we have invest £ into service and £ to create additional specialist place but we be under no illusion that reform to the system be desperately need and we have bring in expert adviser to help we achieve that 
 in london alone the deficit for this year be estimate to be £ but that will grow to £ next year unless more money be put in clearly there be a problem that we need to address ideally those with special educational need should be teach in mainstream education however it be much cheap for local authority to have in house provision and special need school in the borough rather than send child to another more expensive borough harrow be grant a new special educational need school under the last government will the minister confirm that it will proceed it have the support of all the headteacher and cross party support 
 the hon gentleman describe the challenge that result from year under the previous government we recognise the strain that the rise cost of send provision be put on local government which be why we will be set out plan to reform the send system with further detail to come this year include how local authority will be support to manage their historical and accruing deficit decision on new school provision and building will also be make in due course 
 have the department give due consideration to update the allocation policy it be currently base on historical funding which leave borough such as barking and dagenham at a disadvantage for sen provision compare with inner london borough 
 the structure of the high need funding formula be largely unchanged in as we take time to consider what change might be necessary to ensure a fair system that direct funding to where it be need and that will support our future send reform we will continue to consider where change to the formula will be require the secretary of state visit a school in dagenham in december and see at hand its excellent work and the difference it be make to child with special educational need in my hon friend ’s area 
 i draw the attention of member to my entry in the register of members financial interests i have a school in my constituency that be very good at help student with education health and care plan so much so that it be struggle   with the number of student who have ehcp will the minister meet i to discuss this issue and wide send issue in my constituency 
 the government want to ensure that education health and care plan be issue quickly to help child and young people achieve and thrive official work continuously with local authority to offer support where there be issue with timeliness to ensure that effective recovery plan be in place i be sure that a meeting could be arrange for the hon gentleman to discuss his particular concern in more detail 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 the deep crisis in our send system which be of both funding and delivery be let down far too many child and require urgent action will the minister update the house on the timing of the government ’s plan for send and provide assurance that there will be full engagement with parent professional and young people with send on any such plan 
 we recognise the unprecedented pressure that local authority be under and that the system do not currently deliver the good education possible for family who want the good for their child as quickly or thoroughly as it should we will be announce more detail of reform plan this year we consult continuously with family representative of family and local authority and we will work closely with my hon friend ’s committee 
 across the school in mid norfolk send provision be the no issue for parent teacher and staff contrary to the party political broadcast from ministers in the last year i be lucky to secure £ from the conservative coalition for a new school and conservative county council funding for a new school in swaffham official in the department for education have also be constructive in work on a pathfinder for rural hub and speak support parent in rural area really struggle what be minister do to take that forward to support small rural school to access specialist help in hub 
 i know that the hon gentleman raise his concern in all sincerity we will continue to work with all partner parent teacher local authority and indeed the nhs on how we reform our send system and ensure that the support that be need reach every part of every community our ambition be for a more inclusive mainstream school system that draw on the right education and health specialist to ensure that every child receive the support that they deserve 
 far too many child with complex learning disability and autism have be fail by the system and end up have a place not in their local community but in institution that disproportionately affect black child which be synonymous with the 60 and 70 when they be classify as educationally subnormal will the minister explain what work be be do to identify the number of child who have be institutionalise what work have be undertake to review and amend those situation 
 i know that this issue be important to my hon friend she have quite rightly be raise it through a number of avenue i will continue to work with she to ensure that we learn from the past when far too many child be let down and that as we reform our send system it be fit for purpose and serve every child 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 some of the huge cost pressure on send budget be be drive by the lack of state special school place with many council force to send child with complex need to private special school that can cost to time more than local authority provision there be many brilliant independent special school provide value for money yet we know that some private equity firm be profiteer with upwards of profit margin from the school that they run why will ministers not back liberal democrat amendment to the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill to include special school in their propose profit cap backstop for child ’s social care provider 
 the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill be a landmark piece of legislation that the hon lady know bring forward really important change that will keep child safe as well as reform our school system so that it serve all we be focus on improve inclusivity and expertise in mainstream school and ensure that we do have special school that can cater for those with the most complex need our priority be restore the trust that parent should have that their child will get the support they need we will do all that be necessary as part of our send reform to ensure that that be deliver 
 what recent progress she have make on determine the future of the institute of technology 
 the department value the approach of the institute of technology which bring together education and industry to develop and deliver curriculum relate to local employer and create sustainable pathway for talent development we will continue to work with iot include swindon and wiltshire iot in develop our strategy for post-16 skill 
 i thank the minister for her response would she consider meet i so that we can work together on grow iot like swindon especially give their degree award power 
 iot bring together further education and high education provider to deliver high level technical qualification include degree and apprenticeship i could offer to meet my hon friend but i be sure he would much prefer to meet my noble friend the skills minister from the other place i will raise his request with she 
 the stimulating physics network have be work to improve the knowledge skill and confidence of non specialist science teacher in secondary school with outstanding result in school that take part there be more a level physics entrant and more girl take physic that compare with in school that do not take part however fund for the scheme have be cancel from   march which be a considerable problem for constituency like mine which have a need for science technology engineering and math stem skill due to the need of the defence sector what plan do the minister have to fill the gap leave by the spn in order to ensure that the value of physics teaching in school be maintain and to reassure teacher include my constituent thom who have be commit to deliver the spn 
 we absolutely support girl and young woman to take stem subject it be interesting that the conservatives do fund mid year which be unusual as i be sure that they will be aware hard decision need to be make because of the difficult fiscal situation inherit by this government we will continue to do more to get girl into stem subject we be absolutely committed to this 
 what step she be take to increase the number of child and young people who read for pleasure 
 high and rise school standard and excellent foundation in reading writing and math be a key part of our plan for change which aim to ensure that every child get the good start in life read for pleasure be hugely important last month labour announce £ of investment in drive high and rise standard by embed the success of phonic and ensure that child and teacher develop reading skill that include child read for pleasure 
 when i be grow up in the 1980 my nose be always bury in a book and i let my imagination run wild nowadays in child have a mobile phone by the time they reach the age of and statistic show that there have be a steep decline in the number of child read for pleasure do the minister agree that the like of roald dahl and jacqueline wilson should not be replace by a smartphone and will she prioritise child ’s reading for pleasure in the school curriculum 
 i be sure all member join in celebrate world book day in their school i absolutely agree with my hon friend and recognise how important it be to encourage child to read for pleasure we know that read for pleasure do happen in school teacher already encourage their student to listen to discuss and read a wide range of story poem book and play importantly this can also start at home where parent can show how much they love read that be why i commend the lbc campaign kids who read   succeed an excellent initiative to encourage read and ensure that all child parent and teacher get that message 
 in all library in my constituency this week mid sussex baby and toddler will be enjoy themselves at rhyme time i hope that will be the start of many happy year of reading for my young constituent will the minister join i in congratulate west sussex library service on its birthday last month and will she commit to lobby the chancellor and the deputy prime minister to ensure that my county council be sufficiently well fund to enable west sussex to keep its library open to the public for another year 
 i absolutely join the hon lady in congratulate the library service on its success we all know how valuable our local library be in support and encourage child and family to read this be obviously a priority we encourage read for pleasure as much as read for study and it be something we clearly need more of as be longevity as she rightly say 
 i call the shadow minister neil o’brien 
 i completely agree with   the hon member for hampstead and highgate tulip siddiq what be displace read for pleasure among child be smartphone and social medium include in school the department for education ’s own behaviour survey find that nearly half of pupil in year and report that in most or all lesson mobile phone be be use when they should not be the guidance be not work so why be the government continue to block our proposal for a proper ban on smartphone in school 
 last year under the previous government we see the steep year on year drop in the number of child and young people enjoy read the hon member should look at the record of his government before point the finger phone should not be out in school it be a simple as that head have the power to impose rule that suit their school community just a year ago his government claim that they be prohibit mobile phone in school and that their guidance mean a consistent approach across school those be their word the then secretary of state say 
 we be give our hard work teacher the tool to take action 
 be that secretary of state right back then when they back the tory government ’s measure or be the hon member 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to implement the plan for change mission entitle break down barriers to opportunity 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to implement the plan for change mission entitle break down barriers to opportunity 
 this labour government be determined to break the link between background and success so that where someone be from do not determine where they end up in life that work start with the early year which be when we can make the big difference to child ’s life chance through our plan for change we will get ten of thousand more child a record share start school ready to learn because child grow up in our country deserve the good start in life and nothing less 
 what specific step be be take to ensure that the plan for change will help those in my constituency of wolverhampton west who have historically face systemic barrier to opportunity such as those with special educational need those from ethnic minority background and those from a background of low socioeconomic status 
 in wolverhampton west and across our country this labour government be determined to ensure that background be no barrier to get on in modern britain that be why we will reform the special educational need and disability system to ensure that all our child get the support that they need to thrive alongside that we have deliver the big ever uplift in the early year pupil premium we be roll out breakfast club in our primary school and will be launch the phase of primary base nursery ensure that all our child have access to fantastic early year education 
 last week i visit hertfordshire and essex high school in bishop ’s stortford sele school in hertford and hertford regional college in ware at each i meet young people with exciting ambition for the future i welcome the action that the government be take to build our young people ’s confidence and open up opportunity for they as we break down the barrier to opportunity will the secretary of state set out in further detail how the government be support young people in constituency like mine to discover a subject that they be passionate about develop a new skill and find the path that be right for they 
 my hon friend have evidently have a busy week in his constituency and i know he champion young people and the need to drive up standard in education under our plan for change we be start learn early through accessible and affordable early year education we be ensure that all young people will have the skill that they need to seize opportunity with strong pathway into post-16 learning we also want to ensure that throughout people ’s life they have the chance to get on at work the change that i set out during national apprenticeship week we be cut red tape to create more than apprenticeship will make a big difference to adult learner in his constituency and right across our country 
 this slogan word salad of a question talk about break down barrier to opportunity many of my constituent want to know how on earth implement an education tax on the independent school sector break down barrier to opportunity it put up those barrier for parent who have scrimp and save to put their child through   independent school it be a policy of spite that will hurt the state school sector what this government be do be far from break down barrier it be put up barrier to aspiration 
 this labour government be aspirational and ambitious for all our child include the vast majority of child who go to school in the state system i be go to say that the conservatives have not get much to say on education and that be true but the policy that they actually have be to reverse the tax change that labour have introduce in order to invest more in our state system we need to hear from they where they would find the money to pay for the teacher and wide support that all our child deserve despite all the scaremongering that we have hear from the private school lobby at national offer day last week more child get their choice place what the scaremonger predict have just not come to pass 
 the plan for change include the mission to break down barrier to opportunity and build an nhs fit for the future but many nhs trust include mine which represent st richard ’s hospital in chichester report that they be unable to offer level and level apprenticeship due to a lack of backfill funding that often result in they hand back the apprenticeship levy what step be the department for education take to address that fundamental flaw in the scheme and to ensure that apprenticeship deliver the nurse and midwife of the future 
 apprenticeship have an important role to play in our system include in our nhs i be work closely with the health secretary to ensure that we address the long stand workforce challenge leave behind by the conservatives as part of the workforce plan for the nhs we want to ensure that all employer can take on more apprentice and that we drive forward in key shortage area the change that we be introduce through skills england will make a big difference in address and respond to the big skill shortage that we face in this country 
 i call the shadow minister 
 labour ’s plan say that the early year must be the top priority but a survey by the national day nurseries association find that nursery fee be go up by on average because the government be not compensate nursery for the cost of the national insurance increase will the government rethink that decision which the early years alliance have describe as catastrophic or will it be just another example of a tax on work people 
 we be invest more in the early year system through the budget there be record level of investment to support family with the expansion that they be promise by the conservatives but for which there have be no funding for delivery we have also deliver the single big uplift in the early year pupil premium alongside an expansion grant because we know that in too many part of the country parent be unable to access the place that they have be promise we be determined to turn that around   our ambition to roll out primary base nursery will also make a big difference by support parent in the childcare desert leave by the conservatives 
 what step she be take to help reduce the cost of send child to school 
 our child ’s wellbeing and schools bill will introduce free breakfast club in all state fund primary school in england and measure to help with the cost of school uniform breakfast club will save family up to £ a year put money directly back into parent pocket our action be urgent which be why we be roll out early adopter from april we be get on with deliver the change that we promise limit the number of brand uniform item will give parent more flexibility keep cost down for family and save some parent over £ on the back to school shop 
 i thank the minister for his answer and congratulate the department on its excellent work on the child poverty taskforce lesson time and learning be be significantly affect by high level of child poverty school in sheffield central tell i that many low income family be really struggle financially will the minister confirm what specific action the government be take to turn the tide on child poverty and put money back into people ’s pocket 
 there be no challenge more crucial for this government than tackle child poverty the taskforce have start the urgent work of publish the strategy which will look at lever across key theme increase income reduce essential cost increase financial resilience and well local support especially in early year 
 parent whose child have special educational need and disability do not wish to send their child to far away school but they have to because of a lack of local provision if the child be over the age of however it be at the discretion of the local authority to decide whether to meet the cost of transport they to school even though education be effectively compulsory until the age of many local authority include in leicester south be now pass that cost entirely on to parent will the minister commit to deal with send transport cost in the department ’s work to reduce the cost of send child to school 
 i will happily meet the hon member to discuss those issue far 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the child poverty action group estimate that the parent of a child in secondary school spend on average over £ a year on school uniform the government ’s move to limit the number of brand uniform item to or be well intentione but there be nothing to stop the overinflation   of the price of those item a cap on cost review annually would not just guarantee pound and penny save for parent but give school the freedom to set their own uniform policy rather than ministers in whitehall tell headteacher and school governor what to do will ministers think again and back the liberal democrat amendment to the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill next week 
 school uniform play a valuable role in create a sense of common identity and reduce visible inequality among pupil the liberal democrat spokesperson make a number of point in the bill committee and the department will certainly take forward her view and idea 
 what recent assessment she have make of trend in the number of school exclusion of pupil with special educational need and disability 
 every child have the right to succeed in education we publish datum termly and review trend include where pupil with send be disproportionately affect by exclusion we know that some group of child be at high risk of exclusion which be why the government be break down barrier to opportunity by ensure early intervention in mainstream school for all pupil include those at risk of exclusion we be clear that school have a legal duty not to discriminate against pupil with send under the equality act 
 too many child with send in south cambridgeshire be out of school due not only to exclusion but to the long waiting time for specialist or alternative provision when mainstream school can not meet their need i be shocked to hear about harry a constituent of mine who have be receive just hour of forest school a week for the past month as his only education—15 month what urgent action be the minister take to increase specialist and alternative provision so that child like harry can get the full and adequate education they need and deserve 
 i thank the hon member for share harry ’s story i know she be a champion for such issue in her constituency the government ’s ambition be for all child with send to receive the right support to succeed the curriculum assessment review will look at how barrier to exclusion can be remove and high standard support for child to support furth the vision that the department announce there be also £ for the high need capital block next year 
 permanent exclusion from primary school should be an almost non existent occurrence any primary age pupil exhibit difficult behaviour should undertake diagnosis for send and good effort should be make to understand any trauma that the child may have suffer what be the minister do to ensure that we build a system that prioritise the early identification of need and quick delivery of intervention so that child do not fall behind 
 we be aware that some group of child have a high risk of exclusion which be why we be break down barrier to opportunity to ensure that every child can achieve and thrive we be committed to ensure early intervention in mainstream school for pupil particularly those at risk of exclusion 
 what step she be take to improve management accountability at multi academy trust 
 accountability be non negotiable for this government and we know that when standard slip it be disadvantaged child who suffer through ofsted reform we be put an end to high stake low information headline judgment and in their place school report card will provide clear detail on what school be do well and where they must improve high standard must be for every child in every school so we be increase the oversight of multi academy trust our focus remain on standard not structure 
 i have a case in my constituency where a governor feel that she be push out have raise concern about senior teaching staff i understand from last year ’s sky news report that that may not necessarily be an isolated incident as the accountability process potentially involve trustee mark their own homework i be a strong supporter of academy but there must be a balance will the minister commit to bring in a system of accountability and transparency to prevent such thing from happen 
 where concern about an academy be identify or raise the department work closely with the trust to ensure that all statutory requirement be be meet we be legislate in the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill for a more proportionate route to intervention in the event of trust not comply with legal duty or act in a way that be not reasonable i appreciate the complexity of the issue that the hon gentleman raise and i would be happy to arrange a meeting to discuss it far 
 in my constituency of camborne and redruth a small number of multi academy trust be contribute to a high level of suspension and exclusion will the minister meet i to discuss that as a matter of urgency 
 i appreciate the concern that my hon friend raise and i would be happy to arrange a meeting to discuss they in more detail 
 i call the shadow secretary of state laura trott 
 of the key metric for hold school and trust to account be pupil number parent vote with their foot why be the secretary of state stop good school from be able to expand in the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill that will stop competition and accountability erode parental choice and drive down standard 
 the right hon lady appear to have misunderstood both the aim and impact of the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill we recognise that parent must have an opportunity to have good school in their area and that school must be able to set admission number to meet the requirement of the local community that be why we expect local authority to co operate with school in their area and expect all school to co operate with the local authority to ensure that the right number of school place be available in the area where they be need 
 what step she be take to increase funding for agricultural education and training 
 land base college receive high funding per student to support delivery of programme in agriculture horticulture and forestry and animal care and veterinary science the to national funding rate will rise by in increase the funding for those programme 
 kingston maurward college in my constituency of west dorset provide essential training in agriculture offer degree apprenticeship and short course to equip the next generation of farmer with critical skill what measure will the minister take to ensure that farming course be not underfunde compare with other vocational course and that agriculture be promote as a viable career path 
 this government be commit to education for to year old and beyond extra funding be available for all important skill in high value and high cost area include manufacturing and farming we value farmer hugely and we be commit to invest £ in the farming budget over year 
 what step she be take to increase the number of construction apprenticeship 
 where the previous government fail labour be get britain build again our pioneer new homebuilding skill hub will deliver fast track training mean more opportunity new home and strong growth some hub across the country will create more construction apprenticeship place and play a part in get britain build again a homebuilding revolution require a skill revolution and labour will provide more home great opportunity and strong growth 
 have work in construction for a couple of decade prior to be elect i be glad the government recognise the importance of the industry and be firmly committed to house building especially social and affordable housing to make the dream of home ownership a reality once again for our young people the conservative   government duck the difficult decision for too long so will the minister outline exactly how the government plan to create the skill and apprenticeship that we need so that the home that slough family deserve can finally be build 
 i assure my hon friend that this government be not duck or dive the tough decision that need to be make homebuilding skill hub will create more apprenticeship in occupation where there be shortage such as bricklaying and groundwork the change that we have introduce to english and math will support thousand more apprentice to achieve each year include in construction this government of action be build the skilled workforce this country need include in slough 
 level apprenticeship play a vital role throughout our economy include in the construction industry and support social mobility i recently meet young hard work apprentice in mid bedfordshire who would not be able to achieve their ambition without level but there be concern about the future of those apprenticeship will the minister take this opportunity to reassure employer and apprentice that she understand the value of level apprenticeship 
 this government have an extremely challenging fiscal inheritance there be tough choice to take on how funding should be prioritise to generate opportunity for young people to start fulfil career learner who have start will be fund to completion and we expect to make a final decision on effective apprenticeship shortly we be commit to level apprenticeship and to people continue their education to a good standard 
 what recent progress she have make on school building programme 
 we have commit £ for to continue the current school rebuilding programme which be rebuild or significantly refurbish building at school and form college across england all project have be give indicative timeline for delivery base on prioritisation of need around half have be commence so far and be at various stage of delivery

 along with my hon friend i be delighted that so many school in his constituency be receive significant investment through the school rebuilding programme ensure that school and college   have the resource and building that they need be a key part of our plan to break down barrier to opportunity and ensure that every child get the good start in life 
 the minister may remember that the last labour government have building schools for the future some £ be spend on building and it to transform education except building and it do not transform education there be global evidence to back that up because building school be not a new thing can the minister reassure the house that we will never have a repeat of that extravagant and waste programme but that we will ensure we have functional school with brilliant teacher able to teach our child 
 ensure that school and college have the resource and building that they need be key to our mission to break down barrier to opportunity i will take no lecture from the conservative party on education 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 last month labour announce the school set to offer free breakfast club next month through the club we will boost the life chance of up to child and begin to save parent up to £ that come as we improve the quality of early year education alongside our department ’s rise adviser support stuck school drive high and rise standard and bring school together to improve attendance in national apprenticeship week we celebrate by cut red tape to unlock more apprenticeship every year at the department for education we be the department for opportunity and we be prove that we be the department for delivery too 
 on friday i meet with the headteacher of all the secondary school in rossendale they face many challenge but they be unanimous that the single big issue they face be a lack of capacity in special school and alternative provision in our area rossendale have no place child ’s complex need be not be meet and huge additional pressure be be place on our mainstream school that be the legacy of year of neglect what step will this government take to address special school and alternative provision in area such as rossendale and darwen 
 i understand my hon friend ’s concern and the concern of headteacher in his constituency sadly i hear that story in every part of our country we inherit as a government a system that the previous secretary of state describe as lose lose lose we be invest more into the system and we want to ensure that there be more mainstream inclusion but we recognise the need to invest in specialist provision for child who need it most 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 how on earth can the secretary of state justify spend £ on a year contract for advertising and medium while cut a £ latin excellence programme mid year that be help to improve school standard in some of the most deprived area of the country do that not show that the secretary of state ’s priority be all wrong 
 the right hon lady be a minister in the treasury and she be responsible for leave behind the black hole that this labour government be have to sort out we face unprecedented challenge when it come to latin we be work with classic association to ensure that child can continue to study latin it be important that child in our state school have that opportunity but the conservatives design the scheme to terminate in february maybe the right hon lady can tell we why that be 
 the secretary of state be spend £ on advertising she be cut not just latin programme but compute hub language hub and advanced math be those also less important than her advertising budget 
 yet again we hear a lot of sound and fury from the right hon lady but no recognition of the mess that the conservatives leave behind which it fall to this labour government to resolve we be invest more in early year more into our school and more into education yes some of the investment we need to make be about ensure that people come forward to train as teacher particularly because of the chronic issue we face around recruitment and retention because of the mess leave behind after the last conservative government 
 red   hall   primary school in my constituency of dudley be split down the middle by zoar street the theft of lead from the victorian roof leakage and no real playground do not make an environment for child to thrive in the conservatives shelve the plan to consolidate and repair the school on side of the road will the minister meet with i to discuss reopen those plan

 the   university of kent which be the large employer in my constituency be make yet more redundancy due to the enormous debt it owe to international bank will the secretary of state commit to hold crisis meeting with desperate university and their creditor to help secure more sustainable term and a potential way out of the financial emergency that they face 
 i recognise the pressure that many institution across our country face the last conservative government regard university as a political battleground not a public good we face a big challenge in stabilise the finance of our university which be why we have refocus the office for student to ensure that it tackle much early the challenge that the hon lady describe that be also why i take the difficult but necessary decision to increase tuition fee so that we have more revenue go into our university 
 the previous government fail to build much need new school building at dorset studio school and fail for year to open the propose osprey quay special school for child with special educational need dorset studio school urgently need a new home and family in my patch be hugely in need of a send school at the osprey quay site so can the minister outline what step the government be take to get those crucial project over the line 
 the feasibility and project cost for those project be currently be review and the relevant approval will then be seek i will ensure that my hon friend be keep up to date on progress ensure that school and college have the resource and building they need be key to our delivery of the opportunity mission and to give every child the good start in life 
 great teaching and great policy see child in england soar up the international league table under the last government to become the good in the western world i think that the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill risk that progress if the secretary of state disagree will she put her money where her mouth be and resign if england fall down the international league table 
 that be the kind of hyperbole that we often get from the right hon gentleman from that question and from the shameless sense of pride the misplaced sense of pride that conservative members often have you would not know that in child be not school ready in child be regularly out of school and our score be drop contrary to what the right hon gentleman have suggest we face big challenge around standard and a huge disadvantage gap there be a lot that this labour government be have to turn around to ensure that all child get a great start in life 
 the prime minister ’s welcome announcement over the past couple of week of an increase in defence spending create both an opportunity and a challenge for the department as well as for the whole skill system in this country will the secretary of state please outline how she will work with the ministry of defence to ensure that gap be fill in particular how will she ensure that the scottish government in edinburgh take proper action on defence skill as they have fail to do over the past year 
 my hon friend be right the set of statistic release under the labour government show   that apprenticeship start participation and achievement be all on the up compare with the same period under the tories we have celebrate by go far and fast to cut red tape so that up to more apprentice can achieve each year that be a clear contrast to the failure that we see under the tories for year and the continue failure of the snp it be time for change in scotland and only labour can deliver that change

 will the secretary of state confirm how many send child be forecast to have to leave the independent sector and go into the state sector because of the imposition of vat on fee what will be the cost of that to the taxpayer 
 labour ’s plan to end the tax break that private school enjoy will invest significant money into state education i be really surprised that the hon gentleman do not welcome the extra investment that will be go into school in his constituency when it come to child with send where the place be derive through an ehcp there will be no additional cost as i say early the scaremongering that people like he have engage in be just prove to be wrong 
 i have often raise the importance of further education and the transformative impact it can have i know that the minister and the secretary of   state share my belief in excellent education for all instead of the broken skill system that the tories leave behind to that end what step be the minister take to ensure that student without the necessary qualification to get on to t level do not end up fall through the net 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to demonstrate her concern we want a skill system that provide opportunity and deliver growth the curriculum and assessment review be look at how we can ensure that high value qualification pathway be available for to year old as we continue to reform qualification we will consider the review finding and publish they later in the year

 what resource be be provide to school to support restorative justice initiative in relation to knife crime especially victim lead approach such as workshop or peer mentoring to engage young people in conversation about its prevention

 in each of the past year teacher have leave the profession owe to burnout and excessive workload what concrete   step will the government take to address that and how can we reverse the exodus from this fantastic profession

 with permission mr speaker i will make a statement on syria 
 event in syria over the past few day be deeply concern we be work as quickly as possible to establish from reliable source of information what exactly happen and who be responsible but report that a large number of civilian have be kill in coastal area in ongoing violence be horrific as the foreign secretary make clear in his statement yesterday the interim authority in damascus must ensure the protection of all syrians and set out a clear path to transitional justice 
 this be a critical moment for syria and for the interim authority to demonstrate their intent to promote stability and to govern in the interest of all syrians since the fall of assad on   december our priority have be to support a syrian lead and syrian own political transition that lead to an inclusive non sectarian and representative government we have be clear that anyone seek a role in govern syria should demonstrate a commitment to the protection of human right unfettered access for humanitarian aid and the safe destruction of chemical weapon stockpile and combat terrorism and extremism this be the only way forward towards a more stable free and prosperous future for syria and for syrians who suffer for so long under the brutal assad regime we have consistently emphasise this message in all our diplomatic engagement with the interim authority and in concert with our international partner we will continue to focus our diplomacy to this end 
 the uk be engage privately and regularly with the interim authority at every level include through ministers and our syria envoy we be support they to take step that will deliver a more stable free and prosperous future for the syrian people we welcome the announcement by interim syrian president al sharaa on form an inclusive transitional government lead to free and fair election we welcome the national dialogue conference hold on   february but the violence over the weekend demonstrate that more need to be do to bring syria ’s different group together and we urge the interim authority to urgently establish a clear process and timeline for the next phase of the transition representative figure from across syria need to be appoint to the transitional government and the recently announce legislative council 
 our overarching objective be a stable syria in addition to support an inclusive political process we be focus on prevent escalation of conflict in northern syria on tackle security threat include the threat from terrorism and on the destruction of chemical weapon we be also support economic recovery by lift some sanction and scale up humanitarian assistance 
 the uk like our partner impose sanction on assad ’s regime to hold he and his associate accountable for their oppression of syria ’s people in recent week the government have make change to those sanction we issue a general licence to support transaction for humanitarian activity in syria and last week we revoke   the asset freeze of entity include the central bank of syria which have be impose to prevent assad from use financial asset in conduct his vile oppression we keep all our sanction regime under close review and we target they at those who bear responsibility for repression and human right abuse it be also important that we take step to support the economic development that syria ’s people desperately need 
 the humanitarian situation in syria remain dire with over people currently in need of humanitarian assistance we will continue to support those in need across syria where it be safe to do so through non governmental organisation and un organisation we be provide food healthcare protection and other lifesave assistance in addition to agriculture livelihood and education programme since december the uk have announce over £ in additional humanitarian assistance to support vulnerable syrians inside syria and across the region 
 in conclusion this be a critical fragile moment for syria the country face significant challenge as it transition after almost year of conflict stability in syria be firmly in our interest the uk remain committed to the people of syria and we will continue to stand with they in build a more stable free and prosperous future i commend this statement to the house 
 i be grateful to the minister for advance sight of his statement 
 this be the statement on syria offer by the government this year and frankly it could not have come soon enough it be deeply alarming that in recent day we have be witness to some of the deadly violence in syria since the beginning of this dreadful conflict the opposition have be raise question write and oral about the government ’s approach to syria throughout the year so it be with some disappointment that we have have to wait this long and to be quite frank for these event for a minister to give an update 
 report that hundred of civilian have be kill in clash include alawite civilian be troubling the syrian people have suffer year of conflict and decade of oppression the country be now at a fork in the road but these terrible event be a stark reminder that a well future for the people of syria for all group and all minority be far from guarantee we should be clear that those who have ratchet up the appalling situation in recent day should pull back from the brink not jeopardise that well future 
 the labour government have decide to establish contact with hayat tahrir al sham and the interim administration in syria so can the minister confirm whether the foreign office have raise this escalation in violence with interlocutor and if so whether the government have clearly convey a set of expectation for how the temperature should be take down and stability restore can he also confirm whether there have be any direct engagement between ministers and hts leader at any point and what be his assessment of hts ’s response to this violence and the threat pose by remnant of the disgraceful assad regime 
 we note that the government have announce they be lift sanction on entity link to the depose assad regime do the violence of recent day change   the government ’s assessment of the merit of lift such sanction before the minister lift those particular sanction do he consult us and european ally as well as partner in the region be the sanction lift at the request of hts and be there plan to lift further sanction can the minister also be clear with the house about precisely what condition criterion and evidence be be use to drive these decision 
 on the minister ’s visit to turkey last week he say the uk be commit to work in partnership with turkey 
 to support syria ’s transition to an inclusive and peaceful country 
 but what exactly do that mean in practice and what do he see as turkey ’s role on security issue specifically can he confirm that there remain no change to the conservative government ’s very firm position on foreign fighter that they must not come back to the uk what be his assessment of the syrian state ’s ability to counter any isis cell in the east of the country and have he see any progress on secure border in the region and the prevention of smuggle people drug and weapon 
 the government be right that assad ’s chemical weapon stockpile need to be secure and destroy and that need to be verify by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons however be the minister confident these weapon will indeed be destroy we acknowledge that the government have put more funding into the opcw ’s syria mission follow the fall of assad ’s regime but we still need syria to meet its obligation under the chemical weapon convention in full we need concrete action as well as word 
 turn to the humanitarian situation where do the minister judge the need be most acute and how be he mobilise uk aid to ensure that it be safely distribute and be genuinely reach those innocent civilian in need with the reduction of official development assistance to can the minister confirm that syria will continue to be a priority and that fund will be make available give the security and strategic issue 
 finally on the transition to representative and inclusive governance we note the launching of the non binding national dialogue conference by the interim government of syria but do the minister believe that this process will yield the kind of result we all want for the people of syria and have he discuss this through the channel he have establish with the interim government 
 i will try to answer as many of the shadow foreign secretary ’s question as i can as she know we have have senior level contact with the new hts leadership our foreign secretary meet the interim foreign minister on the margin of the paris meeting we have not yet send ministers to damascus as many of our partner will we keep these issue under close review 
 on whether we be consult the europeans on sanction and other thing the europeans have take step on sanction slightly in advance of we i can not remember the precise date but they relax their sanction before we do i can confirm to the shadow foreign secretary that we keep all decision on sanction under very close review 
 the entity for which sanction be lift on friday be very much focused on the economic function of syria as the shadow foreign secretary know well syria be in the midst of a very significant economic crisis the syrian pound have lose of its value and we want to protect the syrian people from the consequence of that crisis the relaxation of sanction be very much focused on allow normal syrians and humanitarian actor to get on with their life but we will keep all further sanction under close review 
 the shadow foreign secretary ask about hts ’s progress on border and counter terrorism and drug she be exactly right to say that we must judge hts on its action not its word hts have make some very welcome commitment on a range of question for example we have see a welcome commitment from the new interim authority to work with the opcw the interim foreign minister have engage with the opcw which have now visit damascus that be to be welcome but the shadow foreign secretary be right that action not word will be how we judge our syria policy 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 i thank the minister for his statement and i echo his horror at the killing of civilian in syria this weekend i agree that this be a critical and fragile moment for the country 
 in a letter to i last week the foreign secretary make it clear that the government ’s policy be to push for an inclusive political process and accountability in syria this be of course exactly what be need to deal with the tension form by decade of civil war and brutal dictatorship but what be the government actually do to make sure this happen we hear about aid and the loosening of sanction be this the full extent of their plan if there be more can it be implement properly when we do not have an embassy in syria and when our special representative have visit damascus only twice this year 
 my right hon friend raise some important point include about what the transitional government will look like and the answer be that all of syria ’s diverse community need to feel that they have a presence in the new government of syria of course many alawites many druze many kurds and many christians across syria feel very nervous at the moment and we call on the interim administration to do all they can through their action not word to reassure those community that they be welcome in the new syria 
 as the shadow foreign secretary note i discuss this with my turkish counterpart last week i can confirm that we have deliver these message clearly and consistently to the interim authority that we have raise the most recent violence with they and that we be seek urgent clarification on the confusing event at the coast which as my right hon friend   the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry   say be absolutely horrifying 
 on the question of a future british presence in syria i will return to the house when i be in a position to give a fuller update 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the report from the syrian observatory for human rights that at least alawite have be kill over the past few day be deeply concern this escalation in violence undermine syria ’s fragile transition from dictatorial rule under assad and it harm effort to encourage religious and sectarian tolerance 
 at this stage it be critical that we understand whether the violence represent spontaneous clash between different sect or be the product of state direct policy this must inform the government ’s position on whether to lift sanction to support syria ’s development and reintegration into the global community 
 i note that the interim syrian government have announce the establishment of an independent committee to investigate the violent clash but this must be follow up with concrete step to protect syrians of all ethnic and religious group and ensure they be represent in the new administration as well as action to bring justice to those who have perpetrate violence in this conflict 
 the international community must also work with partner in the region to support syria ’s transition away from dictatorial rule include by emphasise the importance of embed religious and sectarian tolerance as well as the right of woman in the new syrian regime will the minister update the house on what he be do to engage with partner in the region include the syrian government to promote respect and support for religious and sectarian tolerance in syria 
 it be important too that this government recognise that neighbouring country such as jordan and lebanon have generously welcome syrian refugee but they face immense challenge in provide food shelter and essential service can the minister outline how the cut to international aid will impact our ability to support syria ’s economic development include the cut to bilateral aid to neighbouring country such as jordan and lebanon where many syrians have seek refuge 
 the liberal democrat spokesperson pose many of the most vital question we need to very carefully the determine the nature of the violence on the coast in order to make a full assessment of the most appropriate response we consult closely with all syria ’s neighbour jordan turkey and many other and have raise with they the importance of syria make this transition which be vital for syrians the region and some of the global issue the shadow foreign secretary outline whether counter terrorism or drug supply 
 on aid i can confirm that we will continue to play our full part in syria on monday there will be an international pledge conference on syria in brussels and i expect we will be able to make further announcement in advance of that 
 the interim government in syria have suggest that operation in the coastal area be complete and that thing have now calm down but human right group suggest that the violence be ongoing be the government ’s assessment that this be a spike in violence or a continue escalation in the security situation in syria 
 my hon friend rightly point to some of the confusion around event at the coast we be monitor the situation very closely and will update once we have more clarity we be call on the interim authority to ensure that the violence stop now 
 i call the father of the house
