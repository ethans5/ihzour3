 automated vehicles act 
 animal welfare livestock exports act 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to increase the competitiveness of the uk ’s defence sector 
 last month the prime minister confirm that this government be commit to increase defence spending to of gdp with a fully fund plan obviously the public want to know that we will deliver value for money that be why in parallel we be deliver a fundamental reform of acquisition through our new integrate procurement model 
 last week we hear an announcement about the development of a radio wave drone killer how be the integrated procurement model encourage and accelerate the development of that novel technology 
 my hon friend highlight the fantastic news confirm last week that we be develop a new radio frequency direct energy weapon it be an extraordinary capability that with strike can inflict hard kill on multiple drone at a cost of about 10p a shot as for how that exemplify the new approach it be about the close relationship between industry our scientist and the defence science and technology laboratory it be through the strength of the industry that we drive innovation and get the good kit into the hand of our armed force 
 we be pleased that there be an announcement from the prime minister and that the department have plan but what we actually   need be industrial capacity when the department be hand out order for fleet solid support ship to spain when it have take month to order munition when the times today show a significant drop in the number of apprenticeship and when the department admit that it still will not take past performance into account when award future contract what confidence can we have that there will be the industrial capacity and the real order to enable our defence industry to be competitive and supply our force 
 we be massively ramp up defence capacity the right hon gentleman speak about mm shell that issue be precisely why we have reach a contractual agreement with bae systems and it will be ramp up production in wales and north east england we be do the same with ship complex weapon and as i say early novel weapon and our science base this be all about give our armed force the capability that will give they the cut edge 
 i call the chair of the defence committee jeremy quin 
 the global combat air programme will be a terrific boost to our defence and aerospace industry to maximise success we must keep the typhoon production line go until it come on board so what be minister do to ensure that we maintain export 
 the chair of the select committee ask an excellent question and i assure he that there be an effort across government to promote key defence export not least the typhoon a key factor in our new integrate procurement model be the need to drive exportability that will not only ensure industrial resilience but give we protection against overly exquisite requirement from the domestic side which can result in delayed procurement it be a good question and we be focus on deliver great defence export 
 somerset be home to several organisation in the defence sector such as thales and leonardo however company in defence be concerned about the shortage in science technology engineering and math skill in the uk of defence employer report a shortage of worker with engineering skill what step be the minister taking alongside cabinet colleague to remedy those shortage and ensure that the uk defence sector remain competitive 
 the hon lady ask a good question there be a previous question about defence capacity a key part of that be not just industrial capacity and building but people she be absolutely right i visit yeovilton in somerset where i meet apprentice who be involve in the programme for our helicopter we see a demo of artificial intelligence that be help we to improve the availability of our helicopter work be happen across defence and across government but we want to do more to ensure that we have the necessary apprentice and key skill in our defence sector 
 i call the shadow secretary of state john healey 
 since the new shipbuilding strategy be launch year ago minister have give new build defence contract to the netherlands spain and last week france just day after the defence secretary declare that he be determine that new navy vessel would be build here in the uk he be the government ’s shipbuilding tsar why will he not back uk shipbuilding 
 i point out that a shipbuilding strategy cost money and that be why we be committed to spend of gdp on defence unlike the right hon gentleman on his key point about the shipbuilding strategy i have be to scotland and see the amazing yard where we be build the type and the type i have be to appledore which be contribute to fleet solid support we be committed to a uk shipbuilding sector as the secretary of state confirm in his speech last week by value of the future order book this country be now no for naval export 
 what progress his department have make on the delivery of the uk defence drone strategy 
 we be make excellent progress on implement the defence drone strategy which i launch back in february our priority be to learn the lesson from ukraine in order to build a sovereign industrial ecosystem that would enable uncrewed procurement at scale for the british armed force as for platform production our immediate priority remain deliver drone to ukraine and i confirm that we have deliver drone with many more on their way in the come month 
 do my hon friend agree that when it come to the drone threat a key priority have to be counter drone technology to defend our force do he agree that direct energy weapon will have a key role in that regard 
 my hon friend raise excellent point he be absolutely right our drone strategy must include a focus on how we defend our armed force against the threat that be out there he be also right that a key part of the solution be direct energy weapon in my response to my hon friend   the member for broadland jerome mayhew i speak about radio frequency direct energy weapon but we have also announce our procurement of the laser weapon dragonfire use our new procurement system we want to get that into the hand of our armed force as fast as possible that mean have it on naval ship by use our new minimum deployable capability approach 
 the skill of northern ireland ’s workforce be renowned across the world northern ireland would very much like to be part of the uk defence drone strategy so i ask the minister this simple question what be be be do to ensure that the skill of northern ireland ’s workforce be use for the benefit of the whole united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland 
 what a fantastic question i can answer the hon gentleman simply just a few week ago i be in belfast at the thales factory which be manufacture some of the good weapon available it will be a key part of defence export and fundamentally a key part of future order for the british army northern ireland be very much part of our defence industry 
 i call chris stephens he be not here can the front bencher answer the question as though it have be ask 
 what recent assessment his department have make of trend in the level of harassment and bullying case in the armed force 
 mr speaker i will by all mean answer the question in service complaint relate to bullying harassment and discrimination be rule admissible compare with in i be pleased to say that change to the service complaint system in june have be encourage people to come forward with their complaint the my complaint app which launch in october will make the system easy and more accessible 
 the defence anti bullying hotline be a great step forward in ensure that member of the armed force have the support that they need any time of day or night can the minister tell i what training adviser have have not only on how to help our armed force but on ensure that everything be completely anonymised so that people can go forward with their life and get the support and help that they need 
 obviously a hotline be no good if the individual at the other end of it be not train i can give my hon friend the assurance he seek the most important thing be to ensure that people have confidence that if they come forward with complaint they will be listen to and take seriously 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the minister for defence people and families for invite i to visit the defence serious crime unit which i do last thursday the people there be obviously do good work focus on tackle serious sexual and violent crime in the armed force give the doubling of report of bullying discrimination and harassment in the ministry of defence since and some case remain unresolved for up to year what be the minister do to address the toxic culture in his department why be it that such thing seem to be worsen on this government ’s watch 
 i think the right hon lady would have to admit that a lot have be do over the past or year include the setting up of the defence serious crime unit and the defence victim witness care unit they be important the general message have be   that we have a tolerance approach it have be come forward you will be listen to and take seriously it be reasonable to assume that some of the figure be the result of people now have the confidence to come forward because their complaint will be investigate independently previously that be not the case 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help detect biosecurity threat 
 defence remain committed to detect biological threat we continue to work closely with the cabinet office on this matter and be the lead department for the detect pillar of the biological security strategy we have prioritise funding to create the uk microbial forensics consortium which will strengthen our ability to detect biosecurity threat now and into the future 
 over the past few year the cost and impact of security failure relate to biosecurity have be much great than that of those relate to physical security as the funding for the defence of this country rise to of gdp will the minister ensure that he work with the cabinet office the uk health security agency the department of health and social care and other to ensure that biosecurity include protection from synthetic new threat be at the top of the agenda 
 we certainly will through the biological security strategy and the associate governance structure we be work closely with the uk health security agency to co ordinate our response to the biodefence risk and we be invest £ a year in our international biosecurity programme so we be on the same page 
 do the minister agree that there be real concern in the light of recent report about the increase recklessness with which russian operative may interfere in our economy directly and indirectly and every other aspect of british life be we prepared for that kind of mischievousness 
 yes we be 
 whether he plan to review the uk and israel military co operation agreement 
 an agreement for uk israel military co operation be sign in december there be no current plan for the agreement to be update but we continually review it to ensure that it remain relevant 
 the rector of glasgow university who be an eminent palestinian surgeon have be narrate the horror of the requirement to operate and even perform amputation on child often without morphine in gaza he have also detail the horror of the use of   white phosphorus munition white phosphoru ignite during surgery when expose to the atmosphere and require douse include during complicated operation why be we in a military pact with military force that carry out such action if the minister will not repudiate the pact entirely will he ensure that the use of white phosphorus munition in our name be not acceptable 
 of course it be not we have no role in that and we see no evidence of the prospect of that be use we should focus on our confidence that israel be an important ally which mean that we can make the point that the protection of civilian be of the utmost importance we should also remember that at the heart of this conflict be the fact that if peace be to be achieve hamas need to lay down their arm and release the hostage 
 if a person call for an intifada and chant genocidal chant they be a supporter of hamas people can also be inadvertent supporter of hamas and can aid and abet they way in which that could happen be through have an arm embargo on israel while iran continue to arm hamas so that they can repeat the   october   attack as they have say they wish to will the minister confirm that the uk government have no interest in change their policy on defence agreement with israel 
 indeed we be assure that the strength of our relationship with israel allow we to make representation about the protection of civilian and about the increase in the flow of humanitarian aid we do that in the context of it be an extremely important ally while be cognisant of the broad threat from the terrorist group hamas and iran which my hon friend mention 
 the f-35 programme have not only give world lead capability to our air force and navy but provide job and technological advancement in the uk defence industry could the minister give an assurance that any review of our relationship with israel will not jeopardise that programme 
 i can give the right hon gentleman that absolute assurance we be immensely proud of the f-35 project which deliver devastatingly effective fighting power for we and our ally and uk job 
 follow on from the agreement in november britain and israel sign a memorandum of understanding elevate the uk israel bilateral relationship to a strategic partnership the partnership be underpin by extensive security and defence co operation but it also state that we will co operate to improve palestinian livelihood and economic development what future do my hon friend see for the memorandum in the light of the war in gaza 
 my hon friend ask a relevant question our commitment to a state solution in which palestinians achieve statehood be at the heart of our diplomacy and defence posture throughout the region and it be unchanged 
 what the budget be for the maintenance of service accommodation for financial year 
 the defence infrastructure organisation ’s accommodation budget have not yet be finalise for the financial year the government continue to invest significant sum to improve the quality of uk service family accommodation the spend for on sfa maintenance and improvement be £ an additional £ of funding over financial year and be announce as part of the defence command paper refresh last july 
 the new head of infrastructure at the dio commodore leah griffin have write in her monthly newsletter to military family that the financial situation be more challenging than ever and only urgent repair will be consider we can see that on the ground in my constituency a service person ’s partner who have have abdominal surgery have be unable to climb in and out of their bath to have a shower and have be refuse any kind of modification to assist they that kind of financial challenge have a real impact on servicemen and woman ’s life could the minister look at the problem and commit to ensure a decent standard of accommodation for those people who put their life on the line for we 
 the hon lady be consistent in raise accommodation issue as ever if she have a specific case she be more than welcome to write to i about it if she have not already do so on funding i gently remind she that we commit an additional £ and because of our commitment to we can confirm that we be able to put another £ into sfa over the next year a significant investment 
 my hon friend will agree that it be important that our service accommodation be of high quality but we should also support member of our armed force in buy a home for themselves and their family what support be there in the modernised accommodation offer to help soldier sailor and pilot get on the housing ladder 
 my hon friend make an excellent point which speak to my previous career run a small business that help time buyer force help to buy have be a great success but we also recently confirm support with conveyancing cost because the cost of get on the property ladder include not just the purchase but all the ancillary cost we be commit to support our armed force personnel whether that mean invest in the accommodation of those in sfa or single living accommodation or help those who want to get on to the property ladder 
 i call the shadow minister 
 everyone who serve our country should live in a decent home but last month the independent kerslake commission ’s report on armed force housing   find that the majority of service personnel be dissatisfied with housing condition and very dissatisfied with the maintenance and repair service in service personnel still live in the low grade service accommodation the government ’s word simply do not match their action can the minister honestly look service family in the eye and say that military housing under this government be good enough 
 the debate we have be have be about investment we put in an additional £ which mean that we have be able to overhaul thousand of property perform upgrade to deal with damp and mould and put in new heating system that cost money our commitment to mean that we will get an extra £ over the next decade armed force personnel know that labour can not possibly deliver that because it will not match our commitment to 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the uk ’s defensive capacity in the north sea 
 protect the united kingdom and respond to threat in our territorial water be core business in conjunction with our ally and partner we constantly monitor activity in uk water and deter threat our warship patrol the north sea frequently to achieve that deterrence 
 i thank the minister for his answer in the north atlantic russian submarine activity have approach the most significant level since the cold war operation such as dynamic mongoose be a welcome commitment to both nato and north sea security how much of the new tranche of defence spending will be direct at the north sea and arctic security 
 of course we do not comment on our magnificent continuous at sea deterrence what i can say be that it be a matter of public record that we be committed to a magnificent new generation of type anti submarine warfare frigate which will achieve the competitive edge that keep we all safe 
 do the minister recognise that the seismic array situate at eskdalemuir in my constituency play an important part in our defence not just in the north sea but elsewhere do he agree it be essential that its capability be not in any way diminish by excessive wind farm development in the immediate vicinity of the facility 
 i agree with my right hon friend he be absolutely right in his analysis the broad point be that this be another example of why undoubtedly england and scotland through the union be safe and well together 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the uk ’s military support for israel 
 the uk and israel have a long stand defence relationship as we have discuss already this morning israel be a partner in the region and a uk israel defence co operation agreement be sign in december 
 i thank the minister for that answer the problem of unconditional uk military support for israel be that while the majority of this house and of the british public rightly support our intervention to help protect israel from missile attack from country it be a different story when it come to its intervention and aggression in gaza how will his majesty ’s government ’s policy aim to sort out that conundrum 
 nothing be unconditional the point i have make this morning be that we be support our ally overcome a devastating terrorist attack we do that because it be the honourable thing to do simultaneously we make the point to our ally that the protection of civilian life must be at the top of the operational agenda furthermore we use our military capability to ensure that humanitarian aid can flow into gaza as quickly as possible 
 in the light of the damn international criminal court statement today how concerned be the minister about the potential impact on the uk ’s military relationship with israel 
 it have no bearing we will make our judgment about the legality of our action on our own term and we be confident in that legality 
 whether he have make an assessment of the adequacy of military resource allocate by the uk to operation shader to help deter iranian attack 
 our armed force through operation shader which be focus really on the daesh threat in iraq continue to support the development of the iraqi government in term of their security we commend and thank the man and woman involve in operation shader throughout the region we do that in the knowledge that iran be indeed a threat that be undermine regional stability 
 i thank my hon friend for that answer clearly the brave resistance fighter in iran will be celebrate the demise of the butcher of tehran today iran control hamas hezbollah and other terrorist organisation give the attack by iran on israel what further assessment have my hon friend make of the potential for iran to launch another attack 
 we take the threat iran pose very seriously we note that it use its malign influence to continue to destabilise the middle east through its pernicious use of proxy our judgment be that that capability and intent remain our role in deterrence regionally be hugely important i be very pleased recently to visit the magnificent sailor of the royal navy station in bahrain i reiterate that point about the fantastic deterrent effect they be have when i have a highly   productive interview with the british forces broadcasting service you will know mr speaker if you listen to bfbs as i do that that point can not be over make we be grateful for the magnificent activity of our royal navy in the gulf which be keep we all safe 
 as the minister have say operation shader be originally put together in to defeat the sunni islamic state of iraq and the levant the liberal democrats be very supportive of the way in which the royal air force be use last month to help to intercept the iranian bombardment of israel but the last parliamentary vote on operation shader be hold in when member be approve resource and deployment of uk armed force to defeat isil will the minister subject any operation that be design to deter iranian attack to a debate and a vote 
 it seem to i to be the settled view that operation shader be a good thing and i do not sense any appetite for a parliamentary debate among colleague across the benches in this house i should put it on record that i be very pleased to meet the man and woman of the expeditionary air wing in romania who have contribute so bravely over recent month to magnificent military effect through that operation 
 what step he be take to help support the delivery of aid to the middle east 
 what step he be take to help support the delivery of aid to the middle east 
 as we have discuss today there be a desperate need for increase humanitarian support for gaza we especially in the mod be work alongside partner and international organisation to enable the cypriot maritime aid corridor initiative 
 over the past few month we have see shocking level of suffer in gaza the only sustainable way in which to end this humanitarian disaster be an immediate ceasefire and the return of all hostage but in the meantime aid must be provide to save the life of innocent civilian can the minister explain why there have be only shipment of uk aid in more than month and none so far this year 
 on the contrary we have be hugely active we have have airdrop deliver more than tonne of humanitarian aid to gaza and that be in concert with our friend in jordan we commend the magnificent man and woman of the royal air force who have be instrumental in deliver that much need aid 
 i echo the commendation that the minister have just give our air service personnel however no can be unmove by the humanitarian crisis in gaza with scene of child die of hunger it be utterly intolerable i welcome the government ’s effort   to deploy uk aid flight and airdrop into gaza but the mount scale of this disaster be show that that be simply not enough can the minister explain what the government be do to increase the number of uk aid shipment and access to ashdod port 
 we be seek to ensure an increase flow not just through the air but by road and sea which be why we have be instrumental in the setting up of the humanitarian pier we commend and thank the captain and crew of the rfa cardigan bay which be provide life support for those involve in the pier ’s delivery we hope that this be the of a sequence of increase delivery via all route 
 what step he be take to ensure that the uk meet its nato obligation 
 what step he be take to ensure that the uk meet its nato obligation 
 our commitment to nato be unwavere in response to russia ’s illegal war in ukraine we have commit almost all our force to nato we contribute to every single nato mission and declare our nuclear deterrent to nato we show our commitment not least through our increase in defence spending to 
 the public accounts committee have warn that 
 deterrence can only be effective if our armed forces be credible 
 however that have be undermine by recruitment issue with more people leave the force than be recruit what message do the secretary of state think that send to our nato ally 
 i be pleased to inform the hon lady and the house that we be now see a very high level of application last week the sea lord tell i that hms raleigh where the training take place be the full it have be for more than year we have see a big increase in application to all service and long may it continue 
 i be sure the secretary of state recognise that the uk play an outsize role in nato as a crucial bridge between the united states and europe do he agree that the uk should be contribute its huge industrial expertise to eu defence and security programme offer nato additional resilience and choice while secure sovereign capability through home grow intellectual property 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right our mission do indeed play an outsized role in nato we be the big spender in nato and the large spender in europe by a country mile as jens stoltenberg the secretary general say to i the other week as i say in my original answer we be contributor to every single nato mission plus we declare our nuclear deterrent to nato other than france we be   the only country in europe to do that we will always look at way to do more with nato commit to of gdp send a very clear signal that we be on the side of do that 
 maintain freedom of passage through the greenland iceland uk gap be an essential task for nato particularly for the resupply of europe in time of war do the secretary of state agree that there be an equally big threat from half the russian fleet be in the arctic will he join we on   thursday july   at a symposium that we and nato be hold jointly in portcullis house to discuss defence in the arctic 
 that be a very important point and question have already be raise today about the size of the russian fleet what it be do and where it be active i will have to check the date rather than answer my hon friend from the dispatch box but i be much predispose to attend the symposium 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we be warn by the secretary of state that we be in a pre war world yet we do not have sufficient training and resource to undertake high intensity warfighting and we do not have the equipment and stockpile for our force to survive a prolonged campaign it have be year when will this be put right 
 the hon gentleman may not be aware that we have just provide the large number of personnel to the large nato exercise in europe since the cold war steadfast defender which be the large exercise for year the united kingdom can be very proud of the number of people we supply on land in the air and at sea i have to make a fundamental point to those on the opposition front bench we can not just wish ourselves to security we have to spend of gdp and we have to set out the trajectory to get there that be exactly what the government have do 
 what recent estimate he have make of the cost to the public purse of trident renewal 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the trident programme but i be unclear about whether he mean the dreadnought submarine part of that of course different part of a programme often combine together but the dreadnought themselves will enter service in the early 2030s 
 that be an interesting answer from the secretary of state the government and the loyal opposition have both pledge to commit to trident renewal invest obscene amount of money that would be well use to improve our nhs to help household with the cost of live and to support personnel or indeed veteran accord to the house of commons library briefing trident renewal be expect to cost £ in price while in child   be currently live in poverty when will the secretary of state agree that trident renewal be an obscene waste of money which could be put to much well us 
 i be recently at faslane in scotland and i can tell the right hon gentleman that that be not what the people employ in the defence sector think about trident i can tell he something else have stand at the dispatch box and be defence secretary i know that the defence of this country be vastly support by have our nuclear deterrent in my view every other issue that we face come after the defence of this realm 
 although   the right hon member for midlothian owen thompson   be a value member of the intelligence and security committee i think the secretary of state would agree that the snp be very much on its own on the idea of scrap the nuclear deterrent i be put in mind of a quotation from the late denis healey who say that 
 once we cut defence expenditure to the extent where our security be imperille we have no house we have no hospital we have no school we have a heap of cinder ”—[official report   march vol c. 
 be that endorsement of deterrence not as true today as it be when he give it year ago 
 absolutely right 
 what step he be take to improve service family accommodation 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of service accommodation for armed force personnel 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of service accommodation for armed force personnel 
 currently around of service family accommodation meet or exceed the government ’s decent home standard only these property should be allocate to our family 
 as a base primarily for our royal marines chivenor in north devon see personnel station there for short period of time than many other military basis will my hon friend consider additional support for high turnaround basis perhaps include access to dental service for force family where there be problem register with local provider 
 i very much enjoy visit rm chivenor last summer and i congratulate my hon friend on be a consistent champion of the armed force in her constituency mod dental healthcare provide dentistry for our armed force personnel ensure that they be dentally fit and ready to deploy in the uk and overseas the nhs provide dental care for civilian which include the family of armed force personnel i would be more than happy to arrange a meeting between my hon friend and mod dental healthcare if she so wish 
 as the department continue to sell off service accommodation for armed force personnel include at whittington in my constituency and have abandon plan to allocate base on family size do the minister accept that this can contribute to low recruitment and retention level for the armed force 
 that be entirely why we be invest in our estate i have mention the importance of the additional £ and that be not abstract it have enable we to make a real difference to the accommodation of our armed force by put in thousand of treatment for damp and mould and lot of home be get new door new boiler and so on that be the difference the funding make and that be why our commitment to be so important it be not just about capability it be about the home of our armed force personnel 
 last month the landmark report into armed force housing find that poor quality military accommodation have become 
 a tax on the goodwill of service personnel and their family 
 do the minister agree 
 the hon lady be welcome to send i a copy of that report although i be not sure it be entirely impartial i look forward to read the conclusions—[interruption presumably it recognise that if we want well accommodation we need to put the funding in so i assume that its conclusion recommend that labour commit to 
 what step he be take to ensure that the armed force be adequately equip to tackle security threat 
 we have considerably strengthen the uk ’s defence in recent year and the prime minister ’s announcement to increase defence spending to signal our intent to invest far to ensure that our armed force be equip to deal with the threat we face we be embrace innovation invest in warfighting capability and bolster the uk ’s industrial base by reform procurement 
 the war in ukraine show that drone will play a crucial part in future conflict so what be the government learn from what be happen on the battlefield to ensure that our armed force have the equipment they need to defend we from drone attack 
 that be an excellent question from my right hon friend and i be pleased that so many colleague on this side of the house be ask about drone at the heart of our defence drone strategy be the commitment to learn from ukraine and from the frontline and we be well place to do that because we have joint leadership of both the drone capability coalition in respect of ukraine with latvia and the maritime coalition where uncrewed system have be so important jointly with norway there be key step we be take be to improve governance to cohere that learn across defence and into our armed force the other be to have a strong relationship with industry and i can confirm that next month we will be hold an industry day in the mod with drone company from across the country 
 what recent assessment he have make of the level of risk pose by hostile cyber activity to the uk ’s security 
 we take the risk of hostile cyber activity very seriously our department contribute to the national security risk assessment and the national risk register and of course play a key role in deliver the national cyber strategy to respond to hostile cyber activity against the uk 
 british cyber security be among the good in the world as the sector have innovative company employ people and revenue of £ or more under this government though the ministry of defence ’s record on cyber security only get bad with breach triple over the last year what step be the minister take to work with british cyber security innovator to overcome his government ’s lax record on cyber security to support british innovation and crucially to keep our armed force safe 
 we be do all those thing at pace and of course the scale of the challenge be very significant we be inject a huge amount of money and institutional energy into ensure that our cyber defence be up to scratch we be at the point of the spear when it come to defensive cyber as illustrate by the brilliant man and woman who be part of our national cyber force and we commend they 
 what recent assessment he have make of the security of the uk ’s military basis and service personnel in the middle east 
 of course the force protection of uk service personnel and our basis across the middle east be keep under constant review have be in bahrain and qatar in recent day i can report that the morale and condition of those post to the middle east tend to be very high they be a very purposeful set of people but for operational security reason i would not make any comment on the security readiness action plan 
 i pay tribute to the dedication and professionalism of the british armed force personnel in the middle east who have keep we safe from terrorism and other hostile threat over many decade will my hon friend consider relooke at recognise all people who serve historically in aden for a service medal 
 that be a very important campaign and i be very happy to engage with my hon friend i imagine that he might be ask about a specific constituency case and i be very happy to sit down together to consider that 
 what step he plan to take to ensure efficient use of increase defence funding 
 i be committed to ensure that the defence uplift to mean that we spend the money as efficiently as possible the tremendous work by my hon friend the minister for defence procurement on the integrated procurement model be very important to the outcome of that spending 
 i be very pleased to hear my right hon friend commit to the efficient use of defence spending which we may not have see in the past will he comment on the excellent example of his recent announcement on save royal marine warship and the fact that this government have commit to build up to more for the commando 
 that be absolutely right it be very important that our royal marines be able to continue their activity so not only will we keep the exist ship run but we have announce that we will build up to new multi role ship which be all part of our programme to build ship that be why our shipyard be so very busy 
 because of government plan to mothball hms albion key artefact from the ship include the sword of peace be give to chester town hall for safekeeping and then on   may the secretary of state announce that hms albion will not be mothball when would he like the artefact back exactly when be hms albion go to be put to sea again 
 we never announce that she be be mothball so i be very interested to hear about these artefact i be on hms albion the other week so i will be very interested to engage on what have be remove 
 once again i can clarify that both those ship both use by our royal marines will remain in active service it be the case that more modern ship be be procure which be possible only because we be prepared to put a date to spend on defence 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 increase defence spending be obviously only a means to an end it be not an end in itself the treasury rightly take a jaundiced view of the mod ’s ability to spend money wisely so to that end can the secretary of state advise the house on how much taxpayer money and defence budget be spend refit hms argyll only for she to be pay off immediately after she come out of refit 
 there be no way that the treasury give its very tight hold on the fiscal regime would approve spend of gdp on defence if it do not have confidence in how we will spend it again i refer the hon gentleman to the excellent work of the integrate procurement model which will make all the difference i be very happy to engage with he on individual defence decision but the fact of the matter be that if we do not commit to spend the money we can not put the pipeline in place to build thing like the new ship and submarine we need 
 i be unsurprised that i get no answer to my question because i never get an answer to that question on   january   or to my point of order on   march i be only inform by the minister for defence procurement who be whisper a response i hope into the secretary of state ’s ear of the fate of hms argyll after i read about it in the medium will the secretary of state tell i a different answer then do bae systems approach the mod to buy hms argyll or do the mod approach bae systems 
 i be pleased that the hon gentleman recognise that my hon friend the minister for defence procurement have write to he on the subject and i have no doubt that he will wish to engage with the hon gentleman far 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 we be very mindful of the situation in ukraine particularly in kharkiv where russia be make or try to make inroad this be an existential battle for all civilised country that believe in democracy and freedom and it be the case that we must ensure that the world continue to keep up the effort it be not right for there to be pause in our support and when there be the sort of loss we have see on i hope and believe a temporary basis in kharkiv around the village to the north be an inevitable consequence of inaction 
 lieutenant general pavliuk ukraine ’s commander of ground force recently confirm that medium and short range strike drone now kill more soldier on both side of the conflict than any other weapon be that not both a grim milestone in the history of warfare and the strong possible signal that his majesty ’s armed force must master that develop technology if they be to preserve and enhance their combat effectiveness 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be reason why this country have be at the forefront of provide drone indeed we have make an enormous £ contribution to the drone coalition and provide drone in the late package and there be a lot more to come for ukraine this bloody war be now kill or cause casualty to up to russians a day and it need to come to a stop 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the government ’s increase in military aid to ukraine for this year and the year ahead have labour ’s full support weekend newspaper report that d day celebration be at risk from raf cut and the late mod figure confirm that nearly full time force personnel have be cut since the defence secretary ’s predecessor   the right hon member for wyre and preston north mr wallace admit that this government have hollow out and underfunde the force he be right be n’t he 
 i very much appreciate the hon gentleman ’s support for the ongoing support to ukraine of £ a year i gently say to he that it be not possible to provide that support without a route to get there with the otherwise it will come out of the rest of the budget i too read the story over the weekend and it be simply not the case we will have in fact parachuter exactly the same number as those who jump in that location on d day 
 we will also raise defence spending to of gdp to meet increase threat but this be not the magic wand that will fix year of tory failure the army cut the navy cut the raf cut even defence spending at under labour in have be cut by £ since be it not clear that the armed force can not afford another year of conservative government 
 the armed force can not afford a labour government if labour can not answer simple question when 
 i and other colleague particularly my hon friend the member for south dorset richard drax and the hon member for newport east jessica morden would like to follow up on the minister ’s comment to the house in march regard the tragic sinking of rfa sir galahad in the falklands war do the minister have any update on the release of further file regard that case 
 follow meeting with colleague and veteran have personally review the file at the national archives and in the interest of transparency i be place copy of recently review extract from the board of inquiry report on the loss of rfa sir galahad in the library of the house those extract be draw from different section of the inquiry and have be return to the national archives within the main report which will be publicly available 
 yesterday hundred of rmt member at the royal fleet auxiliary service take industrial action over their pay which have fall behind by in real term allow for inflation since early the minister for armed forces commend rfa crew for the work they be do particularly off the coast of gaza will the minister for defence people and family agree to meet rmt official to ensure that rfa seafarer be pay fairly for the vital work they do support the royal navy 
 as the grandson of an rfa officer i defer to nobody in my admiration for the royal fleet auxiliary i commend the rfa for maintain its operational commitment in particular in relation to gaza clearly we listen to what nautilus have to say with a great deal of interest and i hope the dispute will be end as soon as possible 
 raf valley be the large employer of skilled worker on ynys môn the uk government have cement their commitment to raf valley with £ for a new   flying school £ for hawk engineering support and £ to improve the runway what assurance can the minister give to engineer and those who work on the hawk t2 maintenance contract that there will be well pay local job for they post-2040 
 i very much enjoy my visit to raf valley in february i can confirm that the raf have already start its standard capability investigation process into the future of combat aircrew training the comprehensive review will include the procurement of the replacement of the current advanced jet trainer capability the investigation will consider option for aircraft simulator and associate combine live and virtual training such that we can continue to deliver world class training capability for uk armed force it will provide evidence on likely cost and timing of the replacement training solution to the hawk t2 
 i call barry sheerman interruption barry sheerman 
 i be sorry mr speaker i be think of an even well question 
 stick to the main 
 indeed 
 as you know mr speaker my family come from a military background although i be not a military expert time and again my constituent say they have hear about a shortage of shell ammunition and other thing that we can not supply to the ukrainians what be the hold up why be we not work to produce the tool that our ukrainian ally want 
 the hon gentleman ask about the supply of shell i be delighted to tell to he that we previously confirm the provision of artillery shell to ukraine the late figure be that this country have procure artillery shell directly into ukraine 
 that be a smart tie you be wear mr speaker 
 how can it be that despite spend billion of pound on a400 m aircraft we have only available for d day if there be more let we hear about it why do we retire a highly reliable aircraft in the hercules for a highly unreliable in the a400 m have we sell the hercules aircraft if we have not can we put they back in service 
 as the secretary of state confirm we will have a400 m aircraft available for d day on   june the number of people who will be drop will be for the very good reason that that be the number of paratrooper who at minute past midnight on d day itself land and take the bridge that we name pegasus 
 in my westminster hall debate last year the minister for defence procurement announce plan to close the chicksand base in my constituency and pledge to   write with further detail i be yet to hear more from the minister but my constituent be understandably become deeply concerned will the minister meet i to discuss the issue far and what more we can do in the meantime to address the shocking state of accommodation on the base 
 i be happy to meet the hon gentleman 
 i warmly welcome the government ’s commitment to spend of gdp on defence spending but after we have win the next general election growth will come to the economy and there will be much more money to be spend on defence how would my right hon friend spend that money in the defence of the realm 
 my hon friend be right to point that out because some assumption have be a little misplace in this house until now we will ensure that we can do a whole range of thing that will help to make this country strong and more secure on that he have my word 
 i thank the minister for defence people and families on behalf of falklands veteran and their family include mike hermanis who bring the issue to i for release the document relate to the bombing of the sir galahad in which exonerate the welsh guards i know that the campaign which include my hon friend   the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty will continue to seek the full truth but do the minister agree that instead of be blame the welsh guards be owe our thank for their service 
 i agree with the hon lady as the government have make clear consistently throughout no blame be attach in particular to the welsh guards they commit themselves heroically on that day and i join she in salute they in particular those who die 
 it be of huge strategic interest to britain and the west that israel prevail against hamas and their funder in iran the foreign secretary be right to state last week that end military export to israel would embolden hamas and iran do my hon friend agree that such a move would both harm uk defence interest and disadvantage our own armed force who rely on israeli make battlefield equipment 
 my hon friend be correct in her analysis we be particularly focus on ensure that our asset in the region contribute to the release of the hostage 
 what be the policy of his majesty ’s government on defence deal and arm sale to country whose head of armed force be under arrest warrant for alleged war crime and crime against humanity 
 as the minister for armed forces point out the licensing regime be entirely independent of that we support the country we support the only   democracy in that part of the world we do not support the individual in that government we support the country itself 
 in fareham we be rightly proud of our world class aircraft carrier dock in nearby portsmouth provide thousand of job and be a huge credit to our royal navy however we all know that neither the queen elizabeth nor the prince of wales have as many jet small warship or submarine as originally plan will the minister please tell i how further defence spending will be use to bring online the full complement of f-35 jet for example so that our carrier strike group have the full capability to meet the modern threat of today 
 my right hon and learn friend ask an excellent question she be right about the importance of the carrier strike group on the key point about the f-35s we have confirm aircraft by and a further by but in addition to that it be about work with our ally so that our carrier be at the heart of nato operation and ensure that we have the maintenance and crew in place as we see recently when we need to get the ship active she be ready in day that be a phenomenal achievement it show how effective we be at get our carrier in place when we need they 
 the minister for veterans affair promise last year to end veteran homelessness by the end of that year instead veteran homelessness rise by be ministers proud that their government be fail to deliver on their promise to their veteran 
 i say to the hon lady who have be consistent in that line of questioning that person homeless be person too many it be important to emphasise that most people leave the armed force in a very good position with skill that will advance their career in civilian life i do not want she give the impression that people be damage as a result of the service that they have give the very reverse of that be the case we will of course continue to support veteran charity and initiative to ensure that particularly in place such as naval base port area and garrison town we house everybody who need accommodation 
 britain ’s world lead motor sport industry be worth at least £ annually to the uk economy the sport ’s govern body motorsport uk have proudly sponsor access to military venue for many year but despite recently sign the armed force covenant that access appear to be diminish will the minister please agree to meet i and perhaps the defence infrastructure organisation to discuss well party revenue generate opportunity for the mod estate 
 i would of course be delighted to meet my hon friend on the subject of motorsport i stress to he and the house that the mod have a brilliant partnership with mclaren jointly innovate to look at for example technology relate to electronic vehicle i be more than happy to meet he and look into the matter far 
 a constituent of mine who rent his home from the ministry of defence have recently be give notice to quit within month without any reason he have never miss any rent payment and he have be unable to contact his landlord with a query on the instruction will the minister meet i to discuss the situation 
 i be very happy to meet the hon lady to discuss that i have see several case of people have to leave their service accommodation in general the dio and the ministry of defence will ensure that people have more than the minimum allow by legislation and we bend over backwards to ensure that people leave service accommodation have somewhere to go to 
 my hon friend will appreciate the huge importance of what the uk defence industry be do to help ukraine get the equipment it need can he update the house on what his department be do to increase the amount of ammunition get to the front line in ukraine 
 my hon friend who have defence equipment support in his constituency have be a consistent champion of support ukraine and he come to every question session to make that point we be work hard to get more munition in there i mention artillery shell but i could list an enormous amount of ordnance i can tell he and the house that we be not just do everything possible ourselves but cohere our ally and learn the lesson for our own armed force we have to be in this for the long haul and the fight for ukraine ’s freedom be the right 
 on a point of order mr speaker i think my hon friend the minister for defence procurement may have inadvertently i be sure just mislead the house of commons pegasus bridge be capture in a glider bear assault by the oxfordshire and buckinghamshire light infantry not a parachute assault i know that because i be at the d day with the then prime minister david cameron at be to commemorate the assault i be sure it be an error by my hon friend no will want to believe that an mod minister try to change the history of d day because the aircraft do not work 
 the good news be that that be a point of clarification which have be resolve 
 we now come to the urgent question i will run this short the question for the water company be about those who be affect not other part of the uk so just for clarification it be a tight uq 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs to make a statement on south west water and brixham ’s contamination 
 on   monday may south west water be notify by the uk health security agency of cryptosporidium case in the brixham area south west water undertake monitoring from monday evening into tuesday with the result on wednesday morning identify crypto in the hillhead distribution area a boil notice be issue for customer on   wednesday may   to cover both the hillhead area and the alston area i know that have cause considerable concern and disruption to the local community 
 to date ukhsa have identify at least confirm case of cryptosporidium but give that symptom may take up to day to emerge obviously that number may continue to rise people have be hospitalise bottled water station be initially open on   thursday may and in my call with the chief executive on friday i request that a be open and the hour extend both of which then happen effective from saturday 
 i also raise concern with the chief executive include those share with i by my hon friend the members for totnes anthony mangnall and for torbay kevin foster about inadequate compensation that be raise to £ for resident in the alston supply area and have now go up to £ for those continue to be affect in the alston area a helpline have be establish for business and i request that it work with local mp to streamline the process in addition my right hon friend the minister for food farming and fisheries visit the community on friday 
 some property be initially subject to the boil notice but of them—32,000 resident in property that receive their water from the alston reservoir have now have the boil notice lift not only have all the test on the alston reservoir be clear but south west water say that the positive test of the valve support its contention that the most likely cause be downstream of that reservoir if that be the case those of resident be never subject to any water issue and the boil notice be apply on a precautionary basis notwithstanding that i be sure that there will be ongoing concern so daily testing of that water will continue for the foreseeable future 
 the hillhead reservoir have now be drain clean and refill a flush of the network which aim to remove trace of cryptosporidium detect in the system be start this morning we be work with south west water and the drinking water inspectorate recognise the ongoing disruption to the remain of resident i know that south west water will want to comply fully and in a timely fashion with the investigation of the drinking water inspectorate 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question 
 i thank the secretary of state and the minister with responsibility for river the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for keighley robbie moore for their extraordinary co operation over the past week i have want for nothing from they and they have do an extraordinary job i thank they and their team for be on hand at a moment ’s notice to liaise with i and with the local organisation in my constituency and that of my hon friend   the member for torbay kevin foster 
 in brixham the anger be palpable the frustration be apparent and the sheer inconvenience that have be put on resident by south west water be absolutely abhorrent i have spend the past week and weekend deliver leaflet that south west water should have be deliver it have fail to update resident on the situation before they i have speak with resident and business about compensation and the reputational damage suffer by brixham of this country ’s fine coastal community 
 last week south west water be accuse of make people ill not by an organisation but by tanya matthews in a facebook post that post receive response in which people identify common symptom yet south west water do nothing for hour people be still able to drink the water and south west water continue to say that there be no problem the reason people be ill and that be most certainly an underestimation be the time period in which they be able to go on drink the water 
 of course it be welcome news that the alstom reservoir have be clear and independent monitoring and verification have be undertake by the uk health security agency and the drinking water inspectorate but it be still wholly unacceptable that the resident in the hillhead reservoir area be still dependent on bottled water and can not trust their water system in the century that be a totally unacceptable position for we to be in south west water and its management carry the responsibility for it 
 i welcome the fact that we have drinking water station in churston broadsands and freshwater quarry and that bottle have distribute the team on the ground have do an extraordinary job and we should applaud they but i have question for the secretary of state can ukhsa and the dwi continue to provide independent monitoring over the come week and month to ensure that there be confidence in the drinking water supply will there be an investigation into south west water ’s handling of this matter why when the compensation be be upgrade be people still pay their water bill finally the damage reputation suffer by business and the community of brixham need to be address so will the secretary of state hold south west water to account 
 my hon friend be quite right to express the huge local concern he and i have speak multiple time a day since this issue arise and he have be extremely effective in raise the concern of those he represent 
 there be recognition that the initial comms the mishap with some of the leaflet and the comms about compensation be all area that south west water will   address move forward have seek to take his feedback he be right about the urgency in address the hillhead reservoir for the remain of the population that be certainly uppermost in my conversation with the relevant stakeholder 
 with regard to an investigation issue with drinking water be treat with the utmost seriousness within government so i can assure my hon friend that these issue will be look at extremely closely i speak with the chief executive of the drinking water inspectorate at the weekend and i have a meeting with of its senior leader just before this uq i can assure my hon friend that there will be a thorough investigation as there always be with these kind of issue and i urge all party include south west water to co operate fully and in a timely fashion 
 i call the shadow minister 
 another day another example of the depth of failure to which this government have take we i can not believe that i be about to say this but after long year of conservative rule in century britain our water be no long safe to drink of course the government will be flail around desperate to clasp on to somebody else to blame but this crisis be theirs and it be this government who must show some leadership and take responsibility for it they be the one who weaken regulation leave our victorian era sewerage system starve of investment they turn a blind eye and leave water company to illegally pump a tidal wave of raw sewage into our river lake and sea only last month the labour party warn that our nation ’s health be at risk because hospital admission for waterborne disease have skyrocket by third since be this an example of the government ’s plan work be this what they think success look like 
 and now this as the icing on the cake of failure a parasite outbreak in brixham with south west water some home and business have be advise to boil water before drink it over case of cryptosporidiosis have be report more than people have report symptom and a year old boy have be admit to hospital that be appalling 
 enough be enough so today we be call on the government to urgently adopt labour ’s plan to put the water company into special measure in order to clean up their water as a matter of utmost urgency the government must strengthen regulation so that law break boss face criminal charge and go far by give the regulator new power to block the payment of bonus until water boss have clean up their filth with labour the polluter will pay not the public 
 i have question for the secretary of state with contaminate water hospitalise child and record level of toxic filth in our water system how much bad do the situation have to get before the government adopt labour ’s plan to put the water industry into special measure 
 member on the labour front bench like to claim that their party want to be take seriously as a potential party of government yet once again we see shadow ministers pre empte the investigation and try to shift the issue to that of raw sewage obviously it be for the drinking water inspectorate to fully investigate   this incident and the water company but the initial information share with i suggest that the concern be about farm contamination not raw sewage of course we need to wait for the result of that investigation but the labour party be just jump to a conclusion that fit a narrative it be not interested in what the fact suggest 
 if the hon lady have actually listen to my statement as oppose to pre empte it with a question that she do not then change she would have hear that of those who be subject to the boil notice be upstream of this incident from the information i currently have they be not subject to any issue with their water because of the seriousness with which we take these issue a precautionary notice be quite rightly issue to those resident but the evidence present so far suggest that there be no issue for those resident because the contamination happen downstream 
 as for the wide point scoring and political narrative in this house there be usually a distinction between serious issue such as this and the usual party knockabout what the community want to hear be reassurance that all the investigation have be do that we be get the compensation right and that we be get the remain onstream all of which incidentally the hon lady do not even ask about she do not seem interested in those thing as oppose to the natural knockabout that she be try to do 
 however let i divert to the topic she want to talk about we have a fourfold increase in the number of investigator so the water company can not mark their own homework in this instance the drinking water inspectorate be conduct a full investigation phase have be complete and it be now on phase i have quite a list mr speaker but since you be signal to i i will close with the fact that the large criminal investigation launch by the environment agency and ofwat be currently ongoing 
 i commend my hon friend and constituency neighbour   the member for totnes anthony mangnall   for the very effective action he have take on this issue over the past few day do my right hon friend agree that in an incident of this kind speed be of the essence in diagnose the problem take step to remedy it communicate with and reassure customer and if appropriate compensate they do he believe that south west water have show the necessary urgency in deal with this problem and if not what remedy do local people have 
 i agree with my hon friend that speed be absolutely critical for the detection of the issue itself and the remediation of any health risk and then in speed of communication so that there be no vacuum in which mislead information can arise on the wide point about the speed of comms i think this be an ongoing issue because of the concern that my hon friend the members for totnes anthony mangnall and for torbay kevin foster have raise with i be the impact that negative publicity might have on tourism in the area that be exactly the sort of area i have be push south west water to think about proactively so that it can get ahead with support for comms and advertising it should be work with the business group on which there have be a significant impact so   that it can demonstrate that it get it support the business community and create process that be simplify streamlined and easy to access 
 the belated and pitiful offer of compensation by south west water be somehow symbolic of the complete disconnect that the very wealthy people who run our privatised water industry seem to be suffer from and i be afraid the secretary of state be suffer from the same disconnect he have give the impression that he be not responsible for the water industry and its failing over recent year he be responsible so please can he answer the perfectly reasonable question from my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and hessle emma hardy why will he not make the boss of the water industry criminally liable why will he not put the industry into special measure and why will he not stop these outrageous bonus be pay to their ceo 
 the right hon member seem to have miss what we have do as i touch on in my response to the urgent question i personally have be chair call with the chief executive and key stakeholder for example on friday and saturday the minister for food farming and fisheries who have responsibility for agriculture visit the community on friday morning and have have daily contact with the chief executive indeed my hon friend   the member for totnes anthony mangnall   and i have be speak multiple time a day on these issue so the right hon member ’s suggestion that we have not be involve just do not cut the mustard 
 on bonus we have already take action we have a consultation with ofwat on restrict bonus because i actually agree with the right hon member that where there be serious criminal wrongdoing by a water company bonus should not be pay to executive we actually agree on that point and we be take action 
 on the right hon member ’s point about prosecution as i touch on in my answer to   the hon member for kingston upon hull west and hessle emma hardy we currently have the large criminal prosecution by the environment agency of water firm much to my frustration i be restrict in some of the thing i be allow to know about that investigation because it be a matter for an independent body the environment agency however that investigation be ongoing and it be the large in the ea ’s history it show that we be prepared to get tough with the water company 
 i be grateful to my hon friend   the member for totnes anthony mangnall   for secure this urgent question and i applaud all his effort over the past week south west water ’s response to this crisis have leave a lot to be desire many people in brixham have fall seriously ill while hospitality and tourism business across devon have see their taking slash and booking cancel they all deserve compensation can my right hon friend outline the timescale for the ongoing investigation and when the result of this investigation will become public 
 my hon friend make extremely pertinent point both on compensation and on speed which be the point make previously by my hon friend the member   for south west devon sir gary streeter and i think both apply the point about compensation apply particularly to business because different business be impact in different way the point about speed also apply to the investigation itself which be why i say early that it be really important that south west water this be the signal that he and the house be send it co operate fully with the investigation and in a timely manner i know that local member of parliament want to be able to explain to their constituent exactly what the cause be what the monitoring be and what action be take and i be sure that south west water will have hear my hon friend ’s point 
 in the liberal democrats call for a ban on bonus for water company boss if a company have commit criminal breach last year water boss receive bonus total £ and the ceo of south west water forwent her £ bonus the secretary of state say that ofwat should carry out a consultation to define criterion for a ban on bonus but what size bonus do he think the ceo of south west water ought to receive later this month 
 as a minister have to follow the correct legal process and the legal process for an independent arm’s length body require it to have a consultation as i have say we be already move on that we have already say that we want to ensure that bonus be not pay where there be serious criminal wrongdoing what would be more refreshing from the liberal democrats be an explanation for why their mps oppose thames tideway the £ scheme that will make such a difference to clean up the thames and have be in place for the past year not once have the hon gentleman come to this chamber to explain why have ask so many question on water his mps oppose thames tideway and that £ of investment which will do so much to clean up the thames 
 although i be in the north of the county i have be contact this past weekend by concerned constituent what more can be do to reassure they that this issue can not be repeat in the north of the county which be very proud of its farming and cattle if this be find to be the result of a safety valve in a field what more will be do to reassure other customer who fortunately be not affect this time but might be in future 
 my hon friend raise an important point it be not just those resident directly affect who be concern so too will be those in the surround area indeed some of the initial medium report refer to south devon which lead many resident in the wide catchment to think that they might be directly affect that be why the speed of the investigation and the work that the drinking water inspectorate be do be so critical so that the fact can be quickly establish as i say i speak to the chief executive at the weekend it have complete phase of its investigation and that work be ongoing 
 there be a crisis of confidence in south west water its response have be hopeless frankly it have   have poor communication poor initial compensation as every extra pound seem to be drag out of it and it have a record of failure on sewage what will the government do to help restore confidence that south west water be not only competent and able to manage our water supply but that the water that come through our tap be safe for everyone to drink how can we encourage people to have faith in the outstanding and brilliant tourist offer that we have in the south west which have be batter yet again by bad news because of south west water 
 i agree with the hon gentleman about the brilliant tourist offer and there be work to do to support business particularly in the hospitality trade which will have be impact by the reputational damage that the area have have as a consequence i assure he that i make those point to south west water as i say in my statement i have also speak to it about compensation which have move although there be further work to do particularly with the business community that be also why the investigation be so important so that we get to the bottom of exactly what happen that be important for resident who have have the disruption of the boil water notice and for resident far afield 
 this have be a devastating event although constituent in newton abbot be not directly affect this be an issue of trust as my hon friend   the member for north devon selaine saxby   say it be about trust in south west water as an organisation there be a long way to go before that trust be restore but also about trust in the quality of our water and in our regulator to hold organisation such as south west water to account what do ofwat and the drinking water inspectorate do to challenge the water plan that these water company put out to test what could go wrong what risk analysis and assessment be there what contingency plan be put in place trust can be rebuild not just through the inquiry but by make absolutely sure that the regulator in all their guise have in place the appropriate testing to ensure that this sort of thing can not happen again 
 my hon friend talk about the huge importance of the quality of drinking water that be why we have the drinking water inspectorate there and it will be fully investigate and it be why a precautionary approach be take with alston as i have say on the information that i have the test suggest it be upstream of any problem but a precautionary approach be take that indicate how seriously we take these issue   it be important we get to the bottom of exactly what have happen and what have cause this incident and the dwi be work actively to do that 
 in the drinking water inspectorate find south west water guilty say that the company 
 do not follow good practice 
 to avoid and shorten event where customer report problem about the taste and quality of their drinking water it be fin a quarter of a pound it be find guilty the year after for a year period of illegal discharge of sewage the ceo award themselves almost £ in bonus and award £ in dividend be it not time that all bonus all dividend and all bill rise be suspend until our water company sort themselves out if they do not they need special administration 
 may i remind member that when they be ask a question or speaking they be mean to look at the chair not at somebody down at the bottom of the chamber because we might be unable to hear what be be say 
 it be because of the good work of   the hon member for totnes anthony mangnall   that i be able to ask that question 
 in the end the good work of the hon member for totnes be only allow by the chair think that way 
 i will take that steer mr speaker and direct my remark your way there be agreement on bonus that where there be criminal wrongdoing they should not be pay on dividend there be a debate with treasury colleague on the balance between attract investment into the sector and take further measure i have also touch on the large ever criminal prosecution currently under way with the environment agency it be important that we do not pre empt the investigation we need to get to the bottom of exactly what have happen and who be at fault where there be fault i be sure that as part of that   the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle   and member of the house will look at what monitoring be in place what different party do and whether any lesson from previous incident be sufficiently learn those be issue that should rightly be explore through the investigation and that be what the dwi be do 
 with permission i would like to make a statement on israel and gaza 
 over month since the horror of   october there be no end to the current conflict in sight this government want to bring the conflict to a sustainable end as soon as possible but as so often with conflict of this nature the question be not about our desire for peace but rather about the good mean of achieve it we continue to believe that the fast way to end the conflict be to secure a deal that get the hostage out and allow for a pause in the fighting in gaza we would then have to work with our international partner to turn that pause into a sustainable permanent ceasefire 
 build momentum towards a last peace will require a number of element include remove hamas ’s capacity to launch attack against israel it be a deal of that kind that secure a pause in the fighting before christmas the only such pause since hamas ’s horrific attack it be that approach that the united nations security council endorse just last month follow some effective british diplomacy 
 a deal with hamas for a pause in the fighting would involve exchange hundred of palestinian prisoner charge with serious act of terrorism in return for the hostage release i do not underestimate how difficult that must be for the israeli government but it be the good way forward that we see right now 
 we continue to work closely with the united states and partner in the region to support such a deal we do not believe that the international criminal court prosecutor seek warrant will help in that regard as we have say from the outset we do not think that the icc have jurisdiction in this case 
 a deal as i have describe offer the good prospect of reunite more hostage with their family the anguish for they be unbearable i be sure that the whole house join i in hold the family of nadav popplewell in our thought at this deeply distressing time we be still work intensively to establish the fact after the awful video that his hamas kidnapper release last week the foreign secretary meet the family last week to hear more about their ordeal at hand likewise we send our condolence to those family whose love one the israeli authority state last week have die 
 at the same time the toll on civilian in gaza continue to rise image from the strip give we some sense of what they endure civilian pile belonging on to a cart lead by a donkey or seek to scrape together a meal in a makeshift shelter we have see appalling attack on aid convoy and un office by israeli extremist and the tragic death of un and other humanitarian personnel in gaza 
 we keep in close contact with sigrid kaag the un humanitarian co ordinator and we condemn all attack on aid worker and support the united nations call for an independent investigation the government of israel have previously set out publicly their commitment to increase the flow of aid into gaza significantly but we need to see far more the prime minister impress the urgency of that on   april in the past day the foreign secretary have speak to israeli ministers ron dermer and israel katz he have call on they to implement in   full israel ’s aid commitment we want to see humanitarian aid allow to enter through all relevant crossing point include in rafah critically need good flow in particularly fuel and medical supply effective deconfliction process to ensure that aid can be distribute safely and effectively critical infrastructure restore and protect evacuation for all those eligible concrete action to protect civilian and minimise casualty and as israeli minister benny gantz say over the weekend more planning for reconstruction and a return to palestinian civilian governance of gaza once the fighting have cease 
 we remain absolutely committed to get aid into gaza to alleviate the suffering and we be work with a wide variety of other government and aid agency to deliver aid by land sea and air i be delighted to confirm to the house that we have now successfully deliver british aid on to gaza ’s shore use the cyprus maritime corridor which we and our partner notably the united states the united arab emirates and cyprus make operational just last week we have commit almost £ in funding the royal fleet auxiliary cardigan bay be act as a logistics hub for the operation 
 we have now deliver more than shelter coverage kit alongside aid from the us and uae with more aid to follow in the come week include hygiene kit and forklift truck work to develop other effective partnership for the delivery of aid continue lord ahmad of wimbledon be in qatar today discuss a health partnership for palestinians so that a british medical training agency can support doctor and health practitioner treat palestinian patient 
 we know that much much more aid be require but that delivery by land remain the quick and most effective option so we continue to work closely with oman to maximise the aid deliver via the jordan land corridor i pay tribute to all those aid worker military personnel diplomat and medical professional who be involve in britain ’s effort to save life and alleviate the suffering of civilian in gaza i confirm to the house that last week intense effort by the foreign office lead to the departure from gaza of british aid worker who be at risk from an outbreak of fighting 
 as the fighting continue we estimate that around palestinian civilian have flee from where they be seek shelter in rafah to other part of the southern strip the extent of this displacement be why we have be clear that we would not support a major israeli military operation in rafah unless there be a very clear plan for how to protect people and save life we have not see that plan we and of our partner include france germany italy and australia set out our concern in a detailed letter to the israeli government 
 after more than month of fighting it be become difficult to imagine the realisation of a last peace but britain continue to try to build momentum towards that goal that will require not only the release of all the hostage and an end to the current fighting but the removal of hamas ’s capacity to launch attack against israel hamas no long be in charge in gaza the formation of a new palestinian government for the west bank and gaza and a political horizon for the palestinians provide a credible and irreversible pathway towards a state solution that be what we continue to strive towards peace and security for israelis and palestinians alike i commend the statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement the conflict have now go on for day that be day of destruction day of israeli hostage still in chain day that have lead to palestinian death and day where the risk of further regional escalation worsen every day we will keep repeat our call until it happen there must be an immediate ceasefire as this house support through labour ’s motion and as demand by the united nations security council resolution diplomatic pressure must now go into overdrive to bring the fighting to an end 
 labour have be oppose to an israeli offensive in rafah for month the uk government should now work with the united states to try to prevent a full scale rafah offensive by be clear that they will assess uk export and if it go ahead join our american ally in suspend weapon or component that could be use in that offensive 
 when we last meet on this subject i ask the deputy foreign secretary to confirm whether he or the foreign secretary have receive from foreign commonwealth and development office official any assessment or policy advice not legal advice that the threshold have already be meet he dodge the question and do not answer i repeat that question to he today the whole house will be interested in his response 
 last november in this house the deputy foreign secretary appear to row back on boris johnson ’s shameful abandonment of the international criminal court when he say 
 it be not for minister to seek to state where the icc have jurisdiction”.—[official report   november vol c. 
 the prime minister follow up in december when he say 
 we be a strong and long stand supporter of the international criminal court ”—[official report   december vol c. 
 but in today ’s statement the government have backtrack u turning on of the britain ’s most fundamental principle respect for the rule of law labour have be clear throughout this conflict that international law must be uphold the independence of international court must be respect and all side must be accountable for their action i ask the minister very simply do he agree 
 arrest warrant be not a conviction or a determination of guilt but they do reflect the evidence and the judgment of the prosecutor about the ground for individual criminal responsibility labour ’s position be that the icc chief prosecutor ’s decision to apply for arrest warrant be an independent matter for the court and the prosecutor do the minister agree labour believe that the icc ’s independence must be uphold and respect and that it be right that the conduct of all party be address by the court do the minister agree labour believe that the focus of politician should be on achieve an immediate ceasefire in order to end the war in gaza free the hostage alleviate the humanitarian crisis and create a pathway towards a lasting political solution do the minister agree labour believe the uk and all party to the rome statute have a legal obligation to comply with order and warrant issue by the icc democracy that believe in the rule of law must submit themselves to it do the minister agree 
 labour support the icc as a cornerstone of the international legal system that support apply regardless of the court ’s focus whether it be in ukraine sudan syria or gaza do the minister agree this get to the heart of a simple question do the conservative party the party of churchill who be of the founder of our international legal framework believe in the international rule of law or not 
 i start by assure the shadow foreign secretary that the government ’s answer to his final question be as he would expect yes it be worth state that if look carefully at his high fly oratory this afternoon we do not see very much distinction between the position of his majesty ’s opposition and the government as i will set out 
 the right hon gentleman start off by say that this be day of the incarceration of the hostage of the destruction that have take place and of the risk of escalation i completely agree with what he say he say that the diplomatic pressure must rise i can tell he that the diplomatic pressure be intense on all count and in all place he say that we must work closely with the united states of america let i assure he that we be work intensively and closely with the united states 
 the right hon gentleman ask i about the advice we receive and suggest that i dodge the question on the early occasion i certainly have no intention of do so i can tell he that we receive all sort of advice from all sort of place but we do not as be the custom and practice as he know well disclose our legal advice we be always careful to follow it meticulously that be my answer to his question 
 the right hon gentleman ask be this a matter on which the international criminal court should act independently my answer be that of course it be but we do not necessarily have to stay silent on what the court be do and we certainly be not do so on his question about the letter from a former prime minister as we have say from the outset we do not think that the icc have jurisdiction in this case the uk have not recognise palestine as a state and israel be not a state party to the rome statute 
 as i say if we split away some of what the right hon gentleman say today from the oratory that he customarily display in this place we see that the position of the opposition front bench and the government remain very closely align 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 my condolence go to all the family who over the last few day have receive the most devastating news news that their love one have be murder and also to the popplewell family who have receive heinous treatment from hamas include the publication of that outrageous video last week the select committee push the minister for the middle east to do more to secure proof of life of those who be be hold hostage and that remain our call
