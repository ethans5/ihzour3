resolve 
 that an humble address be present to his majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there be lay before this house a return of a report date   july entitle independent inquiry into the issue raise by the david fuller case phase report.—(anna turley 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to support worker right in the renewable energy sector 
 the government be commit to strengthen collective bargaining and trade union recognition the employment rights bill and the plan to make work pay will modernise right and improve condition the office for clean energy jobs engage union to ensure that renewable energy job support economic growth the net transition and worker move from carbon intensive sector 
 many of my constituent in halesowen work in energy intensive industry such as forge and heavy manufacturing the government be rightly support those industry to become more energy efficient but worker need new skill as well as skill in the many new job in the renewable energy sector as they make this transition how be the department support worker in the west midland to get the right skill for these new industry 
 my hon friend be right to raise that point support worker in energy intensive industry be essential as we transition our economy the government will provide over £ per year in skill fund by support training in renewable low carbon construction and advanced engineering we be also invest over £ over year to develop   engineering skill in england and launch new technical excellence college to make sure that training stay align with employer need we will also push forward on the clean energy workforce strategy this year 
 what step he have take with cabinet colleague to help increase the number of job in supply chain in green industry 
 the industrial strategy publish last month set out our plan to build clean energy supply chain in the uk include a new £ fund through great british energy to partner with the private sector to create job in britain and the new clean industry bonus which have the potential to unleash billion of pound of private investment in offshore wind supply chain we be determined that the clean energy future will be make in britain 
 the power cable over the tyne be a barrier to business secure work for large renewable energy structure risk possible net gva benefit of up to £ it have be propose that the removal of the cable will be complete in will the secretary of state help i push for it to be bring forward so that tyneside be not hold back in the global race for green job 
 i congratulate my hon friend on be such a brilliant champion of the port of tyne and what it offer and she be right to draw attention to this important issue approval of any work to reroute the line be a matter for ofgem but we stand ready to engage with she and indeed ofgem to try to bring this forward i suggest that my hon friend the energy minister meet she to discuss this important issue 
 despite the grow need for green job obviously we be all in favour of make sure we have green job few than in employee receive any dedicated green skill training accord to an ovo energy survey what can we do to support business and what can the government do to accelerate that important training programme in all business where we need green job 
 the hon lady raise an important issue later this year we will publish a clean energy skill plan to address precisely this question how do we make sure we equip worker with the skill they need to take advantage of those job that be be lead by my right hon friend the education secretary in the work she be do with skills england but there be a whole range of thing we can do for the time the government will publish what the skill need be for clean energy job and how we will meet they which will be an important step forward 
 as people fly off for their summer holiday the chance be that the steel in the aeroplane ’s engine come from the stocksbridge speciality steels plant in my constituency i be hopeful about the news that liberty steel which   own the site have attract potential investor for this asset the asset be essential for our national security and provide opportunity for net infrastructure include wind turbine however uncertainty about the firm mean that pension contribution have not be pay to the skilled workforce for month cause significant worry and anxiety for local steelworker what reassurance can the secretary of state provide to stocksbridge steelworker about how the outstanding pension contribution will be pay include in any future ownership arrangement 
 my hon friend raise an important issue about her constituency and the steel industry and i would say thing be that what this government have do which i be afraid be not do previously be set up a dedicated fund for steel so that we be able to make the green transition we talk about this in opposition and we be now deliver billion of pound to help the steel industry transition the other be that i will take up the specific pension issue she raise with my right hon friend the business and trade secretary 
 the worker of grangemouth deserve far well than they get from the labour government to add insult to injury they have have to watch they pull out all the stop for scunthorpe and prax lindsey in a write answer to i the energy minister refuse to confirm how much money the uk government have spend to continue operation at lindsey will the secretary of state now come clean and tell we what price they be willing to pay to save job in england which they be not willing to pay to save grangemouth in scotland 
 the hon gentleman be so wide of the mark it be unbelievable the grangemouth closure be foreshadow before this government come to power we have work hand in glove with his colleague in the scottish government all the way along gillian martin and i have be work on it and for he to try to make party politic out of the issue be frankly a disgrace 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the british oil and gas industry be a resilient sector it have have to be give this government ’s action over the past year and it take a lot to shock it but shock it be when on   july sadly the energy minister claim to the scottish affairs committee that there be no material difference between oil and gas import and production from the north sea might the secretary of state take this opportunity to apologise and clarify those remark because thousand of worker in the energy industry supply chain in aberdeen and across the uk be very worried that the department have such scant regard for they their work and this world lead industry 
 of all mr speaker let i congratulate the hon gentleman on his promotion to shadow secretary of state laughter on the specific issue he raise we will take no lecture from the conservatives some job be lose in the north sea on their watch and here be the difference we be build the future   the acorn project be talk about for year after year by the conservatives but nothing be do this government be deliver 
 i call shadow minister bowie 
 the secretary of state will not apologise that be absolutely fine the industry already know that this be a government who want nothing to do with it and who take every opportunity to talk it down and make every effort to shut it down in that same session last week the minister who be sit to the secretary of state ’s leave also claim that 
 much of the gas that be extract from the north sea be export 
 that be simply not true of all the gas extract from the north sea be use in britain the secretary of state know that so why be he so determined to talk down this industry spout falsehood and myth drive investment out of the uk rely more on import and crucially cost people ’s job and drive the skill we need out of this country that be exactly what he and his colleague be do 
 here be the difference between they and we they would keep we hooked on fossil fuel for time immemorial they have learn not a single lesson from the disaster they inflict on this country family finance ruin business finance ruin public finance ruin a year on there be not a word of apology 
 what estimate he have make of the number of additional job that have be create in clean power industry in the north east since july 
 what estimate he have make of the number of additional job that have be create in clean power industry since july 
 what estimate he have make of the number of additional job that have be create in clean power industry since july 
 what estimate he have make of the number of additional job that have be create in clean power industry since july 
 since come to office the government have show how clean power can create job across our country with thousand of job in nuclear through our investment in sizewell c and small modular reactor in carbon capture and storage in offshore wind and in home heating through our warm home plan this be what it mean to deliver reindustrialisation through our clean energy sprint 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer the north east be uniquely place to be the home of the green energy revolution with the expansion of the energy academy in north tyneside provide a skill pipeline how will the clean energy industry   sector plan help to provide long term certainty for investment and deliver good quality job for community across my cramlington and killingworth constituency and the north east 
 i see the north east as an absolute powerhouse for the clean energy job we want to create early on in this government we do something which again have be talk about for year by the conservative party in deliver the east coast carbon capture usage and storage cluster which be project to create thousand of job include benefit for my hon friend ’s constituency it be not just the direct job that will be create but job in the supply chain we have an opportunity the north east will be at the heart of this to lead in the clean energy job of the future 
 i declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on critical mineral build local supply chain in cornwall be of the primary mean by which local people can benefit if we be to dig nearly £ worth of stuff out of the ground every year or pump gw of offshore wind power onshore therefore what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that supply chain business particularly those of the size we have in cornwall and their workforce get the support they need so that worker and local community may share in the spoil of that investment 
 let i say how much i love cornwall i love cornwall for many reason but reason i love it be the opportunity it offer to drive the job of the future i know from my visit that whether it be through critical mineral geothermal or offshore wind there be huge opportunity in cornwall that be what the industrial strategy be design to superpower that be what the huge investment my right hon friend the chancellor make in the spending review will provide as part of our clean energy workforce strategy later on this year cornwall will be at the heart of it 
 i know that the secretary of state love harlow as well do he agree that the historic investment in clean energy secure at the spending review will mean thousand of job opportunity for young people include in harlow in renewable energy nuclear energy efficiency and so much more 
 i love harlow mr speaker and i love harlow college the visit i have make to the college have be incredibly inspiring i have see with my own eye the enthusiastic young people there and speak to they about green skill and the job of the future when i think about what this government intend to deliver it be absolutely about my hon friend ’s constituent in harlow 
 will the secretary of state join i in congratulate tk murray ltd no relation honest an energy save contractor base in kilsyth on have already cros train more than half its workforce to become fully fledge installer of air source heat pump technology from gas boiler this have be facilitate by warmworks which have develop a supply chain of more than small and medium sized enterprise to make more than green job a reality 
 i love cumbernauld mr speaker my hon friend raise the important opportunity in heat pump technology the growth in heat pump that we be see be not just about a well deal for consumer but about the manufacturing that we can see my hon friend have give a great example of that 
 if the secretary of state love shropshire and i be sure he do i hope he will not bulldoze over all our green belt but that be another story for another day 
 the secretary of state talk about green job i be sure he do not want our fire service to be deploy more and more but with solar energy feeding into battery energy storage system there be real concern at shropshire fire service and across the country that there will be fire that be very difficult for our fire service to control do the secretary of state agree that our fire service should be a statutory consultee on future planning application for battery storage 
 this be an important issue that we need to take seriously at the moment it come under the health and safety regime but we be consult on the good arrangement to ensure that we have the high standard of safety there be high safety standard in place but as we see the growth of battery we will endeavour to ensure that those standard be maintain 
 it go without say that i love burgess hill brilliant business there be steve willis training which be this week celebrate year in business train the region ’s future electricity plumbing and heating engineer do the secretary of state agree that such business be vital in deliver the skill of the future and will he join i in congratulate steve willis training on be a brilliant family business that provide key skill to the south east 
 i warmly congratulate steve willis training on its year in operation and on the work it be do the hon lady make an important point we can help to create job in the private sector but the question then be whether people will have the skill to fill they organisation and company like steve willis training be fundamental to that sometimes it require lot of training sometimes it require short amount of training to retrain people in new technology like heat pump it be vital that that training happen 
 people across basildon and billericay and indeed across the country want to see more job in energy production and to see cheap energy what they do not understand be why the government be back some but not all form of energy why be the government insist on ship job in oil and gas abroad rather than keep they here while invest in green energy at the same time 
 the answer be that we be not as the right hon gentleman know the reality be that the north sea have be a basin in decline and that job be lose under the previous government the question be do we create the job of the future as well as maintain   exist field for their lifetime this government be commit to do so if he want to see those job he should support our plan 
 tempt as i be to wax lyrical about the beauty of aberdeenshire i will instead ask the secretary of state a very simple question by this time next year how many job will gb energy have create in aberdeen and aberdeenshire 
 gb energy will create thousand of job across the country include in aberdeen here be why gb energy really matter we have choose to put its headquarters in aberdeen as we recognise that aberdeen be the clean energy capital of our country not just for oil and gas which be important but for the future snp members be chuntere on the front bench but they never do anything to create that future for people in aberdeen 
 what step he be take to increase electricity grid capacity 
 we be work with ofgem and the national energy system operator to accelerate network infrastructure through reform to planning supply chain and other area deliver the capacity need to achieve clean power by and to drive economic growth 
 in my constituency of bicester and woodstock the local plan anticipate significant new employment site to create job and growth tritax big box tell i that it want to put solar panel on of usable roof area on the building that it intend to create local planning policy would support that yet i be shocked to learn that tritax expect to install solar panel on only of usable roof space it can not get a permit to generate electricity or consent to export to the grid will the minister or his official meet i to discuss how we can turn this into a win win opportunity for rooftop green solar 
 that sound like a fantastic opportunity our ambition be to see solar panel on as many rooftop across the country as possible it be a win win opportunity as the hon gentleman rightly put it he and i have speak about a number of these issue previously and i be happy to discuss this with he if he could write to i with the specific we will certainly look at the matter in the meantime we be look at reform all those process to make sure that we can get as much power as possible 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 the challenge of increase electricity grid capacity include the ability to get plan consent and to achieve grid connection as the minister know in the report that the select committee publish last week we refer to the problem of inconsistency in some of the guidance and energy plan over which come the grid connection or the planning consent will the minister please address   that and ensure that the government clear up that inconsistency so that we can move forward with increase electricity generation and grid capacity 
 i thank my hon friend for the question and for the work that he and the whole committee have be do on this matter his report have be my bedtime read every night this week as it be an important piece of work he be right about thing where process be not as well align as they should be we absolutely need to look at what we can do to make sure that they work much more coherently the point his report make which we be also look at be how we bring together thing such as the strategic spatial energy plan the holistic network design and the land use framework to make sure that we have coherent plan across the country so that we can plan properly our energy system 
 what step he be take to help support business to reduce their energy cost 
 we know that the cost of energy be a huge challenge to business across the country that be why our mission to deliver clean power by be so important that be how we will get bill down for good while we try to get there we be take action to support business include through the new british industrial competitiveness scheme which will reduce electricity cost by around to for more than business 
 when the government help business reduce energy cost include by aid their transition business such as the pub and cafés in dawley madeley and oakengates and manufacturer on stafford park and halesfield can then protect and create job and pass on saving to customer will the government back those business and ask the energy giant which continue to make ten of billion of pound of profit to pay for it 
 my hon friend be completely right to stress the challenge face by business the government be commit to back business we be work with the regulator to make sure that the system be fair for everyone and as be set out in our industrial strategy from the new british industrial competitiveness scheme will reduce electricity cost by up to £ per megawatt hour which will benefit thousand of electricity intensive industry include the one in his constituency we be very clear that we be back business and we will do everything we can to support they in drive down bill 
 energy cost be an issue that the prax oil refinery have bring to my attention over the year as a problem it have be face i appreciate the call i have have with the minister for energy about this i be able to visit the plant on friday and there be clearly grow concern with hundred of job at risk what assurance can the minister offer my constituent who be affect by this situation 
 the hon member be right to raise this situation we know that it be very difficult and we have be engage on it there have be long stand issue with how the plant be run we be try across the piece to support business to make the transition and support they within the transition so that we can protect job across the country 
 i call the shadow minister 
 when the price cap fall last month the labour party boast £ off your bill deliver by labour the minister know that energy bill fall as wholesale gas price fall and she know that her policy be to take the country off gas and keep increase policy cost on bill that be why she refuse to repeat the claim will she take this opportunity to apologise for her party say something that she know be untrue 
 every time the hon member stand up to speak i hold my head in absolute frustration he be gamble with fossil fuel and quite frankly the conservatives should hang their head in shame energy bill rocket under their watch and they do nothing about it they be happy with that that be not a legacy that we be willing to contend with which be why we be take action in the short term to drive down bill through our sprint to clean power their legacy be they should be ashamed of so they should not be lecture we 
 what assessment he have make of the role of new nuclear in support a clean energy transition 
 what assessment he have make of the role of new nuclear in support a clean energy transition 
 the clean power action plan make it clear that nuclear will play an important role in our future energy system provide low carbon baseload power to the grid we be deliver the big new nuclear building programme in a generation have commit almost £ at the recent spending review 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for show his love for hemel hempstead when he come to launch a new scheme on solar panel the other month on the question of new nuclear and clean job could the minister outline how community like mine in hemel hempstead will benefit from these new job 
 well my right hon friend the energy secretary say that we love hemel hempstead i think we agree on that the nuclear sector be poise for significant growth that will help deliver on our energy need in the future and it be how we will deliver thousand of skilled job across the country the nuclear skill plan be a collaborative effort between government industry and academia set out the target work we need to address the skill gap and bring forward the thousand   of apprentice we will need to deliver this work in the future the regional skill hub we have establish will help to deliver training support locally to ensure that every community in the country benefit 
 rolls royce in derby have recently be announce as the preferred bidder for the delivery of small modular reactor which mean that many of my erewash constituent will become the beat heart of the workforce that deliver the reactor can the minister explain how derbyshire ’s fine smr will help to end our reliance on foreign oil and gas 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the government be commit to deliver a new golden age of nuclear secure an abundance of clean power after year of dither and delay from the conservatives and with that will come investment across the country on   june follow a robust year process great british energy nuclear select rolls royce smr as its preferred bidder to deliver the uk ’s small modular reactor subject to final government approval and contract signature the government be make available £ across the spending review to enable this to be of europe ’s smr programme 
 i have always be a supporter of nuclear power unfortunately we do not have access to nuclear power in northern ireland but i know from discussion with the minister that he be very keen to ensure that modular nuclear power opportunity be available in northern ireland business that i have speak to want access to these opportunity as do the northern ireland assembly i know that the minister be always commit to try to make thing well so have he have an opportunity to talk to the relevant minister in the northern ireland assembly about ensure that access to modular nuclear power be available to we in northern ireland 
 i regularly engage with ministers in the northern irish executive include in the department for the economy which have responsibility for energy policy in northern ireland and we discuss a range of issue we be happy to support the northern irish executive in any way we can either with technology or through roll out the regulatory framework we be really excited about the opportunity pose by smr and be happy to discuss that in northern ireland as well 
 what step his department be take to help reduce industrial electricity price 
 what step his department be take to help reduce industrial electricity price 
 we understand that high energy bill be a challenge for business and particularly energy intensive company we be clear that in the long term our mission to deliver clean power be the only way to bear down on that cost but   while we get there we be provide the support need through the british industrial competitiveness scheme and the supercharger scheme protect over business 
 the uk ’s industrial electricity price be among the high in europe and it be quite clear that the government ’s current policy be fail manufacture business in constituency such as mine will the minister commit to introduce support that genuinely reduce electricity cost for manufacturer include by tackle high wholesale energy price rather than prolong the uncertainty which sadly put local job at risk 
 i gently remind the right hon member that industrial energy price rocket on the conservatives watch gas price for non domestic company go up by which be catastrophic for uk plc we be take action to support business through our sprint to clean power and critically the measure we be provide through the british industrial competitiveness scheme those measure have be support by make uk the british chambers of commerce uk steel and the chemical industries association the conservatives dither delay and do nothing to support business we be crack on and get on with the job 
 on friday i visit c&m precision ltd a small manufacture company in my constituency electricity represent easily its big cost what be the minister do to listen to small and medium sized enterprise like c&m who feel that their voice be simply not be hear 
 we be listen to business particularly small and medium sized business we have hear company complain for example about be lock into expensive fix term contract that be why ofgem be work to deliver blend and extend contract so that business can benefit from low price we have hear their frustration at the lack of a redress system which be why last december we expand the ombudsman service to of business so that they can get redress and financial award of up to £ we have also hear their frustration about energy broker which be why we have consult on introduce regulation of party intermediary we will respond in due course 
 last week the energy security and net committee hear from make uk and representative from the chemical petrochemical steel and ceramics industry that close alignment and collaboration with the eu on energy pricing be critical to reduce bill that be also recognise in the government ’s industrial strategy what more be the department do to bring that forward quickly 
 my hon friend make a good point industry voice have be call for that close alignment particularly on the emission trading scheme we have hear that from uk steel the cbi make uk and the energy intensive users group and we believe that those strong linkage be the right thing to do to cut red tape at the border to protect   consumer from high cost and critically to boost trade and growth which the government be absolutely committed to do 
 way to drive down energy cost include for energy intensive industry could be to help cut curtailment cost by encourage the co location of new energy intensive industry sector with some of the renewable sector that we be currently have to pay to switch off as we start to roll out more datum centre across the country what conversation have ministers have about how such centre could be optimally locate to help reduce our energy bill at the same time 
 my hon friend make a good point as always we in the department be work across government as part of the ai council as well as with colleague in the department for business and trade to ensure that we have the co ordination and collaboration to support business on the ground 
 what step he be take to help increase the supply of clean energy 
 we will continue to support new renewable through the contract for difference scheme in conjunction with initiative such as the warm home plan the future home standard and the boiler upgrade scheme great british energy and great british energy nuclear will together invest more than £ over this parliament in home grow clean power 
 i welcome the government ’s mission to achieve clean power by i know that the minister will agree that it be vital that we make the transition to net as quickly as possible not only to fight climate change but to low energy bill do he agree that whereas previous government have fail to deliver for the british people our plan be the single good way to bring down energy bill for family include in my battersea constituency and to provide they with much need energy security 
 i completely agree my hon friend make the point that this be not just about action on the climate as important as that be and create thousand of new job but about bring down bill and crucially deliver on that energy security point the truth be that even though our clean power mission be about do all of those thing at the same time the conservative party oppose all of that action would leave we much more vulnerable to the volatility of the fossil fuel market and would turn its face against the economic opportunity of the century 
 the minister will recognise that way to increase the supply of clean energy be to enable community energy project to supply local energy market when minister be ask about that as he know they have be many time they generally say that there be no technical   obstacle to it happen but will the minister recognise that there be world of difference between on the hand something be technically possible and on the other that same thing be facilitate and encourage so it really happen will he focus on the latter as the government develop their energy market reform 
 i completely agree the right hon and learn gentleman be absolutely right there be no technical barrier to do it but that do not mean that it be a straightforward process to be honest thing that i think would have be much more straightforward like how we define community be more difficult to get right but we be absolutely determined to do it he be right to make the point about deliver clean power that benefit local community so that they can buy it locally and really see the benefit of host it that be exactly what we be determined to do and we will continue to work to make it happen 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of extend the warm home discount to all household in receipt of means test benefit on people receive those benefit 
 we know that household be under huge pressure with the cost of living and energy cost be a big part of that the expansion of the warm home discount scheme will mean that nearly more family will receive vital support with their energy bill this winter this will provide much need help at a time when people desperately need it 
 will the minister confirm how many resident in my north durham constituency will benefit from the extension of the warm home discount to all household in receipt of means test benefit 
 sadly we do not have datum at constituency level but i can tell my hon friend who be a brilliant champion for his constituency that around extra household in the north east will benefit from the expansion an increase of around 
 the minister will be aware that many home particularly in rural area be old property that be difficult to insulate do she agree that we all need to concentrate on those old type of property many of which be the home of elderly people who can not afford expensive energy we need to concentrate on ensure that those home be properly insulate and that the warm home discount scheme be extend to such property 
 the hon member make an important point we be very clear that we need to make sure that we have the right solution for every household include those in rural community i have meet representative from rural community council member and some of the company that be try to do work in rural community we be absolutely committed to get this right as part of the warm home plan 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of mechanism to encourage private sector investment in renewable energy source 
 since the election last year we have secure over £ of investment into the uk ’s clean energy industry last year ’s renewable auction for allocation round be the most successful in our history and we will shortly open the ar7 auction this be the way to deliver energy security low bill and good job for our community 
 private sector investment via community energy scheme be a popular way of engage people to get behind renewable energy project in their area a great example be meadow blue community energy in my constituency of chichester which put money back into the community with a grant scheme and be now fund solar panel on local school roof do the secretary of state agree that community energy project would attract more private sector investment if grid access cost be reduce and the delivery of local supply be make easy 
 the hon lady raise an important issue which be also raise by   the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright she be right about the virtue of community energy great british energy be go to partner with local community to deliver community energy up and down the country because sometimes public capital it could be loan it could be grant can help lever in the private capital that we need she be also right about some of the barrier as the energy minister mention i want to assure she that we be go through the different barrier in granular nerdy detail to see how we can break they down 
 i must declare an interest as a crofte tenant of knock and swordale common grazing as good a definition of a community as you can ever get but knock and swordale along with several other community power scheme in my constituency can not get grid connection except through active network management connection which basically mean that the community can supply power to the grid only when the big boy the commercial company be not do so these connection offer be next to useless and the national energy system operator ofgem and the transmission company have to be tell from this dispatch box that they can not be agnostic about what kind of grid connection they offer and to whom they must put community if community be go to support this transition 
 my hon friend who i have talk to on a number of occasion about these wide issue raise a really important point i be just talk to the energy minister about it let i take away my hon friend ’s point about access we be commit to drive forward community energy and we will talk to neso and ofgem to get it right and make sure it happen 
 what step he be take to ensure scientific evidence be use to support his net policy 
 yesterday the secretary of state make an incredibly important statement to this house outline the crisis we face when it come to climate change and the decline of nature tackle this start with be honest about the science and what the expert be tell we we know that we can only have climate security for future generation by act at scale today 
 i thank the minister for her answer energy security be important not just to help bring bill down now do the minister agree that it be also vital for the future and for protect future generation include in my constituency of eminently lovable watford because those young people be the one who will face the climate change consequence in the year to come 
 as someone who grow up in luton i be not sure i be allow to say that i love watford because there be an age old rivalry there but yes we know that act now with our clean energy superpower mission scale up renewable reinforce the grid and reduce our reliance on volatile fossil fuel market will mean a clean more secure future for generation to come that be why unlike the conservatives we be follow the science and show the leadership that be need at home and abroad 
 around beverley there be proposal for solar farm total mw can the minister assure my constituent that the scientific evidence that will be use to assess this will include the cumulative impact of these project on the area around beverley 
 yes of course we look at the cumulative impact of these development have be in the department the right hon gentleman will know that we have an excellent team of scientist lead by professor paul monks who i want to pay tribute to because he be stand down later this year i be sure the right hon gentleman would want to do so too 
 i call the shadow secretary of state and congratulation on your marriage 
 thank you mr speaker 
 the secretary of state try to argue yesterday that he be a climate change believer and everybody else who disagree with he be a deni because he do not want to engage with any legitimate criticism of his policy he be offshore british industry in other word replace british good with dirty import with high emission can the minister confirm what the scientific evidence be that do so will help to tackle climate change 
 perhaps if the right hon member have be here yesterday she would have be able to engage with the secretary of state on this the science be absolutely clear every avoid fraction of a degree of   warming make a difference to the severity of climate impact that be why the prime minister go to the global leader summit at cop29 last year to announce a new ° c align nationally determined contribution and we will continue to show international leadership 
 what step he be take to manage the radio teleswitch service switch off 
 the government have step in to ensure a more control and carefully manage phase out of the radio teleswitch service i have be engage directly on this and meet energy uk and ofgem fortnightly to discuss progress and the supplier phase out plan my focus and priority be absolutely clear to ensure that there be no impact on consumer and that we minimise any consumer detriment 
 i welcome the government ’s change in course because the previous hard deadline would have leave many people include people in my constituency of edinburgh west vulnerable and indeed unaware that there be any need to change their meter but there be still a big problem in scotland as people be still wait on meter and may be unaware of this issue on engage with the community will the minister please tell we what she be do in scotland to ensure that rural community be approach about this and vulnerable people get protection 
 we have be work closely with the scottish government and engage with scottish mp we know that about meter need to be replace in scotland all those household have be contact multiple time in addition because we know that there be particular challenge in some rural community we have do a sprint in which supplier be work in collaboration with the local authority to bring down the number of replacement need i can reassure the hon member that no area will be switch off without we contact consumer to inform they without we allow they to book in emergency appointment and critically without we inform mp and local authority so that we do this in the good possible way 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the climate change committee ’s report entitle progress in reduce emission publish on june 
 the climate change committee report make clear the progress we have make in the past month on overturn the terrible legacy of the conservatives who turn their back on climate action we know that clean power be the route to energy security low bill and good job it be a shame that the tories and reform be still stick in the past 
 the climate change committee say that the uk should be proud of its approach to consistent and sustain decarbonisation but there be much more to do this week bracknell forest community climate action be host a summit to discuss what can be do locally to address climate change and support nature do the minister agree that local initiative like this demonstrate the strong public support for action on climate change 
 we know that there be strong public support and we be keen to engage more at a local level with group like bracknell forest community climate action that be why we have set up the local net delivery group to work with council and mayor and why we will produce a public participation strategy later this year i very much hope that my hon friend ’s constituent will get involve in that 
 will the minister join i in congratulate the fantastic lib dem run winchester city council on be rat the green council in the uk by climate action uk that be a lot of work by politician and it show what politician who dearly believe in this issue can achieve if they crack on and deal with it rather than weaponise it in some kind of culture war 
 i be happy to join the hon member in congratulate his local council i visit the local government association the week before last i think with the local net delivery group on which we have representation from all area of local government i be keen to learn from the good and translate that into action for other who need a bit more encouragement 
 what step he be take to increase the use of renewable energy 
 our clean power action plan set out our pathway to deliver clean power to support that plan we recently launch the solar road map which confirm plan to increase domestic solar installation through the future home standard and warm home plan 
 over of our food and £ in lifesave medicine depend on the cold chain but operator face soar energy cost and grow grid instability in epsom and ewell sunswap be pioneer battery and solar power refrigeration which cut emission while protect vital supply chain will the minister commit to target support for renewable energy innovator like sunswap whose technology can strengthen both sustainability and national resilience 
 the hon lady be right that we have an enormous amount of innovation in this space and real potential to meet our future need not just as a result of the pathway that we have outline but through innovative solution like the she mention which provide specific support to target industry i be happy to look far into her proposal and at the funding available for innovation if she want to write to i with any detail i will happily follow up 
 a business in the village of fradley in my constituency have a plan to put million of watt of solar on the roof of its business unfortunately it can not proceed with that application because there be not sufficient export capacity on the site it would never export a watt of that electricity which would meet only a fraction of its energy need will the minister meet i so that we can discuss how we can make regulatory change to support project like this 
 my hon friend make a point that other have raise we be look in granular detail at how the system work to ensure that the regulatory landscape allow such opportunity to be take i be very happy to meet he to discuss this far we be take a detailed look at every single aspect of the system so that community business and other can benefit from be able to export power to the grid that will help the country with its energy need and deliver a benefit for local community 
 what step he be take to help reduce household energy bill 
 what step he be take to help support low income family in the context of trend in the level of energy price 
 what step he be take to help reduce household energy bill 
 we believe that the good way to protect household permanently be through our mission to deliver clean power by combine with our warm home plan to upgrade million of home across the country so that they be warm and cheap to run that will drive down energy bill and make cold home a thing of the past we know that we need to support people while we make that transition which be why we be extend the warm home discount 
 almost of people in my north east hampshire constituency live in fuel poverty i agree with the minister that invest in renewable energy would help to tackle that so how be she work with the ministry of housing communities and local government to empower local authority to develop renewable energy generation locally by follow europe ’s lead in put solar over car park for example in order to make energy cheap and more sustainable 
 the hon member be right there be a big push to work with local and regional authority to ensure not only that we generate renewable that can impact on bill but that we upgrade home through local energy action plan local authority be for the time work with the national energy system operator and other system operator to drive that local and regional authority have a crucial role to play in upgrade million of home across the country 
 my heywood and middleton north constituent live in a state of profound uncertainty as to how the unpredictability of global energy market will affect their family do the minister agree that if we want to protect those family from volatility we must end our reliance on global fossil fuel market and introduce target intervention to bring bill down particularly for those on the low income 
 my hon friend be right it beggar belief that the conservative party be so stuck in its ideological opposition to move towards clean power we be clear that we must break our dependence on global fossil fuel market which lead to record energy bill during the energy crisis we be make that sprint but it be critical that we support the most vulnerable household while we make that transition which be why i be so proud that this government extend the warm home discount so that an extra household in will benefit this winter 
 i congratulate ministers again on embrace the principle of the sunshine bill campaign run by i and many other to ensure that solar panel be include on the roof of all new house in the heat of recent week people in my constituency have be swelter in beautiful old regency building which pose a particular challenge in this respect do ministers agree that if we line up heat pump technology and solar panel we can lower our energy bill and keep cool at the same time 
 the hon member be right we believe in a solar panel revolution that be of the key thing that great british energy will bring about across the country on overheat it will be critical to ensure that as we upgrade home we make they fit for purpose in the context of climate change we be include air to air heat pump in the boiler upgrade scheme and we will consider other measure to keep home cool 
 the government have take long overdue step to secure rooftop solar on new build but there be even great untapped potential on exist commercial and domestic rooftop will minister consider introduce a scheme similar to those in other country offer free installation of rooftop solar for business and resident the cost could be pay back through a long term power purchase agreement that would simultaneously increase the supply of clean energy and cut bill 
 my hon friend be right to talk about the potential of solar on our commercial building we know that solar can reduce energy bill by about £ we be look at all the option because we be absolutely serious about a solar rooftop revolution whether on our home or commercial building 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we welcome the joint agreement sign in may between the uk and the eu in which small step be take to address the impact of the conservatives botched brexit deal on energy cost and bill what further step will the secretary of state take to forge energy co operation   through a recoupling of the uk and eu electricity market and the uk ’s participation in the eu ’s internal electricity market to boost trade bring down renewable energy cost and reduce energy bill 
 we have be listen to industry voice and they be very clear about the opportunity for strong alignment we will continue to engage with they and with our partner in the eu on the opportunity as we make the sprint to clean power 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since the last oral question time for the department the spending review announce the large investment in clean energy in our country ’s history investment in new nuclear in carbon capture and storage and in hydrogen transport and storage we be invest £ through great british energy and £ in our warm home plan for energy security low bill and good job 
 evidence from the national grid ofgem and imperial college london show that locational or zonal pricing would save billion of pound a year low bill and reduce the need for expensive and often unpopular grid infrastructure why have the secretary of state rule it out 
 i make a comprehensive statement to the house on this last thursday and the ground for the decision be these there be the question of fairness and secondly there be the question of the cost of the transition and what would happen in the meantime we need investment in our clean energy infrastructure and we need investment in growth i believe that our way reform national pricing be the right way forward 
 in the fight for energy security every area of our country must play its part but that mean energy infrastructure project should be distribute evenly what be the department do to ensure that no community will be ask to do more than its fair share 
 my hon friend make an important point that be why the strategic spatial energy plan will set out where we need our energy infrastructure so that we can have a plan system that match power need and infrastructure at least cost to bill payer and taxpayer 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 yesterday the secretary of state say i be hide when i be in fact with my month old baby who i know he be aware of on behalf of all young mum who face those kind of comment in their few week back at work may i gently suggest he reflect on those remark 
 i want to ask the secretary of state a very simple question be £ high or low than £ 
 on the point i completely respect the right hon lady ’s decision to be with her young baby and there be no offence intend i think it be very important that we understand the need of new parent and indeed parent across the country on the question she ask i do not know what she be get at frankly 
 i do not know whether the secretary of state do not know or do not want to say but £ a megawatt hour be what electricity cost last year and £ be the price he have pay for offshore wind and he be set to do the same this year and that be before the extra cost for the grid for wasted wind and back up which be go through the roof thank to his policy yesterday he commit to radical honesty in that spirit will he admit either that he can not add up or that his policy can not bring down bill 
 i be go to be radically honest and tell the right hon lady the truth she be gamble on fossil fuel the same thing she do that lead we to the bad cost of live crisis in our country ’s history with family finance business finance and public finance wreck the only way to bring down bill for good be through cheap home grow power that we control we have an energy security plan the conservatives have an energy surrender plan 
 what ambition do the department have for sector and technology that gb energy will prioritise since the chief operating officer have say that he want to evolve it into a major energy company and what might that mean for job creation include in constituency like mine 
 gb energy will prioritise a whole range of project and that be a matter for gb energy as a publicly own energy company at arm ’s length from government but there be huge opportunity right across our country whether in float wind tidal hydrogen or offshore wind and supply chain gb energy be own by the public and will benefit people right across britain 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 across europe we have already see heatwave relate death avoidable death and the met office report say that thing will just get bad the lib dems and i have a really cool idea will the secretary of state work with local authority to open up public space with air conditioning such as leisure centre and library so that they can provide relief from extreme heat for the elderly and vulnerable 
 there be no monopoly on good idea and the hon lady raise the important issue of how we adapt as a country to the climate crisis we know we have a lot more to do and we will listen to all good idea 
 in   my   constituency i be proud that we have the example in the country of a high energy use craft that have transition fully to renewable have work with a   uk manufacturer to create a super efficient electric furnace will the secretary of state come to stourbridge and visit allister malcolm glass at the stourbridge glass museum with i to highlight it as an example for other to follow and protect high energy use heritage craft across the country 
 my hon friend raise a great example and i will take a risk and say yes i will come to stourbridge i love stourbridge and i look forward to see that project 
 the government ’s new scope guidance for offshore project be hugely welcome we be already battle deadly heatwave and overshoot climate limit so it be critical that we stop extract new oil and gas give that there be no scenario in which rosebank or indeed any new oil and gas well be compatible with limit global temperature increase to ° c why be the government try to delay recognition of that climate reality by say that application will be consider on a case by case basis will the minister give we a conclusive science back answer now and confirm that rosebank will not be go ahead 
 of course the government follow the regulation that we have put in place quickly and application must be consider on a case by case basis that be the way anyone would expect they to be deal with i will not say on the floor of the house any more about those application as they be live decision that will be make in due course by the department 
 what reassurance can the minister offer the nearly worker at prax that the government be focused on find a new owner for the lindsey oil refinery 
 i will repeat what i have say before we be obviously hugely disappoint by the way that the owner have deal with the company i repeat the ask that i have make in the house a number of time and in write to the chief executive that he should put his hand in his pocket and do the right thing by the workforce we be do everything we can as part of the insolvency process safely to manage the refinery and to look at whether there be buyer interested in take it on 
 the late central estimate from the office for budget responsibility put the cost of achieve net by at £ with half that cost attribute to lose fuel duty do the secretary of state accept that the government will need to increase duty elsewhere include on renewable which could push bill up far 
 the most significant thing about the obr report be that it say there be an threat to our gdp by in a ° c world and a rise in the debt to gdp ratio if we do not act on climate change that be the most important thing from that report which i recommend all hon member read over the summer 
 i have receive numerous email from my constituent in broxtowe raise concern about the loss of or threat to meadow meadow be critical to our environment and have be part of our natural heritage for century they provide a wealth of benefit such as a unique wildlife habitat flood alleviation and the promotion of clean air without well protection remain historic meadow and their ecological value risk vanish beneath our foot will the minister commit to include the protection of meadow in the list of irreplaceable habitat 
 i appreciate my hon friend ’s concern this be a matter for the department for environment food and rural affairs but i be happy to talk to colleague as they bring forward their land use framework nature base solution to climate change be important so we very much engage with our colleague in defra on these issue 
 solar developer be not play by the rule when it come to access the land of people on ynys môn government guidance state that developer must act reasonably when try to obtain permission to access the land but my constituent have receive threatening email and there have even be case of developer trespass on land do the minister condone such behaviour and do he believe that current guidance be strong enough to protect constituent such as mine 
 i do not know the specific of the case that the hon lady raise if she want to send any detail to i i will certainly look at they we clearly want to see and expect in every single case a partnership between developer deliver project that we think be important the planning system responsible for put the process in place and the community who should have their local area protect and be able to access it i be happy to follow up with she if she want to raise specific with i 
 the vyrnwy frankton project which aim to connect onshore wind to the grid would cut across my constituency and affect local community and cherish countryside pose a threat to business and tourism will the minister assure i that the impact of the project and its associated lifetime cost will be minimise by undergrounde the cable along the route except where geology make that impossible 
 that be not the position of the government because report after report and the evidence point to the fact that undergrounde cable be significantly more expensive than put they above ground individual application will clearly look at the individual circumstance and make a decision on that we have say as a government that communitie that host network infrastructure should benefit through community benefit and direct money off bill and that be what we will deliver 
 it be recently announce that the surplus ministry of defence land at raf wyton in my constituency have be designate as an mod trailblazer site the housing minister confirm   to i last week that no assessment have yet be make of the energy infrastructure currently in place the prime minister recently confirm to i here in the chamber that my proposal to develop a defence technology cluster on the site would be support to that end be the minister prepare to look into the available energy infrastructure and substation connectivity at the site and write to i with his assessment 
 the hon gentleman be assiduous in raise these sort of question with i i be very happy to look at the possibility he be right to outline the potential of site such as that and we will look at it 
 nova innovation in my constituency be pioneer float solar which be generate clean energy will my right hon friend outline what step the government be take to support the development of float solar 
 that sound incredibly exciting and i look forward to find out more 
 we have be use float solar technology in this country since last month the french start the large plant in europe produce mw the chinese have single plant that produce mw give the scale of its use across the world bar britain why do the secretary of state refer to float solar as a nascent technology what be nascent about it 
 it sound like i be be educate about float solar i be happy to share the hon gentleman ’s enthusiasm for it if he have proposal about how we can take it forward i be all ear 
 in france germany croatia and elsewhere on mainland europe geothermal energy be be take very seriously i be disappoint that geothermal energy get little mention in the industrial strategy particularly as there be estimate to be gw of energy in the cornish granite batholith will the secretary of state meet i to discuss how we clear the barrier to unleash the potential of the cornish granite batholith 
 my hon friend always raise the huge potential of cornwall in this house and in the energy space he be right to talk about the potential for geothermal we be hugely excited about the opportunity that it present i be very happy to meet he and other to discuss far how we can take it forward 
 i be already be contact by constituent who be worried about afford their energy bill this winter but do not feel that the service they get from the energy company be properly support they what step be the government take to ensure that energy company provide the support that they need 
 we be very clear that energy company have strict obligation to follow we be work with ofgem to ensure that it adhere to those obligation and we be do the job   of review ofgem to ensure that it be a proper consumer champion with the mandate and power to work on behalf of consumer and reform this market so that it work in the interest of the hon lady ’s constituent 
 more than ineos chemical employee be to lose their job at grangemouth because the refinery have close the £ commitment to project willow do not help they in the here and now and it be frankly an insult to the worker who be about to lose their livelihood to talk about training opportunity at forth valley college that be not be afford to they what have the government actually do and what will they   do for those worker who do not have the same redundancy or training package as the refinery worker 
 we be look in the round at how we can deliver job and opportunity on the grangemouth site the national wealth fund make an unprecedented commitment of £ and i have be meet company that be potentially interested in develop project to make sure we get they over the line we have deliver on the training guarantee and deliver support beyond that provide by the falkirk and grangemouth growth deal we be do everything we can to support the workforce there and we will continue to do so 
 with permission mr speaker i wish to make a statement on a significant datum protection breach from february relate to the afghan relocation and assistance policy it lead to the high court grant an unprecedented super injunction and the previous government establish a secret afghan resettlement route today i be announce to the house a change in government policy i be close that resettlement route disclose the data loss and confirm that the court order be lift at noon today 
 member of this house include you mr speaker and i have be subject to the super injunction it be unprecedented to be clear the court have always recognise the parliamentary privilege of proceeding in this house and ministers decide not to tell parliamentarian about the data incident at an early stage as the widespread publicity would increase the risk of the taliban obtain the dataset however as parliamentarian and as minister it have be deeply uncomfortable to be constrain from report to this house i be grateful to be able to disclose the detail to parliament today i trust that you mr speaker and member will bear with i if i take the time to ensure that the house now have the full information possible as i discuss with you yesterday 
 the fact be as follow in february month after the then defence secretary ben wallace introduce the afghan relocation and assistance policy and month after the fall of kabul a defence official email an arap case working file outside authorise government system as the house know arap be the resettlement scheme that this country establish for afghan citizen who work for or with our uk armed force over the combat year in afghanistan both in opposition and in government labour have back that scheme and arap have have full support from across this house 
 the official mistakenly believe that they be send the name of applicant however the spreadsheet in fact contain personal information associate with afghans who have apply to either the ex gratia scheme or the arap scheme on or before   january it contain name and contact detail of applicant and in some instance information relate to applicant family member in a small number of case the name of member of parliament senior military officer and government official be note as support the application this be a serious departmental error it be in clear breach of strict data protection protocol and be of many datum loss relate to the arap scheme during this period 
 minister in the previous government become aware of the data loss in mid august month after the incident when personal detail of individual from the dataset appear online action be take to ensure they be swiftly remove an internal investigation be conduct and the incident be report to both the metropolitan police and the information commissioner the met deem that no criminal investigation be necessary and the information commissioner have continue to work with the department throughout 
 however journalist be almost immediately aware of the breach and the previous administration apply to the high court for an injunction to prevent the datum   loss become public the judge deem that the risk warrant go far and on   september grant a super injunction which prevent disclosure of the very existence of the injunction that super injunction have be in place for nearly year during which time medium organisation and their journalist be serve to prohibit any reporting no government wish to withhold information from the british public parliamentarian or the press in this manner 
 in autumn previous ministers start work on establish a new resettlement scheme specifically design for people in the compromise dataset who be not eligible for arap but who be nevertheless judge to be at the high risk of reprisal by the taliban it be know as the afghanistan response route or arr it be cover by the super injunction the then government initially establish the arr to resettle a target cohort of around principal but in early a combination of ministers decision on the scheme ’s policy design and the court ’s view have broaden that category to nearly principal 
 i want to provide assurance to the house and the british public that all individual relocate under the afghanistan response route arap or the home office ’s afghan citizen resettlement scheme undergo strict national security check before be able to enter our country the full number of afghan arrival under all scheme have be report in the regular home office statistic mean that they be already count in exist migration figure 
 as shadow defence secretary i be initially brief on the arr by james heappey the former armed forces minister on   december and issue with the super injunction at the start of that meeting other member of the present cabinet be only informed of the evidence of the data breach the operation of the arr and the existence of the super injunction on take office after the general election by that time the arr scheme be fully establish and in operation and it be nearly and a half year since the data loss 
 i have feel deeply concerned about the lack of transparency to parliament and to the public i feel it only right to reassess the decision make criterion for the arr we begin straightaway to take a hard look at the policy complexity cost risk court hearing and the range of afghan relocation scheme be run by the previous government cabinet colleague endorse the need for new insight in the autumn of last year while the scheme keep run in december i announce the streamlining of the range of government scheme that we inherit into the afghan resettlement programme to establish well value for money a single set of time limit entitlement and support to get afghan family resettle on behalf of the house i sincerely thank our colleague in local government without whom this unified resettlement programme would simply not have be possible 
 at the beginning of this year i commission paul rimmer a former senior civil servant and ex deputy chief of defence intelligence to conduct an independent review the review be conclude and report to ministers last month today i be release a public version of rimmer ’s review and i be place a copy of it in the library of the house i be very grateful to he for his work 
 despite brutal human right abuse in afghanistan the rimmer review note the passage of time it be nearly year since the fall of kabul and conclude 
 there be little evidence of intent by the taleban to conduct a campaign of retribution against 
 former official it also conclude that those who pose a challenge to the taliban rule now be at great risk of a reaction from the regime and that 
 the wealth of datum inherit from the former government 
 by the taliban 
 would already enable they 
 to target individual if they wish to do so which mean that it be highly unlikely that merely be on the spreadsheet 
 would be the piece of information enable or prompt the taleban to act 
 rimmer be clear he stress the uncertainty in any judgment and do not rule out any risk yet he conclude that give this update context the current policy that we inherit 
 appear an extremely significant intervention to address the potentially limited net additional risk the incident likely present 
 the rimmer review be a very significant element but not the sole element in the government ’s decision to change policy to close the arr and to ensure that the court order be lift today policy concern about proportionality public accountability cost and fairness be also important factor for the government this be not a decision take lightly it follow a lengthy process include the rimmer review detailed ministerial discussion and repeat consultation with legal adviser just as i have change government policy in the light of the review the high court today in the light of the review rule that there be no tenable basis for the continuation of the super injunction 
 to date arr principal be in britain or in transit together with family member at a cost of about £ from today there will be no new arr offer of relocation to britain from today the route be closed however we will honour the invitation already make to any name person still in afghanistan and their immediate family when this nation make a promise we should keep it today i be also restore full accountability for the government ’s afghan relocation scheme to parliament and i would expect our select committees now to hold we to account through in depth inquiry 
 let i turn to the practical action that we have take as a result of this policy change and in preparation for the lifting of the court ’s super injunction my concern have be to notify as many people as possible who be affect by the data incident and to provide they with further advice the ministry of defence have do that this morning although it have not be possible to contact every individual on the dataset owe to its incomplete and out of date information anyone who may be concern can head to our new dedicated gov.uk website where they will find more information about the data loss further security advice a self checker tool which will inform they whether their application have be affect and contact step for the detailed information service centre that the mod have establish 
 this serious datum incident should never have happen it may have occur year ago under the previous government but to all those whose information be   compromise i offer a sincere apology today on behalf of the british government and i trust that the shadow defence secretary as a former defence minister will join i in that 
 to date afghans have be accept by britain through the range of relocation scheme britain have honour the duty we owe to those who work and fight alongside our troop in afghanistan the british people have welcome they to our country and in turn this be their chance to rebuild their life their chance to contribute to and share in the prosperity of our great country however none of these relocation scheme can carry on in perpetuity nor be they conceive to do so that be why we announce on   july   that we would no long accept new applicant to arap however i reiterate the commitment that we make then to process every outstanding arap application and relocate those who might prove eligible and we will complete our commitment to continue the review of the triples 
 i recognise that my statement will prompt many question i would have like to settle these matter soon because full accountability to parliament and freedom of the press matter deeply to i they be fundamental to our british way of life however life may have be at stake and i have spend many hour think about this decision think about the safety and the life of people i will never meet in a far off land in which of our servicemen and woman lose their life so this weigh heavily on i and it be why no government could take such decision lightly without sound ground and hard deliberation during the last year we have conduct and now complete this work i commend my statement to the house 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement and for receipt early this morning of a hard copy of the rimmer review i also thank the secretary of state and the minister for the armed forces for brief i yesterday and other parliamentary colleague today furthermore give the nature of the super injunction and the fact that the timing and nature of the statement relate entirely to the court ’s lifting of that super injunction i recognise that it be entirely right for the secretary of state to update the house at the early opportunity and i welcome the opportunity that colleague now have to scrutinise these matter 
 let i begin by declare an interest i be a defence minister in august when the department become aware of the breach my main role be to chair meeting on the matter in august because i be the duty minister thereafter however as minister for defence procurement and with this sit outside my portfolio i have relatively minimal direct involvement that say the secretary of state have issue an apology on behalf of the government and i join he in that and in recognise that this data leak should never have happen and be an unacceptable breach of all relevant data protocol i also agree that it be right for an apology to be issue specifically to those whose datum be compromise 
 it be nevertheless a fact that can not be ignore that when this breach come to light the immediate priority of the then government be to avoid a very specific and terrible scenario namely an error on the part of an   official of the british state lead to the torture or even murder of person in the dataset at the hand of what remain a brutal taliban regime as the rimmer review confirm that scenario thankfully appear to have be avoid of course we understand that the review be set up in january and report to the secretary of state in june 
 i want to be clear that it be entirely appropriate that the secretary of state have seek to update the department ’s understanding of the threat on the ground in afghanistan that exist today particularly for those person in the dataset who have previously be consider to be at the great risk of reprisal however the house will appreciate that when ministers become aware of the data breach in august we do not have the luxury of month in which to assess the situation as rimmer say in paragraph 
 the review note that the passage of time be particularly relevant 
 i know that my former ministerial colleague the former minister for the armed forces james heappey who lead the response to the leak will have be focus entirely on what he see as his duty of care to those at risk of reprisal base on the threat assessment that pertain at the time however any threat picture be constantly evolve and as i say i support the secretary of state ’s decision to review the mod ’s understanding of the threat give the late situation as report by rimmer we support his conclusion that the afghanistan response route can now be close 
 turn to the super injunction i entirely understand why this would be a subject of considerable interest particularly to the newspaper and medium outlet concern we have an independent judiciary and it be not for i to comment either on the decision to grant the injunction in the place or to lift it today but it be surely tell that paragraph of the rimmer review state that plan at the time that the government become aware of the breach in the summer of be base on a 
 risk judgement that be the taleban to secure access to the dataset the consequence for affected individual may be serious 
 have that not be the case no doubt the court would have be less likely to grant the injunction and certainly not a super injunction 
 on the leak can the secretary of state confirm that it be by a civil servant and that ministers at the time take step to change the casework procedure by not use spreadsheet send by email but move to a more secure system fully within the entirely secure network can he confirm that although the dataset be of about only a relatively small portion be identify as at high risk of reprisal and only a small number have be settle here which be why as he state the cost be about £ not the £ report elsewhere now that these matter be rightly in the public domain and give the reassessment of the threat in the rimmer review i agree that it would be wholly appropriate for the defence committee and other to look far into these matter 
 can the secretary of state comment on specific item be report which be that someone i refer not to the person who make the leak but another apparent party who obtain some of the datum be engage   in blackmail do the original metropolitan police investigation look at that and if not will he consider reopen it so that the police can look at that specific point which have serious implication 
 although we must recognise the huge role play by afghan national in support of our armed force any policy in this area must always be balance against our own national interest we support the government in close the arr scheme as we do with their decision to close the full arap programme 
 i welcome the tone in which the shadow defence secretary have respond and i welcome his join i in the apology on behalf of the british government to those whose datum have be compromise i also welcome his acceptance that as he put it it be entirely appropriate for the defence secretary as part of a new government to look to update the department ’s assessment of the threat i be very pleased that as the house will have note he support rimmer ’s conclusion and my policy judgment that the government have announce today the shadow defence secretary be right that in simple term rimmer give we a revise up to date assessment of the risk in particular the risk to those individual whose datum may be on that spreadsheet he do confirm that it be highly unlikely that their name be on the dataset increase the risk of their be target 
 the shadow defence secretary ask i or specific question he ask about the official it be a defence official i can not account for the improvement in datum handle that previous ministers may have make but when i do his job in opposition this data leak be just of many from the afghan scheme i can also say that in the past year since the election the government have appoint a new chief information officer instal new software to securely share datum and complete a comprehensive review of the legacy afghan datum on the casework system 
 on the £ figure which i think the shadow defence secretary may have pick up from court paper that be a previous estimate it be relate not simply to the afghan response route but an estimate of the total cost of all government afghan scheme for the entire period in which they may operate 
 on the significance of today ’s announcement and the policy decision that we have take compare with simply continue the policy and scheme that we inherit the taxpayer will pay £ less over the period about few afghans will come to this country and above all proper accountability in this house and proper freedom of the medium be restore 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement although i welcome it and his intent to inject parliamentary transparency and scrutiny this whole datum breach be a mess and wholly unacceptable as i mention to the minister for the armed forces during our recent secret briefing i be minded to recommend to my defence committee colleague that we thoroughly investigate it to ascertain what have transpire give the serious ramification on so many level 
 as thing stand notwithstanding the content of the rimmer review how confident be my right hon friend the defence secretary that the afghans affect many of whom bravely support our service personnel will not be at risk of recrimination and reprisal 
 i can only recommend that my hon friend read in full the public version of the rimmer report which i have publish today rimmer set out conclusion and an update risk assessment take an up to date view recognise that the situation in afghanistan be nearly year on from the point at which the taliban take control and that the present regime see those who may threaten the regime itself as a great threat to their operation than any former government official or serve official 
 i recommend that my hon friend read that report and i expect that he as the defence committee chair will want to take full advantage of this restore parliamentary accountability i have always believe that our select committee system in this house be perfectly capable of and well suit to many of the in depth inquiry that often get punt into public inquiry or call for such inquiry i hope he will have note the fact that the shadow defence secretary also endorse that view 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the minister for the armed forces for his briefing on this issue this morning 
 i be pleased this house now have the opportunity to scrutinise this alarming datum breach it be right that the then government move to introduce a new scheme to try to minimise the risk to the afghan soldier and their family catch up in this breach involve individual in total it be the very least we owe they give the sacrifice they make to support our campaign in afghanistan and i welcome the apology from both side of the house as a result of this data breach 
 there be however serious question raise about how this data breach be allow to happen under the conservatives watch and the heighten level of risk it have create for the afghans involve what step have be take to address the root cause of the breach and ensure that it can not happen again report by the financial times this afternoon suggest that an original relocation scheme consider for all afghan personnel could cost up to £ will he confirm what assessment his department have make of that figure and why that be keep hide from the public 
 the immediate priority must be to ensure the safety of all those individual catch up in this breach so what assurance can the secretary of state provide that lift the super injunction do not heighten danger for the individual concern what step be he take to ensure that the individual whose datum be leak be aware of the incident what additional support be be provide to they directly now that the case be in the public domain in the light of these development can he outline when the casework and final relocation under this and the arap scheme will be complete 
 i welcome the hon lady ’s response i provide the answer to or of her question directly to the shadow defence secretary on the step   we have take to ensure the reduce risk of datum loss and data breach in future can never say never but i be more confident that i be month ago i have also give a response on the £ figure the estimate full cost of all afghan scheme that will run to their completion from start to finish because of the saving that will derive from the policy decision we have take today will be between £ and £ the cost of the arr scheme to date the cost and the sum commit to bring the principal and their immediate family who be in britain or in transit be about £ on those still to come i expect the cost to be a similar sum 
 i think i say in my statement to the house that rimmer recognise the uncertainty and the brutal nature of the afghan taliban regime there can never be no risk in such judgment and decision and that be reason that i and the government have take this decision with hard deliberation and serious intent i hope the house will back it this afternoon 
 i be grateful to the ministerial team for my early briefing which give i an opportunity to read a foreign affairs committee report that come out it be begin in september in under the chairmanship of   the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat it be call miss in action uk leadership and the withdrawal from afghanistan and it be excoriate 
 the manner of the withdrawal of international force from afghanistan be a disaster a betrayal of our ally and weaken the trust that help to keep british people safe 
 it say 
 the government should keep well record securely hold on locally employ staff 
 we have hear that this be of the many datum loss from arap 
 to ensure that any evacuation can be carry out more effectively it should devise a policy base on clear and fair principle about the assistance that will be offer to local partner in the event of a security deterioration and report to we when it have do so 
 i hope that such a policy have be develop that more lesson have be learn and that ministers will report to my foreign affairs committee about where we be now 
 i be sure ministers will report to my right hon friend ’s committee if she invite we to do so she be right to make the big argument that anyone provide datum to the british government have a right to expect that personal datum to be store securely handle safely and not subject to the sort of loss or breach that we see too often in the early day of the afghan relocation scheme 
 i call the father of the house 
 i commend the secretary of state for his honesty and i agree with everything he say in his statement what an appalling mess but part of the original sin be our intervene militarily and then scuttle out on a wide point may i take it that we have learn our lesson and have get over the liberal imperial itch of the cameron and blair era to intervene militarily in ungovernable country such as iraq afghanistan syria and libya let we now move on but i support what the secretary of state say 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his remark i be certainly grateful for his support for my statement this afternoon although he have not say it he be a big champion of press freedom and i expect that he also recognise that an important part of our decision have be the period in which we have see no public knowledge no media reporting and no parliamentary accountability we set that right today 
 as a veteran of the war in afghanistan i be appal to watch the chaotic mismanagement follow the fall of kabul that leave afghans who serve alongside our troop and who work so hard for a well afghanistan dangerously expose this be a situation that i fear would happen and could see come even when i serve in afghanistan in the fact be that the previous government have plenty of warning that that situation could happen and fail to plan properly for it this data breach join a litany of other datum breach delay and failure of our ally do the secretary of state agree that we must give our full support to those afghans so they can rebuild a new life in the uk 
 i do indeed i know from afghan family who be relocate in the early day to my own constituency in south yorkshire that it be the voice of member on both side of the house speak up in exactly the same term as my hon friend just have and recognise the debt this country owe to many of those who work alongside or serve with our armed force and who make possible in the place the very difficult job that our force undertake in afghanistan that provide a warm welcome and they continue to do so to those afghans we be offer a new home and a chance to rebuild their life and contribute to our country
