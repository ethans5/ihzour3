 scotland have the low rate of child poverty in the uk with the game change scottish child payment help more than and lift of they out of poverty why do the uk government continue to refuse to follow such a successful example 
 the uk government have ensure that the cost of living challenge have be tackle by work in tandem with the scottish government and use reserve and devolve lever to get the good outcome for everybody across scotland the benefit cap level have be increase by from   april the national living wage have increase by to £ an hour for worker age year and over overall this government be work to deliver for the most vulnerable in society and will do so in conjunction with our partner in the scottish government

 after year of snp government and year of the tories in child in scotland live in poverty there be more child in poverty compare with a decade ago and this week it be reveal that member of the scottish government ’s own poverty and inequality commission have resign do the minister agree that both the scottish and the uk government should be work more urgently and more effectively to tackle child poverty 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his new position the uk government be commit to protect the most vulnerable in our society and we have take decisive step to do that include uk wide additional spending of £ in benefit for pensioner £ in benefit to support disabled people and people with health condition and £ in working age benefit and child welfare we have also uprate benefit and pension credit in line with inflation and have raise the national living wage to help to protect the most vulnerable we will continue to keep the situation under review but this government have continually demonstrate our commitment to the most vulnerable across scotland

 accord to office for budget responsibility and uk government projection the uk will see between £ and £ in revenue from north sea oil and gas over the next year while it be welcome that the acorn project can now bid for funding it be important to know that not a penny have be commit can the minister tell i what discussion the secretary of state have have with   government colleague to secure at minimum a share of those revenue say £ over year to rapidly accelerate scotland ’s carbon capture industry if not do that mean he be content to see scotland ’s people strip of their vast natural resource without a single penny of that £ be invest in scotland ’s carbon capture ambition 
 i be not sure whether the hon gentleman actually listen to my answer but more than £ have be allocate by the united kingdom government to the development of this technology the government will commence engagement and assessment of delivery plan and due diligence on the acorn and viking transportation and storage system and will engage with they directly in respect of the next step to develop those we will set out the process by which capture product in track will be select to meet the stated ambition in due course

 there be huge potential for offshore wind in scotland and it be an important part of the transition to a green economy there what conversation will the minister be have with the offshore wind sector follow the absolutely disastrous contract for difference round last week 
 i personally engage with all sector of the energy market include the offshore wind sector we be very pleased with the announcement that have be make follow the announcement last week and will continue to engage with the sector to see it develop across scotland and other part of the united kingdom 
 we come to the shadow secretary of state 
 i join the secretary of state in say how gutted we be about the football result last night but mark my word we will be seek revenge in germany at the european championship next year 
 i take this opportunity to thank my hon friend   the member for blaydon liz twist who be in the shadow scotland team but have move on to do new thing after the reshuffle and to welcome to the scotland team my hon friend   the member for keir hardie ’s old seat merthyr tydfil and rhymney gerald jones he be very welcome 
 last week it be reveal that the former prime minister   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss have secure a book deal her book be title year to save the west but it might have be well focus on the day it take she and her government with the support of the scottish secretary to crush the economy do the minister accept that scot will be pay the price for year to come for the tories kamikaze handling of the economy 
 as the hon gentleman well know the economic challenge we face here in the united kingdom be no different from those face by other economy around the world they have be entirely cause by the illegal war in ukraine and the covid pandemic thankfully due to the decisive action of this conservative government and prime minister the evidence suggest that the uk be recover from the economic shock far well than france italy and germany 
 ukraine and covid do not crash the economy this government do the truth be that after year we have a low wage low growth economy let i take the example of resident in a random scottish constituency rutherglen and hamilton west behind every door we knock on the story be the same the cost of living those voter be pay the price for bad government the uk government who crash the economy and be ask work people to pay for it and the scottish government who mismanage the economy and be also ask work people to pay for it there be a tory premium on everyone ’s mortgage and rent alongside the high tax burden on work people in year and the snp want to increase income taxis far and be propose eye water council tax rate for those resident do the people of rutherglen and hamilton west not deserve a fresh start with scottish labour ’s michael shanks 
 it be not so long ago that scottish labour be call for even high taxis on the people of scotland when scottish labour leader anas sarwar stand for the leadership he say 
 i actually think our tax policy will be even more progressive and radical than even john mcdonnell ’s or jeremy corbyn ’s tax policy or manifesto 
 mr sarwar have now u turn of course but maybe the hon gentleman can explain how much scottish labour secretly want to put up taxis in scotland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the uk ’s departure from the eu on scotland 
 the uk government be focus on open new international export market for scottish business we have trade agreement with non eu country and the eu and those agreement will support growth job and high wage the hon gentleman will have note the recently revise number which show that we have recover well from the pandemic than france italy or germany since the united kingdom have achieve the high rate of growth in the g7 fast than italy france japan and germany 
 we have a really good trading relationship with the european union it be call membership and of people in glasgow north and of people across scotland vote to retain it if brexit be really deliver the success that the secretary of state say it be why do he think the poll show that those figure would be even high if the people of scotland have the choice again 
 the recent trading number show that we be now do more trade with the eu in good and service than we do when we be member 
 do my right hon friend agree that we be develop a much well relationship with our former colleague in the eu include through agreement such as the windsor framework and our accession to the north sea group of country that co operate on energy and more recently to horizon and other european programme that show that we be on the right footing to have a good future relationship post brexit 
 yes on horizon we be patient and do the right deal it show the future for british scientist as well as how important british scientist be to horizon and how much the eu want they to be part of it my right hon and learn friend be right we have a well relationship and that do not cost £ a year 
 whether he have hold recent discussion with cabinet colleague and the scottish government on increase co operation between nhs england and nhs scotland 
 the united kingdom government support collaboration between all our nation to share good practice improve transparency and provide well accountability for patient ministerial colleague at the department of health and social care have write to the scottish government invite they for talk on how we can work together to tackle long term waiting list in all part of the united kingdom 
 if someone be sick and their life be in danger be it not the case that the border between scotland and england should not get in the way of the good possible health outcome 
 the hon member make an extremely important point that be something about which i be acutely aware as a borders mp indeed i have a constituent who live in foulden who have be tell that they will need to wait over year to have their cataract see to in scotland meanwhile their neighbour who be register with a gp in england be be treat by nhs england within month my constituent simply do not understand that discrepancy the snp government in edinburgh should be do much more to drive down nhs waiting list and engage with colleague in westminster to ensure that all people across these island get the good possible nhs service 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the adequacy of the level of government spending in scotland to deliver public service 
 the united kingdom government be provide a record settlement of £ per year the large since devolution in fact the uk government be provide the scottish government with over more funding per person than the equivalent uk government spending in england with the generous fiscal framework agreement the scottish government have the certainty and flexibility to manage their budget and deliver high quality public service across scotland 
 the recent programme for government launch by the scottish minister only reveal a tired government too distract by internal squabbling to achieve anything for the people of scotland do the minister agree that the scottish people deserve a change of government in scotland and westminster with a labour government focus on tackle the cost of live and improve living standard for the whole of the uk 
 the snp ’s programme for government be a complete and utter miss opportunity rather than focus on scotland ’s nhs and school and our economy and transport link the snp be too busy plan independence rally scotland do need change and i be confident that in the next general election we will see that change in the election of even more scottish conservative and unionist mps 
 what recent discussion he have hold with cabinet colleague on support the seafood sector in scotland 
 the government be commit to support our seafood sector which be the lifeblood of some of the most remote and fragile community in scotland this past monday i meet with ministerial colleague in the home office to discuss in more detail the comprehensive package of support measure this government have offer to the sector to ease access to labour challenge 
 i thank my hon friend for that response what discussion have he have with the department for energy security and net i see the minister our hon friend   the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie sit next to he on the front bench and the scottish government to ensure that the impact of offshore wind on the fishing industry and coastal community will be adequately address along with the impact of marine protection area 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for his continue energetic and relentless campaigning for his constituency and the fishing sector this government be commit to work with other government departments and the scottish government on our share ambition to protect the marine environment and ensure   that the increase spatial squeeze on our sea be manage effectively however we also note the legitimate concern of the fishing industry and continue to engage with stakeholder other uk government departments and the scottish government through the scottish seafood industry action group i understand that the energy minister my hon friend   the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie be due to meet my hon friend shortly 
 fisherman from portavogie ardglass and kilkeel work hand in hand with fisherman from scotland so whatever benefit the minister can bring to scottish fisherman will benefit the fisherman and fisherwoman of northern ireland have any discussion take place of how scotland and northern ireland can work well together include here at westminster 
 i be happy to work with all colleague across the united kingdom to advance the fishing industry and i be happy to meet the hon member to discuss how we do that together 
 what discussion he have hold with cabinet colleague and the scottish government on the devolution of drug policy to scotland 
 what discussion he have hold with cabinet colleague and the scottish government on the devolution of drug policy to scotland 
 illicit drug destroy life and devastate community the united kingdom government ’s year drug strategy set out ambitious plan back by a record £ over year to tackle the supply of illicit drug and build a world class system of treatment and recovery this be a uk wide strategy and there be no plan to devolve drug policy to the scottish government 
 the lord advocate have announce that she be not go to prosecute drug user for simple possession offence commit within a pilot safe drug consumption facility both the home affairs committee of this house and the scottish affairs committee have recommend that the uk government support such a pilot in glasgow by create a legislative pathway under the misuse of drugs act that would enable such a facility to operate or by devolve the power to the scottish government both cross party committees of this house be very clear that the evidence show that those measure could be lifesave so when will the secretary of state act to save life in scotland by persuade his government to drop their intransigence on this issue 
 it be disappointing that the scottish government be not prepared to work with the uk government on project adder that offer be make with support funding the e in adder be for enforcement i believe the police and the procurator fiscal service should be enforce the law in scotland not decriminalise drug because enforcement help to drive people to health solution 
 the minister do not answer the question so i will try again scotland need a care compassionate human right inform drug policy with public health and the reduction of harm as its principle and the scottish government be ready and willing to work with the uk government to put that progressive policy into practice scottish tory msp miles briggs say on good morning scotland yesterday that he hop the uk government would not move to block this lifesave measure despite the minister ’s cabinet colleague continue to denounce its effectiveness what recent discussion have he have with the scottish government on advance this pilot scheme 
 drug consumption room be not the easy solution hon member may think they be there be no safe way to take illegal drug drug devastate life ruin family and damage community the uk government believe that the police and the procurator fiscal service should fully enforce the law however i say to the hon lady that if the scottish government and the lord advocate decide to proceed with a pilot on dcr the uk government will not intervene 
 the secretary of state will fully realise the challenge it would present for border force if we have differ rule on what drug be lawful and not lawful across the united kingdom therefore will he assure i that he will not look to devolve drug policy and will instead get the scottish government to focus on their own responsibility 
 hear hear 
 labour members always seem to cheer i at this moment in scottish question they be very generous 
 my hon friend make a very good point drug death in scotland be time high than the uk average despite the law be the same across the uk i do not believe drug consumption room be the panacea to those problem but we absolutely must have drug law that work across the whole united kingdom because it be a uk wide problem 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i think we should be clear the lord advocate ’s statement on monday be a game changer it remove of the major obstacle to a pilot drug consumption facility which be design to prevent overdose the secretary of state have be equivocal in his response so far so let i give he another chance to get on the right side of history will he actually say that he will support and work with the scottish government to see this pilot project through 
 i think i have be clear i have be clear that the uk government ’s policy be not to proceed with drug consumption room we believe as i have say that drug devastate family and destroy community i be very clear about those thing but i be also very clear that the lord advocate and the scottish government appear to have achieve a workaround that allow they to have a pilot drug consumption room probably in glasgow and the united kingdom government will not intervene in that so the snp now have no more excuse 
 can i press the secretary of state on this point because of course he have form on intervene in decision of the scottish government he say he will not intervene can we therefore be clear that he will say on behalf of the uk government that he will not use any administrative or legislative mean to frustrate or block this pilot policy by the scottish government 
 hear hear 
 i be very popular today i will be with snp members in particular when i say that the answer be yes 
 what recent discussion he have hold with the scottish government on the impact of increase in the cost of live on people in a the uk and b scotland 
 our government have take assertive action on the cost of living uk wide support for household to help with high energy bill be worth £ or £ per household on average the united kingdom government ’s focus have be on support everyone with the cost of live with specific target support and tailor intervention for the most vulnerable 
 i thank the minister for his answer he will know that like his constituent my constituent in edinburgh west still face the impact of food inflation high energy bill and unfair standing charge for electricity however we also now face the potential bombshell of a council tax hike by the scottish government which will affect household in edinburgh west that will have to pay more than £ a year will the uk government be speak to the scottish government—[interruption if snp members do not mind will the uk government be speak to the scottish government to try to mitigate this and what step do they have in mind to do so 
 i share the hon lady ’s concern about the snp green government ’s bombshell tax plan to hike up the tax burden for many household with people already face pressure on their household budget as she will know along with the record block grant the spring budget provide the scottish government with an extra £ over the next year on top of the £ of additional funding that we provide in the autumn statement of our economic priority of halve inflation and grow the economy be the most effective way of support her constituent 
 what recent assessment he have make of the strength of the union 
 i believe that support for the union be strong the united kingdom be of the most successful political and economic union in the world and the foundation on which all our business and citizen be able to thrive when we work collaboratively we be safe strong and more prosperous 
 while the snp ’s minister whip up grievance politic at independence rally scotland ’s nhs go backwards scotland ’s ferry do not work and scotland ’s economy stagnate do the secretary of state agree that it be about time that the snp stop obsess about another independence referendum and start deliver for the people of scotland 
 i agree with my hon friend and i could not have put it well myself 
 be the truth of the union not that while we see independent norway and independent ireland in budget surplus independent ireland with a surplus this year of € rise to € in the next year the scottish government can not build small hospital on small scottish island be the answer not for scotland to remove the westminster handcuff and to get the independence and budget surplus of norway and ireland so that we can move forward and move away from the brexit of the tories and the labour party 
 they always say independence will sort the problem scotland be not build hospital on the island because the scottish government be squander the most generous settlement they have have since devolution begin 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question i wish to welcome a special guest who be observe our proceeding today the speaker of the jordanian house of representatives mr speaker you be most welcome 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday september 
 i start by pay tribute to the clerk of the house sir john benger and thank he for his many year of distinguished service hon member hear hear 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i will have further such meeting later today 
 the wealth of billionaire have skyrocket over the past decade while average work household in the uk have the low living standard since the 1950s while hard work family be struggle to make end meet the wealthy be play by a different set of rule with report that even member of the house of lords be try to exploit the non dom status loophole to avoid pay their fair share do the prime minister agree that whether it be the wife of the most powerful man in the country or the host of the apprentice no billionaire should qualify for special tax treatment while my constituent face soar level of inequality and poverty 
 the fact tell a very different story from what the hon gentleman say he mention inequality inequality today be low than it be in he mention the number of people in poverty again i be pleased to say that few people be in poverty today than in include many in scotland of course we understand that thing be challenge right now with the cost of living that be why we have put in place record support to help family particularly with their energy bill and particularly for the most vulnerable in our society with record amount of cost of living payment go to million across the country include in scotland show the power of the united kingdom government 
 thank to this conservative government we have the opportunity to be the country in the world to end new case of hiv by that be partially down to our world lead opt out hiv testing programme that have be roll out in very high prevalence area to reach this goal and to make this progress we must roll out opt out testing to other high prevalence area such as the west midland include my constituency of west bromwich east will the prime minister commit to meet i and the incredible terrence higgins trust to hear more about the merit of opt out testing 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue and thank she for her work in this area we remain absolutely committed to end new hiv transmission within england by and i be pleased that she highlight that the provisional datum from nhs england indicate that the opt out testing programme have be highly successful the department of health and social care be currently evaluate the impact of the programme with a view to decide whether it should be expand to additional area and i know ministers will keep she and the house update 
 we come to the leader of the opposition 
 i join the prime minister in his word about the clerk of the house 
 i pay tribute to the police who track down the escaped terror suspect from wandsworth prison last week despite be charge with terrorism and despite be a flight risk he be not hold in a category a prison why not 
 i thank the police and their partner for their effort to find and arrest daniel khalife there be now an ongoing legal process that must be allow to take its course but i would like to reassure the public that while these case be extremely rare the justice secretary have launch an internal investigation about how this could happen as well as an independent investigation of the incident so that we can learn the lesson from this case and ensure that it never happen again 
 the truth be the government be preside over mayhem in the criminal justice system only a few short month ago zara aleena ’s family say that ministers have these be their words—“blood on their hand   after probation failure that lead to her murder so it beggar belief that we be back here once again the chief inspector of prison say that condition in wandsworth be so bad that it should be shut down the chancellor be tell anyone who will listen that he raise concern month ago probation school building and now prison why do the prime minister keep ignore the warning until it be too late 
 the right hon and learn gentleman with his background should know well because of the wide variety and considerable difference in severity of people charge under that act it be not and have never be the policy that they be all hold in category a prison it should not need i to point that out to he give his experience 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about resource i be happy to tell he that over the last few year we have deliver an extra new prison officer staffing level at wandsworth in particular be up by in the past year and because we be boost prison pay we be also improve retention at the same time we be invest £ to improve prison security with new measure such as x ray body scanner if he want to have a truly honest debate about this perhaps he would acknowledge that prison escape be almost time high under the labour government than under the conservatives interruption 
 order i do say this last week and it will continue this week anyone who want to start the session by leave please do so i be happy to help you on your way 
 every week whatever the topic the prime minister paint this picture as if everything be great and fine out there it be so at odd with the live experience in the real world 
 let i turn to another serious security concern some in this house face sanction intimidation and threat from the chinese state when i ask the prime minister on monday whether the foreign secretary raise the specific issue of the allege spy arrest in march when he visit china a few week ago he would only say that he raise that type of activity but avoid specific i ask the prime minister again do the foreign secretary raise this specific case when he visit china yes or no 
 i refer the right hon and learn gentleman to my previous answer where i say clearly that the foreign secretary raise these issue with the chinese foreign minister whom he meet as do i when i have my meeting with premier li over the weekend when it come to china the government have put in place the most robust policy that have ever exist in our country ’s foreign policy it be to protect our country and the value and interest we stand up for it be to align our approach with our close ally include those in the g7 and eye and it be to engage where it make sense either to advance our interest or as i do at the weekend to raise our very significant concern that be the right approach to china it be that be welcome by each and every of our ally i would be interested to know what he think he would do differently 
 that certainly be not a yes what the prime minister say now be totally at odd with the intelligence and security committee of parliament report of july that set out that the government have no clear strategy when it come to china have fail to support the intelligence agency and be leave the uk severely handicap in manage our future security this have be raise time and again but yet again the prime minister fail to heed the warning and be now desperately play catch up will he finally commit to the full audit of uk china relation that so many in this house have so long demand 
 as always the leader of the opposition be just play catch up but he have not catch up with the reality of what be actually happen he talk about the isc report if he actually go through it he would realise that it relate to a period of investigation in and since then we have launch a whole new integrate review refresh of our china strategy which be publish we have put in place a range of new measure include the national security protective authority which be staff out of mi5 and support business and organisation to be alert to the risk from cyber and from china 
 if the right hon and learn gentleman want to talk about foreign policy he should perhaps reflect on his own record this be the man who say he be behind the former labour leader a person who want to abolish the army scrap trident and withdraw from nato it be clear what he do he put his own political interest ahead of britain ’s 
 probation prison school china yet again inaction man fail to heed the warning and then blame everyone else for the consequence on sunday the home secretary celebrate her anniversary in post that be if we overlook the day she miss when she be deem a national security risk in that year people have cross the channel on a small boat and the taxpayer be now spend £ a day on hotel bill the prime minister be fail to stop terrorist stroll out of prison fail to guard britain against hostile actor and he be completely fail to stop the boat how can anyone trust he to protect the country 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about trust and about action but just today this government be take action to reform defective eu law to unlock over home boost our economy support job and ensure that we can realise the aspiration of homeowner he talk about trust he try in this house to talk the talk on house building but at the sign of a cheap political hit what do he do he cave in rather than make the right long term decision for the country he have take the easy way out it be typical of the principle free conviction free type of leadership that he offer flip flopping from be a builder to a blocker the british public can not trust a word he say 
 every week the prime minister come here protest that nothing be his fault and try to convince anyone who be still listen that everything be great the truth be that the floor fall in for million of family because of the government ’s economic mayhem   the classroom ceiling collapse because he cut vital school budget and now the wall of our national security have be breach because they have ignore repeat warning no vote for this shamble no vote for he how much more damage do the british public have to put up with before he finally find the stomach to give they a say 
 we be get on for the british public just in the last week we have announce a new landmark deal for british scientist and attract £ of new investment for our world lead auto industry and wage be now rise at the fast rate on record and where have the right hon and learn gentleman be this week lock away with labour ’s union paymaster promise to give they more power and to scrap the law that protect british family and their access to public service it be clear that it be only the conservatives who be on the side of the hard work british public 
 last week with yorkshire colleague i meet our local integrate care board to discuss plan for improve dentistry provision when surgery suddenly close to nhs patient without notice as in harrogate do very recently an immediate strain be put on local provision will the prime minister look at what can be do in those circumstance to ensure no be leave without access to an nhs dentist 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise that and we will look into the issue   he will be reassure to know that we be invest £ a year in dentistry there be no geographical restriction on which dental practice a patient may attend and practice should keep all their record up to date include whether they be accept new patient typically where a practice end a contract nhs england and icb should work together to ensure that funding be reallocate and patient continue to have access to nhs dental care 
 i call the snp leader 
 as someone who spend more money heat their swimming pool than the total value of the uk state pension the prime minister i think it be safe to say might not be as invest in this topic as some other but let we afford he the opportunity to clear up any confusion will he commit his party the conservative party to maintain the state pension triple lock beyond the next general election yes or no 
 this be the party that introduce the triple lock this be the party that have deliver a £ increase in the state pension since it be also the party that have ensure that there be few pensioner live in poverty today and that this winter pensioner will get an extra £ alongside their winter fuel payment to support they through the challenge time with inflation our track record be clear there be party in this house that have always stand up for our pensioner and that be the conservative party 
 i do not think we hear a yes there mr speaker you will imagine my shock my utter surprise that we appear to have consensus once again   between the conservative party and the labour party on this most important of issue despite the promise that be make to the people of scotland in and despite clear statement from the like of gordon brown that the only way to protect pension be to remain within the uk how hollow those word be now who do the prime minister think will scrap the state pension triple lock his government or the labour party ’s government 
 thank to the action of this government pensioner in scotland be receive record increase in their state pension—£870 this year and extra support with the cost of live this winter this be the government who introduce and remain committed to the triple lock but the hon gentleman raise a good point pensioner in scotland should know that the reason they can rely on the state pension not just today but for year to come be the strength of our union and the strength of our united kingdom government 
 beautiful eastbourne be perhaps well know as a top visitor destination but there be important work be do to put we on the digital map digifest the local event of its kind be come to the welcome building next week it will showcase some pretty stellar local tech talent and open door of opportunity with an ambition to create local job in this sector will the prime minister applaud event organiser chalk eastbourne and switchplane and lie out what the government be do to ensure great britain and eastbourne be of the good place in the world to be involve in this continually groundbreake sector

 it be absolutely right that we do everything we can to speed up cancer diagnosis the pandemic have have a significant impact on cancer recovery as the right hon gentleman will know before the pandemic there be about cancer referral a month but during the pandemic the figure drop to about and now as those referral come through    that be have an impact however we be ensure that there be hundred more oncologist and radiologist work this year than last year and roll out more than community diagnostic centre as the right hon gentleman say early diagnosis be key which be why although there be work to do cancer treatment today be at record level we be make progress and the day backlog be now fall recently the nhs write to all trust streamline our target clinically advise and now all the focus be on meet they as quickly as possible 
 in the bolton police station custody suite be close by the police and crime commissioner and the then chief constable because they have give up on arrest criminal the new chief constable be deliver on the people ’s priority so that emergency call be answer promptly crime be investigate and arrest be make which mean that the newly reopen custody suite be always full will my right hon friend join i in thank greater manchester police do he think that that approach ought to catch on throughout the country

 my hon friend be right to highlight the incredible power of ai to transform not just business and our productivity but public service    such as health and education however we do need guardrail to allow we to make the most of the opportunity of ai and to address risk we have a responsible proportionate regulatory approach that balance risk with innovation and i look forward to work with international partner at our upcoming ai safety summit on how we do that at a global level 
 luton airport be try to expand its capacity massively from passenger per year to a whopping that will blight the life of thousand of resident across hertfordshire and bedfordshire especially those in north st albans who live under the flightpath but it will also fly in the face of advice from the government ’s own climate adviser it have be report that the prime minister be get ready to ignore his climate adviser be that true 
 no but i would say that my approach to reach net be not that require people to give up do the thing that they want to do and enjoy such as fly the right thing to be do be as we be do invest in and fund new technology such as sustainable aviation fuel because that be how we will decarbonise aviation during the transition to net rather than force people to give everything up

 personally i know the stark impact of dementia and the effect that it have on the family of our citizen who live with it it be my honour last week to sponsor alzheimer ’s research uk to highlight the recent progress on a new diagnostic test and new drug that could be available as early as next january i welcome the inclusion of dementia in the government ’s major condition strategy but will my right hon friend ask his secretary of state to convene a dementia medicine taskforce so that we can take advantage of this progress in research will he consider alzheimer ’s research uk ’s request for a dementia champion 
 i start by thank my hon friend for his work in this important area regulator be work closely with industry to evaluate new dementia medicine because of course we want patient to benefit from rapid access to safe and effective treatment we be also strongly committed to funding dementia research include double the amount allocate to £ a year by next year and last year we launch the dame barbara windsor dementia mission back up with new funding which will work with industry to develop biomarker and datum and digital science innovation and to strengthen our trial in dementia i look forward to hear more suggestion from my hon friend   on that 
 in the 1990 under the conservative government people be die because of the length of time they be on nhs waiting list in we be see an increase number of people die while they be on nhs waiting list before get treatment be the prime minister ashame that people be die needlessly on his watch 
 of course the number on waiting list have be impact significantly by the pandemic but that be why we have put record funding in place to help to address that include innovation such as surgical hub same day emergency care virtual ward and such like i would gently point out to the hon gentleman that in england part of the reason that waiting list be not come down as fast we would like be the strike action by doctor something that be support by he and his colleague who have stand on the picket line ensure that patient can not get access to care it be also he and his party who be say that they will    repeal the law we have put in place that will guarantee patient safe access to medical treatment in the event of industrial action if he want to make this issue emotional he should tell people why he believe that patient should be deprive of access to lifesave care because of industrial action 
 what recent assessment he have make of the economic outlook for the west midland 
 we regularly engage with local partner across the west midland to gather insight and intelligence on the economy early this year we initiate the trailblazer devolution deal which include measure to help business thrive i see that just the other week the mayor launch business growth west midlands back with £ in funding for business support 
 i thank the prime minister for that answer and i be glad to hear about the continue growth in the west midland however in lichfield we have a problem with road and footpath closure and we do not know for how long they will go on hs2 be behind these closure and hand do not know what the other be do hs2 be the most dysfunctional organisation i have ever have to deal with will the prime minister in the short term try to restructure hs2 so that it work as a company should in the long term can he save other constituency by stop hs2 at the end of phase 
 i know the frustration that this be cause to my hon friend ’s constituent i be tell that hs2 ltd be prioritise the completion of work that be under way include roadwork in lichfield to keep disruption to a minimum i know that the transport secretary will continue to hold it to account and that the company will keep local community inform about future work 
 uk billpayer be face have to pay an extra £ because of the government ’s failure to agree new offshore wind with russia use energy as a weapon when will the prime minister take energy security seriously and protect we from the whim of fossil fuel autocrat 
 we do take energy security seriously indeed we create a brand new department to focus on energy security so it be a bit rich come from a labour party which want to cut off our access to home grow british oil and gas which would increase our reliance on foreign oil and gas increase our reliance on dictator and increase our exposure to those market as independent report have say it would also be bad for the climate as import fossil fuel come with something like or time the emission labour ’s policy be not just bad for the environment it be bad for our energy security and bad for british job 
 the collapse of a potential rescue deal for wilko this week bring add urgency to the regeneration of our town centre will the prime minister agree to meet i and the leader of torbay council to identify way that with government support and planning reform this can be accelerate 
 investment through both arm of our town fund be part of how we will regenerate and unleash the potential of our town centre i be delighted to hear that that investment include torbay ’s £ town deal and indeed £ for paignton via the future high street fund my hon friend be right about ensure that our planning system be friendly for small business and that be what we be do make it much easy to convert unused shop into cafés restaurant or indeed new home that be an example of how we be help our high street to adapt and thrive 
 the new defence secretary have be quote as say that raac could be present in military building can the prime minister today guarantee the safety of our military personnel and equipment or be this yet another tick time bomb that the government have fail to see come 
 across the public sector departments be make sure they follow the technical guidance to identify and mitigate raac as require as the hon lady have see in the nhs we have move the affected hospital into the new hospital programme more generally this government have invest record sum in defence the £ at the last spending review be the single big uplift in defence spending since the end of the cold war 
 it be vital that we retain recruit and protect our prison officer so will the prime minister agree to prevent any prisoner who assault a prison officer from be release early from jail this simple measure would be very popular with prisoner officer and the public and you never know mr speaker it might even find favour with the party opposite which normally think that the only people who should be in prison be those who misgender people 
 my hon friend be right to say that prisoner who be violent towards people work and live in prison will and should face the full consequence of their action i be pleased that the recent police crime sentencing and courts act increase the maximum penalty to up to year imprisonment for those who assault emergency worker that include prison officer the ministry of justice will continue to press for charge for more serious offence such as abh assault occasion actual bodily harm where appropriate 
 at the weekend global economic power come together to agree a monumental trade agreement they include india the united states and the european union but not the uk do the prime minister choose not to sign up because presumably he think it be a bad deal or be the uk leave out altogether because he have as weak a reputation on the world stage as he do at home 
 i be not sure whether the hon lady be here for the statement on monday but i rather assume she be not what she describe be not a trade deal so she should get her fact right as i explain on monday there be lot of different way in which country will participate in solve international issue at the same summit she mention we announce a record investment in the green climate fund the single big investment by this country to help with international climate finance that be warmly welcome by country at the summit which can see that the uk be take a leadership role and help country to adapt to and mitigate the impact of climate change 
 this week we be hit by the devastating news that all wilko store would be close mean the loss of job bassetlaw and worksop be the home of wilko ’s headquarters and a distribution centre where job be set to go wilko have be mismanage for year in the past decade more than £ have be pay out to shareholder and recently the hq be sell for £ before be lease back will the prime minister reassure my constituent and all those nationally who be affect by the demise of wilko that he and the government will do everything in their power to help support people into job and make sure that their redundancy package and pension be protect and that we will take whatever action be available to we to hold the ownership to account 
 as my hon friend know some of the topic he raise will be commercial matter for the company but i do know that this be a concern time for worker at wilko my right hon friend the business secretary be keep close to development and we have already start support those who have be make redundant and we stand ready to support other to the full of our ability 
 the head of the army general sir patrick sanders have say that the uk must 
 forge an army capable of fight alongside our ally and defeat russia in battle 
 so why be the government still push ahead with further cut of troop to the british army 
 again this be the government who have put a record amount into our armed force £ we remain the large investor in our defence in nato as we see at the nato summit other country look to we for leadership how the armed force allocate that record funding be a matter for the chief to make sure that we have the capability we need to meet the threat of today that be a decision that they will make and we will back they but no can doubt our commitment to fund properly the armed force and ensure that we keep this country safe 
 the prime minister have rightly say that democracy such as the uk not authoritarian regime should lead the fight on global challenge such as development and climate change give that the link between fail regime climate change and the number of asylum seeker be grow will my right hon friend ensure that do   development democratically be a key theme in the white paper on international development will he also visit the westminster foundation for democracy ’s garden of democracy exhibition here in parliament which highlight our promotion of democratic value abroad 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight the exhibition in portcullis house member will have hear his invitation we be consult widely   on the detail of the white paper on international development and what it should say and specifically on the role of democracy in development i encourage all interested organisation and individual to share their idea through the public consultation 
 may i just say thank you to sir john benger in his final prime minister ’s question for his loyal service to the house we do appreciate it thank you sir john 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state if she will make a statement on combine sewer overflow 
 with the usual courtesy i welcome   the hon member for croydon north steve reed   to his place 
 i restate that i have always be clear that the current volume of sewage discharge by water company be totally unacceptable and they must act urgently to improve their performance so that they meet government and public expectation i confirm that the department the environment agency and ofwat have receive the information notice and will of course comply with their request we do not agree with the office for environmental protection ’s assessment of our compliance with the law and the house should note that the oep itself have say 
 we recognise that a great deal be already be do to tackle the issue of untreated sewage discharge and we welcome the intent of government measure such as the plan for water and storm overflow target as well as commitment to increase investment 
 the public be rightly disgust by sewage discharge from storm overflow and so be the government which be why we have take more action than any other government on the issue i remind hon member that the european commission take the labour government to court in for breach of the law subsequently we have start the construction of the thames tideway tunnel which be due to be complete next year it be take a decade to construct 
 however a decade ago the conservative lead government take action and start require the monitoring of storm overflow that work will be complete by the end of this year it be owe to that that the scale of the problem have be unveil i note that in wales which be run by a labour government discharge occurrence be much higher—38 time a year for outflow versus in england 
 the environment act include new power and responsibility which increase understanding last year the department for environment food and rural affairs publish the storm overflow discharge reduction plan that lead to some of the action that we be take 
 we have be repeatedly clear that water company reliance on overflow be unacceptable they must significantly reduce how much sewage they discharge as a priority we be hold they to account and that be also true of our regulator i remind the house that active investigation include an active criminal investigation of water company be under way 
 we welcome the opportunity to set out the scale of the action that the government be take no government in history have do more to tackle the issue last year we launch the storm overflow discharge reduction plan our strict target will lead to the tough ever crackdown on sewage spill and we require water company to deliver the large ever infrastructure programme in water company history 
 i be therefore happy to answer today ’s urgent question but i say yet again that the conservative government be clean up the mess leave by a labour government and we will get on with the job 
 nothing more graphically illustrate year of fail tory government than the tide of raw sewage swill down our river into our lake and wash up on our beach the conservatives cut the environment agency ’s budget in half that lead to drastic cut in monitoring enforcement and prosecution which lead to a drastic increase in illegal discharge trash nature damage tourism and put kid health at risk 
 this government be up to their neck in a sewage crisis of their own making and now in an absolutely unprecedented move the office for environmental protection tell we that the government may have break the law themselves in allow all of this it identify possible failure to comply with environmental law by the secretary of state ’s own department the environment agency and ofwat 
 this government have break the entire regulatory system they enable this scandal but do we hear a word of apology just now no we do not there be only complacency labour want severe and automatic fine for every illegal discharge to pay for a tough regulation and enforcement regime why will the government not do that we want mandatory monitoring of every outlet so that the public know where the discharge be happen why will the government not agree to that 
 can the secretary of state tell we which ministers sign off what the oep call 
 a misinterpretation of the law 
 to allow more frequent sewage discharge without risk of sanction that be a government sanction green light to pollute be it she what action will she now take to put an end to this appalling situation bring the water company to heel and clean up our waterway will she publish the correspondence between the oep and her department if she have nothing to hide 
 finally if the secretary of state ’s department be find to have break the law will she do the right thing and resign the prime minister would not tolerate raw sewage in his private swimming pool so why be he happy to treat the british countryside as an open sewer 
 the risk for the hon gentleman be that he have already soil his own reputation by fail to acknowledge that the investigation that lead to that court case which be refer to in the information notice take place under a labour government on sky last night i believe it be a former labour minister from the department for environment food and rural affairs who basically say that he know sewage discharge be happen and what do the labour government do about it they do not do anything in they set out a consultation basically allow self monitoring by the water company frankly the labour government do sweet fa and we be clean it up now 
 let we have a look at the timescale that have be mention for the situation that lead to the ruling by   the court of justice of the european union thing have not be do in wales where there be a labour   government so there be no change in policy there meanwhile the conservative government have get on with impose unlimited penalty on water company that be why so many power be put into the environment act and regulator be now use they there be hardly any monitoring in thank to labour the scottish national party do not have a leg to stand on either and it be the conservatives who get the monitoring go where labour have weaken monitoring we have increase it 
 on the assertion that the hon gentleman make about budget he should be aware that the purpose of the permit and of the fee that go with the permit be to pay for those regular inspection government funding which we increase last year be use when enforcement action need to be take and that include take company to court that be why there be an active criminal investigation under way now 
 frankly it be the conservatives who get the monitoring go and unveil the scale of this while the labour government look the other way i have no confidence in the plan that labour have put forward we be already get on with many of the action that it talk about and that be why we will sort out the mess that the labour government leave behind 
 can we be more moderate in the language that we use i do not think that it have be appropriate and hopefully we will hear no more of it 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 we all understand the long term challenge of storm water overflow where heavy rainfall be inundate the system over time we will see more storm water tank such as the litre tank that yorkshire water instal in scarborough but there can be no excuse for discharge when the weather be dry some be down to human error or to mechanical failure but many be down just to under capacity in the system as we address the problem can we focus on the dry discharge and ensure that investment go where it will have the most effect where the most concentrated sewage go into waterway 
 my right hon friend be right to point out some of the investment that be under way but the storm overflow discharge reduction plan which i anticipate will receive nearly £ of investment from the water company will prioritise where the big issue be i think that be the right thing to do i be also mindful of other potential environmental responsibility particularly in area of conservation we will continue to ensure that as part of the plan we get on and get into the detail we be already do quite a lot of work with the water company hold they to account and ensure that they get on and spend the money 
 along with the water company of the main source of water pollution in the south west be the minority of livestock farmer who put silage run off from silage and slurry into local waterway yet the government have radically cut the number of inspection and there have be hardly any prosecution why 
 the right hon gentleman be a former minister in defra i be not aware of what inspection be do when he be in office what i do know be that we increase funding for farm inspection my understanding be that there be about last year the approach be target sometimes farmer be not do it intentionally we be help in different way include by increase the funding for slurry infrastructure through the environmental land management scheme we be increase incentive to help with thing such as barrier strip and buffer strip so that stock be keep far away we be actively work with farmer we want they to be able to do the right thing enforcement be undertake he will be aware of a recent case in herefordshire and we will continue to allow our regulator to make decision on criminal investigation independently rather than the government dictate they 
 i welcome the work of my right hon friend the secretary of state in this area despite what have be say today we have to recognise that this be the government to take the bull by the horn and actually do something about illegally discharge sewage which have be happen for decade i have witness it myself i have recently be speak to southern water about a river that my constituency happen to be near although i recognise that southern water be do its very good to do small trial around land drainage frankly it be not do enough quickly enough will the secretary of state outline the power of the environment agency that she be strengthen in order to fine company such as southern water which as my right hon friend   the member for scarborough and whitby sir robert goodwill   say be use opportunity in dry weather to dump sewage where that really should not be happen 
 my right hon friend be right to point out that we have take action and give power to the regulator a very successful prosecution happen i believe southern water be fin £ in a recent case we need to continue to work to get effective action i have complete confidence in the environment agency in get on with the detailed work that we need to do to ensure that the water company stick to the law and we continue to strengthen the law include through the unlimited penalty that this house vote for actually i think it be only government members who go through the division lobby to pass those penalty 
 the secretary of state will know of the concern from her own mailbag as i certainly do from mine my constituent be in touch with i week in week out with concern about the river lune or the beach at fleetwood my constituent and i would like to know what step the secretary of state will take to ensure that when water company break the law they will be punish and bring to justice and will not do it again 
 i be conscious of the breakdown near fleetwood early this year to give some credit to united utilities it work at pace to try to fix the mechanical failure that have happen we now have legislation that allow the environment agency to apply unlimited penalty she will be aware that a live criminal investigation by the environment agency be under way   against water company it will then be for the court to decide the scale of the fine we will continue to ensure that penalty be apply and clear instruction be give we have have discussion with the environment agency we need to get the problem fix but water company should not try to do this on the cheap and think that it be cheap just to pay a penalty than actually sort out the problem 
 i sit on the bill committee for the environment act which create the oep i also sit on the environmental audit committee which interview the now chair of the oep it be government members who introduce the oep enable she to do this work to find out the scale of the problem when the report refer to the government it be not be party political it be refer to all government for the past year or more do my right hon friend agree that we need to keep look at these report rip off the plaster that we have start to rip off and hold to the fire the foot of all the polluter that cause these problem in the place 
 my hon friend be absolutely right when we leave the european union we recognise the need to have suitable scrutiny which be what be in place clearly the oep have not come to a conclusion about break the law that be why it have ask for more information that be its right and entitlement that be what we legislate to allow it to do and we will continue to comply with that meanwhile it will not distract we from get on with our plan for water and hold water company to account 
 water company have dump sewage more than time over the past year now we find out that instead of stand up to the water company the government seem to have be complicit in let they break the law beyond the government ’s own failure have this sewage crisis not be drive by under investment while £ be hand out to shareholder since privatisation be it not time to put an end to this racket and restore water as a proper public service 
 i understand that the hon member come from the very left wing of the labour party and that that will continue to be his mantra i understand however that it be not the position of his party to nationalise water because it recognise that about £ worth of investment have go into water infrastructure since privatisation 
 clearly the scale of what need to be do in the next few year be considerably great than we have see before at the same time back in we have of the big dividend go and the gearing of thames water be change frankly the labour government then do not do anything about it that be key to of the situation that we face at the moment but meanwhile we will continue to get on i be confident that with the thames tideway tunnel opening next year we will have good sewage channelling and will be able to deal with that in london the work continue include thing such as nature base management practice in order to help in yorkshire as well i know that his water company be look into that too 
 july   last year be the hot day on record in the uk temperature exceed ° c in some place during a dry spell yet water company that respond to a bbc investigation admit to so call dry spill of sewage that day the environment secretary be report as say that it do seem extraordinary but that the environment agency be the regulator give that it be the hot day when people be inadvertently bath in sewage why do the environment secretary wash her hand of it 
 i be conscious of the investigation that the bbc undertake the environment agency and the department do not agree with its assessment of the datum that do not mean of course that there have not be sewage spill on dry day that be why it be part of the investigation it be part of fix the problem and we will continue to do that 
 the secretary of state know gill rider from history the chair of pennon group which own south west water i have hear what the secretary of state have say but surely the time have come to get these company and their leadership under control south west water be a disgrace it be leak it be treat its customer with utter contempt secretary of state please sit on these company and make they do the job that they be mean to which be to stop this now 
 unlimited penalty be available to the environment agency and there be already a criminal investigation under way i know my hon friend have secure a westminster hall debate next week to discuss it in further detail and my hon friend the water minister will reply substantially to the many detailed point that i be sure he will raise 
 it be my constituent mr latimer who be responsible for the law change state that sewage should only be discharge during exceptional circumstance he know as we all know that it be this government who be actively enable the water company and regulator to get away with dumping sewage into our river and our ocean why will the secretary of state not admit that under this government sewage dumping be no long the exception but the rule 
 because the hon lady ’s assertion be simply not true 
 rather than just scaremongere which be what we be hear again from the opposition could we have a focus please on the quality of our water in leigh on sea and southend west the quality of our water have go up from in to and the vast majority of our beach be rat good or excellent will my right hon friend applaud the work of local group the bluetits chill swimmers run by daniella bee and philip miller of adventure island who be assist i in have regular sewage summit with anglian water we have extract a promise from anglian water to eliminate of use of our combine storm overflow year ahead of the government ’s target be this local action not the sort of thing we should be do not just scaremongere 
 my hon friend be right to praise the activity happen in her constituency and the people of southend should be congratulate on elect she to this house because she be an avid campaigner for they she recommend her part of the world for swim due to the designate beach and i could do the same in my own constituency i remind the house that when the conservatives come in to power in only half our swimming beach and designate bathing water be deem excellent thank to whatever happen under labour now it be more than in which show the progress we have make right around the country 
 i ask the secretary of state this pertinent question what do she say to the senior executive at yorkshire water who when i complain about the quality of the water in some of the river in yorkshire say mr sheerman do n’t you realise that there be no river in our country that be fit to swim in be it not the truth that the secretary of state ’s pathetic performance today and her use of the most vulgar language i have hear in this chamber in all my year in this house show that she be out of her depth that she be incompetent and that she should resign immediately 
 i look forward to the election in huddersfield the hon gentleman should look at some of his own speech i do not know on what basis he have make that assertion quote the chief executive of yorkshire water but that be not the case—[interruption the hon gentleman can always contact i directly to give i the quotation and the source of the quotation i look forward to receive it and i will take the water company ’s chief executive to task if that be truly what she say 
 despite all we have hear from labour be it not the reality that in government labour do absolutely nothing on this issue with no monitoring in place and that it be this government as the oep recognise who be sort the problem through the plan for water through record investment and through monitoring improve water in north west norfolk and across the country 
 my hon friend be absolutely right he have a coastal constituency as well and will know the continue work to improve the quality of our designate bathing water and our water more broadly there have be more stringent standard apply over the last decade we continue to work to try to improve that and we will continue to get on with the job 
 the secretary of state seem to have a weird amnesia about the past decade or so so that there be a big leap from labour be in government to she suddenly be in front of we today i hope she do remember the many time whether in the environmental audit committee the environment food and rural affairs committee or the environment bill committee that i ask she about make sure the office for environmental protection really have tooth be independent and be respect by government i be concerned that there be already sign that the government be try to undermine the work of the oep will she assure we that she will respect the conclusion that it come to and act accordingly 
 i will say that we set up the oep we will comply with the information notice it have request and then we will see where its decision go from that it be important that that institution continue to have the freedom we give it we will continue to respect that and to comply with its notice as set out under the statute 
 the water minister and i regularly visit a beach that have be subject to several environmental spill this august when i check at the site it be a storm overflow and not a combine sewage outlet give that there be not enough rainfall to constitute an exceptional amount can the secretary of state advise i why the environment agency have not take enforcement action against south west water and all the other water company that be spill sewage when there be no exceptional circumstance 
 i understand from my hon friend the water minister that the environment agency be currently investigate the source of the pollution to help with its investigation 
 the right hon lady ’s department issue a statement say that it do not 
 agree with the oep ’s initial interpretation 
 but will 
 continue to work constructively with the oep on this issue 
 that seem like a contradiction to i how do the secretary of state plan to work constructively with the oep when her department ’s statement demonstrate a complete disregard for environmental law 
 the hon lady be incorrect we absolutely respect the law we introduce the environment act we can disagree with initial assertion but we will continue to ensure that we provide the information the oep have request 
 i thank the secretary of state for the renew determination to bring about improvement it be clear that we need it when we vote on this issue in the house we be give assurance that these incident would not take place it be clear that while official may not agree with this investigation there be still a real cause for concern how do the secretary of state intend to alleviate those concern and more importantly ensure that sewage release be regulate and safe i make this suggestion very respectfully stop the dividend to the chief executive and director would be a method to encourage improvement by the water company who seem reluctant to make they 
 i be conscious that the hon gentleman be a member for a northern ireland constituency the oep ’s remit extend to northern ireland although not to the welsh labour government or the scottish snp government investigation can be undertake that be what we legislate for in this house and unlimited penalty can be apply that be true in england we will continue to make sure that we do what we can not only to reduce these challenge but to fix the long term issue we know that in london for example the thames tideway tunnel have take a decade that be the scale of the issue the fact that we know about the scale of the issue right now be due to the conservative government have take action while the labour government look the other way 
 the last time i ask about the dumping of sewage in our river in this chamber the prime minister agree with i that it be absolutely unacceptable however the oep ’s investigation be a scandalous revelation that show the entire water and regulatory system be break what do the secretary of state think should happen to company regulatory body and government departments that knowingly break the law 
 we set up the oep and it have the power thank to this conservative government to get on with the role as it see fit it be do so it have start the investigation and ask for more information and we will comply with that i say to the hon lady as i say at the start of my response to the urgent question that this be completely unacceptable by the water company that be why we be take action and get on with the job we do not need lesson from labour who look away and do nothing they be the people who be take to court by the european commission for failure failure failure thank to labour 
 on a point of order mr deputy speaker i know that the secretary of state be under great pressure today she seem to be out of her depth in quite shallow water but she misquote i in a question i ask a few moment ago i say a senior executive of yorkshire water i do not say the chief executive of yorkshire water that be on the record and hansard will show it i want an apology from the secretary of state 
 that stand on the record interruption secretary of state do you wish to respond 
 far to that point of order mr deputy speaker i think that the hon gentleman say the chief executive i hear now that he say a senior executive but the point still stand provide the quotation provide the source and i will take it up with that executive and the chief executive of yorkshire water because frankly that be not acceptable 
 thank you very much secretary of state for respond to the urgent question we will now move on 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to provide for a national register of asbestos present in non domestic premise and of the condition of that asbestos and for connected purpose 
 may i begin by thank mesothelioma uk for all the fantastic work it do to support those live with the asbestos relate cancer as well as provide access to mesothelioma clinical nurse specialist across the uk that charity offer a range of support service and dedicated research to help patient live well and long life i find its work invaluable a few year ago in this place when my hon friend   the member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch   and i be try to get the government into the sensible and correct place on the issue of compensation 
 i represent an area with many former steelworker power station worker docker and a few miner so respiratory industrial disease be an issue that i know well include from my close family increasingly the disease be not restrict to role that involve directly instal material with asbestos it also affect those who work in building with asbestos such as teacher indeed teacher be more likely to die from mesothelioma than the general public sadly i have hear example of that from my constituent a government survey find that of participate school have asbestos on their estate and although most have a plan for deal with it that figure speak for itself 
 i thank in particular my hon friend   the member for loughborough jane hunt who apart from be an excellent champion for her constituent have do incredible work lead up to this minute rule motion include her recent westminster hall debate on asbestos in the workplace 
 as most people will be aware asbestos be a naturally occur mineral that be use extensively in building in the uk and around the world between the 1950 and 1980 it can be find in ceiling tile pipe insulation flooring textured paint and boiler and it be often mix with other material which make determine its presence even more complex in fact asbestos be of material consider so hazardous that they require their own regulation the other be radiation and lead lead and radiation be tightly control and although there have be a lot of work over the year to tighten regulation on asbestos and indeed to ban it many would say that it remain the poor relation of the material in public policy term 
 the scale of the problem can not be underestimate the health and safety executive have say that between and building in the uk contain asbestos other estimate suggest tonne of asbestos be spread across building in this country asbestos be of course the single great cause of work relate death in the uk hse estimate that more than people die from asbestos relate cancer each year of whom half die from mesothelioma 
 government of both side have seek to address that issue we have have ban on import use manufacture and supply the control of asbestos regulations   provide a framework for work with asbestos in non domestic premise the regulation be welcome as they place a requirement on a duty holder to assess the presence condition and exposure risk of asbestos in non domestic premise the duty holder be require to maintain an up to date register and share it with anyone who may be at risk of exposure or of disturb asbestos contain material 
 however as welcome as those regulation and other intervention may be there remain too many new mesothelioma case in the uk and there be a clear trend of rise case among those who have work in building with asbestos rather than among those who work directly with asbestos product and material a report by alpha tracker on the condition of asbestos in school hospital and home find that more than half of sample find to contain the material be already damage that of asbestos contain material in hospital and healthcare setting have high damage and that of asbestos in school be in poor condition we must therefore ask if the current approach be work and sufficient 
 the uk national asbestos register a new social enterprise establish to help management and duty holder to manage the material have identify common failing in the current system there be communication failure contractor rarely see an asbestos register or record be mislay or difficult to access a contractor undertake what seem like minor work for example may be unaware there be acm in that building and that they might disturb they 
 secondly information be provide in a format that be difficult to understand poorly arrange or too lengthy mean that document be often incomprehensible thirdly register be not update as work be undertake mean that information be out of date or the information be hold on different database as contractor change information can be lose
