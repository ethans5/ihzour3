boost british export especially for our small business be vital to create job and economic growth and it absolutely must be a strategic priority for the government this secondary legislation be a welcome step forward give uk export finance the opportunity to grow its portfolio of project to help deliver for business across the country 
 this measure will be very important to my constituent as wokingham be of the good place in the country to do business and the government should continue to help unlock our growth potential we rank of local authority for competitiveness between and the gross value add per fill job vacancy be which be significantly fast than the rest of berkshire and the south east 
 my constituency have great example of where government support programme have deliver success such as m2 m pharmaceuticals which win a king ’s award for enterprise this year tomorrow i be visit intersurgical another great success story for wokingham business which design manufacture and supply medical device have grow from people in to upwards of employee worldwide it now export its product globally however i be sure it be deeply concerned about the budget ’s impact on maintain its profitability i look forward to hear from the company what more the government need to do to support its success 
 there be certainly more that should be do to boost british exporter and improve britain ’s trade policy to start the government urgently need to fix our break relation with the eu to foster close co operation with our large trading partner we must cut vast swathe of red tape and reduce the trade barrier that hold back our business for example the government should urgently negotiate a veterinary and plant health agreement with the eu to reverse the decline in british agrifood export since secure bespoke mutual recognition agreement for britain ’s engineer architect lawyer and accountant would also help british business across a variety of sector to secure great export opportunity the trade association i have meet make thing overtly clear the impact of brexit be hurt their profit and we need to fix this mess 
 on trade i hope this government do not follow the conservative party ’s approach of negotiate trade deal in desperation which lead to weak outcome as we can see from the result for instance the conservatives fail to guarantee british standard on animal welfare and environmental protection in agreement such as the australia trade deal at an especially difficult time for the agriculture sector even a tory former secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs describe that agreement as 
 not actually a very good deal”.—[official report   november vol c. 
 parliament never get a proper say on our trade deal eliminate the opportunity to stop the government barrel ahead with deal that be deeply unpopular 
 i respect the minister greatly but there be a lot to get right and to fix from the previous government will he meet i and representative from wokingham business such as xpert which be struggle to secure uk export finance to hear what they need from his department will he set out to the house the specific form of scrutiny we will get when the government conclude the trade deal will his department renegotiate the australia and new zealand trade agreement 
 these order be technical in nature and relate to the capacity of uk export finance which be the operate name of the export credits guarantee department the uk ’s export credit agency to support current and prospective exporter as hon and right hon member will know uk export finance have a mandate to support uk exporter with finance and insurance help they to compete internationally uk export finance or ukef for short be establish more than year ago and be the world ’s old export credit agency its support have prove crucial to british exporter throughout its existence 
 ukef help exporter to win international contract to fulfil export order to create job and to get pay last year it provide £ in finance to support uk exporter and support up to job around the uk as a result some of the business it support last year be small and medium sized enterprise ukef provide its finance at no net cost to the taxpayer in fact it generate a return for the exchequer with £ return to the treasury over the last year 
 the export and investment guarantees act as amend in confer power on the secretary of state to provide finance that be conducive to export and to provide insurance in connection with overseas investment those power be exercise and perform through ukef subject to some limited exception section 6(1 of the act impose a limit on the aggregate amount of financial commitment that can be make under those power in other word the total size of ukef ’s financial portfolio at present the limit stand at £ express in special drawing right special drawing right be an accounting unit for international transaction and be create by the international monetary fund their value be base on a grouping of major currency include pound sterling the us dollar and the euro the sum equate to approximately £ at today ’s exchange rate 
 why be we seek an increase well the current limit have be in place since and uk export finance ’s portfolio size be now draw close to it be ukef to reach its limit it would have to pause its vital financing activity which in turn would cut off its support to prospective exporter i should note that in practice the size of ukef ’s portfolio be subject to a limit set by the treasury this limit call the maximum commitment limit must be low than the statutory limit set out in legislation i be therefore propose these statutory instrument to increase the commitment limit in section 6(1 and to avoid the future risk of have to turn away application for ukef support 
 section of the act enable the secretary of state by order to far increase the limit by up to £ the power to make such an order may be exercise on up to occasion and have not be use before i be therefore seek approval of these order together which would allow we to increase ukef ’s statutory commitment limit by £ per order for a total of £ inflation since the limit be last amend and the increase transaction size that the department be support mean that the department be now approach that legal limit 
 lay these si together be about future proof ukef and give it sufficient legal capacity to provide certainty for its customer again it be a decision for treasury ministers to then confirm the actual commitment limit under which the department operate after they have come into force the instrument take together will increase the commitment limit to special drawing right which convert to around £ pound at today ’s exchange rate 
 uk export finance be deliver an ambitious year business plan that align with this government ’s mission support growth and prosperity for uk exporter and their community across the country and do so at no net cost to the taxpayer but its ability to do so will be at risk without the additional legal headroom that these instrument provide these change will therefore allow uk export finance to continue meet its mandate in support export and drive growth something that i be sure those in all part of the house will join i in welcoming i commend these order to the house

 the minister for women and equalities be ask 
 if she will make an assessment of the effectiveness of primary prevention measure in school in tackle violence against woman and girl 
 education have a role to play in the prevention of violence against woman and girl and it be essential to the government ’s safe street mission we be review the relationship sex and health education guidance to ensure that it enable school to tackle harmful behaviour because we be determined to ensure that misogyny be stamp out and not allow to proliferate in school 
 we know that sexual violence be a critical problem in our school in in response to ofsted ’s rapid review of girl and of boy say that sexist name be use sometimes or a lot harassment of this kind have become commonplace in educational setting and harmful sexual practice be become a risk will the minister meet i and white ribbon uk to discuss how primary prevention measure can be introduce into school curriculum to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 i would be more than happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that issue far she bring real expertise from her background in education and it be essential that we do more to tackle the behaviour that she have identify i welcome the work of white ribbon and i hope other member will be able to support that work later this month 
 when it come to young boy and young girl in school and when it come to bullying and sometimes thing that happen at home the relationship between the teacher or classroom assistant and the pupil be very important make it possible to identify problem that may arise at home and then roll over into school can the minister give we some idea of what be be do to improve that relationship so that child who fall by the wayside can be save 
 the hon gentleman have raise an important issue it be crucial for teacher and school staff to have what they need in order to tackle harmful behaviour and language in school sadly sometimes the very staff he talk about be on the receive end of such attitude and behaviour which be completely unacceptable as education secretary i will do all i can to ensure that school staff and teacher in england have the support they need in tackle behaviour of this kind 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 this government be commit to use all the lever at our disposal to deliver our mission to halve violence against woman and girl we have already announce our intention to embed specialist domestic abuse adviser in control room launch pilot for the new domestic abuse protection order and implement a duty on employer to anticipate occasion when sexual harassment may occur and take responsible step to prevent it 
 i be very pleased to hear that from the minister i be proud that in stevenage independent domestic violence advocate and independent sexual violence advocate work for survivors against domestic abuse also know as sada do brilliant but challenging work support those who be at risk and suffering as a result of domestic or sexual abuse throughout hertfordshire there be no doubt that idva and isva be a key part of domestic abuse provision across the country so will the minister assure i that the government will continue to support they in the vital work that they do 
 have do that work myself i be more than happy to champion and praise the work of idva and isva as my hon friend might imagine we will use every tool available to we include those vital role to target perpetrator and address the root cause of abuse and violence 
 when i speak to the chief constable of norfolk constabulary recently he tell i that if a suspect be arrest and charge today with a serious sexual offence such as rape the crown court trial could commence in the spring of which be more than a year away that be totally unacceptable what can the minister do to reassure woman in norfolk who be wait for their case to be hear 
 it be indeed totally unacceptable and it be i be afraid a legacy of a totally fail justice system we know that owe to the complexity of the system rape victim be often leave to wait disproportionately long than other who be already wait too long in our manifesto we commit ourselves to fast track rape case we be carefully consider the good way to do that along with colleague at the ministry of justice who lead on this work and we will announce our plan in due course 
 i recently join a reclaim the night march in greenhead park in my constituency the of these march take place in leeds in the 1970 and they be still important because a woman be kill every day in the uk what action be we take to prioritise reduce the level of violence against woman and girl and also to create safe environment at night 
 i thank my hon friend for question the march be in and frankly progress have be too slow if we still need to march we will use a cross government transformative approach to halve violence against woman and girl and that will be underpin by a new violence against woman and girl strategy to be publish next year that will include drastically improve the police and criminal justice response prevention and education be also absolutely fundamental to our approach and we will work across key department include the department for education to tackle the root cause of these crime 
 pupil in my constituency be benefit from pioneer workshop that be design to increase awareness of sexual violence and misogyny through a project call do n’t steal my future do the minister agree that raise awareness of sexual violence in an age appropriate way be vital to keep young people safe if so will she come with i to meet the team at the rape and sexual abuse support centre north wales 
 the simple answer be yes i do agree as somebody who have write and deliver such programme in school i know that brilliant work be go on across the country in local authority multi academy trust and more widely with voluntary sector organisation do a lot of the work i would be glad to explore with official the good way to learn from those who work with child and young people because we have to work out what will work in our school and then make sure that we put it out everywhere 
 in the last parliament we back benchers try and fail several time to make misogyny a hate crime legislation can be a powerful game changer be it not time we make misogyny a hate crime 
 the government be absolutely committed to tackle misogyny both before it start and when it exist hate crime review be be undertake and i be more than happy to meet the hon lady i have meet she many time to discuss this subject 
 woman flee domestic violence be vulnerable and in desperate need of support and help but often local authority which be suppose to help do not enable woman to get a   place to live or receive their benefit in the last parliament we try to make sure that woman in such circumstance could have a relative claim their benefit what action will the minister take to ensure that those woman be give the support that they need in their desperate time 
 i could not agree more with the hon gentleman and i remember his valiant effort during the passage of the domestic abuse act the government have commit to ensure that local connection do not apply in case such as those he talk about with regard to benefit the department for work and pensions be very much part of the mission group on violence against woman and girl and i will absolutely raise his point we will seek to make sure that when and wherever people crop up with these issue their local authority and local system be in place 
 in the month to july violence against woman and girl offence be record in northern ireland will the minister outline what discussion she have have with the police service of northern ireland about get strong conviction rate for such incident of violence 
 i have speak to the chief constable of the psni within the last week and he have request that we go over to northern ireland that trip be plan for early in the new year and i would very much welcome work with colleague in this house and the devolved government to make sure that we be all work together on this issue 
 a constituent of mine come to see i in distress a couple of week ago have be a victim of rape in she have now be give a date in for her case to be hear i be sure the whole house will agree with i that that be completely unacceptable she have be deny access to mental health support during this time because it may impact her defence what be the minister ’s thought on that matter 
 i would like to say very clearly from the dispatch box that it be a total myth that people can not access mental health support when await trial it be something that have creep in over the year and i would like it to be stamp out for good across all agency i run a rape crisis service that definitely serve people who be await trial if i be the member of parliament represent the hon gentleman ’s constituent i would push back on that assertion and say that it be certainly not the policy 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 datum show we that woman of colour face disproportionate rate of homicide and that adult of black black british or mixed ethnicity be more likely to experience sexual assault than those of white asian or other ethnicity these challenge be just as common when it come to domestic abuse those people be less likely to access support service than white woman we desperately need strong action to support these vulnerable woman   so can the minister tell i how the government will ensure that we help more woman from ethnic minority background to get the support that they need and end the injustice that they face 
 i could not agree more with the hon lady as she might imagine consider the seat that i represent we need a strong by and for service in our country we need to ensure that the geographical location of someone in the country do not matter and that specialist service be available for black and minority ethnic woman and other marginalised group for example disabled victim of domestic abuse or victim of domestic abuse in the armed force there need to be a specialist approach for specialist group and we will be make sure that that be part of our violence against woman and girl strategy 
 what step she be take to help end discrimination against disabled people 
 what step she be take to help end discrimination against disabled people 
 our manifesto commit we to champion the right of and work with disabled people put their view and voice at the heart of all we do we want a more inclusive society remove the unnecessary barrier that have too often hold disabled people back 
 i want to draw the minister ’s attention to the fact that almost in people in my constituency be class as disabled and after year of a conservative government who slash public service there be still far too many people in south derbyshire who report that their daily activity be significantly limit by their condition what more can this government do in my constituency to support disabled people in access care as well as career and educational opportunity 
 my hon friend in describe her constituency speak for the whole country disabled people and people with health impairment be very diverse and we want to promote diverse specialist initiative to support people to stay in work to get back into work if they have lose their job and to progress in work include by join up local employment and help support we need to remove barrier to access service as well 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 i be sure that many of we will welcome commitment from the government to remove barrier to work for disabled people but disability charity have outline concern about the government ’s plan for work capability assessment reform and change to personal independence payment and the access to work scheme will the minister please commit to work with disability charity to ensure that any change to those scheme   include any propose by the previous government be make alongside consultation with the people those policy will affect 
 i can give my hon friend that assurance as i have say we be commit to put the view and voice of disabled people at the heart of everything we do and in look at these issue to consult properly and amply with disabled people and with their organisation 
 nowhere be disabled people more discriminated against than on britain ’s railway the previous government have an access for all scheme that would allow disabled people to get to platform that be otherwise inaccessible this have be put on hold by the new government can the minister tell i what discussion he have have with his colleague in the department for transport and when we might see station such as whitchurch make accessible to people who can not manage step 
 i be afraid that i can not talk about the situation at whitchurch but the hon lady speak for many on this as there have be some high profile and troubling instance of problem in this area over recent month this be a good example of the kind of issue where as minister we need to be talk across government departments and make sure that barrier like the she have describe be remove we be determined to do that 
 young woman and girl in my constituency travel abroad to stay with relative sometimes for several week or month and they get into difficulty or be impact by safeguard issue will the secretary of state confirm what support be available to help repatriate such girl who have dual nationality and have in many instance have false allegation make against they by perpetrator who do not want they to leave the country 
 that question be perhaps more relevant to the previous group of question but i be very happy to make sure that we write to the hon gentleman to set out the support that be available 
 what step the government be take to support woman back into work 
 we be lay the foundation for all employer to create condition that enable woman to return to work and to thrive in their career as part of our effort to make work pay we will improve access to flexible working strengthen workplace protection for new mother and review the parental leave system 
 parent of pre school child in south devon be find it all but impossible to find nursery or pre school place due to the lack of availability and the financial pressure that such establishment be under this be make it extremely difficult for parent often mother who would like to return to work after have child how will the department for education   and the office for equality and opportunity work together to increase the number of nursery and provide they with adequate funding to ensure that woman be provide with all the support they need to return to work 
 the hon lady be right to identify that accessible and affordable childcare be essential for make sure that woman in particular be able to work to work the hour that suit they and to progress in their career that be why we have confirm that we will be expand government fund childcare with an initial £ as part of that programme we will be roll out new or expand primary base nursery application be open and school be encourage to participate 
 the all party parliamentary group on domestic violence and abuse be reconstitute this week as its chair i be pleased to report that at our meeting we hear from survivor and organisation that support survivor in the workplace 
 the minister will be aware that the gender pay gap persist do she agree that more could be do to support survivor in the workplace such as by have domestic abuse policy in every workplace and by consider pay leave and flexible working so that survivor can get the life change support they need and can stay in work 
 i agree with the hon lady before i come to this place i run a refuge for woman and child affect by domestic violence during that time i see some good example of employer support woman who be go through a very difficult time in their life there be more that we can ask of employer and there be more that we as a government be commit to achieve especially through the gender pay gap action plan we will be take forward and through halve violence against woman and girl 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be work woman who will pay the price for labour ’s budget of broken promise with the increase to employer national insurance contribution make work people bad off and affect childcare setting the joseph rowntree foundation have say that single parent families—80 of they be head by woman will on average be £ bad off by october have the minister assess what additional negative impact there will be on the labour market of the hidden scrapping of the child benefit change for single parent household this have be describe by martin lewis as an unfair penalty to single parent household 
 we be commit to transform the life of woman across our country and that apply to single parent too i be lead the child poverty taskforce with my right hon friend the secretary of state for work and pension unlike the last government we be commit to drive down the number of child grow up in poverty the last government leave a shocking record of rise level of child poverty and this government will turn it around 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i draw the house ’s attention to islamophobia awareness month no in our country should be target because of their faith or race and british muslims be a crucial part of britain ’s history and society 
 more widely the office for equality and opportunity be already make great stride the new employment rights bill will legislate for a strong duty to prevent sexual harassment and action plan will cover the gender pay gap and menopause issue we will open a consultation on extend pay gap reporting and equal pay right to ethnic minority and disabled people

 the prime minister can plant as many question as he like with his back benchers but at the end of the day i be the he have to face at the dispatch box i welcome he back from his trip to azerbaijan where he have unilaterally make commitment that will make life more expensive for everyone back home speak of make life—[interruption 
 order somebody be suggest read i think you will notice that the prime minister also read so please get your act together 
 i can pre prepare my question but the prime minister need to answer from his mind he have make life more expensive with his unilateral   commitment but speak of make life more expensive will the prime minister confirm that he will keep the cap on council tax 
 the right hon lady talk of the trip to cop i be very proud of the fact that we be restore leadership on climate to the uk because that will be measure in low bill energy independence and the job of the future she may have miss this but on monday i be very pleased to announce a huge order into job in hull for blade for offshore wind if she be oppose to that sort of action she should go to hull and say so on the question of council she know what the arrangement be 
 i think the house will have hear that the prime minister could neither confirm nor deny whether the cap on council tax be be raise so i will ask he this how much extra do he expect local authority will have to raise to cover the social care funding gap create by the chancellor ’s budget and increase in employer ni he tell   the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine   just now that he be cover social care how much extra do he expect local authority to raise 
 this knockabout be all very well but not actually listen to what i say minute ago be a bit of a fundamental failure of the leader of the opposition i just say £ and i repeat it £ 
 the prime minister have repeat that number because he have probably not listen to the labour run local government association which say that with no separate funding for the chancellor ’s budget announcement care provider would likely see increased cost which will cost council more all of the £ in grant increase he be give will not cover what be require for adult social care it be clear that the government have not think through the impact of the budget and this be the problem with have a copy and paste chancellor do they not realise that care home gp surgery child ’s nursery hospice and even charity have to pay employer ni 
 we have put more money into local authority than the conservatives do in year they leave they in an absolutely catastrophic state we have produce a budget that do not increase tax on work people nothing in the payslip and be invest in our nhs invest in our school so every child can go as far as their talent will take they and invest in the house of the future if she be against those thing she should say so 
 i be not against any of those things—[hon member ah of course not none of we be against any of those thing but the prime minister have confirm that he do not know what be go on he probably do not realise that on monday the ministry of housing communities and local government reveal that council will need to find an additional £ in council tax next year that be a lot more than £ i know he have be away but do the deputy prime minister who run that department make he aware of their £ black hole 
 let i get this straight the leader of the opposition do not want any of the measure in the budget but she want all the benefit the magic money tree be back after week in office the conservatives have learn absolutely nothing we have put forward a budget that take the difficult decision fix the £ black hole that they leave and invest in the future of our country they say that they want all that but they do not know how they will pay for it same old tories 
 even the prime minister must admit that labour fiddle the fiscal rule the office for budget responsibility have say that it do not recognise where the additional growth will come from the fact be that the rise in employer national insurance will be a disaster for small business around the country let i tell you about kelly mr speaker for over year kelly have run an after school club business support child and family in her borough in her national insurance cost be about £ in april that will rise to £ that be a increase in cost from the budget alone if kelly ’s small business go under what be the prime minister ’s message to she and the family it support 
 i would say this to kelly we inherit a very badly damage economy and a £ black hole and we be not prepared to continue with the fiction we stabilised—[interruption 
 order ms lopez i be sure i can expect well from you as a parliamentary private secretary 
 i would say to kelly that we be fix the mess that we be leave and be invest in the future of our country i would also say to she that the leader of the opposition in week want all the benefit from the budget but have no way of say how she will pay for they the same old mistake over and over again 
 the prime minister have nothing to offer but platitude the fact be that the government do not know what they be do their ideological budget be design to milk the private sector and hope that nobody would notice now his cabinet ministers be all queue up for public sector bail out for his tax mess if he be go to bail out the public sector perhaps he can tell we this do he think it appropriate to approve as the ministry of housing communities and local government have do a day week for council that be not flexible working but part time work for full time pay 
 question base on what we be actually do be usually well than make up fantasy question what do the tories deliver in year low growth a stagnant economy a disastrous mini budget and a £ black hole and now the leader of the opposition want to give i advice on run the economy i do not want to be rude but no thank you very much 
 town like southport need investment and support after year of decline under the conservative party will   the prime minister confirm that his budget will provide that much need investment for town like mine and that unlike under the previous government my local authority and the public service that my town rely on will finally be properly support 
 may i begin by pay tribute to my hon friend and his southport constituent they have show extraordinary courage and resilience as they try to rebuild from the devastating tragedy and loss of early this year we will ensure that the people of southport be support now and in the year to come the budget be design to fix the crucial service that his constituent rely on include through £ of new funding for local government and investment in safe street and in the future of our nhs that be the direction in which we be take the country 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 when it come to fix the crisis in the nhs that he have inherit the prime minister have rightly recognise the need to improve access to gps but as be the case for my hon friend   the member for edinburgh west christine jardine gps in my constituency be write to tell i how worried they be about the national insurance hike ’s impact on patient care i listen very carefully to what the prime minister say to my hon friend but i hope he will think again will he at least exempt gps community pharmacist and other health and care provider from that tax rise 
 i hear the point that the right hon gentleman make and i understand the concern we have make a huge investment in our nhs the big ever investment in our nhs for many many year and certainly almost all the people work in the nhs be very pleased to see that investment in they and in their service on the question of gps we will ensure that they have the resource they need and the funding arrangement will be set out in the usual way later this year 
 i have to say i think patient gps and other listen to that answer will want more reassurance and will want it much more quickly 
 turn to the war in ukraine a senior adviser to president elect trump donald trump junior have share a post on instagram declare that soon within the next few week president zelensky will lose his allowance if the trump administration do withdraw support from our brave ukrainian ally will the uk and europe step up to fill the gap will the prime minister seize frozen russian asset not just the interest but the asset underlie it so that we can fund a huge boost to the ukrainian force in their fight against putin ’s war machine 
 as the right hon gentleman know we have be resolute and strong in our support for ukraine in the face of russian aggression as he also know in recent week i have be speak with other leader about how we put ukraine in the good and strong possible position at this time i will continue those discussion 
 child poverty be a national scandal in st helens north it increase by over under the previous government do the prime minister agree that we need to address this scandal ideally cross party if so do he share my concern that the conservatives have oppose action that we be take with the budget employment right housing and more not to mention their leader ’s comment on maternity pay which suggest they just do not get what work family and their child need 
 my hon friend be absolutely right under the conservative party we see child poverty increase by this be a budget that not only invest in our nhs and our school but ensure that work people will not face a penny extra in their payslip or at the petrol pump that be because when it come to the tough decision on tax we have not touch national insurance income tax or vat just as we promise on work people we also give of the low pay a pay rise something that the conservative party seem to be oppose 
 lebanon be in crisis and my constituent catherine flanagan be in despair her year old son david nahle have be out of her care for the past year the belfast high court have indicate that he should be return to his mother and have issue a bench warrant for the arrest of his father however when my constituent flee domestic violence in beirut she get no help or assistance from the uk embassy and when she have seek assistance from the foreign and commonwealth office to be reunite with her son to see her son again and for this british citizen to come back to the uk she have not receive the assistance that she or i and our community expect she should will the prime minister engage with this issue and at the very least ask the foreign secretary to assist my constituent in her earnest desire to see her year old son again 
 i thank the right hon member for raise this case and for all he be do on behalf of catherine and david i hope they get some comfort from know that they have an mp work so hard on their behalf it be a complex and difficult situation but of course i will make sure that the relevant meeting be set up with the relevant ministers to ensure the right hon member get the answer he need on behalf of his constituent 
 my constituency be the home of uk brewing and have the good pub in the country the prime minister be welcome to join i for a pint to sample the very good beer in the world as this government look to reform business rate and consult on those change will he commit to ensure that pub and hospitality have a seat at the table 
 the last time i go to my hon friend ’s constituency i get to see the fantastic south derbyshire college i look forward to test his proposition that he have the good pub in his constituency on some future occasion pub and brewery be such an important part of our culture and our community that be why the budget deliver an £ per year tax cut for   pub reduce the duty on a pint we also deliver a relief on business rate for next year permanently lower they the year after we be protect small business by more than double the employer allowance to £ 
 in the past week there have be report that more school be slat for closure as a direct consequence of the prime minister ’s ideologically drive policy to introduce vat on school fee and increase national insurance contribution this pattern will be see up and down the country and will lead to staff be unemployed and pupil and parent be cast adrift will the prime minister do the decent thing abandon this policy and apologise to those affect 
 i do understand the concern of those who save to send their child to private school because they believe in aspiration and opportunity every single parent share that aspiration to opportunity whichever school they send their child to under the last government we do not have enough teacher in basic subject in our state secondary school the tories be prepared to tolerate that i be not 
 people across the country include an estimate in wales will benefit from labour ’s budget measure on the minimum wage and the national living wage member should contrast that with the leader of the opposition who say that the minimum wage be hurt business or the shadow chancellor who call the minimum wage a burden do the prime minister agree that those comment underline that the tories have no interest in protect work people or boost the income of the low pay 
 it be the last labour government who introduce the national minimum wage in the tooth of opposition from the tory party i be proud that this government have now increase it by over that mean an increase of over £ a year for a full time worker age to whether it be our employment rights bill or decision at the budget this be a government who be proudly on the side of britain ’s work people 
 now that sue gray have remarkably turn down the opportunity to be the prime minister ’s special envoy to the nation will he finally admit that it be an invent job on taxpayer money for of his crony if it be n’t be he go to hire a new 
 it be n’t 
 i represent load of hard work mum and dad in tipton wednesbury and coseley last week the leader of the opposition ’s campaign chair rachel maclean say it be not the right decision for the tories to expand childcare provision will the prime minister confirm that this labour government believe in support work family and will work to get they the childcare they need 
 let i be absolutely clear this government be commit to make childcare more affordable and accessible the tory party vote against make life easy for work family they have learn absolutely nothing we be commit to provide £ to expand access across childcare create new school base nursery and family hub i be proud that we be take the country in the right direction 
 article of the united nations genocide convention make it explicit that genocide be not about number it be about intent the intent of the israeli government and the israel defence forces have be explicit in word and action over the past day with more than innocent man woman and child kill on october the foreign secretary deny that a genocide be even take place and suggest that the israeli army have not yet kill enough palestinians to constitute a genocide last week at prime minister ’s question the prime minister state that he have never refer to the atrocity happen in gaza as a genocide will he share his definition of genocide with the house and state what further action he be prepared to take to save the life of desperate and starve man woman and child give that we now hold the presidency of the united nations security council 
 it would be wise to start a question like that by a reference to what happen in october of last year i be well aware of the definition of genocide and that be why i have never describe this or refer to it as genocide 
 my constituent ’s daughter bethany rae fields be brutally murder by her ex boyfriend in despite raise multiple alarm of her abuse to the police this week bethany ’s mother pauline travel down to parliament to bring her case to the minister do the prime minister agree with pauline that more need to be do to shift the culture towards believe victim and react fast when they sound the alarm of concern as way to reduce violence against woman and girl 
 what happen to bethany be appalling and my thought as i be sure be those of the whole house be with her family we need a culture shift here and we have commit to halve violence against woman and girl in a decade no government have ever make that commitment before and i hope that can be something that be share across the house because this be so important it start with that central question of belief and confidence for every woman or young woman who come forward there be probably about who never have the confidence to come forward and this start with belief and the culture that we put in place we be committed to that and i invite the whole house to join we on that mission to halve violence against woman and girl 
 i be sure the prime minister and the whole house would wish to congratulate donald trump on his landslide victory last week 
 order i will hear the question 
 thank you mr speaker within a couple of day we have learn of a assassination attempt charge have be lay and behind it be iran ’s revolutionary guard have the time not come to proscribe what be so obviously a terrorist organisation and in do so not just do the right thing but perhaps mend some fence between this government and the incoming presidency of donald trump give that the whole of the prime minister ’s cabinet have be so rude about he over the last few year 
 i be glad to see the hon member make a rare appearance back here in britain he have spend so much time in america recently that i be half expect to see he in the immigration statistic when we see the next batch—[interruption he may have miss it but i congratulate the incoming president last week and we will work with he the point the hon member make about iran be very serious and we will work across the house and with our ally on it obviously on the question of proscription we keep that under review 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s recognition of islamophobia awareness month and his commitment to support muslim community the definition of islamophobia from the all party parliamentary group on british muslims be of the most widely accept definition and i have be discuss its adoption with the deputy prime minister the faith minister and the leader of the house give recent riot and a doubling of islamophobic hate crime over the past decade will the prime minister outline the step that this government will take to tackle the issue and commit to ensure a clear and effective definition of islamophobia 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important issue whatever the hatred there have be a rise in the past or so month and the whole house will join i in say that we must meet any rise in hatred in whatever form it be include islamophobia we be work with other to take that forward and i be happy to meet he far on that 
 i be in south lochaber at the weekend speak to pensioner who still can not understand why the prime minister choose to take away their winter fuel payment of they remember from just year ago the then leader of the opposition stating 
 look ahead to winter be frightening i ’ve meet pensioner who have no idea how they ’ll heat their home 
 she ask i to ask the prime minister whatever happen to that guy 
 as the hon member know from previous answer we have take tough decision in this budget to deal with the situation that we face because of that we have stabilise the economy which mean that we can commit to the triple lock and because of the triple lock pensioner will be well off i will take no lecture from his party about run the economy the snp ’s record in scotland be terrible 
 i welcome the establishment of a flood resilience taskforce because in my constituency of broxtowe unprecedented flooding have affect many of my constituent there be rise concern and significant financial insecurity for many they face distress trauma and fear in their own home what other measure be the prime minister take to improve flood resilience what support will be available to my constituent in broxtowe 
 i know the dreadful impact that flooding have have on my hon friend ’s constituency include in storm henk early this year the last government leave flood defence in the bad condition on record we be invest £ in flood resilience over the next year and we have launch a flood resilience taskforce to co ordinate national and local flood preparation to well protect community and our economy interruption rather than heckle the opposition might reflect on the record that they leave 
 resident of my constituency of south basildon and east thurrock face a triple whammy of council tax increase by reduce public service and £ of emergency funding that be be borrow at above base rate that be approximately £ a year go to the treasury that could be spend on frontline service in thurrock will the prime minister commit to reduce that rate so that the money can go where it belong 
 the last government make life even more difficult for council need exceptional financial support by charge a premium on borrow that be the wrong decision and it have a huge impact on vital service we will take a different approach we be deliver a real term increase in core government spending power and that will benefit the hon member ’s constituent 
 the leader of the opposition take time at her party ’s conference to say that 
 a little bit of adversity 
 in life be good for people ’s mental health that approach clearly do not work for the people stick on mental health waiting list because of the last tory government will the prime minister commit to tackle mental health waiting list in the nhs 
 we obviously recognise the devastating impact that mental health problem have on people ’s livelihood lord darzi ’s report show that waiting list be far too long and that there be a shocking decline in mental health for child under the last government we be give mental health the commitment it need by recruit mental health worker they be much need and reform the mental health act in my view that be long overdue 
 chalk stream river be rare and have a unique ecology most of they be in the uk and be in my constituency of north east hampshire last year chalk stream river be hit with hour of sewage   discharge but the previous government do nothing despite call for action from my hon friend the member for chesham and amersham sarah green will the prime minister introduce a special protection for our chalk stream river 
 i thank the hon member for raise this issue we be commit to the protection and restoration of unique chalk stream she be right that the destruction of our waterway should never have be allow and we have announce immediate action to end this disgraceful behaviour new power and tough penalty include fine ban bonus and bring criminal charge against those who persistently break the law we have also launch a water commission 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s leadership on an international scale to smash the criminal gang that smuggle people across the border this labour government have return more than people with no right to be in the uk which be more than the conservatives do will the prime minister confirm that he will continue this trend and smash the gang that profit from people ’s misery 
 yes the last government lose control of our border in the month of this year small boat arrival be up by on the same period last year they spend £ returning what volunteer to rwanda since come into office we have return people with no right to be here they talk about get the flight off we have get the flight off include the single big deportation flight that be why we be invest another £ in smash the gang we be absolutely determined to have a serious response to a serious question not a gimmick that achieve absolutely nothing 
 i be sure that ensure that every child have access to a great education be a priority for all across the house and i welcome the announcement on extra funding for child with special educational need and disability in the budget in the chancellor ’s speech she announce a £ increase in core spending and £ for sen however the budget document state that those sum be both from the same pot in which case that spending be announce twice which be correct 
 the chancellor make this absolutely clear in the budget we be put that huge investment into special educational need an issue of concern across the house because i think all member recognise the appalling record of the last government the appalling state of sen have be raise by those on the hon gentleman ’s own bench i be proud of the money that the government be put in where the last government fail 
 not a week go by when my office be not contact by young people and their family who be be let down by the shocking state of sen provision locally in my constituency i be try to work across party line to push both central bedfordshire and hertfordshire council to do more i welcome the fantastic news in the budget about additional   funding and the subsequent announcement about increase support for mainstream setting but we will need to do more can the prime minister assure my constituent that we will not shy away from the whole system reform need to finally ensure that every young person have the support that they need to thrive in school 
 we will not shy away from that challenge because it be far too important for the child family and community involve we will therefore not only put the necessary money in but look at the reform that be need alongside that investment and we will finally fix the problem another of the problem that we have inherit from the lot opposite 
 final question sir alec shelbrooke 
 thank you mr speaker on   november the house will be ask to consider the reading of of the most consequential piece of legislation about the country ’s make up i be genuinely approach it with   an open mind but have many concern be the short space of time for debate on that day will the government commit before   november to days—16 hour of protect government time for the bill on the floor of the house so that we can examine and debate the bill on report which be when much of what we be concerned about can be bring up otherwise people like i may decline it a reading through fear that we may not be able to debate the issue in full 
 i be grateful to the right hon member for raise this issue which be obviously important and it be an important vote i know that there be strongly hold view on both side of the debate across the house that be why there will be a free vote every member need to decide for themselves how they will vote i do think that there be sufficient time allocate to it but it be an important issue 
 that complete prime minister ’s question interruption point of order come after urgent question and statement 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the transfer of sovereignty of the chagos island to mauritius 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question follow year of negotiation under prime ministers on   october   the government secure a deal that will protect the secure operation of the uk us base on diego garcia well into the next century the government inherit a situation where that future be under threat international court be reach judgment on the basis that mauritius have sovereignty over the chagos archipelago international organisation be also take step not to undermine mauritian sovereignty claim that be not sustainable 
 the base on diego garcia play a critical role in counter an array of threat to regional and international security without legal certainty the base simply can not operate effectively continued uncertainty would be a gift to our adversary that be why the agreement have be welcome by all part of the us system and other critical regional security partner include india agree the deal now on our term mean that we be able to secure strong protection that will allow the base to operate as it have do we have secure a deal that protect our national interest respect the interest of our partner and uphold the international rule of law there will be clear commitment in the treaty to robust security arrangement include arrangement prevent the presence of foreign security force on the outer island so that the base can continue to operate securely and effectively we would not have sign off on an agreement that compromise any of our security interest or those of our ally 
 the agreement will be underpin by a financial settlement that be acceptable to both side and will underpin a strong long term partnership with mauritius that be crucial to secure the agreement the government will not scrimp on our national security however i be sure that the house will understand that it be not normal practice for the uk to reveal the value of payment for military basis anywhere across the globe because to do so would put at risk their future secure operation 
 the deal will also deliver benefit for the chagossian community who be remove from the island in the 1960 and 1970 i know that the whole house have already express and will join i in again express regret for that shameful episode mauritius will now be able to implement a programme of resettlement to the island other than diego garcia and we will work together to start a programme of visit for chagossians to all the island the uk will finance a new trust fund for mauritius to support chagossians and will provide additional government support to those live in the uk all chagossians will of course remain eligible for british citizenship and free to make their home in the uk 
 we will work with mauritius to ensure the continue protection of the island unique environment with the share objective of securing and protect of the world ’s most important marine environment that will include the establishment of a mauritius marine protect area the agreement also shut down the possibility of the indian ocean be use as a dangerous illegal migration route to the uk with mauritius take responsible for any future arrival 
 the long term protection of the base on diego garcia have be the share uk and us priority throughout this agreement secure its future we look forward to engage with the incoming us administration i congratulate both president trump and dr ramgoolam on their recent election victory in the us and mauritius respectively and we look forward to work with their government on this matter the agreement be in all side shared interest and in our national security interest 
 mauritius have no legal or historical claim to sovereignty over a group of island that be mile away from it and the opinion of the international court of justice be purely advisory there be no legal reason why we have to do any of this i warn the foreign secretary week ago in this chamber that it be an enormous mistake to do this give that we have a us presidential election come up on   november minister might say to i it ’ okay the united states be fully in favour really i can tell the house that the incoming national security adviser mike waltz have form on this go right back to when   the right hon member for braintree mr cleverly   be do his good to give away the sovereignty of the chagos island indeed mike waltz write to secretary of state blinken at the time 
 i assure the house have be in america last week and know the incoming us defence secretary very well that there be outright hostility towards this deal whatever be say about a lease agreement these agreement can very easily be break as we see with hong kong diego garcia be describe to i by a senior trump adviser as the most important island on the planet for america so the minister will find outright hostility 
 by the way what happen to the chagossian people be truly awful but they be unanimous in their wish not to live under mauritian rule they want to live under british rule because they trust we 
 there be no basis for this agreement if the government continue with it they will be at conflict with a country without which we would be defenceless 
 i be afraid i fundamentally disagree with what the hon gentleman say let i be clear this government inherit a situation whereby the long term secure operation of this crucial military base he be right on that point be under threat international court be reach judgment and international organisation be take step not to undermine mauritian sovereignty that threaten the secure and effective operation of the base in the absence of a negotiate solution a legally bind decision against the uk seem inevitable that would have threaten the secure and effective operation of the base and that be not sustainable interruption 
 on the hon gentleman ’s comment about the incoming us administration we very much look forward to work with they and i be sure that they will be brief on the full detail of the deal i be confident that the detail of the arrangement will allay any concern otherwise we would not have enter into any such arrangement in the place interruption 
 order mr francois i welcome you back to the front bench but i do not welcome you shout from it continuously do we understand that we need calm this be an important subject so i do not want the rhetoric that be come from there 
 mr speaker i have know the right hon gentleman a long time and he know that he can come and speak to i about these matter at any point 
 let i be clear we will work very closely with the incoming us administration and we be work closely with the current us administration this agreement have support across the national security apparatus of the united states otherwise we would never have enter into an arrangement the previous government recognise the threat to the long term operation of the base which be why they start the negotiation in the place but this government do the deal diego garcia be important but it be not at risk it be more secure as a result of the deal what   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   be suggest be simply not the case 
 the hon gentleman mention the chagossians what happen to they be completely wrong and shameful that have be agree on all side of the house i have engage with the chagossian community on a number of occasion he will also recognise that there be a range of view across the chagossian community include those who support the deal we have make sure that their interest be at the heart of the arrangement whether in the trust fund the unilateral arrangement the continue commitment to uk citizenship for chagossians their ability to return to visit all the island or the resettlement programme that mauritius will restart under the treaty 
 i be confident that this deal be the right thing for our national security for the chagossian community and for our ally and partner 
 we hear representation from   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   about uphold international law do the minister agree that it be important that the uk fulfil its international law obligation do he recognise that in the international tribunal for the law of the sea confirm that mauritius have sovereignty over the chagos island do he agree that notwithstanding that the deal secure the long term certainty of the base on diego garcia 
 my hon friend be absolutely right agree this deal now on our term mean that we have be able to secure protection that will allow the base to operate as it have do into the next century it settle the historical sovereignty claim in a way that successfully balance our international law obligation with vital uk and us national security requirement 
 i welcome dame priti patel to the opposition front bench 
 thank you mr speaker 
 the world be a more dangerous place than ever before in our lifetime and this government have agree to give away a key strategic asset in the indian ocean end more than year of british sovereignty it be the wrong decision and we stand by that completely a month have go since the government ’s announcement but we be still in the dark about exactly what they have agree that be simply not acceptable we have no treaty and vital question remain unanswered that be unacceptable and the minister need to put it right today 
 we can not afford for our military base on diego garcia to be compromise in this way what safeguard will be in place to ensure that no other state can establish themselves or place their asset in particular strategic asset on any nearby island in the archipelago how do the decision affect the strategic defence review that be under way how much money will labour be ask british taxpayer to send to mauritius each year under the deal which we do not even know the detail of which departmental budget will that come from what be the total figure the house expect transparency include on what taxpayer will be fund we need to hold the government to account on this 
 will the minister please give a cast iron guarantee that the uk will be able to unilaterally extend the agreement on the military base beyond year that be all we have hear for now what will be the mechanism for do that this be a crucial piece of scrutiny that we all need to know about particularly as the minister raise a point about national security and the national security apparatus agree to this arrangement what discussion have the foreign secretary i know he be not here today personally undertake with the chagossian community who the minister will know be beyond distraught about the agreement 
 the election in mauritius and the united states pose further question and it be right that we follow up on they labour rush into the deal just before the mauritian election even though ministers must surely have realise that a change of government be a strong possibility why do they do that the minister need to be clear we want to know how the government be go to engage with the new us administration the opposition oppose the government ’s decision and we intend to hold they to account 
 i welcome the shadow foreign secretary to her place in this chamber we be in a committee early today but i welcome she to her place i have always have good engagement with she on issue in the past and she be right to ask important question but the thing i need to do be correct the idea that we be somehow give up the base that be exactly the opposite of what we be do we be secure the future of the base the base will continue to operate it will continue to operate as it have do 
 the right hon lady ask an important question about security guarantee in relation to the outer island there will be clear commitment in the treaty for robust security arrangement include prevent the presence of foreign security force on the outer island we simply would not have sign off an agreement that   compromise any of our security interest or those of our ally indeed this have be discuss not just at a political level in the united states but at a deep technical level she will know from her time in government about the nature of the special relationship and the depth of that relationship that be why we have proceed only on the basis that we be all satisfied with the arrangement 
 the right hon lady will be able to scrutinise those arrangement in due course as will the house mr speaker the treaty will be present in the usual way after signature it will go through the usual process interruption she ask when we have just have the mauritian election we will be engage with the new administration there and seek to present the treaty for signature we will then present it in all its detail to the house 
 the right hon lady ask about an extension period there be a provision in the treaty for an extension period after the year period 
 the right hon lady ask about the chagossians again i gently say that there be a range of view in the chagossian community they have be express to i on many occasion both before i come into government and since i have be in government there be a range of view on the arrangement we respect all the different view that be out there we will continue to engage with the chagossian community but i be absolutely clear that there be important provision in the deal that support the chagossian community their ability to return to the outer island the visit the trust fund the unilateral support we will continue to provide and the fact that chagossian be welcome to come here to the uk and take up british citizenship which be an agreement under the previous government 
 portsmouth be the home of the royal navy and as the member for portsmouth north i welcome the appointment of jonathan powell who play an important part in negotiate this deal as national security adviser do the minister agree that with his experience in help to negotiate the good friday agreement and his work on some of the world ’s most complex conflict he be uniquely place to advise the government on tackle the challenge ahead and to protect the advancement of uk security 
 i totally agree with my hon friend who i know take a keen interest in the overseas territory in particular gibraltar i totally agree with she about the new national security adviser he be a remarkable individual with a huge track record in government of make deal and get thing do which i know be appreciate by our friend on the opposite side of the atlantic too he be somebody who take the national security of this country extraordinarily seriously so i completely agree with her characterisation 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 many chagossians from all over the country gather at a rally yesterday where they express their concern about the uk mauritius agreement we reiterate our concern here today the exclusion of the voice of the chagossians   be wrong it can not be right and surely no member of this house could think it acceptable that the chagossians be deny the opportunity for self determination 
 will the minister update the house to confirm the timescale by which parliament will have oversight of the final treaty will he look again at inject the voice of chagossians into the process even at this late stage may i also raise the case of the tamils strand on diego garcia we welcome recent news report that they will be airlift to the uk but will the minister update the house on whether that will take place and whether they will be permit a permanent right to resettlement in the uk 
 i thank the hon gentleman who speak for the liberal democrats for his question i know that the future of the island be hugely important to the chagossian community i have engage with the chagossian community over many many year and since i have be in government we have always be clear about the importance of respect their interest i have to say though that the negotiation be between the uk and mauritius as sovereign state with our priority be to secure the full operation of the base on diego garcia however it be crucial that we recognise the importance of chagossian interest within this process and we have do that 
 i be confident that when the full deal be present to parliament which it will be in due course there will be important provision in there that will reassure member of the chagossian community as i mention some of they have already be make public the ability to visit the ability to resettle on the outer island the uk citizenship guarantee the trust fund and of course the uk ’s own support which be crucial and come on the back of the support we have provide for some time 
 the hon gentleman ask about the sri lankan migrant on diego garcia this government inherit a deeply troubling situation which remain unresolved under the last administration for year after the migrant arrive on diego garcia result in mount legal challenge we have be work at pace to find a solution that protect the welfare of individual and the integrity of british territorial border due to the exceptional nature of the case the government have take the decision to relocate a small number of the migrant to the uk but that be subject to security check they will get a short period of permission to enter the uk when the individual can consider their personal circumstance and next step 
 of the wonderful thing about our parliament and our democracy be that our citizen can see our proceeding but so too can our foe those who wish we harm and have no good intention towards we will look across at the opposition benches and see that there be not a credible national security team when they be ask question of this government 
 i want to confine my question to a constituent of mine who have live in the uk for the last year after leave the chagos island he be keen to reunite with his family who be now uk citizen but housing cost be an issue will the minister get back to i with information on whether housing support could be part of the government ’s overall support for the chagossian community 
 i thank my hon friend for his question obviously i do not know the full detail of his constituent ’s individual case but if he write to i i will of course come back to he in due course 
 can the minister confirm or deny that   the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer   have any unminuted conversation with philippe sands kc about the mauritian claim over the chagos island 
 the prime minister engage with the former prime minister of mauritius and with the us administration on these matter we have engage with a wide range of partner in these discussion the right hon gentleman be very familiar with they as the former foreign secretary who be part of that process 
 i hope that my hon friend the minister will agree with i that as we discuss the very important issue raise by   the hon member for clacton nigel farage we must acknowledge that all right hon and hon member be do what be in the good interest of our country that right hon and hon member on the opposition benches do not have a monopoly on national security and defence and indeed that it be this government who be reform and improve our international reputation around the world our decision on the chagos island which will protect the base and deal with the other issue my hon friend have mention be an important part of that 
 absolutely the importance of national security to this government be at the heart of the mission set out by the prime minister which have be put into practice by the foreign secretary the defence secretary and i along with other across the government we would never take decision that compromise the national security of this country or indeed that of our ally and that be why i be confident that this decision be the right let we remember that this process be begin under the last administration because they recognise the challenge and recognise that something need to be do about it
