 small music venue such as the frog fiddle in cheltenham be part of the lifeblood of the creative industry but the music venue trust have warn that after year of economic pressure and the recent budget more than venue be on the brink of closure how be the government support small music venue and what step will they take if the voluntary levy on arena and stadium ticket be not agree by the large venue whose participation be vital 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for that question my constituency of wigan be home to the verve and it be difficult to know where such a band would now cut their tooth in the industry because many of the live music venue that they play in as an up and come band have disappear i very much recognise the problem that he raise he will know that this government have support the voluntary levy that the industry have back but if that levy be not implement we will be force to take action my hon friend the minister for creative industries arts and tourism will be write to the industry in those term this week 
 what recent assessment she have make of the contribution of tourism to the local economy of coastal town 
 tourism be vital to our coastal town and if we be to reach our target of international visitor to the uk by we will need to do far well at improve tourism number in our coastal town 
 the coastal village of skinningrove be home to a fantastic tourist asset land of iron which be the lead ironstone mining museum in the country i be campaign for it to receive national status as the national ironstone mining museum will ministers consider meet i to discuss that request and would they like to visit 
 my hon friend challenge i a bit the rhondda have the good mining museum in the uk but i be prepared to concede that in england he might be right but there be an important point our mining heritage be part of understand the country that we have be and the country that we can be in future i be very happy to meet my hon friend arts council england have a specific way of give a national name to museum and that be thing that he might want to apply to it for 
 tourism and hospitality contribute more than £ and a of all job in north west norfolk why be the government hit those business with high business rate and a job tax 
 it would be good would it not to have an nhs that work in this country it would be good to have an economy that work train that run on time and a country that function so that when tourist come here they have a good experience rather than sit on a platform wait for a train that never turn up on time i be determined to ensure that we get to visitor to the united kingdom last year we have just visitor if we be to secure that increase we must have a country that welcome tourist to every part of the country not just london and the south east 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the budget have create a perfect storm for hospitality and tourism business across the country ukhospitality be sound the alarm say that the budget be a blow for the tourism and hospitality sector accord to the minister ’s impact assessment how many job will be create as a result of lower the national insurance threshold and how many business will close as we suspect they will what do his impact assessment tell he will be the impact on ethnic minority community woman and those with disability for whom the tourism and hospitality sector be a huge employer will he tell the house whether he even have an impact assessment for of the most damaging and regressive taxis that we will ever see 
 with that list of question i think the shadow minister need a debate 
 the irony be we have already have debate on these issue in the last fortnight thank to you mr speaker 
 i welcome the hon member to his place and his new responsibility i look forward to work with he 
 the truth of the matter be that the tourism industry have really struggle over the last few year partly because of brexit and partly because of covid under the last few year of the conservative government it do not get back to its pre covid level of visitor to the uk it be now at as i say i want we to get to by the only way we be go to do that be if we significantly improve the offer at every stage of the experience of visitor come to the united kingdom 
 yes there be undoubtedly challenge for the hospitality industry i say this in a speech yesterday afternoon but the thing that really worry i be that historically we in this country have see a job in the industry as something that someone have to do when they have not get another job i want to change that so that it be a career to be proud of something respectable that someone might do for their whole life 
 whether she have have recent representation from society lottery on the potential merit of rating those organisation under any future statutory levy on gambling operator 
 as set out in a write ministerial statement yesterday the government will introduce a statutory levy on gambling operator which be a commitment make as part of the gamble white paper in society lottery will be charge the levy at the low rate of i know that they be a vital fundraising tool for many charity community group and sport club up and down the country 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests the minister clearly recognise as we all do the contribution that society lottery make to our constituency through various organisation do she recognise that not for profit society lottery will have to fund any levy due from their charitable return which the sector and i think many of we feel amount to a charity tax 
 my understanding be that the levy come after the money have go to good cause but i be not the gambling minister who sit in the other place i will happily arrange a meeting for the right hon member with the gambling minister 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to ensure the community wealth fund support community in dudley constituency

 we believe that the horserace bet levy be vital for the financial sustainability of the sport and its thousand of fan i can update he that the minister for gambling recently meet representative from horserace and bet to encourage a voluntary deal that fairly reflect the relationship between racing and betting we expect an update from the british horseracing authority and the betting and gaming council on progress by the end of the year 
 let ’s hope that the shadow minister will not fall at the hurdle 
 thank you mr speaker 
 the horseracing industry have be leave in the dark by this government follow the chancellor ’s disastrous budget the office for budget responsibility warn   that the national insurance rise would cost on average £ per employee with employ across the country the government ’s job tax could cost the horseracing industry £ and the gambling sector up to £ even before the new levy will the secretary of state tell the house whether her department have make any assessment of the impact of the increase in national insurance contribution on the industry how many job will be lose how many training yard and course will close how many of the independent bookie will shut

 sport club in my constituency such as shipston rugby club and stratford sport club be do fantastic work with young people but for rural constituency like stratford on avon where sport play a vital role in youth engagement the impact of extreme weather event mean that many sport club consistently lose access to their facility due to flooding throughout the year will the secretary of state confirm whether the new youth strategy will consider the challenge pose by the climate on youth sport activity 
 the hon lady will know that for young people in particular the climate crisis be an enormous priority as she know we have announce that we be co produce and create the national youth strategy with young people i would be amazed if the impact of climate change on the thing that matter most to they be not an essential part of that strategy

 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thank you mr speaker and a very happy birthday to the clerk of the house 
 as we have hear time and again today and in the past few week the government ’s job tax could cost £ to the department ’s sector to the art sport music hospitality and tourism be the secretary of state blindside by the budget as the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs claim or be she aware of that have she as we have ask several time do a sector by sector impact assessment if not why not if so will she publish it 
 i gently say to the right hon gentleman that unlike the previous government we do actually like another and work together across government so i have a number of discussion about the budget with my right hon friend the chancellor in advance she be very aware of the importance of creative industry and of all our sector to the uk economy that be why we have put they at the heart of our industrial strategy and our economic plan we be work closely with the industry to make sure that they continue to thrive 
 so it sound like the right hon lady do know which be interesting give that she care about charity as much as i do they face a £ bill when they need help the most we give they £ her government be now go to take time that amount back from they we hear yesterday that the teenage cancer trust will have to find an extra £ and marie curie report have to find nearly £ where do the secretary of state suggest that such organisation find the money to pay this charity tax and who will fill the gap if charity have to scale back on their work as a result of this government ’s decision 
 under the last government charity face a perfect storm not only do they receive very little support from the government in fact they be silence and gag and be tell by charity minister that they should be stick to their knitting which in my view be deeply offensive but they have to deal with the rise pressure of the cost of living crisis and the mess that the right hon gentleman ’s party be make of run the country our government be determined to take action on this and we be elect on a pledge to do so as i have tell the right hon gentleman ’s colleague previously we be protect our charity as be announce in the budget and i will take no lecture from the conservative on how to run this country 
 in the uk export £ worth of creative good and £ worth of creative service but we can and must do well may i press the secretary of state on what she be do to support the creative industry co ordinated strategy for growth

 hazlerigg victory club be just of many fantastic football club in my constituency   that be run by local champion for the benefit of our community they have say that pitch be too often of poor quality and be eye wateringly expensive to hire how can we ensure that that the big dan burns and grace donnellys of the future have access to appropriate facility 
 our government be acutely aware that there be not enough facility in community in the uk to keep pace with demand we know that these facility be a visible symbol of whether we value our child and young people whether we value those community and whether we stand with they we be work with the football association and the premier league to create new state of the art facility across the country to inspire the star of the future and i would be glad to discuss that far with my hon friend to ensure that it be of benefit to she 
 in brighton pavilion we love our grassroots music venue and we often need to make robust use of the agent of change principle to protect they when it come to licensing and planning but it be hard work to enforce that and ensure that it happen be the minister have any discussion with the secretary of state for housing communities and local government about put the agent of change principle on a statutory footing 
 those meeting have already take place and will continue to take place the hon lady make a very good point i have visit brighton pavilion many time so i know that other music venue there can i hope come online in the near future i know that the secretary of state meet ed sheeran last week she have tell i about it about time to discuss precisely that issue

 the hon member for battersea represent the church commissioners be ask 
 what assessment the church have make of the potential impact of the terminally ill adult end of life bill on church own hospice 
 what assessment the church have make of the potential impact of the terminally ill adult end of life bill on church own hospice 
 church nationwide provide chaplaincy and grief counselling service to hospice patient and their family many modern hospice start off as church affiliate institution thank to the pioneer work of dame cicely saunders they be largely now affiliate to hospice uk which support over hospice across the uk include the royal trinity hospice near my constituency of battersea only a of adult hospice in the uk receive funding from the state the rest rely on charitable support and there be considerable concern that the terminally ill adult end of life bill may divert much need fund from frontline care 
 hospices have charitable aim to provide palliative care at the end of life but these could be compromise by the terminally ill adult end of life bill which come before the house tomorrow what consultation and impact assessment of this measure have there be with hospice that have a faith foundation i be hear that some hospice need an exemption or they might close 
 i do not believe there have be consultation with any faith connect organisation and i do not believe that an impact assessment have be carry out however hospice uk the body to which most church associate hospice be affiliate have survey provider staff and practitioner who have express concern about the bill ’s implementation they be concerned about the following who will qualify the impact on those work in hospice palliative care and end of life care the ability of provider and staff to opt out the practical operation of a conscience clause the financial impact on the future funding of hospice and the lack of public awareness of end of life care and the available choice 
 can my hon friend confirm whether church own hospice will work with independent hospice and other organisation to mitigate the potential impact of the terminally ill adult end of life bill and to issue a statement from across the sector 
 i thank my hon friend for her question on this incredibly important issue i refer she to my previous answer but it be also worth highlight that in recent year the general synod of the church of england have twice vote by large majority against change the law on assist suicide the association for palliative medicine and hospice uk to which most chaplain and church own hospice be affiliate remain opposed to any change in the law the sector be particularly concerned about the funding challenge such a change would bring as be highlight in a select committee report the report show that funding for palliative care service fall by almost in country such as the netherlands belgium and luxembourg where legalised assist dying be in place compare with a increase in country where it have not be legalise 
 do the church commissioner agree that hospice be about comfort the dying and surround they with care be that not the very antithesis of the state involve itself in sanctioning and assist suicide 
 if we think back to the founder of hospice care it be found on the principle of faith and jesus christ it be only right that those principle of care and compassion ring true in ensure that hospice care be there for those who need it 
 the very ethos of church own hospice be the sanctity of life on which the bible be very clear church own hospice will reflect that in what they do do the church commissioner share my concern about the potential conflict that could arise between church own hospice and this house follow the outcome of tomorrow ’s debate on the assist die bill do she share my concern about the sanctity of life and agree with i about the importance of make sure that we keep people alive 
 hospices and palliative care play an important role in end of life care i believe that we need to fund those service properly before we consider move towards legislate for assist dying 
 what step the church be take to preserve historic place of worship 
 what progress the church commissioners have make on reduce the backlog of work to restore parish church and cathedral 
 the national church institution have invest £ in the buildings for mission fund which provide money for repair specialist advice and grant to parish of up to £ for small scale urgent work building for mission can also be use to pay for essential improvement to church mission and ministry such disability access toilet or even a community kitchen 
 my constituency be home to many historic church that continue to be much love by their community they include st john ’s church in bromsgrove which date from century but be predominantly construct in the and century the church have have to raise many hundred of thousand of pound for the upkeep and maintenance of its spire key to that be the list place of worship grant scheme what conversation have take place between the government and the church regard the preservation of that scheme 
 st john ’s church in bromsgrove be a perfect example because have raise the fund it be prepare to undertake urgent work to its spire with an anticipated project cost of roughly £ but it could reclaim around £ through the list place of worship grant as the hon gentleman probably know the scheme have pay out £ since it be introduce in by the former prime minister gordon brown and have assist over place the scheme currently receive around application per annum and have a budget of £ the department for culture media and sport have assess the scheme on numerous occasion it deliver the fair possible system of make grant 
 st andrew ’s parish church and holy trinity church in my constituency be both list building that provide vital community service the former be save for a heat pump and the latter for a new roof they be hop to use the list place of worship grant scheme to undertake the work but because the scheme be due to expire next year their future be uncertain will my hon friend join i in thank the many church across the uk and kettering for the work that they do to serve our community what plan be there for the future of the scheme 
 my hon friend be a strong advocate for the church in her constituency i be pleased to hear she mention that st andrew ’s church be upgrade its heating system hopefully it will benefit from some funding from the list place of worship grant scheme as i be sure will be say again in this question session the scheme make a huge difference to church many have to do a lot of fundraising in their community but be able to rely on the scheme help to cover some of the cost 
 what step the church be take to mitigate the impact of the potential withdrawal of the list place of worship grant scheme in march 
 what recent discussion the church have have with the secretary of state for culture media and sport on whether the list place of worship grant scheme will continue after march 
 the list place of worship grant scheme which be clearly dominate question today enable vat to be refund for repair to our old and most precious church and religious building without access to the scheme parish will find it hard to fund essential repair and they will have to spend more time on fundraising and less time on the need of their local community i understand that the bishop of bristol and the national churches trust have write to my right hon friend the secretary of state for culture media and sport to ask for a meeting i hope that my right hon friend will meet they in the near future as time be of the essence 
 in rural area like the weald of kent our church be vital public building provide somewhere not just for the spiritual life of our village and town but for their civic life give the impending withdrawal of the list place of worship grant scheme what be be do to support church like st mildred ’s in tenterden it play a vital role in the town especially now that the town hall be close for refurbishment and it rely on the scheme to make essential repair the hon lady have speak about the importance of the scheme but will it be extend 
 as the hon lady will agree i be not the secretary of state for culture media and sport so i can not give she a decision on that however she rightly highlight the vital role that church play as a cornerstone of all our community up and down the country alongside their role of provide community   and spiritual leadership like she i hope that the scheme will continue i congratulate she and her colleague on write to the secretary of state and i hope they will get a response in the near future 
 on bedfordshire day i want to put on record my appreciation for everyone who work so hard in our county to make it such a wonderful place that include constituent who be passionate about preserve st botolph ’s church in aspley guise they be work hard to raise ten of thousand of pound for their tower restoration project and expect work to start early next year however they be concerned that without the list place of worship grant scheme work will become much more expensive and may not be able to proceed will the church commissioner meet i to discuss how we can continue to support historic church such as st botolph ’s 
 i join the hon gentleman in congratulate all those who work in our community and church i will be delighted to meet he to see what assistance can be provide for the parish i understand that st botolph ’s have a target of £ for extensive repair to the tower it have already secure £ in donation from the local community and be await decision on a number of grant i congratulate the whole congregation and the community on their fundraising effort to reach that huge figure the hon gentleman make a good point and share a good example of why the scheme be so important 
 what step the church be take to support people that be housebound due to a disability 
 what step the church be take to support people that be housebound due to a disability 
 i welcome the timely question from my hon friend as we be in the middle of disability history month the church have start a project to support local parish to adapt their building to make our church more accessible it include standardise signage to make accessibility obvious training for church leader and staff and a grant scheme for adaptation the church also continue to develop worship and educational resource which be available nationally to people who be housebound and their carer 
 in the report of the archbishop commission on reimagine care which i chair we recognise the important role of church and faith community in support old and disabled people the report ask the church of england to consider develop resource and capacity in local church 
 to adopt an asset base approach to engage with disabled people and old people in their community 
 can my hon friend update the house on what action the church be take to fulfil that recommendation 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for chair the archbishop commission along with the pastoral visit make by clergy resource be make   available nationally for disabled people or those who be housebound they include sunday service broadcast online on youtube each week from a different parish which have thousand of unique viewer each week and for which british sign language interpretation be available there be the dailyhope telephone line and the everyday faith app with reading and reflection which be use by individual and have be download over time there be also the daily prayer app with morning and evening prayer which have reach over unique listener since 
 church together south tyneside do amazing work through its happy at home hub provide a range of service to the lonely and the isolated will my hon friend expand a little more on the church ’s wide pastoral duty towards those in the great need 
 again i congratulate my hon friend on all the wonderful work take place in her constituency church together group do a fantastic job in tackle the scourge of isolation and loneliness there be other project that start recently to support parish with the physical accessibility of their building include church hall and other facility without the lpw grant scheme the adaptation of some of our most historic church would be hard to deliver at pace 
 what step the church be take to ensure the preservation of historic church in northumberland 
 the historic church of northumberland be among the old and most architecturally significant in our country any church can apply for support from the £ building for mission fund the diocese of newcastle be very grateful for the support of the northumbria historic churches trust and other local grant make body my hon friend may also want to encourage his parish to approach some of these excellent charity 
 st mary ’s church in woodhorn in my constituency have not be in operation for worship since it be of the old most historic church in northumberland if not the country it be under the care of northumberland county council now but it be in a dilapidated state can my hon friend give i some advice on who i can contact within the church to see whether it can support the church to ensure that it be part not just of the history of our wonderful county but of its future 
 my hon friend rightly highlight that st mary ’s church in his constituency be of the old and it be a charming example of wonderful architecture i understand some of the challenge that he mention as the church have be close for a long period of time it would be wonderful to see church such as that reopen we would all like to see church open as oppose to closed as many of they be as a grade i list building on the national heritage list for england it be eligible for grant for repair and renovation i be happy to write to my hon friend with a list of grant make body i will ask church house for further advice on who he can speak to as well as work together to see whether we can get his church reopen 
 it be not just in northumberland where there be many historic church the village of ashby cum fenby in my constituency have recently show that the local community will come together to support their local church but vital to that be leadership with priest spread throughout so many different parish it become more and more difficult to provide that leadership can the hon lady give an assurance that the church will do all it can to ensure that our small village be not neglect and that there be regular service and leadership by the ordain priest 
 there be only a tenuous link there so good luck with that 
 i agree with you mr speaker but i congratulate the hon member on try so diligently on that question what i will say be that i will happily write to he with a response to that if that be okay 
 what assessment the church have make of the effectiveness of the anglican al ahli hospital in gaza 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for turn our attention to gaza only of gaza ’s hospital be still in operation offer mainly basic care the anglican run al ahli hospital have remain operational despite face huge difficulty thank to    the dedication of its hard work staff and the leadership of its director suhaila tarazi last week it be announce that the hospital be to receive £ of support from the un development programme as well as the palestinian american medical association but this vital work can not begin without an immediate ceasefire and a pathway to peace 
 i thank my hon friend for her answer hon member will have note the progress that have be make on a ceasefire in lebanon but as she have just mention without a ceasefire in gaza the £ that have be allocate to the al ahli hospital by the un development programme will not be spend give the scale of the humanitarian crisis the desperate need for medical aid and the onset of winter that be likely to lead to far suffering and a great number of death 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we all welcome the ceasefire arrangement between israel and lebanon but we need a ceasefire in gaza the community in northern gaza be reliant on the anglican al ahli hospital for much of its healthcare the hospital be see more than emergency patient a day and have to use the library and historic church as ward give that the rest of the hospital have be largely destroy by the israeli force a ceasefire be essential but we also need humanitarian aid to get in as well as vital medical supply fuel and other resource so that the rebuilding of infrastructure can begin we know that there be huge challenge in relation to access be give at checkpoint in gaza

 friday december the house will not be sit 
 i be sure that the whole house will want to join i in wish a very happy thanksgiving day to all our american friend and family and a happy big birthday today to the clerk the joe root of the parliamentary estate huge thank to he for his stylish and expert century half century i should say 
 mr speaker a man of your wide culture and extensive learning will doubtless be familiar with the film mad max i be no expert but the image that it conjure up of a desolate chaotic landscape with wreckage strew everywhere be the perfect metaphor for the government ’s recent budget 
 let we take hospice for example in herefordshire we be bless to have the extraordinary st michael ’s hospice st michael ’s support hundred of in patient a year with end of life care and thousand more as out patient and with visit in the community it have a dedicated staff assist by some volunteer this be extraordinary i shudder to think what it would cost the state to provide that kind and quality of care certainly more than £ a year what have this labour budget do to st michael ’s hospice the change to national insurance alone will cost the hospice an extra £ next year but that be only part of it at the same time the budget have directly and indirectly push   up the wage bill by a further £ that be £ annually in extra cost a vast amount for an organisation that offer incredible care and actually save the nhs £ a year hospice in almost every constituency will be affect and so be the interest of almost every colleague in this house 
 this disastrous outcome be clearly never intend by the treasury it be another completely unnecessary blunder with potentially tragic consequence as with gps pharmacy and mental health and social care charity no compensation whatsoever have be offer for this tax raid when will the government publish a proper impact assessment and explain why none have be offer 
 there be a direct link here to the issue of assist dying in the word of the health secretary no less 
 i do not think that palliative care end of life care in this country be in a condition yet where we be give people the freedom to choose without be coerce by the lack of support available 
 that care be now be deliberately worsen by his own chancellor personally i feel strongly pull in both direction by both side but thing no can be in any doubt about be that the government have no business try to rush this legislation through the house by proxy the text of the bill be publish barely week prior to our vote tomorrow no impact assessment or legal issue analysis have be publish far from public debate precede legislation legislation have precede debate that be completely the wrong way around 
 we can be perfectly clear about this all member   of parliament be recently send a dossier by the   promoter of the bill entitle your question answer unfortunately far from answer key question the dossier fail even to touch on a whole series of important issue those include the bill ’s impact on the medical profession and the relationship between medical staff and patient its impact on the provision and regulation of the different drug and drug cocktail require the record to date and protocol to be use in case an initial attempt at assist die fail and what the inevitable for profit industry exploit the new law will look like and how we should feel about it 
 as the senior judge sir james munby highlight there be a host of question about involve the judiciary in the process and the balance of probability test for coercion most profoundly of all there be the question of what choice and dignity actually mean in different contexts none of those matter be even mention in the dossier purport to give the answer whatever feel about the issue of assist die itself as i say i feel very pulled in both direction this absence of debate especially with so many new member in the house be a matter of the grave public concern as the house well know the government themselves be all over the place on the issue 
 in ask for an assessment of the bill ’s likely impact on the nhs the health secretary be do exactly the right thing prepare civil servant and clinician for what could be a huge change and ask they to look at a crucial question that have not even be address let alone properly answer as for the justice secretary she be attack by none other than her own labour predecessor lord falconer of thoroton for impose her view but his lordship somehow miss that she be also make the argument that it be inappropriate   in principle for the state to get involve in what many term assist suicide that too be yet another issue that have barely be discuss i ask the right hon lady whether she share my view that it be a tragedy that colleague be be ask to vote without full and proper consideration of the vital issue i have mention 
 i join the right hon gentleman in congratulate the clerk of the house on his very special birthday as someone recently on the other side of that same special birthday obviously i know i do not look it i welcome he to the half century club and i hope his party be as good as mine be we will leave that conversation for another day 
 this week we mark white ribbon day i be proud that this government have pledge to halve violence against woman and girl i be also proud to have announce the debate on lord etherton ’s review of the treatment of lgbt veteran today i be particularly pleased for my friend and manchester resident carl austin behan who after year of decorate service in the raf be dismiss the day the raf find out he be gay he deserve recognition and much more as do many other 
 i know that the shadow leader of the house be fairly new to opposition like most of his colleague but i gently say to he that the idea of opposition be to oppose the government not his own record in government last week he attack our plan to meet climate goal yet when he be the minister with responsibility for decarbonisation he seem to take a very different view tour the studio to champion net here we be yet again he be attack our plan on national insurance contribution but i check the record and notice that when his government raise national insurance contribution and not just on business but on worker he be the financial secretary to the treasury at the time and say in defence of the measure from this very dispatch box 
 it be a profoundly conservative thing to do”—[official report   september vol c. 
 he seem to have be for it then but be against it now i be not sure what his position be i be quite confused about it 
 may i say to the hospice that he mention and to the many hospice like it that we have make a record investment in the nhs the hospice sector be leave on its knee by the right hon gentleman ’s government as he know the health secretary will soon come to the house to explain how the record allocation of resource that he have receive will be distribute include to the hospice sector 
 the right hon gentleman raise the assisted die issue that we will discuss tomorrow i must say i think it be regrettable that he have choose this opportunity to raise those matter in such an unnecessarily political fashion this issue generate very emotive response on both side and i hope that tomorrow ’s debate will be conduct in a respectful considerate non partisan and non political manner he ask about time and scrutiny which i have mention before as leader of the house i be very confident that the bill will undergo sufficient scrutiny and will have sufficient time for consideration 
 as i have say before from the dispatch box the government will of course implement the will of the house whatever it may be and as i have also say before should the house choose to give the bill its   reading the government will of course work with the bill ’s promoter to ensure that the bill and the policy be workable operable and implement that will mean work with the promoter on tidy up any measure where necessary the department of health and social care be get to work straightaway on what the bill will mean in term of implementation assessment and the documentation that the right hon gentleman highlight should the house decline to give the bill its reading then of course that work would not happen as i have say before after several week in committee the opportunity for the bill to return to the house will not be until the end of april that be a considerable amount of time for the government to do that work and consider the bill far 
 this year mark the anniversary of the summerland disaster on the isle of man in which people include child lose their life after a fire engulf the summerland leisure complex my constituent valerie daniels and her young sister be both impact by that horrify tragedy young man from warrington die in the fire a report into the disaster be release in the follow year and catalogue a series of failure from the design of the building to the fire safety regulation but to date no individual or group have be single out for blame for what happen will my right hon friend find time for a debate on the issue so that survivor and the family of those who lose their life can finally get justice 
 i be really sorry to hear about that tragedy that affect my hon friend ’s constituent these be incredibly pertinent issue one that we should be debate in this house she might want to raise they as part of the grenfell inquiry debate that will take place next week if not i be sure there will be other opportunity for she to raise they 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 yesterday mark fuel poverty awareness day and just last week ofgem unveil another increase to the energy price cap for this winter an increase of in january this follow a rise in october and multiple occasion on which the government have fail to prioritise energy support for this winter for example the warm home discount scheme will not benefit household until and financial energy support for pensioner be remove under change to the winter fuel payment recent polling from the warm this winter campaign have find that almost half of those polled—47%—are worried about how they will stay warm this winter when can the house expect a statement from the government on tackle fuel poverty this winter 
 i thank the hon lady for that question i also notice that her leader be out on the airwave today with a separate campaign i wish he well with that and hope that he be not another hit wonder when it come to those issue 
 we have inherit a really difficult situation when it come to energy supply and energy price as the hon lady know the energy price cap be set by ofgem and reflect its consideration of how energy be buy a few month ago we be take this issue incredibly   seriously which be why we have a plan to get to net by it be only by switch our energy supply to renewable that we will be able to bring price down for long and have the energy security we so desperately need 
 the hon lady ask about the situation this winter particularly for pensioner and other she will know that there be the £ warm home discount as well as cold weather payment that will get trigger we have extend the £ household support fund into this winter that payment of either £ or £ be now be make in place such as manchester to those on council tax support so just above the pension credit threshold we have also see the big ever increase in the number of people apply for pension credit so we be take action we will support people this winter but more importantly we will take the long term action that we need to get our energy bill low 
 liverpool woman ’s hospital in my constituency offer the only specialist gynaecology and maternity service in the country yet those service be under threat due to the nhs case for change will the leader of the house grant a debate in government time to consider the necessity of retain those specialist service at the current crown street site 
 i be very familiar with the important service in my hon friend ’s liverpool constituency that she describe the hospital programme we inherit from the previous government be a work of fiction and we be determined to make sure that any commitment around local hospital service be both deliverable and fundable that be what we be set out to do but i will certainly make sure that the health secretary have hear my hon friend ’s plea today and that she get a full reply about her local hospital
