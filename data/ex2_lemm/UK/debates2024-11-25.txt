 i pay tribute to the local authority emergency service volunteer and all those affect by storm bert in cardiff in rhondda cynon taf and across south wales may i ask my right hon friend to speak to colleague in the department for science innovation and technology about look carefully into the role of the met office it be clear that its response be slow and that there be an underestimation of the impact of storm bert it put out a yellow rather than an amber or red warning our constituent have be let down by this incompetence before it can not keep happen 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to tackle serious and organised crime 
 the government be increase funding for the national crime agency by £ next year with £ over the next year for the border security command to tackle organise immigration crime the whole house will welcome the recent action by the national crime agency to arrest major suspect in people smuggler gang 
 i applaud the work of the border security command and the nca in those operation will the home secretary join i in thank greater manchester police for their work in tackle organise crime group particularly the notorious adam ocg in rochdale whose drug dealing modern slavery and child exploitation make life such a misery for my resident will she particularly applaud chief superintendent danny inglis and his team not just for their superb detective work but for their engagement with school 
 i join my hon friend in congratulate greater manchester police and the national crime agency on that operation which have make people safe on the street of rochdale tackle organise drug crime mean action stretch from international work by the nca right through to neighbourhood police on the street and community work to prevent young people from be draw into organise gang 
 the home secretary know that rural area be not immune to county line activity will she put on record her thank for the excellent work of west mercia police who recently arrest quite a few people on charge relate to drug and firearm what more can the national crime agency and particularly the multi agency co ordination centre do to support rural force and small force such as west mercia 
 i certainly welcome the work that have be do to tackle the gang the right hon gentleman refer to such crime have a huge impact on community we need the national crime agency work not just through the regional organise crime unit but with local force right through to the neighbourhood police on the beat that be often where the intelligence come from especially where child be be drag in 
 i know the home secretary understand the importance of our brave firearm officer in deal with serious and organised crime that pose a danger to the public i welcome the measure to provide anonymity but will the government consider go far by allow a defence in misconduct or criminal proceeding if an officer can show that they follow their training and procedure 
 the hon gentleman will know that we set out very swiftly the response to the accountability review that include a series of measure not just on anonymity but on strengthen the law and on the need for the system to work much more speedily to support officer in very difficult split decision we have a review under way involve tim godwin and sir adrian fulford which be look at many of these issue 
 what step her department be take to help tackle antisocial behaviour on high street and in town centre 
 what step her department be take to help tackle antisocial behaviour on high street and in town centre 
 what step she be take to improve safety in town centre 
 too many town centre and high street have be hit in recent year by soar level of shoplifting and street crime and damage antisocial behaviour at the same time as neighbourhood police have be heavily cut the government be introduce new power to tackle antisocial behaviour and shop crime and rebuild neighbourhood police on our street 
 too often in recent year antisocial behaviour have blight our high street with people in clwyd east feel unsafe when they be out in their local community we know that neighbourhood policing work in prestatyn the recent work of north wales police to combat antisocial behaviour at the retail centre have lead to positive youth engagement and criminal charge do the home secretary agree that rather than write off such offence as low level and leave community to deal with they alone as the previous government do we must prioritise neighbourhood police and give officer the power they need to tackle antisocial behaviour head on 
 my hon friend be exactly right and i congratulate she on stand up for her town centre when town centre crime get out of control it impact on local business and local confidence and it impact badly on community that be why we be bring in respect order under which repeat perpetrator can be ban from town centre and set out our plan to have more neighbourhood police and police community support officer back on our street 
 i thank my right hon friend for that helpful answer many resident in my constituency flag up the real problem with antisocial behaviour in both sheerness and sittingbourne town centre windows have be smash in church hall and shop window be smash when the christmas light be be put on i be see this all the time can she please tell i what help she be offer kent police to support my resident face this behaviour 
 my hon friend make a really important point as well as our plan to increase neighbourhood policing and introduce respect order we be go to get rid of the ludicrous £ rule that we inherit from the conservatives which mean that shoplifting be very often not properly investigate that need to be take much more seriously 
 this morning i have the pleasure of meet sunny the new store manager at the hotel chocolat in uxbridge which open today unfortunately during that joyous occasion he tell i all too familiar story about the shoplifting and antisocial behaviour that blight our high street will the home secretary assure i that the of the met police ’s time that be take up with london wide and national policing issue will be take into account when allocate the met ’s budget so that we have the resource we need and crucially the police we need back on our high street 
 my hon friend make an important point i can tell he that we have already provide met police with an initial £ this year to fund the police pay increase that be not fund by the previous conservative government we be also support neighbourhood police right across the country and much strong action not just on shop theft but on assault against shop worker a truly disgraceful crime 
 as a former police and crime commissioner for lancashire i work very closely with the last government on operation centurion which be about really focus in on antisocial behaviour through more visible patrol and well partnership work we know that a lot of antisocial behaviour be egg on by a very small minority and some of the most serious crime relate to antisocial behaviour be drive by that small minority without restrict freedom ban order do not work and engagement with youth offend team do not work because they be all voluntary what measure do the government intend to bring in as part of their new tolerance zone that will be different from what currently exist to make it really tolerance 
 the hon member be right that sometimes it be a small minority who be make life a total nightmare for everyone else the current antisocial   behaviour injunction just be not strong enough because very often they do not come with a power of arrest that be why we be introduce respect order which mean that repeat perpetrator can be ban from town centre they will have a power of arrest so that swift action can be take if they be breach 
 antisocial behaviour and crime on our high street be well tackle with a visible police presence but police officer in my constituency be spend a hour round trip take those they be arrest to worthe custody centre when we have a perfectly fit for purpose custody centre in chichester do the home secretary agree that open chichester custody centre would reduce the time that police officer spend sit in traffic and get they back on our street 
 the hon member make an important point there be often additional challenge for rural area or area where neighbourhood police may have to travel and it be important that we maintain and increase neighbourhood police right across the board in all area she will know that many of the issue around the location of centre be operational decision for police force but i will pass the issue she have raise on to her police and crime commissioner 
 the cherry tree community centre on the swinemoor estate in beverley provide support for up to young people in the area despite not have any permanent premise it have plan permission and some money from the national lottery but could i please meet the right hon lady or of her colleague to discuss how we can find the funding for the right premise to support young people in swinemoor and across beverley 
 i will happily ensure that the right hon member be able to have a meeting with of the team we believe that introduce youth hub be part of the prevention work that we need particularly as part of new prevention partnership to stop young people be draw into crime we also need a new strong law on child criminal exploitation 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the use of illegal high power sur ron type e bike by criminal gang on and around our high street be cause significant concern particularly in london with incident of antisocial behaviour violent mugging and phone theft become increasingly more common can the home secretary please update the house on discussion her department have have with the mayor of london and the commissioner of the metropolitan police on what they be do to reduce these incident and make our street safe across london 
 the hon member be right to refer to the issue around antisocial and criminal use not just of e bike sometimes e scooter be use illegally on pavement and off road bike cause havoc in local neighbourhood that be why we will strengthen the law around vehicle use for antisocial behaviour so that they can be seize when that antisocial behaviour take place and the police do not have to go through a whole ritual of a series of warning which delay action 
 what step her department be take to improve intelligence sharing follow the terrorist incident in forbury gardens in reading in 
 the horrendous attack in forbury gardens in reading claim the life of people and it be all the more agonising for their love one that the subsequent inquest conclude that it be avoidable the home secretary and i be oversee the implementation of commitment make in response to the inquest and we be determined that all the lesson learn from this terrible incident be act on 
 i thank the minister for his response james furlong david wails and joe ritchie bennett be murder in the forbury gardens terrorist attack in reading in the coroner find major problem with intelligence sharing between authority which be underline in the prevention of future death report publish in may alongside other gary furlong my constituent and the father of james be demand that this be not just another report that sit on a shelf gathering dust what action will my right hon friend the home secretary take to make permanent change on the back of this attack will she agree to meet gary furlong and i to discuss progress in due course 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this very important issue our deep condolence be with the love one of james joseph and david follow their tragic death i assure my hon friend and the family that we will do everything in our power to stop this happen again we will of course be happy to meet the family to discuss change make and i would be happy to meet my hon friend and her constituent to discuss the matter far 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 i be sure that the thought of the whole house will be with the family of the read victim and the victim of other terror attack 
 jonathan hall kc the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation have say that as much information as possible should be put into the public domain as early as possible to maintain public trust can the minister assure the house that he and his ministerial colleague have always disclose relevant information at an early stage in relation to high profile terror relate case that have attract substantial public and medium attention 
 the shadow home secretary have raise an important issue yes we agree with jonathan hall he be absolutely right our overriding priority will always be to ensure that the victim of crime get justice and we will look at how good that can be achieve 
 what step her department be take to help tackle shoplifting and violence against shop worker 
 what step her department be take to help tackle shoplifting and violence against shop worker 
 what step she be take to help tackle retail crime 
 in the last year of the previous government shop theft reach a record high and we see intolerable level of abuse against shop worker leave people fearful of go to work this government will not stand by as these crime devastate our high street and town centre that be why we be commit to rebuild neighbourhood policing scrap the £ limit which have let thief steal below the level with impunity and introduce a new stand alone offence of assault a retail worker 
 our shop worker will be put in some long hard shift in the come week to help we to get ready for christmas but a report from the union of shop distributive and allied workers have say that their risk of be the victim of assault in the workplace have double in the last year will my right hon friend join i in commending usdaw ’s freedom from fear campaign and affirm that the government ’s commitment to remove the immunity from certain type of shoplifting introduce by the conservative government will proceed at pace 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for highlight usdaw ’s finding and its tireless campaign alongside the co op for the new stand alone offence of assault a retail worker which we will be proud to introduce in the forthcoming crime and police bill alongside the scrapping of the £ limit i take this opportunity to recognise the commitment of cleveland ’s police and crime commissioner matt storey in tackle retail crime i look forward to work with all police and crime commissioner to tackle this scourge on our community 
 shoplifting be a crime that threaten the feeling of safety for shopper and shop worker alike in my constituency of east worthing and shoreham the issue have become so severe that in the past year a resident have describe it as an epidemic can my right hon friend please tell i how the government plan to tackle this issue so that shopper and business in my area can operate in safety and with confidence 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that people in east worthing and shoreham and across the entire country want to know how this government be go to tackle this epidemic i have refer to the neighbourhood police officer respect order the abolition of the £ threshold limit and the stand alone offence of assault a shop worker i want to restore confidence in the people my hon friend represent confidence that will make they feel their street be safe and ensure that criminal in their area pay the price for their crime 
 my constituency team and i recently visit shop on of the busy high street in my constituency of the we visit say that their staff have suffer attack at work and all say   that shoplifting be now pretty much a daily occurrence do the minister agree that extra resource and extra policing be part of the answer but that we should also be look at programme such as offender to rehab scheme of which have be roll out in the west midland to make sure we be also tackle the cause of retail crime 
 my hon friend paint a deeply upsetting and unacceptable picture of the impact that aggressive and repeat shop theft can have on retail worker the bad thing be that we know that it be replicate up and down the entire country we can not continue like this that be why we be determined to take the action that i have set out in previous answer but i agree that we have to look at issue around rehabilitation for offender include treatment for addiction where appropriate 
 bath be a very popular tourist and shopping destination but it have also see the high increase in shoplifting offence between and for my shopkeeper to feel safe they want a much more visible police presence in bath what can the government do for they 
 the hon lady be absolutely right shop theft go up by in the previous year which be totally unacceptable and i hear very clearly what she say about her constituency of bath that be why the neighbourhood police model that this labour government stand on at the general election be so important for start to deal with shop theft which as we have just be talk about have become an epidemic 
 the home secretary have repeatedly reiterate her pledge to tackle shoplifting and violence against shop worker by have a name officer in each community as part of the uplift for neighbourhood policing i speak to cambridgeshire constabulary recently which confirm that under the home secretary ’s plan there would be police officer to cover the whole town of st ives that officer would cover not only st ives but the town of ramsey and all the village in between woodhurst old hurst pidley warboys wistow and bury last week the policing minister would not commit to review the police allocation formula to ensure cambridgeshire receive its fair share of funding how can officer be expect to cover such a large area effectively give that cambridgeshire be likely to receive only a handful of the officer 
 i say gently to the hon member that he have to look at what this government inherit from his conservative government after year during which neighbourhood policing be repeatedly cut this government be commit to restore neighbourhood policing we have say that we will bring in police officer police community support officer and special 
 when 
 the shadow home secretary be shout when at i we be work on this as quickly as we can month in after year of what the conservatives do to our policing 
 shoplifting be often organise by criminal gang and norfolk police have have some success in fight they do the minister recognise that partnership such as operation wonderland which have just be launch by west norfolk police alongside the local council cctv operator street ranger and shop worker be key to tackle this crime and make sure offender be bring to justice 
 the hon gentleman make a very important point police alone can not deal with this crime we need to work hand in hand with business as well as the trade union usdaw have be very important in the campaign for the offence of assault a shop worker that we be go to bring in i have also meet the british retail consortium and will chair a regular forum with the retail sector to make sure we be share good practice we be go to deal with the problem we have inherit 
 i call the shadow minister 
 of the good way to help tackle retail crime be to put more police on the street the last conservative government do just that—[interruption the last conservative government do just that deliver record number of police with more funding than ever before but we be not stop there this year the conservative government increase frontline police funding by £ will the minister commit to matching or even improve that figure next year 
 i do not know if it be just amnesia on that side of the house but i think the shadow minister need to reflect on what we actually inherit pcso cut by special down by third and over police officer cut under the conservative administration so a little bit of humility about what they have leave we with would go down very well 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the afghan citizen resettlement scheme 
 we be determined to honour our commitment to those who support we in afghanistan and who stand up for freedom and democracy place their own life at risk to date the afghan scheme have bring over people to safety in the uk include thousand through the afghan citizen resettlement scheme we aim to continue to relocate eligible individual through our establish scheme as quickly as possible 
 a major issue of concern for afghans who have be here since the opening of the scheme be that their residency permit be now up for renewal i be sure the government do not want to render illegal those whom we welcome to the uk can we have some guidance from the home office about some of the question that people have ask i where do people go for renewal how be the home office   respond to those who have have several change of address and if there be a cost what happen to those who can not pay 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and for all her work for those who be here from afghanistan we continue to seek to email and notify all individual currently resettle in the uk whom we be aware of and i will certainly continue to discuss with she the method we be use for those face other issue 
 my constituent dr lubna hadoura be an nhs consultant who desperately want to be able to care for her year old mother a refugee displace from gaza early this year who be now alone in egypt and unable to care for herself will the minister assure i that her application for an adult dependent relative visa will be carefully humanely and properly consider 
 i be not quite sure that that be actually about the resettlement scheme but okay 
 i thank my hon friend for her question the death and destruction in gaza be intolerable and i assure she that that application be be look at very closely and she should be receive an update very soon 
 what step her department be take to help tackle domestic abuse 
 the government have set out an unprecedented mission to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade i say this on white ribbon day and it be good to see everybody wear their white ribbon we be determined to tackle the scourge of domestic abuse in all its form from early raneem ’s law which will embed domestic abuse specialist team into control room in order to improve the police response to domestic abuse crime will ensure that victim get a swift and specialist response when they call for help we will also finally launch the pilot of the domestic abuse protection order and roll they out across the country which the previous government fail to do year after the fact of the law change so we will be provide strong protection for survivor and ensure that perpetrator be properly monitor and manage 
 i thank the minister for her response my constituent samantha billingham be a domestic abuse survivor who now run training session on coercive control coercive control be a thread that run throughout all abuse and i be shocked to hear that it do not form a core part of the training for the police social worker or any other domestic violence training will the minister meet i and samantha to ensure that coercive control form a key part of domestic violence training 
 i have meet samantha billingham a local west midland legend campaign in this space a number of time and i share my hon friend ’s shock at the lack of knowledge about coercive control all police social worker and other in contact with victim of domestic abuse ought to be aware of coercive control and its insidious effect on the victim and of course i would be delighted to meet she 
 there be a significant disparity in sentencing for murder base on whether a weapon be take to the scene of a domestic crime or be already present sentence for murderer who use a weapon already available at the crime scene start year low than sentence for those who bring a weapon with they do the minister agree that this disparity must be tackle 
 i thank the hon lady and pay tribute to julie devey and carole gould of the parent who be fight this campaign a ministry of justice sentencing review be currently ongoing and i know that carole and julie and members here will want to feed into that 
 what step her department be take to help prevent young people from become involve in violent crime 
 the epidemic of knife crime that have grow over the last decade be devastating family and community right across the country that be why this government have set ourselves an unprecedented mission to halve knife crime over the next year we be already take action to get lethal blade off britain ’s street and take strong action against illegal online knife sale we be also determined to stop young people be draw into violent crime and county line in the place which be why we be deliver a radical new young future prevention programme with target intervention to help at risk young people and a network of new youth hub 
 i thank the minister for meet i recently as she say too many young people be be draw into county line suffer exploitation and violence this be a significant problem across the country include in norwich many organisation be work hard locally to improve the situation such as the joe dix foundation establish by his parent after joe ’s tragic murder in can the minister reassure i that the government be invest all they can in preventive measure and set out what be be do to support organisation on the frontline 
 it be a great pleasure to meet my hon friend just last week to discuss this issue organisation like the joe dix foundation do amazing work to help keep people safe and keep young people out of county line gang in particular and through the home office county line programme we be go after exploitative gang and provide specialist support for child and young people our young future programme will establish those prevention partnership in every local authority to identify child and young people at risk 
 the minister speak of the young future programme will she work with the northern ireland executive to put in place the same programme so that we can prevent young people in northern ireland from join paramilitary organisation which be nothing more than organised and violent crime organisation 
 i can certainly talk to ministers in the northern ireland office to discuss what we can learn from the propose programme and the good practice we know exist already in many part of the uk we want to build on that so i be very happy to share that 
 what step her department be take to help tackle car theft in rural area 
 who want to answer this 
 sorry mr speaker these question be like bus they all come along at once 
 vehicle theft be a deeply distressing and damaging crime which can have a detrimental effect on both individual and business include in rural community that be why we be work closely with both the police and the automotive industry to ensure the most robust response possible to these crime last week i meet with the national police chiefs council lead for vehicle crime to discuss this issue and how we can well work together to prevent it 
 an increase in car and van theft and antisocial behaviour in stocksbridge deepcar high green chapeltown and dodworth have leave my constituent feel vulnerable and unsafe local people have also experience excessive response time how be the minister tackle the rise in vehicle theft work with manufacturer to improve vehicle safety and support south yorkshire police after year of conservative cut 
 i be pleased that this question be be ask and it be important to note that this autumn drive by the national police chiefs council lead for vehicle crime the national vehicle crime reduction partnership have be launch bring together the police the home office and manufacturer on the very point of how we tackle this problem we be also commit to bring forward legislation to ban electronic device use to steal vehicle empower the police and court to target those criminal use manufacture and supply they 
 that be a welcome answer from the minister farmer in wiltshire complain not just about car theft which be endemic but wide agricultural theft too and the terrible scourge of hare course it be all bind up in serious organise crime do the minister recognise the seriousness of organise rural crime of this nature and what step be she take to address it 
 the hon gentleman make an important point i recently meet the agricultural engineers association to discuss the implementation of the equipment theft prevention act which he will know be   important in tackle some of that rural crime with agricultural equipment that have be steal often by organise gang there be work ongoing on this and the issue be recognise by the home office 
 what step her department be take to increase public trust and confidence in policing 
 public confidence in policing fall under the last conservative government as we see a big drop in police on the beat with few crime solve and a real sense in community that more criminal be get away with it this government be determined to turn that around start with get police back on the beat and rebuild neighbourhood policing 
 early this month i hold a community meeting in dinnington about the regeneration project on the high street it be well attend and people be optimistic but they be also worried about the lack of police in the area and the crime that continue to blight their town can the home secretary reassure the resident of dinnington that this government will rebuild community policing which be utterly let down over year of conservative government 
 my hon friend be exactly right the percentage of people see police on the beat each week have drop by third over the past year the percentage of people who say they never see the police have double that be the shameful consequence of year of conservative police policy this government will put more police and police community support officer back on the beat 
 local volunteer in potters bar be leave struggle on remembrance sunday to stop the traffic to allow the march to take place they be tell by the police that they lack the resource and the power to stop the traffic yet on the same day in neighbour essex the police manage to visit a journalist regard a delete tweet every weekend vast amount of resource pour into london for pro palestinian march do the home secretary share the despair of my constituent at this allocation of resource and will she provide guidance for next year ’s remembrance service both on police power and the responsibility regard those march 
 i just point out to the former deputy prime minister that the state of police in this country be the policing that we inherit after year of conservative government in which they take police off the beat and in which we lose neighbourhood policing and pcso this government have make clear what the priority for policing should be neighbourhood policing include tackle antisocial behaviour and town centre crime and reduce serious violence include knife crime and violence against woman and girl we always believe that remembrance day should be respect which be something that of his former colleague as home secretary do not respect 
 i call the act shadow minister 
 more than non crime hate incident have be log by uk police force in the past year include against schoolchildren as young as for classroom insult this be estimate to have take hour of police time and undermine public trust and confidence in policing the last government tighten the guidance and it have be widely report this morning that the home secretary will update it again how will the right hon lady know if her change have work what be the metric and be there a target if the change do not work will she restrict investigation to take place only when there be an imminent risk of an actual crime 
 i welcome the hon member to her act role i be not sure how long she be act for we have make clear what we believe the priority should be for policing neighbourhood police and reduce serious violence on our street and that should be the case across the board we should have a common sense approach to police decision in every area across the country on the issue she raise the inspectorate have recently do a report which find inconsistency in a whole series of area we believe that its recommendation need to be take immensely seriously by force across the country 
 what step her department be take to help keep child safe online 
 there be nothing more important for the government than keep our child safe that be why i be appal by the volume of child abuse that be proliferate online and why we be determined to act we be committed to robust implementation of the online safety act which contain strong protection for child but we will not hesitate to go far if tech company fail to play their part our investment in the national crime agency gchq an undercover online network of police officer and the tackle organise exploitation programme be support our effort to keep child safe online by target and stop the high harm and most technically sophisticated offender 
 i greatly welcome the action that the government be take but the fight against child sex abuse online be only as strong as its weak link and facebook ’s decision to allow the encrypt sharing of image make it a very weak link indeed do the minister share my anger that facebook appear to be turn a blind eye while its platform become a safe haven for paedophile 
 my hon friend raise an extremely serious issue i assure he that we very much share his concern the home secretary have meet representative from meta and our official be in regular contact what we say in all those discussion be very simple for year meta have be an industry leader when it come to prevent and detect child sex abuse online and   what we all want to see be it continue to play that positive role and not as my hon friend fear go in the opposite direction 
 my constituent lose his son to suicide follow exposure to an online suicide forum he be sadly of know britons the young of whom be just whose death have be link to this site under the online safety act the technology secretary have the power to include such small but very dangerous site under category the most heavily regulate category but ofcom have advise he against do so will the minister press her colleague in the department for science innovation and technology to include these exceptionally dangerous site in category 
 i pay tribute to the hon member ’s constituent it be unimaginable for any parent to have to go through something like that we at the home office be work incredibly closely with our dsit colleague as the online safety act come into force to ensure that it be as strong and robust as it can be we be have those conversation daily 
 what step her department be take to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what step her department be take with police force to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 what support she be provide to local organisation to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 the scale of violence against woman and girl in our country be intolerable and the government will treat it as a national emergency as part of this mission we be bring together minister from right across government so that every department do its bit from prevention work in school through to relentless pursuit of dangerous perpetrator on top of that work we have already begin strengthen the police response to domestic abuse we will mark the next day of activism with further announcement on our work to tackle spike stalk and other vawg crime 
 charity such as aylesbury women ’s aid do brilliant and vital work to support survivor of domestic abuse however when these survivor interact with other public face service such as emergency or healthcare service they be not always meet with the same level of understanding what measure be the minister take to ensure that survivor of domestic violence and abuse be meet with a trauma inform approach across all public service 
 a massive thank you to aylesbury women ’s aid for the amazing work that it be clearly do i be afraid that my hon friend and victim be exactly right in their assessment that be why we must have a completely cross government approach to ensure   that no matter where a victim stand up all service take responsibility for their role in the life of those who be suffer 
 as   the hon member for stourbridge cat eccles   point out coercive control be a criminal offence but it be often overlook despite research suggest that it be the high risk factor in domestic homicide in my surgery in esher and walton victim have tell i that there be not a sufficient understanding of coercive control in police interview particularly when other crime be be investigate what assessment be be make of the effectiveness of the roll out of the domestic abuse risk assessment dara toolkit which be introduce by the college of policing in 
 a number of different risk assessment tool be use whether dara or dash the domestic abuse stalking harassment and honour base violence risk assessment which have a more historical grounding and be use more widely i want the hon lady to know that it be impossible to read any domestic homicide review in our country for the past decade and not think that risk assessment and how well they be use and operate be something that we should look at 
 will the minister join i in thank the incredible staff at the sandycroft centre in my constituency who offer life save support for vulnerable people in time of crisis will she visit the centre with i to hear from ceo lee mckenzie and the independent sexual violence adviser who be on the frontline tackle increase violence against woman and girl 
 as it be very local to i i take a particular interest in the sandycroft centre such centre be invaluable to vulnerable woman and i would be delighted to visit he and lee it would be a minute drive 
 do the minister agree that local charity like jasmine house which operate in my constituency play a vital role in support woman who have be victim of a sexual crime but in addition to the worry of constantly try to find funding they be concerned about the impact that the government ’s propose increase in employer ’s national insurance will have on their ability to continue provide that help do the minister agree that they should be exempt from the change to national insurance contribution 
 i pay tribute to jasmine house as someone who apply for funding for a similar centre i understand exactly the funding pressure that its staff will face what the sector really need be stability the assurance of more than single year funding which the government be look at and make sure that we mitigate to ensure that there be enough 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 today be the international day for the elimination of violence against women it mark the start of day of global activism on the issue as part of the labour government ’s safe street mission we have set an ambition to halve violence against woman and girl which i hope everyone will be a part of 
 today we be set out new action to tackle the devastating crime of spike with a new stand alone criminal offence to strengthen the police response new specialist training for bar and door staff across the country and new recording measure because we fear that the prevalence be much high than have be previously think and the dangerous criminal responsible need to be catch and stop as we look forward to the festive season everyone should be able to enjoy a night out without have to worry about the safety of their drink and whether they will be able to get home safely 
 i meet constituent at my coffee morning in southall green on friday who raise the constant issue of open drug dealing and antisocial behaviour in the town centre will the secretary of state work with the mayor of london to ensure that we have more police on the street of southall and london as soon as we can 
 my hon friend make an important point we have already give the met an additional £ this year on top of what it be previously allocate we also need to ensure that here and right across the country we have neighbourhood police back in town centre because that be how to tackle not just local drug dealing but antisocial behaviour and other crime that blight community 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 let i start by offer the home secretary a belate congratulation on her appointment have be a minister in that department i know how difficult her job be and i genuinely wish she well in do it we will always seek to work constructively with the government in the national interest i also associate myself with the remark she make about international vawg day international day for the elimination of violence against women and girl since the election people have dangerously and illegally cross the channel a increase on the same period last year why do the right hon lady think the number have go up so much on her watch 
 i thank the shadow home secretary for his opening word i think he describe his time in the home office as his good ministerial job ever give that he be chief secretary to the treasury under liz truss we can perhaps wonder why he be also the immigration minister who i remind he tell the commons and the select committee that he would not rule out use giant wave machine as the way to stop small boat crossing we inherit record high level of small boat crossing in the half of this year we have take action to fix the previous government ’s chaos 
 i be ask the home secretary about her record i be ask the home secretary why small boat crossing have go up during her time in office   perhaps it be because as the national crime agency say we need a deterrent yet she cancel the rwanda deterrent before it even start now we hear ursula von der leyen the european commission president ask european member state to look at offshore processing be that not why it have go up be that not why the minister for border security and asylum admit last week that she be open new hotel instead of close they down 
 seriously what a lot of chaos high level on record that be the month of the last conservative government while the right hon gentleman be in government in fact the number since the summer be not the high on record that unfortunately be his legacy while he be the immigration minister he increase the number of asylum hotel by and increase the number of people in asylum hotel by over seriously he should not try to give lecture to anybody else at all 
 well i be go to give a little lecture if you really want to attack each other can you do it before we get to topical question these question be mean to be short and sweet because otherwise other member will not get in 
 specialist domestic abuse service such as the step in knowsley be face an increase in demand but be have to turn people away due to a lack of funding what more can minister do to support such service 
 i have visit the step and to say that it be run by brilliant merseyside woman would be an underestimation specialist by and for service play an essential role and provide tailor support to victim and survivor we understand the challenge that the sector face in particular with the level of demand their service be currently face all decision on funding after march be subject to the spending review process 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we all want to stop criminal terrorise our community whether they be domestic abuser or shoplifter target our high street live facial recognition be be roll out by our police force include on sutton high street in my constituency but we can not ignore the risk that this technology present facial recognition system be most likely to misidentify black people and woman do nothing to stop crime and far erode trust in our police will the minister introduce clear regulation oversight of live facial recognition such as that which the eu pass last april 
 this be another area where the new incoming labour government be have to look at power and measure bring in by the previous government live facial recognition can have very positive effect but we need to consider whether we need a framework around it that be why i will be host a series of roundtable before christmas to discuss with stakeholder the way forward on this technology 
 the national audit office recently raise serious concern about the previous government ’s decision to buy poor quality expensive and contaminate asylum accommodation at northeye what step be the department take to ensure that asylum accommodation be fit for purpose and represent value for money 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this issue what the national audit office find in its report be not only an appalling process of decision making by member of the previous government but a grotesque waste of £ of taxpayer money just like the waste of £ at raf scampton in contrast the new government be determined to cut asylum accommodation cost by step up decision making reduce the backlog 
 order gregory stafford 
 and increase return 
 order it be the back benchers who do not get in 
 transnational repression by iran china russia and other unfriendly nation continue to be writ large on diaspora population in this country what be the government ’s strategy on transnational repression and will the home secretary reintroduce the last government ’s defend democracy taskforce to monitor incidence 
 the hon gentleman make a good point the taskforce be examine closely the threat that he raise and we shall have more to say about that shortly 
 i be sure that the home secretary would agree that good government be transparent government i have be tell by her department in response to a write parliamentary question that the number of crime commit by illegal migrant be not available through publish statistic i be sure that the home office do hold the datum so will the minister commit to publish it in full 
 there will be a huge drop of immigration relate national statistic at the end of the week 
 brave woman from maltby come to my most recent surgery each tell i about the horrific physical and emotional abuse that they have suffer at the hand of their ex partner they also tell i that the police have ignore non molestation order which as i know from my professional experience before i be call to the bar be far from uncommon what step will the government take to ensure that any relevant court order be give due force 
 my hon friend make an important point there be a serious problem of injunction non molestation order and protection order not be   treat properly that be why we be introduce raneem ’s law which include strong protection order and specialist in control room 
 chelmsford ’s allocation of dispersal accommodation for asylum seeker be more than bed but the number find to date be about a of that number owe to the high demand for and high cost of private rent accommodation in the district what extra support can the minister offer council face the increase cost of housing asylum seeker 
 we be try to co operate much more with local authority so that we can deal with these issue but ultimately the way to deal with they be to get the backlog down and get people out of high price accommodation so that we can integrate they if they be grant asylum 
 i have meet a number of british palestinian family who be try to reunite with their family in gaza part of the entry clearance process require the undertaking of biometric there be no visa centre in gaza and they be unable to leave owe to the closure of the rafah crossing will the home secretary or the minister please indicate whether they be willing to introduce a temporary waiver for biometric so that people can complete the entry clearance process 
 the death and destruction in gaza be intolerable palestinians who wish to join family member in the uk must do so via the range of exist route that be available but if my hon friend wish to raise a specific matter with i i shall be happy to meet she 
 what step be the minister take to tackle crime in rural area 
 as i say early i have meet representative of the agricultural engineers association to discuss the implementation of the secondary legislation that be require to deal with the theft of agricultural equipment and i be also have meeting with the rural crime unit to discuss some of the specific however the neighbourhood policing guarantee apply in rural area just as much as in urban area which be important 
 my constituent tracy set up the organisation change be make in memory of her grandson cameron hamilton who be fatally stab in bournemouth town centre last year tracy believe deeply in the power of education and positive activity to tackle knife crime and be campaign for a youth hub in the constituency can the home secretary update we on the progress be make towards the roll out of a network of youth hub and will she support tracy ’s campaign 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s constituent tracy for campaign in memory of cameron too many young life be be lose that be why we be set up the young futures programme with youth hub but also prevention partnership to work across the country 
 in recent week the number of channel crossing have be far high than the home office expect which be why we have see ministers rapidly approve new asylum hotel we be tell that the situation be temporary because asylum claim be apparently now be process fast and people be be move through accommodation fast too what reassurance can the home secretary give my constituent that the fast processing of asylum claim with no deterrent in the system will not simply act as a massive incentive for more people to come here on small boat 
 i have to tell the hon member that unfortunately the previous government cut asylum decision make by in the run up to the election and they take away caseworker that be why the backlog be soar we have now put caseworker back in place so that we can start clear the backlog because asylum hotel be cost the taxpayer huge amount of money 
 disabled woman be almost time more likely to experience domestic abuse and almost twice as likely to report sexual violence do the minister agree that it be important for not only her department but the police to work with disabled woman lead organisation to understand the intersection with gender base violence and the double whammy that affect disabled woman 
 my hon friend be absolutely right i pay tribute to stay safe east of very few specialist disability and domestic abuse charity without by and for service we simply would not be serve most of the woman in our country who need support 
 a report publish today show that hour be take up each year investigate non crime hate incident do the minister agree that confidence in the police could be restore if they prioritise their time and resource to investigate actual crime rather than hurt feeling 
 this government have make very clear what our priority be around safe street and where the focus should be for policing on halve knife crime and halve violence against woman and girl over the next decade the home secretary have also be very clear that a common sense approach must be take to non crime hate incident we will work with the inspectorate and the college of policing on the matter 
 before i call the prime minister i should like to say a few word about our former colleague lord prescott john be elect to this house in and he serve the people of hull for decade he become deputy leader of the labour party in my father help on that campaign and deputy prime minister at the election 
 i have to say thank to john for come to chorley to ensure that i have a new start as a labour member in chorley i will just share what john do on that day tragically the press push an old lady over and her arm be break the thing john say be i must go to the hospital he go to hospital to see that lady as her cast be be put on that be the kind of person john prescott be 
 john play a major role in deliver the kyoto protocol and be a great champion of regional government integrate transport and affordable housing after leave government he become active in inter parliamentary relation lead the uk delegation to the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe he be an effective politician a highly respect colleague and a tower figure in the labour movement and in this house he will be deeply miss and all our thought be with pauline and the family 
 on a point of order mr speaker thank you for those word which john ’s family will have hear 
 there be many member of this house who serve their constituent faithfully some deliver change for the entire country very few enter into public consciousness let alone public affection but john prescott achieve all those thing he be absolutely unique and people love he for it he have the most extraordinary life from fail his plus to stewarding anthony eden on a cruise ship to be deputy leader of as he describe it 
 the great party there be 
 and the long serve deputy prime minister this country have ever have 
 it be an extraordinary life yet ordinary people across the nation feel that he be of they he tell a story of a working class lad make good who embody the aspiration of work people across the entire country people feel recognise in the struggle they have the snobbery and the small mindedness that still plague politic even today but they also feel that he understand and champion their ambition their hope and their dream 
 john be a politician for work people through and through that be who he always be a proud son of wales and an honorary son of the humber he serve the city of hull for year as you say mr speaker everyone know that he love it as fiercely as he fight for it everything he do be about make work people ’s live well that be evident from his whole career a career in which he be often ahead of his time he lead on climate change fight regional inequality support the minimum wage work to transform   public transport build council house and even complete the channel tunnel in many way he set the path that we walk today make no mistake he do thing his own way and forge his own path and in do so he bring about some of the great transformation this country have ever see 
 john be the linchpin of new labour because beneath the pugnacious exterior he be a skilled negotiator sometimes with immense and perhaps surprising sensitivity he have an incredible skill which be the ability to bring people together from different starting point whether that be in his work on climate negotiation or close to home in his own party to stand together in a well place 
 that sum up another thing that i think the public sense about john that he be not in it for himself he be willing to work with people he do not agree with as well as challenge those he usually do agree with he have great self awareness and great humility and if he disagree fiercely in private he would do so and then defend the line often improve because of his intervention in public to the hilt 
 john be a team player and he be proud to play for team labour that be never more evident than during the campaign season when it be time to bring out the battle bus a tradition that our deputy prime minister proudly continue this year the prescott express be a morale boost to any campaign it may have be arrive in a tesco car park but john be always meet with a reception like beatlemania and no wonder the public be at the heart of john ’s politic and it be clear that the public have a particular place in their heart for he too that be key to his popularity indeed after the famous incident it be the public who come out swing for he that night labour campaigner be anxiously dispatch to the most accurate focus group that there be the local pub to hear what people be say the report be clear the public have his back just as he have always have theirs tony blair my predecessor say simply john be john

 john ’s legacy will always be etch on the heart of those he serve and the city that he love there will never be another jp and no member of this house will ever be able to connect with the voter quite like he do he truly be of a kind john ’s spirit and approach   to politic will live on in all of we who be inspire by he and by his dedication and commitment to the cause rest in peace comrade 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i be never on john prescott ’s christmas card list but i do have the interesting task of shadow he in the early noughtie for year and i feel like i get to know he my respect for he grow though i be never sure whether it be entirely reciprocate i would occasionally tour the media studio with he and on occasion john be get his make up on and clearly have not realise that i be outside the door he say to his aide be that bloody liberal here again 
 we speak more in later year when i be secretary of state for energy and climate change as john always retain a deep and well inform interest in all thing climate with his significant globally recognise role in secure the kyoto climate treaty the government ’s chief climate negotiator in my time the brilliant but sadly depart pete betts have also be john ’s key negotiator at kyoto pete would tell the story of how john ’s sheer energy and staying power be crucial to the success of those negotiation and how john would tour the negotiate room throughout the night utter the great phrase i ’m walk i ’m talk 
 our path also cross in the great city of kingston upon hull when we eventually manage to get siemens to invest in a wind turbine manufacturing facility for offshore wind farm there be a celebration on the day when the sod be turn to build the factory and the reception be hold in what be call the deep a huge tourist attraction which john have play a crucial role in make happen down by the marina in hull the deep be the uk ’s home to several specie of shark as we walk around it be instruct about shark we be reliably inform that shark can be very friendly and though he would never admit it in public john be always very friendly to i he be a trailblazer and an inspiration even plunge into the thames in a wetsuit to make an important point about water pollution exactly the sort of savvy effective campaigning that i for admire john will be miss by very many people so on behalf of bloody liberals everywhere i send my heartfelt condolence to pauline john ’s child and grandchild and all his family and many friend 
 far to that point of order mr speaker as chair of the parliamentary labour party i echo the tribute make by the prime minister and send our thought and love to john ’s family at the plp meeting tonight we will have a chance to reflect on his enormous contribution to the country and the party as a former labour organiser i can tell the house that he be belove by our member they would move mountain in wales to go and see he although he himself say 
 when i do die after year in politic all they will show on the news be second of i thump a fellow in wales 
 the many many tribute over the weekend rightly reflect his immense contribution to the country which should never be underestimate his drive to improve council housing his championing of the minimum wage his   leadership on climate change climate action before it be a thing a true socialist and thoroughly authentic he care only about make people ’s live well 
 to go back to that punch there be many other here today who be close friend with john or who work with he and know he far well than i we be however connect by event for i as a youngish general secretary of the welsh labour party organise his visit to rhyl clearly not very well although he never seem to hold it against i and he do not get i sack which be an enormous relief at the time there be so much that i could say about that day he be a trooper he go back inside immediately after the punch and do this rather strange comedy show at the little theatre but i will not test your patience mr speaker the definitive guide be in matt forde ’s podcast with martin angus which i would recommend to all member for those of we in the background of the footage it never go away although john be right that the clip have be show again a time over the weekend his legacy be always far big than a gif he will be much miss by our big labour family 
 i call the father of the house 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i serve in this place with john prescott for many year and i admire he from afar as be a true labour man and a man of true grit i be not sure that my admiration of he be reciprocate but i hold he in great affection my memory of he be in when i arrive in this place as a new member of parliament i give a speech during which i could see john grunt and look furious he probably think i be an absurd young opinionate thatcherite brat and he be probably right 
 talk of mrs thatcher my next memory of he be when i see he have a quiet supper in the little member canteen we use to have downstair the moment my boss mrs thatcher come in i could see john wave his hand in fury at she for all that she have do neil kinnock lean over and say calm down john calm down i think here be a man of real strong opinion we have so many anaemic politician today i be not look at anybody in particular so it be wonderful to have a man like john prescott on the opposition benches 
 john much mellow and it be a great joy to serve with he on the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe i remember he say that his child want he to go on strictly come dancing but he decide not to that would have be something for the history book john prescott on strictly come dancing 
 as a local member of parliament i pay tribute to john prescott i use to take my child to the deep and he do a great many thing for hull i wish hon member could have watch look north our local television news programme and see the tribute pay by local people who say how love he be in hull and how hard he work for the people he be a great man and he will be sorely miss 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i be deeply sadden to hear about the death of john prescott i send my condolence to pauline his son and all those who be close to he   i consider he to be a good friend of mine and of mansfield he be a giant of a man and a champion of the coalfield devolution local government and climate action 
 i meet john in the 1980 as an activist in the labour party and enjoy support he in his campaign to be deputy leader in and in his campaign to be leader and deputy leader in his legacy include set up the coalfields regeneration trust which be establish to help support former coalfield area in community such as mansfield that have be impact by the pit closure programme of the 1980 and 1990 that help ensure that my area receive million of pound of funding 
 john have a particularly strong link to my constituency of mansfield especially through my labour predecessor sir alan meale who be his parliamentary private secretary for some year anecdotally i can recall many endearing memory of john include a time when we be play table tennis in sir alan ’s front yard in mansfield it be a lovely sunny day and we be enjoy our game in the garden on a day when the prime minister be out of the country on business an important call come through that john have to take and we pause our game to this day i have no idea who it be or what be say but the conversation clearly distract john so much that when he arrive back he hit the ball with such force that it bounce right off the table and hit the ministerial car from that experience i can assure the house that the left hook still pack a mighty punch 
 in the year after john leave office i would often drive he back to the station at newark or doncaster after his many visit to mansfield so he could get the train to london or back home to hull the insight from his frank and honest recollection of history from the blair and brown year will stay with i for a very long time may he rest in peace 
 far to that point of order mr speaker when i arrive in the house it be common in the conservative party the thatcherite conservative party i say to my right hon friend   the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh to view john prescott as public enemy no it be an act that he love play into in public at least that be say outside the studio or the chamber he be friendly and helpful certainly to i indeed he be almost the good possible constituency neighbour could want 
 john prescott be quintessentially a working class hero an identity that i suspect the current deputy prime minister also adopt of course he be a brilliant constituency ally and a forceful defender of the interest of the people of hull with the emphasis on force however he be also a necessary champion of the new labour party the prime minister refer implicitly to the fact that john prescott deliver man vote we should remember that it be an act of huge courage for he to take on his own union ally i think at about hour ’s notice and persuade they to support the neophyte tony blair 
 frankly despite the snobbery of the london establishment about john prescott ’s education it be a very unwise person who underestimate his intellect he be a formidable and brilliant innovator on i be look at the environment secretary the environment on europe on devolution and on a whole range of thing   he be what we would all hope to be not a creature of history but a changer of history for that we should always admire he 
 to put to side all those grand thing he be also greatly greatly love by his family on that basis i offer my condolence to pauline and the rest of the family 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i want to add my own few word to the tribute that have be make and especially to welcome the comment from my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull east karl turner which be so warm and personal 
 john prescott ’s great many achievement his commitment to climate change and other matter have already be speak of he be a truly authentic working class hero and somebody who always attract a crowd wherever he go he persevere with his famous battle bus through good time and poor one what may sometimes be miss be his commitment to devolution and the great effort he make in the north east of england where he commit to the campaign for a north eastern assembly we be not successful on that occasion the referendum be not win but ultimately john ’s legacy prevail in the devolved institution and authority that we have see ever since 
 on a personal note i want to put on record my thank to john for his personal support to i i find myself propel on to the shadow front bench a little bit prematurely and unexpectedly but he be of great support to i in discharge the transport brief he retain such immense knowledge and on every single occasion he offer encouragement for which i will be eternally grateful he be a true giant of the labour movement we will miss he enormously but his legacy remain i too pass on my sincere condolence to pauline and to all his family 
 far to that point of order mr speaker on behalf of the scottish national party i pass on our sincere condolence to pauline to john ’s family and to his many friend colleague and comrade right across the labour movement you have lose a colossus of a man and an inspiration to working class people right across the united kingdom who be encourage by his example to go into politic 
 i remember come down here as a new mp in and observe the labour front bench titan all of they and all know to the uk public but dominant among they be john prescott and it be john prescott the public want to hear from when he appear on the tv screen the public pay attention and listen to what he have to say he resonate with the british public who hold he in a curious affection if what he have could have be bottle i be sure we would all take a little sup of it today 
 i will never forget where i be as a candidate in when that famous incident come in that   the hon member for newport east jessica morden   refer to who could i think we all know where we be i be with a bunch of former at a husting at brechin high school and of the senior pupil say to i if it ’s like that every day in your political life i want a bit of that there ’s inspiration for you mr speaker 
 john be a huge music fan and a great supporter of our music act mp4 we could never quite master the jazz that he seem to favour although maybe as a tribute to he we will get round to do of those number but it be something he completely love 
 everyone have talk about john ’s commitment to climate change but there be also his commitment to devolution which a few colleague have mention john prescott be the engine who drive that path towards a scottish parliament and the regional assembly which will be happen as a matter of course with this new labour government 
 john be part of a generation that we be sadly begin to lose but he will stand out as of the true great parliamentarian in this house of the past few decade and we will all miss he dearly 
 far to that point of order mr speaker it be wonderful to hear all the various tribute to john and i want to share my own memory of he as some have mention when it come to campaigning his big thing be his battle bus who would not love tour the country eat sweet with martin angus i be sure my right hon friend   the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner   will attest to that 
 i have my own memory of john ’s battle bus from after the election he get a small group of we together and we tour london as commuter be on their way to work at around or o’clock in the morning john be on the tannoy thank they all individually for vote labour and for another year of a labour government watch people literally stop in the street confuse that a bus be talk to they only to discover that it be actually the deputy prime minister talk to they be incredible john then take we all to his flat where despite have have no sleep at all he make we bacon sandwich and tea that be john at his good generous indomitable and completely unpredictable 
 john ’s incredible achievement and those of that labour government will stand the test of time he be the cement that keep the broad church of those new labour government together and we will always remember he for that i also want to say that last year my father die of alzheimer ’s and it be very difficult in those early day to remember the man who be before that cruel disease take he away i really do hope that pauline and john ’s family be listen to the wonderful tribute that be be pay here in this house and around the country so that they can remember the extraordinary man that john be and the extraordinary life that he live 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i collide if that be the right word with john prescott when i be shadow secretary of state for transport as he plough on with his integrated transport plan which be of the centrepiece of the blair administration i find that some of my colleague try to treat john prescott as a bit of a joke that be a mistake yes we tease he about his jag and he rather love that but he be utterly sincere in what he do passionate and pretty brutal with his opposition opponent when he feel he be on top we clash again over the proposal for regional assembly great campaigner though he be he lose the north east referendum and i do not think he ever really forgive i for that 
 when require however john could be a great statesman he be right to insist on a public inquiry into the marchioness disaster which the previous government have refuse to hold and he be right immediately to announce an inquiry into the paddington rail disaster as soon as it happen i recall get of the most surprising telephone call of my political life when have tell the conservative conference that he be right to call that public inquiry and that we should wait for its outcome i get a call from he to thank i for that bit of bipartisanship something even he be capable of when the camera be not look 
 i pay tribute to john for that because the cullen inquiry come up with a completely new safety regime for rail include a rail accident investigation branch for the department for transport we have not have a public inquiry into a rail accident ever since because of the safety regime that he implement follow the inquiry every survivor of the paddington rail crash and subsequent rail crash be grateful to he for what he do for passenger safety on our railway if for nothing else we should remember he for that 
 i send my good wish to john ’s family and to all his friend and colleague on the government benches at this sad time 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i will share particular memory of lord prescott the be from my time work for the disability charity scope we have decide as a campaign team to use the general election to highlight the many obstacle that disabled people face when exercise their democratic right to vote i and my campaign colleague devise the polls apart campaign which include a special campaign pack for candidate 
 bear in mind that this be in the halcyon day before email a campaign pack be something of a rarity we print staple and post out hundred of pack to candidate the length and breadth of the uk include to the labour candidate for kingston upon hull east off it go send class to our amazement a week or so later a reply come back say that mr prescott not only support the campaign but have write to all of labour ’s candidate in his capacity as the general election co ordinator instruct they to take the campaign action that our pack suggest more than that when labour be elect a few week later he bring forward amendment to the representation of the people act to make it easy for disabled people to exercise their right to vote 
 i have meet john prescott a few year before that when i work for the then member of parliament for streatham the right hon keith hill both john and keith be member of the rmt parliamentary group which be as broad and diverse as its talent be deep i ask keith ahead of my remark today if he have any particular memory of john that i might share with the house and he tell i of from his time as a minister in the office of the deputy prime minister 
 john and keith be due to make a presentation on labour ’s housing growth area to the prime minister tony blair in the cabinet room morning at am at am john be still work on the presentation he decide that he need to know about the rail connection between cambridge and oxford so he phone network rail member can doubtless imagine the startled reaction   of the poor network rail official who answer that call at o’clock in the morning from someone claim to be the deputy prime minister who have a very specific question about east west rail link tony blair be equally amazed at am and do he tell you what the rail connection be ask the pm there be n’t any reply john—“we’re go to change that now thank to the budget that change will finally be deliver a fitting tribute perhaps to the work ethic energy and enthusiasm for change that john prescott exemplify 
 far to that point of order mr speaker my condolence to pauline and all of john ’s family at what must be a truly devastating time for they david use to work in my office and he send i a message just after john die he be very close to his father and see he as his hero and his friend we send our condolence to all of they 
 i obviously know john in the house for many year when he be elect along with dennis skinner they share a flat in clapham i do not know what go on in that flat but while they be good friend they be very different character i later learn that after the last vote take place in the house dennis and john would both leave to go back to the flat but they never travel together dennis always make sure that he get there so that he could get hold of the television in the flat turn it on and watch the dart the snooker or whatever else john would turn up and want to watch newsnight and dennis refuse to change the channel he would say no way you ’ll watch the dart with i you can imagine the repartee and the argument that would have go on between they which would have be incredibly funny 
 in the election john offer to help in any way he could and he be fantastic we do several event together day we start in hull in the morning with the launch of our art manifesto and then go on a tour all around yorkshire and humberside in the famous bus john seem to know the owner of every fish and chip shop in the whole of yorkshire and insist on stop at every so we have a big supply of fish and chip all day long then we get to scarborough where we be do a rally in the pavilion by the seafront john and i get up to speak on the stage and i do not think a lot of the people there realise that a political rally be go on they think they be just there enjoy the sunshine and then these guy get up on the stage and start talk 
 the people love john because he bring out freddie the fox we have a long discussion about the evil of foxhunt the evil of tory foxhunt the tories be always go to bring back foxhunting the tories would kill the fox then he pull freddie out of his coat and say look at poor freddie here they ’re go to tear he apart that ’ what the tories do to you he be love for all of that 
 i want to say thank you to john for what he do but also to remember that of the crucial point in his political career be the issue of climate change and kyoto it be not easy popular or normal a lot of people refuse to even consider what we be do to the natural world and the environment and how there be limit to what we can do hence the protocol that john negotiate and sign up to he be of the people who be very important in start to change   the global debate about climate change and respect for the natural world and the environment we should all say thank you to john prescott for that 
 far to that point of order mr speaker the time i meet john prescott in his role as deputy prime minister be in when he open up admiralty arch to young homeless people as part of the winter shelter programme it be a bitterly cold winter and at the time the conservative back bencher crispin blunt say that this project would be treat a historic building as if it be a flagship for undesirable give that john be frequently describe as an undesirable by many of his opponent throughout his life he take that as a badge of honour and he be really proud of that homelessness project i will never forget the way he share breakfast with those rough sleeper and take a real interest in every of their life it be a testimony to his compassion his practical politic and his unwavering commitment to housing policy many million of council tenant see home improvement new window new door and home insulation and none of they will ever forget that those be the basic that many of we take for grant but which far too many people lack at the time 
 in a superb biography by my late former colleague on the independent colin brown naturally entitle fight talk there be a lovely and tell quote from john 
 there be those priest of the left who want to keep their conscience and there be those who will get their hand dirty i belong to the dirty hand brigade 
 john be regularly patronise and frequently under estimate but he have the last laugh by deliver for real work people for that we be all grateful 
 far to that point of order mr speaker in the last month of the united kingdom take over the rotate presidency of the european union and prime minister blair want to make a big success of it of his concern be that there be a young british mep who be prone to behave very badly in the chamber and be particularly rude to visit heads of state so john prescott be send to see i he himself of course have serve as an mep and be a big project supporter he love everything about the european union so he come to explain to i that it would be very bad for britain if i be to stand up and cause a scene when prime minister blair be speak i will not say that he threaten i but i certainly feel deeply intimidate and behave myself impeccably over the course of the next month that be the bruiser john prescott perhaps 
 a couple of year later on remembrance sunday when the ceremony be over and the parade have finish i be walk up whitehall and there to my astonishment walk on his own and without any security be the deputy prime minister i say hello and wonder what he be do john have see a group of arctic convoy veteran on the other side of whitehall a seafarer himself he have go over to speak to the man who have endure such appalling hardship during the last couple of year of the war and say to they i ’m go to fight to make sure that you guy get a campaign medal after all these year recognise what you ’ve do   they do get the medal and i get the message i understand why he have be so phenomenally successful from humble root he connect he get on with people and he be very human we mourn his passing but perhaps we also mourn the passing of big working class character in politic we need far more of they 
 far to that point of order mr speaker as you well know john have many connection with the north west of england he go to school on the wirral he be a parliamentary candidate in southport and he return there to campaign in the general election he be a seafarer out of liverpool and he be present with a trophy by anthony eden whom the prime minister mention the trophy be for win a boxing bout on board ship and it be there that he hone the craft that may have lead to what he be know so famously for later on 
 when i come here in i bump into john in the committee corridor where he be sit at a desk work he say he be there because despite be a former deputy prime minister he have to share an office with other members of the house of lords he have recently be ennoble and he moan about the fact that there be no preferential treatment for he however despite the moan he be get on with the job as john always do 
 my favourite story of he be when during the election campaign the battle bus turn up on grand national day outside aintree racecourse he have a campaign to keep the grand national free to air on terrestrial tv and there he be with his loudspeaker harangue the racegoer to come and sign his petition which they do in drove not only do they sign the petition but they queue in large number for selfie with john that go to the point about the affection in which he be hold and the impression that john make that day will stay with i forever 
 when i come here and be serve in this place as he be serve in the lords he be a source of terrific advice to i and i be proud to have count john as a friend over the year i send my good wish to pauline david and the rest of his family may john rest in peace 
 far to that point of order mr speaker when i be elect for beverley and holderness in john prescott the mp for neighbour kingston upon hull east be of course already a legend he be the word mangle fast fiste former bar steward who have for the last year be deputy prime minister of this united kingdom hear the tribute from across the house and all the way in which that man be able to influence history and make a difference be i hope an inspiration to aspirant working class politician all over the country but also to people in this house 
 i know john from a few year before i enter parliament he come to cambridge for a transport summit so i organise a demonstration against it and stand outside all day the day go on and he do not come out when eventually he do come out i be just about the only demonstrator leave i immediately berate he and his entourage and we have a surreal dance around the car park before he go up to a jaguar and try to get in it be not his i think it take he quite some time to forgive i for that 
 i regularly see john as do colleague from hull such as   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson who be sit on the government front bench on hull train and he be normally surround by paper at a place table that he be try to keep entirely to himself 
 although he be gruff he be also engage he would often come to beverley when pauline would go shop and he would go to the royal standard pub the fine establishment in beverley where he be always very welcome and people to this day hold he in the high regard 
 as have be remark he lead our delegation to the cop at kyoto in and be widely regard as the key element in deliver its historic outcome the time an international agreement be make to recognise and cut climate emission the former us vice president al gore say that he have 
 never work with anyone in politic quite like john prescott
