 question put forthwith standing order no 
 the house divide ayes noes 
 the deputy speaker declare that the question be not decide because few than member have participate in the division standing order no 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 i be delighted to present this bill for its reading i begin by state how grateful i be to all the members from across the house who have engage with this bill especially during the public bill committee it become quite clear very quickly how passionate every committee member be about animal welfare and we have a huge amount of contribution with many take the opportunity to name check their own pet from home i think i have hear every cat name during my   year in clinical practice but i have to say that i be really impress by the imagination of   the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter who reveal that her cat be name clement catlee and mo meowlam 
 my many year in veterinary practice work both in winchester and in romsey in your beautiful constituency madam deputy speaker as well as around the rest of country have show i just how deeply the people of this nation care for their pet they be companion and they be sometimes sole companion to people who live alone i have lose count of the number of time especially during covid that we be treat animal and someone would say i have not see anyone else for month and my dog or my cat be my only companion pet be absolutely vital for many people ’s mental health especially when we have an epidemic of loneliness pet be sometimes part of the antidote to that 
 my constituency be the home of canine partners the organisation that provide canine companion for individual with disability i just want to reflect on the positive effect those dog have on the people who care for they 
 there be so many fantastic organisation like canine partners another be the cinnamon trust if a person end up go into hospital for an extended period of time the cinnamon trust will take care of their pet for they and give it back to they when they be discharge that take away so much of the worry 
 my partner emma and i have dog frank and moose frank have be mention before in parliament because i manage to wish he a very happy birthday recently he be a pug cross border terrier i think the good way to describe how he look with his undershot jaw and his big buggy eye be quirky i admit that he get a mixed reception liberal democrat member see a picture of he and call he ugly which i be horrendously offend by hon member shame it be awful shame we be at of my friend house for dinner recently and of their child look at frank and say frank be really ugly the other child say you should not say that because he might have be in an accident it be possibly a genetic accident but i want to make clear on the record that beneath his appearance he be a gentle and loving companion and he bring a smile to the face of everyone who see he 
 i know that many other member as well as people across the country will feel as strongly about protect animal welfare as i and other vet do pet like frank and moose have such profound impact on our everyday life and happiness and it be crucial that we do all we can to ensure dog like they be protect from the cruel practice involve in pet smuggling all of the pet who have be mention in this chamber and other who have not be be close to our heart and serve to remind we of the importance of this bill although my pet and your madam deputy speaker alfie and 
 alfie and luna 
 alfie and luna they be cockapoo i be sure they keep you very fit although our pet and all the pet of the other hon member who be in the chamber today be well care for and have love home that be not the case for all cat and dog in the uk 
 as a vet i have see the devastating consequence of puppy smuggling it be unimaginably cruel to separate puppy and kitten from their mother at a very young age and then bring they across border in substandard condition where they be sell for maximum profit by unscrupulous trader who prioritise profit over welfare 
 i thank my hon friend for introduce this bill which i know mean a lot to the great number of my constituent who have contact i they be particularly concerned about the condition that puppy be smuggle in but also that many animal come into this country illegally bring condition that we have eradicate here or have crop ear and tail they be very keen to see my hon friend ’s bill pass but can he assure we that more can be do in future to make sure in particular that we stamp out those illness 
 i very much appreciate that intervention from my hon friend yes important part of this bill which i will come on to be biosecurity there be a lot of disease that we do not see in the uk that can affect human as well such as rabie and brucella cani there be also disease such as distemper that affect other dog we do not see those disease in the uk but there be a risk of they come in and become endemic my partner emma who be here today be an epidemiologist at the university of surrey study disease such as rabie in dog and the risk of they transfer across border it be a very live issue 
 those who purchase an animal be often completely unaware of the smuggling process which be devastating when people go to buy a puppy they be completely unaware that there be a reasonable chance that it have be smuggle in from abroad 
 my hon friend be lay out clearly the need for change a number of my constituent include ann from bredbury shannon from marple and ashley from high lane have be in touch to ask i to support he in his endeavour people be stagger that some of these practice be not yet outlawed do he agree that some of his proposal in the bill be close loophole that people already expect to be close 
 that be an insightful intervention from my hon friend yes most people be shock at the sheer scale of puppy smuggling the dogs trust do a study look at of the online platform with puppy advert and up to of those advert turn out to be for puppy that have possibly be smuggle in from abroad in the last month in vet say they have treat animal that they believe have be smuggle from abroad this be not a niche issue it be a systemic issue within the pet trade and these loophole need to be close 
 i thank the hon member for introduce this fantastic bill which do important thing for animal welfare sadly my constituency   have a problem with dog on dog attack which be truly distress to their owner the overwhelming majority of dog owner in my constituency be incredibly responsible and keep their dog under control at all time but a tiny minority be do a great deal of damage do the hon member have any thought on what we could do about that 
 dog on dog attack be a huge issue it largely come down to socialisation when they be puppy it be make a lot bad during the covid pandemic when people could not attend normal puppy training class and puppy could not walk and meet other dog or have normal training regime 
 i will also come on to the problem of dog have illegally crop ear when their ear be cut off because dog communicate by body language and part of their body language be ear position if they can not move their ear they can not communicate in normal way to other dog that they be not a threat and they be more likely to get into fight and difficulty it be the same if their tail be cut off and they can not show whether they be happy sad angry or confident 
 when owner buy a new puppy often they do not realise that it have be smuggle and take from its mother far too soon that can cause a lot of medical issue and other disease such as parvo virus it be not unusual for someone to buy a new puppy and within the week or have to go to the vet repeatedly with a very sick animal whose problem be often quite hard to diagnose sometimes these disease be fatal there be few thing more heartbreaking than a family who within a few day of ownership not only have an expensive veterinary bill but have lose their new puppy 
 i thank the hon member for introduce this important bill which i support he talk about the impact of disease that puppy might have when they be bring in do he agree that there be also disease that have potential impact on human health often for the veterinary surgeon or nurse who be look after they for example disease such as brucella canis could lead to miscarriage for a lady if she be look after of those puppy while pregnant 
 i know that the hon lady speak with authority as her husband be a vet i thank she for sit on the committee and for push the bill through she also have a private member ’s bill on animal welfare she make an important point that have be consume the veterinary profession for the last couple of year a lot of dog bring in from abroad have a disease call brucella canis which can affect human it can cause infertility and miscarriage obviously if a dog have be illegally smuggle in owner might not be aware of the risk because they assume it have be bear in the uk it be a huge human health risk as well 
 just last night i be still receive message from veterinary colleague about treat animal that they strongly suspect have be smuggle in because of the type of illness that they be see that be why we be strive to end those practice by deliver the measure in the bill 
 the bill close loophole in our pet travel rule that be currently exploit it do so by reduce the number of animal permit per non commercial   movement from per person to per vehicle include vehicle on board a train or ferry and to per person for foot or air passenger careful consideration have be give to set these limit balance the need to disrupt illegal trade with minimise the impact on genuine pet owner to underpin this only an owner not an authorised person will be permit to sign a declaration that the movement of a dog or cat be non commercial 
 crucially the bill place a duty on the government to use these regulation make power to deliver key measure a ban on the import of puppy and kitten under month old a ban on the import of heavily pregnant dog and cat that be more than day pregnant and a ban on the import of dog and cat that have be mutilate raise the minimum age at which dog and cat can be import will ensure that very young animal be not take from their mother too soon separate a puppy or kitten from its mother too young have huge implication for its health and welfare 
 i thank the hon member for bring forward this very important bill the point about very young animal be really pertinent in my family we have kitten they be bring into our house at an appropriate age and we can see the importance of their relationship after birth 
 of my constituent own ferret and i meet both those ferret at civic event in my constituency of watford they clearly have personality and it be really important that this bill seek to protect they 
 yes ferret be some of the most quirky and engage creature you can ever meet great personality i have to say i hate they come into the consult room because you can smell that they have be there for several hour afterwards but they bring a lot of joy and pleasure to the people who own they 
 we anticipate that trader may respond to an increase in the minimum age for import puppy and kitten by increase the number of pregnant dog and cat that they import the evidence from stakeholder suggest that even at present trader be import very heavily pregnant dog and cat in order to benefit from their trade as soon as the puppy and kitten be bear because it be much cheap and easy to bring in an animal before it give birth than to try to move a whole load of puppy we know that some dog be be take back and forth they get pregnant again and then be bring back to give birth it really be abuse of these bitch they be basically puppy factory 
 the transportation of heavily pregnant dog and cat be dangerous to the health and welfare of both the mother and the offspring especially in heatwave give the heat inside van when they have a few pregnant dog in the back so it be paramount that we remain on the front foot and use the bill to prevent this practice become commonplace 
 the bill will raise the minimum age at which cat and dog can be import to ensure that very young animal be not take from their mother too soon and that we can age puppy and kitten more accurately currently the minimum age be technically week but it be very hard even for vet to accurately age animal by the time they get to month old they have lose all their deciduous tooth their baby tooth and have mostly adult   tooth so we can be much more confident about their age raise the minimum age will be much well for their welfare but it will also help tackle the criminal business model because the demand be for puppy not dog that be over month we hope that if people can not bring in dog at month old it will take away the incentive to try to get they across the border 
 i come to mutilation which include ear cropping the declawing of cat and tail docking it be very cruel and should not be tolerate for anyone who be not aware ear cropping be when someone cut a dog ’s ear off to make it look more aggressive it often happen to breed such as xl bully and dobermanns it have be illegal in the uk for more than a decade since i think people be still perform the procedure in the uk without veterinary supervision and probably with no anaesthetic and then claim that the dog have be bring in from abroad because it be still legal to bring they in from abroad 
 i receive message last night from about a dozen vet say that just in the last couple of month they have treat dog that have clearly have their ear hack off in the uk and that now have infection and need the rest of the ear amputate this be go on now the great thing about close that loophole be that there will be no excuse for own a dog in the uk with cropped ear and no will be able to claim that such a dog have be bring in from abroad 
 of the great beauty of this bill be that it apply to scotland too do the hon gentleman agree that it will make the prosecution of ear cropping relate case easy in scotland for the benefit of our wonderful dog 
 clarity about the fact that there be no excuse for have a dog with crop ear should make prosecution and enforcement of the law a lot more straightforward 
 i will read out a message that i receive from a veterinary colleague last night 
 just see for repeat med check this week 3yo crop doberman import but clearly be very young and owner be not give any passport or paper he have his ear crop supposedly do abroad before be import but be probably do in the uk lovely bright dog until anyone put a hand towards his head when it will explode with aggression big enough dog to be life threaten if a child approach he now exist near permanently muzzle and dose up on prozac it ’ madden frustrating and pitiful all at the same time 
 cut a dog ’s ear off with no anaesthetic be obviously physically harmful but it can also affect the dog ’s psychology for the rest of their life so they will not let anyone go near their head it be quite interesting we know that dog love to be stroke particularly on their head and study show that both a human ’s and a dog ’s cortisol level go down when a human pet a dog the relationship be mutual and symbiotic deprive an animal of that type of relationship for the rest of its life be really upsetting what be the point in own a dog if you can not even stroke it it be a real shame there be no reason to mutilate an animal in this way it be a cruel practice only carry out for aesthetic reason and the bill will help we to close that loophole for good 
 the bill be amend in committee to allow the appropriate authority to exempt pet owner from the new requirement in article and 5a of the pet travel   regulation in exceptional and compelling circumstance this aim to ensure that the new measure will not disadvantage protect group such as assistance dog user it will also provide flexibility in emergency situation such as case where genuine owner can no long travel within day of their pet for example because they have a medical emergency i know that have cause some concern and i reassure hon member that it be intend for use in limited circumstance which must be exceptional or compelling exemption seek will need to be consider on a case by case basis and the government have provide reassurance that no blanket exemption will be grant 
 finally in committee the bill be amend to remove the power that would have enable the secretary of state to make consequential change that might have be require as a result of change that the bill make to the pet travel rule and correspond commercial import rule further consideration of the legislation have take place since the bill be introduce and we have great confidence that no further consequential amendment will be require should far change to the pet travel scheme legal framework be need the government may be able to make they use exist power in other legislation 
 the bill will play a pivotal role in disrupt the cruel pet smuggling trade a share objective of member from across the house it have be a joy to see the house unite on animal welfare and to see the commitment to work together across party to end puppy smuggling i urge all member to support these crucial measure 
 i thank   the hon member for winchester dr chambers   for bring forward the bill and for all his work to get it to this stage   we should also thank the former hon member for north devon who i understand bring forward the bill in the previous parliament it do not quite get through parliament before the general election it be good to see propose legislation move from parliament to the next and have cross party support 
 the hon gentleman represent winchester madam deputy speaker you and i share a relationship as i be a romsonian and you represent my parent but of my job be in winchester in the esso garage by peter symonds college so i know the hon gentleman ’s constituency very well that be the job that get i through university and earn i money in the summer holiday of my proud achievement be be give the opportunity to step up and take on the night shift which be double pay for a student that be very exciting unfortunately i lose that job because i fall asleep on my shift and someone steal the carwash while i be asleep yes i be demote back to daytime shift but winchester always have a place in my heart 
 it be a great relief to know that member of this house sabotage their petrochemical career quite early on i have a job in a garage as an year old i can not remember the brand i make the fatal mistake of fill up a car salesman ’s brand new car with diesel when it be an unleaded car that be why i never rise to the top of british petroleum 
 i should state for the record and for colleague in hansard that i be not my hon friend   the member for bracknell peter swallow as be suggest early this week for those online i be not my hon friend   the member for weston super mare dan aldridge either whom i be quote as be this week nor be i a member of a much bad version of direction that idea go viral this week thank to of my former labour colleague who temporarily make i twitter famous 
 i be a very passionate member of the labour animal welfare society and i would like to thank the society for all its hard work during the election period on this campaign when we put out social medium post and speak to resident right across the political spectrum it be very clear that there be real support for change and much tough animal welfare measure the conservatives when in government fail to take action on e collar on ban import from trophy hunting fur and foie gra on ban snare and other inhumane device that be already ban in wales and scotland and this be really critical for every pet owner on the theft of pet it be really positive to see these measure now come forward 
 on my hon friend ’s point about social medium do he have a view on the importance of have a dog in your social medium during a general election campaign it seem to be an almost compulsory element of many of the campaign i be involve in include mine surely the bill be critical to ensure the good nature of the animal appear in those social medium post 
 i completely agree i be a candidate for month and for a long while i run doorstepdogs every week i take a photo of my favourite dog that i meet on the doorstep unfortunately i have give up on that maybe i should bring it back 
 that be a very good point about social medium reason why there be such an interest in dog with cropped ear be that a lot of influencer on instagram and other social medium platform pose with dog or show that they have new dog with cropped ear many people be not aware that it be a mutilation they think it be how dog ear normally look that drive a demand for dog that look like that we will be run a stop the crop campaign to try to get influencer and company that use crop eare dog in advert to stop do that so that cropping be not normalise among the general public i thank the hon gentleman for raise that point 
 it be fantastic to hear about that campaign and i would fully support it but there be also positive in the world of pet on social medium i follow an account southend dog training which have help i with free advice to ensure that dash my little chorkie full name dash potato evans reader sit walk and do not lick so many people every time we meet they he do not come out with i on the doorstep because while i be try to talk about serious policy issue he be more keen to get in the house and explore 
 in all seriousness the bill be really important it close loophole and stop the shameless exploitation of dog cat and ferret as i learn from the clerk as i walk in ferret be include in the bill because of   their alignment on rabie categorisation it be fantastic to see a really well rounded bill of this nature it will stop puppy be strip from their parent and smuggle into the uk under the age of month and it will stop heavily mutate dog be bring in as well as heavily pregnant dog who just become puppy farm 
 i be at a food conference in northampton yesterday and when i tell people there that i be come in to parliament today to talk about puppy they think it be a little strange but i explain the loophole and they be not fully aware of what go on it be really important that we take this kind of action to close those loophole 
 i must confess that i be feel increasingly guilty for not have mention my cockapoo brora since everybody else be mention their pet she have be a social medium star she pose in a scotland football strip just before the last championship 
 the hon gentleman make a good point about people not be aware and need reassurance when we buy brora year ago i remember it be on my mind that we have to be careful because there be a lot of people sell puppy on the internet apparently genuinely i have hear from constituent who buy a puppy unaware of the puppy trade and then face the sort of issue that my hon friend   the member for winchester dr chambers   mention do the hon gentleman agree that it be important that the public take away from this bill an awareness of those danger 
 i could not agree more it be critical that we do more in parliament to raise these issue i also welcome some of the minor amendment make in committee which strengthen the bill far and will reassure people particularly in the limited circumstance in which the bill may have unintended consequence 
 it be the story of my life that i be a dog lover and an animal lover every time i come home from parliament dash be there wait for i very fortunately he come with i when i come down to london and he come with i back to northampton it make my life so much well as you say to come home decompress 
 the hon gentleman be do a marvellous job but he have use you a number of time as indeed have other member in their intervention while i be on the subject of intervention it be fascinating for i personally to hear about the social medium account of everybody ’s dog but could we please try to keep intervention within scope of the bill 
 thank you madam deputy speaker you make a good point 
 as i be say when i come home and see dash it be a great opportunity to decompress i agree with   the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine   that that be such a valuable part of own a dog 
 in closing i want to thank a number of organisation that have help i and other to really understand this issue paws battersea and the countryside alliance have provide great briefing and have help i and other to understand it today be a victory for common   sense and animal welfare way or another we will make sure that we improve animal welfare right in this place 
 i congratulate   the hon member for winchester dr chambers   on introduce this important bill it be an absolute honour and a privilege to speak on this subject i have speak on animal welfare in westminster hall debate in the past month and it be an important topic to speak about on the anniversary of my election so i be grateful for the opportunity 
 i be also an animal lover i know that all right hon and hon member present be extremely well informed so the fact and information i will share be not for their benefit i want to use this opportunity to provide some education for community across our country and to share the message far afield beyond this place 
 as mahatma gandhi say 
 the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judge by the way its animal be treat 
 we often say we be a nation of animal lover and today be a test if we legislate we must legislate like cruel practice like smuggle pregnant animal or separate young animal from their mother at an early age violate all level of mercy these act cause unnecessary suffering and must be stop 
 have research and have information provide by my team i find the scale of the issue staggering between and dog import under the pet travel scheme rise by many of those be illegal or misclassified commercial import a single journey from romania to the uk be over mile puppy as young as week be transport in cramp filthy van we have hear about cropped ear a cruel thing to do to any animal more than dog with cropped ear be now estimate to be in the uk population a result of the legal grey area that we hope the bill will address 
 i pay tribute and express my gratitude i be sure on behalf of the house to the many charity and organisation that look after animal welfare and ensure issue be bring to the attention of this place and that be on the ground helping battersea dogs trust countryside alliance and many more that be local regional national and international 
 it be important to share some of the key issue around biosecurity and health risk many smuggled puppy and kitten arrive in the uk without the core vaccination require to prevent rabie distemper parvovirus and other life threaten illness these animal be often too young to have receive their vaccination or to have develop any immunity that be dangerous for they and also pose a serious public health risk to our community and domestic pet population the current system allow these animal to enter the country with minimal scrutiny create a perfect entry point for zoonotic disease those that can jump from animal to human 
 i will share or case study from battersea milo a month old dog rescue by battersea have be brutally mutilate his ear be hack and crudely stitch shut with cotton thread which have be leave to fester that be not just illegal it be deliberate torture   masquerade as aesthetic enhancement we need to tackle the glorification of mutilate animal on social medium or any other platform that do not make it clear to the people view that it be not the natural state of the animal it have be mutilate that be an important point that i hope through this debate will become more well know 
 to give some more example sunny ray and sky cane corso puppy be traffic over mile from romania they be just week old under the legal import age and unvaccinated mutilate and force into cramp stressful condition their ear have be crop and their tail dock all illegal here but still allow under import loophole snowy a heavily pregnant dog be smuggle during the final of her pregnancy in breach of current law she endure the journey in squalid dark and suffocating condition without adequate food or water these journey not only traumatise the animal but endanger the life of unborn puppy and the mother carry they 
 i do not have much experience of the importation of animal into our country until my preparation for this and previous debate i be aware that in my constituency there be an illegal trade of puppy which be keep in small cramped cage outside until they reach the age when they can be sell these cruelly treat puppy can be sell for thousand and thousand of pound i hope that part of the work we be do on the bill can also look to address that 
 on the exploitation of loophole we have hear that the current pet travel scheme design for holidaymaker have be systematically abuse by organise puppy trafficker breeder mislabel commercial sale as personal pet movement to sidestep import rule veterinary check and regulation smuggle heavily pregnant dog be a deliberate move allow trafficker to appear legitimate by show the puppy with their mother deceive buyer into think that the litter be breed responsibly in the uk 
 these be not off case this be organised animal trafficking often international in scale that thrive on weak legislation poor enforcement and consumer deception without the bill we be effectively enable profit from pain through a loophole ride system that be ripe for abuse 
 on constituent engagement on this issue through battersea alone over people across constituency have contact their mp to urge they to support the bill this be a groundswell of support that cut across party line while i have only have email from a constituent directly about the bill i have have over email in this parliament from constituent call for strong animal welfare protection this speak to a powerful public mandate people be demand action to end the suffering of trafficked animal and uphold the uk ’s reputation as a leader on welfare pass this bill be the right and compassionate thing to do 
 when think of dog and their close relationship with human a good place to start be literature a great novel about our relationship with dog be white fang by jack london   a great american socialist writer when it come to cat i can do no well than natsume sōseki the great japanese writer who write a series of novel about cat observe their human master with great wit and intelligence 
 as a boy i have dog or rather my father do they be pistol poins and muttley my dad believe that dog should be name after shakespearean character hence pistol and poins but the balance of power shift in the family and then we have muttley the hanna barbera dog though we draw the line at huckleberry hound something very important about the dog be that they be all strays they have great emotional difficulty in be able to trust human because they be mistreat when they be young that be why   the hon member for winchester dr chambers   be right to emphasise the real damage that cruelty to animal can do the next door neighbour have cat butch and cuddles and the clue be somewhat in their name they be stray cat butch take a long time to trust the next door neighbour and my family and i but he do trust we now if animal suffer cruelty when they be young it cause long term psychological damage 
 i be delighted that the bill extend to scotland this house should not be afraid to legislate for the welfare of people or animal in scotland so i commend the hon member for winchester for seek to legislate for scotland it be very important to my constituent we have the dogs trust in broomhouse in my constituency which my good friend councillor lalley take i to visit the people there do a huge amount of good work with stray dog 
 may i take a moment to mention dobermann rescue base in my constituency which also do fantastic work i be sure my hon friend will join i in commend its work 
 i will join my hon friend in commend the work of that dobermann charity dog like dobermanns and german shepherd have a certain reputation but they be very kind love and loyal so i commend work that be do to help dobermanns 
 there be a great deal of support in my constituency for the bill which have many important element restrict the commercial importation and non commercial movement of dog cat and ferret into the uk on the ground of welfare be an important objective as the bill be implement which i hope it will be we must redouble our effort to bring to people ’s attention how wrong the importation of these animal be 
 the hon member for winchester mention campaign on social medium and he be entirely correct to do so the scale of the problem be large people be import these animal for commercial gain and it involve a great deal of cruelty there have be a rise in the market for pregnant dog and cat to be bring in the hon member be right to talk about the mutilation of animal people have know for decade if not long that the mutilation of animal tail docking and so on be cruel and wrong and should not be take place in this day and age it be utterly barbaric 
 the bill be very important for public health as   the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed   say dog that have not be test for disease will not be able to come here and it will help to fulfil   labour party manifesto pledge on animal welfare it will also improve enforcement i have some experience of that from talk to former colleague and the bill will make it much easy to enforce certain element of exist animal cruelty law for example on the mutilation of dog that be very important 
 mention have be make of dog on twitter feed during the general election campaign i admit that during the campaign and for many month beforehand i too have a hobby of take picture of dog and post they on twitter i have get out of the habit so i thank the hon member for winchester for remind i that it be quite a pleasant thing to do it be probably well for my constituent too they probably find it much more interesting than my political comment and other interesting observation i may have they may in fact come to the view that i be more perceptive and expert on dog than on politic although i hope they will not find that out for another year or so 
 as a vet the hon member for winchester speak from a position of real expertise he outline why the bill be important and he be to be commend for bring it to the house 
 i rise to support this vital bill and i commend   the hon member for winchester dr chambers   for bring it to the house as all member will know animal welfare be a major concern for our constituent and nowhere be that more true than bolton west the bill have be long await and i be delighted that this parliament will finally deliver where previous parliaments be unable to deliver we be a nation of animal lover and it should be a point of pride that to reflect that we strive to have the tough animal welfare protection anywhere in the world 
 my mailbox and postbag reflect the animal welfare concern that i have and that we have hear during the debate dean a constituent of mine in daisy hill email to say 
 accord to respondent to the cats protection cats and their stats cats survey of the cat that be obtain in the month precede the survey be from abroad the importation of cat and dog with mutilation such as declaw and ear cropping lack of vaccination and health check and dangerous transport condition present a significant risk to animal welfare 
 we know that the uk ’s biosecurity be compromise by pet smuggling give that animal may carry transmittable disease such as rabie and tapeworm which put both human and animal at risk the rise price of cat in particular pedigree mean that illegally import cat be become increasingly lucrative for criminal cats protection statistic show that of the cat obtain in the past month be pedigree for the time more pedigree cat than moggie be acquire in a month period the bill be a vital opportunity to put in place the measure to tackle pet smuggling that could not complete their passage in the last parliament 
 will my hon friend join i in thank the volunteer across cats protection and at edinburgh dog and cat home for the work that they do every day to keep rescue animal safe do he agree that those charity need our help and support and that the bill will help to amplify the work that they do 
 i will also put it on the record that i have rescue animal a cat and a dog who both live to year of age sadly they be no long with we but for the sake of hansard i want to mention their name cannie and roohi 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to talk about the critical work of animal welfare charity across the country they can make such a difference 
 diane in ladybridge email to say 
 this bill be a major step forward in improve the life of animal 
 she be delighted that it will make it 
 much hard to exploit pet travel rule to illegally traffic puppy and kitten breed in horrific condition overseas into the uk 
 she also note 
 dog and cat involve in bad breeding whether they ’re use for breeding or breed poorly themselves don’t have a fair chance in life they ’re more likely to have health problem and poor socialisation mean they can struggle with life as a pet 
 i be really pleased that the bill will finally close a loophole to address the issue of dog and cat with illegal mutilation such as cropped ear or dock tail and help to bring down demand for those feature we have speak about the social medium impact it be incumbent on we as parliamentarian and figure in public life to continue to drive public awareness about why those procedure be mutilation and the adverse impact they have on the animal and frankly society as a whole 
 i be really pleased that the bill will make it much hard to exploit pet travel rule to traffic illegally puppy kitten and ferret breed in horrific condition overseas into the uk sadly these activity can involve gang who be associate with serious organise crime which i be personally keen on tackle during my time in parliament by bring in tough restriction we can protect animal welfare and also cut a source of criminal income an issue that way or another i continue to raise in this house 
 while cat and dog be overwhelmingly the most popular pet in this country it would be remiss of i as a northern mp not to reference the humble ferret mention by my hon friend the members for watford matt turmaine and for northampton south mike reader ferret be a northern icon on that topic our other northern icon oasis be today reform for their gig in year to conclude have listen to my constituent on the vital importance of protect animal welfare it be fair to say that both they and i be mad fer ret 
 i congratulate   the hon member for winchester dr chambers   on bring forward this bill a year on from the general election it be nice to have of those day when there be a sequence of bills that we can all get behind and support and that should do great good for animal in this country and hopefully for some of the human as well 
 when i give my maiden speech i highlight that my predecessor and i in keep with convention i say something nice about he be both vegetarian and that animal welfare be a cause that be close to both of our heart if we look at most of his time in office we can see his extensive effort around animal welfare my   contribution have be far more limited in part because of the number of constituency issue that i feel need to take priority during that time but i be pleased to be here today to support this measure to improve the wellbeing of animal 
 i recall a write question my predecessor ask that slightly relate to today ’s debate and it be in relation to the importation and exportation of reindeer from the united kingdom thank to that question we be now aware that in and in there be import of reindeer and export of reindeer presumably santa ’s sleigh have separate licensing arrangement in the united kingdom 
 import control have a significant role to play in my constituency crawley constituency be home to gatwick airport and its animal reception centre give people the important ability to relocate with their pet and also to bring more exotic animal into the united kingdom local authority also have a significant role to play in these process during my time as a councillor i see a number of request for permit for exotic animal result in somewhat confusing conversation about why someone really need a full sized crocodile in the middle of a housing estate that licence be not approve 
 the hon member for winchester be to be commend for bring forward this bill and the house be privileged to benefit from his extensive professional experience in understand the important role that the bill will play in prevent animal abuse and hopefully enhance wide animal welfare 
 we be a nation of animal lover and we should feel proud that the legislative framework in this country be already world leading despite all the measure we have in place i think member would agree give the range of correspondence we get from our constituent that there be probably more separate campaign on animal welfare than on any other policy area that have certainly be my experience it be important that we do not rest on our laurel we must accept that the job be not do and that as technology move thing forward additional measure will need to be put in place to improve animal wellbeing 
 the issue of social medium and animal abuse online have be raise in the debate and the hon member for winchester outline the role that influencer have to play in addition there be far too many group online that be dedicate to animal abuse constituent of mine have attempt to shut down such group but rather than be support by social medium company in try to address the problem they have instead find themselves report by the perpetrator of the abuse and have face have their own account shut down and be leave without the support they need to bring the network of abuse to an end 
 the bad example of that type of animal abuse that i be aware of be bring up with i in a constituency surgery and they relate to the torture of baby monkey which be choose because when they be put in a baby grow people can convince themselves that they be a baby although that be clearly illegal already the current requirement on social medium company to act be insufficient i will not burden the house by inform hon member of the thing that i now know about what happen to those monkey all i can say be that   after my constituent leave i spend some minute deal with the tear about what have happen to those monkey we must do well around this and i very much hope that move forward we be able to do so 
 i enthusiastically support the bill but we can not rest on our laurel meta must be make to answer for not act to bring an end to animal abuse on its network and for its active profiting from the advertising that appear on those network advertiser must be make aware that part of what they be pay for when they advertise on facebook be the maintenance of animal abuse network i hope advertiser think more carefully about that in the future 
 i be proud to speak in this debate as the member of parliament for portsmouth north a seat i do not hold this time last year but proudly hold today although technically not for a year until tomorrow morning 
 i want to speak today in strong support of the bill it be a vital step forward in our duty to protect animal from cruelty and exploitation i thank   the hon member for winchester dr chambers   for introduce the bill and for his service as a vet i know the city of winchester well as i do my teaching degree at king alfred ’s college like my hon friend   the member for northampton south mike reader winchester will always have a special place in my heart particularly jesters a pub i work in for many year although it do not exist any more 
 portsmouth be a city that care many of my constituent have share their heartbreak at hearing of how young animal be bring into the uk sometimes under age unwell and traumatise just to be sell for profit the bill address that it ban the importation of puppy and kitten under the age of month it stop the transportation of heavily pregnant animal and prohibit the import of animal that have undergo unnecessary mutilation such as ear crop or declaw those practice be outlaw in the uk but be still far too common abroad like my hon friend   the member for crawley peter lamb i believe that social media platform and influencer should do more to stop that 
 these reform be not only overdue they be essential in portsmouth we be fortunate to have a number of deeply committed local charity that deal with the consequence of these inhumane practice i would like to pay tribute to some of those charity those at cats protection ’s portsmouth branch work tirelessly to rescue rehabilitate and rehome abandon or abuse cat across the city its volunteer provide vital neutering and microchippe service which help to reduce the stray population and improve feline welfare they frequently take in cat that have come from unsuitable background some of which be link to international trafficking or illegal sale 
 i also want to recognise portsmouth cats lost found and rehomed which be lead by the inspirational penny parker since the group have reunite countless lose cat with their family offer shelter to stray and provide veterinary care to those in desperate need its small but mighty rescue cabin penny ’s place be a beacon of hope for animal who might otherwise just have be leave to suffer 
 i also applaud portsmouth tortoise rescue in cosham although it do not support cat dog or ferret it have recently receive national recognition for its outstanding work in exotic animal welfare and bernice buckingham and her team of trustee and volunteer do an excellent job their educational programme and specialist care have make portsmouth tortoise rescue a trust name not only in portsmouth but across the south 
 finally phoenix rehoming have win award include animal rescue of the year and most dedicated pet rehome service and i wish the team luck with their nomination for animal charity team of the year phoenix rehoming have a strong footprint in portsmouth it work with foster family and community to rescue and rehome dog many of whom have be illegally import or abandon after be smuggle as part of this illicit trade 
 these organisation be do heroic work but they should not have to shoulder the burden of weak regulation and criminal cruelty by tighten important law this bill reduce the risk of trafficked animal enter the uk and ensure a great oversight through veterinary check microchipping and enforcement power it also protect family in portsmouth who often fork out quite a lot of money for these pet and then find they have be sell sick animal with fake paper and be leave not only heartbroken but face thousand of pound in vet bill 
 the legislation be not just about animal welfare but community resilience it give our local charity a fighting chance pet owner peace of mind and most importantly vulnerable animal the protection they deserve i represent a city that believe in fairness compassion and responsibility so i be proud to support the bill on behalf of the people of portsmouth north let we put an end to cruelty at our border and build a country that treat all live being with dignity 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i congratulate   the hon member for winchester dr chambers   on introduce this private member ’s bill as he be a veterinary surgeon i know that this topic be close to his heart as it be close to the heart of many hon member 
 the hon member for northampton south mike reader   speak with passion and pay tribute to selaine saxby the former member for north devon who bring this bill forward in the last parliament and i thank he for that tribute   the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed   quote mahatma gandhi to great effect   the hon member for glasgow east john grady   rightly point out that the bill extend to scotland and that section to apply to northern ireland   the hon member for bolton west phil brickell   remind we how important animal welfare be to all our constituent and   the hon member for crawley peter lamb   remind we that while our animal welfare law in britain be world lead we can always do well finally   the hon member for portsmouth north amanda martin   pay tribute to those many charity in her constituency that dedicate themselves to improve animal welfare 
 britain be a nation of animal lover and the conservatives be proud of our record in government of improve animal welfare in the last parliament we ban the keeping of primate as pet introduce pet abduction as a specific criminal offence increase the penalty for animal cruelty ban the export of livestock for slaughter or fattening and recognise animal sentience in law through the animal welfare sentience act the establishment of the animal sentience committee ensure that all legislation pass by this house consider the principle of animal sentience in we introduce lucy ’s law which ban the party sale of puppy and kitten these regulation help to protect animal from be keep in shockingly poor condition separate from their mother at a young age and deprive of human or animal interaction for most of their life 
 the animal welfare bill before we today be another example of do the right thing to protect those pet that we all love many charity have be tirelessly campaign for this legislation for many year include the british veterinary association the dogs trust the rspca paws cats protection blue cross battersea dogs and cats home and the conservative animal welfare foundation 
 the bill aim to close exist loophole that be use far too often by dishonest breeder and smuggler to disguise commercial import of cat and dog as non commercial movement in a bid to avoid compliance with exist welfare standard i welcome raise the minimum age at which cat and dog can be import to month that will curtail the ability of unscrupulous puppy smuggler to bring those puppy into the uk 
 the bill also far restrict the import of heavily pregnant animal the dogs trust have see a record increase in the number of heavily pregnant bitch intercept at the border since in prepare for this debate i have read about the most appalling case of pregnant animal be transport in cramp condition to give birth with little food or water this barbaric practice can permanently damage the health of both the mother and the puppy or kitten 
 similarly we support the decision to cap the number of animal transport non commercially at per vehicle rather than per person as at present that will close another loophole exploit by smuggler that allow they to transport several dozen animal in trip claim ownership of per person 
 i be equally glad to see this legislation ban the import of dog and cat with non exempted mutilation into great britain accord to animal welfare charity such as the rspca incident of ear cropping have skyrocket twentyfold in the last decade we on the conservative benches be commit to end that horrible practice i pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for epping forest dr hudson who like the hon member for winchester be a veterinary surgeon and a passionate advocate of that reform of course mutilation be not limit to dog and this legislation will also outlaw the declawing of cat that be another horrible procedure that have no medical basis and we support that measure 
 this be a good bill its measure be well consider back by expert and charity and design to implement positive change to protect our beloved pet i be pleased   to confirm on behalf of the opposition that we support this bill and i sincerely hope it will gain the support it deserve from the whole of the house 
 i congratulate   the hon member for winchester dr chambers   on champion this bill and guide its passage through the house i have welcome the expertise he have lend to this debate as well as his information and the way in which he use it in committee i be really fascinated to learn about the cut the crop campaign and i be keen to hear a bit more about how we can support that 
 i thank all member who have contribute to constructive and positive debate during each of the bill ’s stage i have to say that the constituent of my hon friend   the member for northampton south mike reader   must be delighted that he do not pursue his career on the forecourt he mention work of the animal welfare society and his passionate membership of it he also remind we all of the importance of doorstep dog and of my favourite dog at polling station which always seem to appear whenever the election day be i thank he for his support and join he in support paws battersea and the countryside alliance 
 my hon friend   the member for congleton sarah russell   mention dog on dog offence those be offence under section of the dangerous dogs act and we be work with the crown prosecution service to update its guidance to make that clear we be also work with stakeholder to encourage responsible dog ownership and reduce dog attack as my hon friend quite rightly point out this be about a minority of dog owner but it be extremely distressing for anybody involve 
 my hon friend   the member for glasgow east john grady   mention stray dog and the difficulty they have in gain trust which be so true as well as the damage that cruelty to animal can do throughout a pet ’s life he also mention the importance of social medium and how we can ensure that all of we in this house be send the right message that we think the practice of mutilating animal be unacceptable 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for bolton west phil brickell   for his support and for raise the importance of end smuggling smuggling be the wrong thing to do for the welfare of animal and for our biosecurity and that be a really important point he also raise how we need to bring down the demand for mutilate dog and i think we can do more across the whole house on that issue of course i agree with he that ferret be a northern icon 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for crawley peter lamb   for his support he be right that santa ’s sleigh have a separate licensing system so there be no difficulty in reindeer pass between any border on the night of   december i recognise his support for the welfare of animal and we must do well i will take away his important concern about social medium advertising 
 i join my hon friend   the member for portsmouth north amanda martin   in thanking i hope i get all of they cats protection portsmouth portsmouth lost   find and rehome penny ’s place phoenix rehoming and bernice buckingham at portsmouth tortoise rescue for all the work they do interruption i be so close i thank they for all the work they do across her constituency 
 as note by the hon member for winchester it be nice to have the whole house unite on a matter of animal welfare what a nice way to end the week the nation be also unite on animal welfare few topic have as much engagement and support from constituent as evidence by the frequent correspondence i receive in kingston upon hull west and haltemprice and that i be sure all of we across the house receive the public ’s passion for pet be very much reflect in the statistic accord to the pdsa pet ownership have increase in recent year with over half of adult own a pet as the proud owner of my cat serena meglatron and lily i welcome the bill and be thrilled that the measure cover cat because they deserve equal protection as dog i pay tribute to my daughter isabel who be here this morning and the magic way she have with animal she have a particular talent when we have have young kitten in help they grow up to be soft and gentle animal in fact our beloved thomas use to go to bed with she like a small teddy to be cuddle at night time i would go in and see they sit watch television together honestly he be more like a dog than a cat that only go to reinforce the point make that when animal be treat well when they be little they grow up to be soft gentle and love animal 
 it be only right that import cat should have parity i nearly say pawrity of protection as they do across our domestic animal welfare law while we be talk about the wonderful thing we have across our constituency i want to mention jenny ’s cat house jenny take in load of animal that be rescue and lose and find literally into her house it have become a charity now she do incredible work as many do across the constituency 
 as we be talk about constituency issue a sad thing happen in northampton a few week ago there be an arson attack in dunelm and that spread to pets at home in the st james retail park unfortunately that fire rip through the vet the dog groomer and the store will the minister join i in thank all the volunteer vet groomer and the fire service who put their life at risk to save so many pet dog cat and other as that fire take hold 
 i of course join my hon friend in thank everyone involve it be horrific to think that somebody would wish to attack a veterinary building where they know animal receive treatment and where they live i hope that whoever have do that will be quickly and firmly bring to justice 
 as the number of pet owner have increase there be a number of people travel with their pet in dog cat and ferret be move non commercially into great britain while most of those be genuine movement the rise in non commercial movement also account for the uptick in unscrupulous trader that abuse our pet travel rule to illegally smuggle puppy and kitten into the country due to its illicit nature we can not know the true number of pet illegally smuggle into great britain what we do know however be the devastating effect it can have on the health and welfare   of the animal that suffer as a result i be delighted to reiterate the government ’s support for the bill these measure represent a crucial step forward in our collective effort to tackle the pet smuggling trade 
 as we set out in our manifesto this government be commit to end puppy smuggling and the measure in the bill will close loophole in our pet travel rule that smuggler exploit the bill will tighten these rule by reduce the number of pet that can travel in a single non commercial movement and require the movement of a pet to be explicitly link to that of its owner that will fundamentally disrupt the tactic we know illegal trader employ to avoid more stringent check and oversight i be reassure that the bill give the government the power to reduce those limit far should there be evidence that our pet travel rule continue to be abuse 
 as the hon member for winchester rightly highlight the bill also introduce power for the government to tackle low welfare import through secondary legislation the government must use these regulation make power to introduce impactful restriction restriction raise the minimum age at which dog and cat can be move into great britain to month ban the import of heavily pregnant dog and cat and ban the import of dog and cat that have be mutilate we want few low welfare operation supply pet to the gb market and fundamentally we want few animal to suffer i know that colleague from across the house be keen to see these regulation make it on to the statute book as soon as possible 
 this government be commit to introduce the prohibition in the bill as soon as practicable deliver these measure through secondary legislation will allow the government to work closely with stakeholder to understand where appropriate exemption from the measure may be need these will need to be carefully consider to ensure that we do not inadvertently create any loophole that could be abuse of course the enforcement of the measure will be crucial to their success local authority and the animal and plant health agency will continue to be responsible for enforce pet travel and commercial import requirement we will work closely with enforcement body to ensure that they have the right tool and guidance to enforce these measure effectively 
 i welcome the bill ’s new power to make regulation which will provide authority with a clear process and enforcement power when present with a non compliant pet regulation will allow for the cost of detention to be meet and if necessary for the animal to be rehome they will bolster the enforcement tool available to agency empower they to take appropriate action if the new rule be not follow while ensure that we protect the welfare of pet that be import illegally 
 in committee the government support several amendment to the bill which provide draft clarification and the necessary flexibility for genuine owner who will impact by the new rule due to protect characteristic or circumstance beyond their control i be pleased to see those amendment pass and i be confident that they will strengthen the bill the government support amendment to narrow the bill ’s power to make criminal offence those amendment will ensure that any criminal offence create use this power be foreseeable have be set out in the bill and will receive the appropriate scrutiny from parliament   the offence specify in the bill have be inform by engagement with enforcement body to ensure that they be fit for purpose 
 as touch on by the hon member for winchester the bill receive a clarification draft change in committee this change make it clear that the exist definition of pet animal in our pet travel regulation be not affect by the bill ultimately it ensure that the status quo be maintain and the effective operation of our pet travel regime 
 the bill be also amend to allow an appropriate authority to grant an exemption from the tight non commercial pet travel rule as amend in the bill in exceptional or compelling circumstance i reassure hon member that this mechanism will be tightly control the government be commit to ensure that the bill will not result in loophole that could be exploit by smuggler the mechanism will give the government flexibility to deal with unanticipated event that may impact the ability of genuine pet owner to follow the more stringent pet travel rule introduce by the bill for example in the case of force majeure such as a natural disaster that ground plane or a medical emergency that prevent owner from travel within day of their pet 
 furthermore the amendment will ensure that the new measure introduce by the bill do not adversely impact protect group such as assistant dog user who may wish to travel together in group large than this have be carefully consider by the government in accordance with our public sector equality duty under the equality act importantly the amendment do not provide blanket exemption from the rule instead each case will be consider individually the government will work with the animal and plant health agency to ensure that there be a clear process to follow and that exemption be grant only in truly exceptional or compelling circumstance 
 finally the government also support an amendment that remove the power to make further consequential amendment arise from the bill ’s change to the pet travel rule and correspond import rule since the bill be introduce we have far assess the change to legislation that might be necessary as a result of the bill and we be confident that no further amendment be require we be keen to take no more power than be necessary the amendment have not be consider lightly and i be in no doubt that they improve the deliverability and ability to enforce this bill 
 several mp have mention our work to reset relation with the eu as announce at the uk eu leader summit on   may the uk and eu have agree to work towards have a common sanitary and phytosanitary area which would make take pet to the eu on holiday easy and cheap it be important that we get the right agreement for the uk so we be not put any arbitrary deadline on negotiation we will provide more information on pet passport in due course in the meantime owner will still need an animal health certificate for their dog cat or ferret if they be travel from great britain to an eu country while i be unable to comment on live negotiation i reassure hon member that this government will continue to support this bill while negotiate an sps agreement with the eu 
 as set out in the government ’s manifesto we be commit to end puppy smuggling and deliver a well future for animal i be pleased to say that this bill do just that its key measure deliver crucial recommendation by the select committee on environment food and rural affairs and tackle multiple concern that have be raise by stakeholder regard loophole in our pet travel rule i commend the hon member for winchester on take this important bill through the house and i very much look forward to see it on the statute book

 question put and agree to 
 bill accordingly read the time and pass 
 bill not amend in the public bill committee consider 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 it be a pleasure to reach this milestone in the bill ’s journey through the house of commons as we know livestock worrying have devastating consequence for both animal and farmer in committee i and other committee member share the experience that have resonate with we of farmer have suffer attack to their livestock the damage of a livestock attack can be horrific cause brutal injury that be tragically often fatal there be instance of stress cause pregnant livestock to miscarry and separation of mother and their young lead to hypothermia or starvation i have see picture from farmer in my constituency of the aftermath of attack that have mutilate their calf beyond any hope of keep they alive 
 the consequence of an attack no matter the scale be profound and attack be sadly all too common the datum from the recent national sheep association survey speak for itself of respondent have experience incident in the last month and agree that there be an urgent need for additional police power the response highlight that livestock worry remain a huge problem for the sector and show just how important it be to deliver the bill 
 as someone who grow up on a sheep farm a vet who have treat injury cause by dog that be out of control and someone who continue to work with farmer quite closely in the meon valley i can not emphasise enough how necessary this legislation be the problem be devastating for animal but also cause farmer to take a huge economic hit it be horrendously stressful for everyone involve and it be not a niche problem it happen all the time i thank the hon member for introduce this legislation 
 i thank the hon member for his insight as a vet and for emphasise what so many people across the house know these change be vital may i also say how grateful i be to the hon member who take the time to serve on the bill committee i be truly grateful for their support and contribution and for the conversation i have have with many of they about the bill 
 as we hear in committee the bill will modernise the dogs protection of livestock act ensure that it reflect the need of modern day farming the bill strengthen police power so that they can do their job more effectively specifically it give the police power of entry and allow they to seize and detain dog and to collect evidence change that farmer in my constituency have specifically tell i be necessary the bill will also increase the penalty and we hope in turn the deterrent against livestock worry the fine be currently cap at a maximum of £ that will go up to an unlimited amount to reflect the severity of   livestock worry from an animal welfare standpoint as well as the economic toll an attack can have on farming 
 farming have diversify and therefore the scope of livestock require protection have increase i be delighted that camelid such as alpaca and llamas will now be protect under the bill anyone who have drive down country road such as those in my constituency of chester south and eddisbury will know that farmer move livestock in recognition of that the bill include road and path as location where an offence may take place that will give farmer great reassurance when move livestock as i say in committee the legislation put animal welfare and farmer right at its heart 
 today mark exactly year since the general election i be deeply proud and grateful that in my year as the member for chester south and eddisbury i have be able to introduce a bill in my name that will make a genuine difference both for animal welfare and farmer this be precisely why i stand for election and it be testament to the strength of this parliament that an opposition back bencher can help deliver meaningful change in the law that will have a real and lasting impact 
 we should all be able to enjoy the countryside and there be no fine countryside than in chester south and eddisbury however that enjoyment come with a responsibility to preserve and protect it and to support those who care for it every day our farming community the bill give we the opportunity to act to protect our countryside support our farmer and strengthen animal welfare i hope that member from all side of the house will join i in back it just as they do in committee 
 it be a pleasure to speak on another animal welfare bill today as   the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth   say it be fantastic to see this legislation bring in by a party that be not in government with cross party support i declare that i be a member of the national farmers union food and farming fellowship i have be fortunate to visit a number of farm across the uk to hear at hand from farmer from a range of speciality i can say that the bill will be fully support across that community particularly in northamptonshire 
 the nfu do great work to represent our fantastic farmer a number of whom i meet yesterday at a food event in northampton as we launch the northamptonshire good food plan they speak of the challenge particularly of work across border with the police because their farm often do not fit within normal police boundary and say they want more government support for the rural economy the bill go some way to help to achieve that 
 i be really pleased to see the expansion of the definition in the bill and i commend the hon member for chester south and eddisbury and the bill committee for ensure that we get that right in particular the inclusion of alpacas and llamas be really positive as we be see more and more of they rear in northamptonshire it will be positive to continue to review that as farmer diversify into new way of maintain food supply and the environment and ensure the long term   sustainability of farming bill such as this should continue to be adapt and evolve through successive government 
 i meet a farming colleague relatively recently who tell i about a mauling incident that happen on his land it be shocking to hear about the direct impact on he and his staff who discover it and the fact that the police struggle to take action because of the lack of power to undertake thing such as forensic it be positive that the bill be increase the relevant power particularly on the capture of dna from dog to ensure that perpetrator can be bring to justice it be a grim thing that continue to happen year on year and we must take positive step to change it 
 the bill be also very well time in northamptonshire the new police fire and crime commissioner danielle stone have recognise that rural crime have be neglect in recent year she have launch a rural crime survey and have a number of roundtable and panel with farmer across the county we now see farming and the protection of rural community front and centre in her police action plan northamptonshire be home to the large town in the uk northampton but also acre and acre of beautiful countryside which be use for both arable farming and rear herd and grow crop it be great timing to see the bill come through before the summer not just my police fire and crime commissioner but police commissioner across england will recognise and support the bill as a positive step forward 
 when i read the bill and listen to some of the observation in committee i find the expansion of the provision to road and path quite interesting for the record my uncle be the former president of the ramblers association and he repeatedly remind i of the right to roam campaign whenever i see he at family do it be positive that the bill expand the definition to include road and path because it set clear requirement when someone access land particularly in somewhere like northamptonshire where so many public footpath run through farmland to protect farmer and set clear boundary for those walk their dog or undertake more nefarious activity it be also positive to see the recovery of cost in the bill that be a big step forward that will deter people and serve as a reminder to many people who may be impact by the bill 
 overall the bill take a really responsible and balanced approach and i commend the hon member for chester south and eddisbury on her work as we have hear today from the many dog owner in the chamber dog owner be generally responsible but when thing go wrong and someone do not take that responsibility seriously there must be measure in place for the police to step in and farmer to be protect so i be really pleased to see this bill it do not take a heavy handed approach as a couple of constituent have write to i about it strike the right balance and i fully commend it and thank the hon member for bring it forward 
 i thank   the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth   for bring forward this bill which be immensely popular   with local farmer i have meet with the nfu and its membership repeatedly over month if not most of the last year and it be always of the thing they mention to i i commend she for her sterling work and for the collegiate way in which she always conduct herself include in this matter 
 it be fantastic that we be extend protection to alpaca and llama no want to see attack or worrying and include both those definition be really important and strengthen the law appropriately i be incredibly impressed that the bill cover path and road the hon member for chester south and eddisbury think her constituency be the most beautiful in the country but of course it be not even the most beautiful in cheshire because mine be well of the really beautiful thing i do recently be go to goostrey rose festival last weekend we have new path in goostrey and they be use incredibly regularly by dog walker but they be on farm boundary this legislation be so important for cover path like those 
 i have be on a farm with a family in the aftermath of a dog attack and it be terrible i be not here to demonise dog owner we have so many considerate sensible countryside love dog owner in my constituency and i know the hon member for chester south and eddisbury be not either we be here to make sure that the overwhelming majority of people be leave in peace to go about their everyday life in both the farming community and the dog own community they be often and the same and to make sure that rural crime be properly prosecute 
 gps theft be another major component of rural crime in my area our local police and crime commissioner dan price have be do work on this and the hon member for chester south and eddisbury have be involve in it it would be great to get an update from the minister on that 
 i want to take a moment to thank the nfu which have lobby i extensively on this issue i be on its food and farming fellowship and have learn a great deal from it i also thank the farmer in my constituency for continue to feed we and for look after the countryside so well 
 i rise to support the bill and i commend   the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth   for bring it to parliament 
 i want to make some brief remark about what be sometimes perceive as a tension between those who wish to responsibly enjoy the countryside and both the economic toll and the harm do to livestock by livestock worrying since be elect to this place i have be a strong champion for expand responsible access to the countryside across england and wales my hon friend   the member for northampton south mike reader   mention the right to roam campaign 
 i commend the hon member for chester south and eddisbury because this bill shin a light on the fact that most of we who wish to go into the great outdoors and enjoy our wonderful countryside whether that be in cheshire or on the wonderful west pennine moor in my bolton west constituency do so responsibly but those who do not ensure that their dog conduct themselves   in a considerate manner will feel the wrath of these measure i particularly welcome that because there be a balance to be strike between farmer and those who look after livestock in the countryside and those who want to enjoy our great outdoors 
 with that in mind i want to touch on a couple of point on extend the provision to include camelid there be a number of alpaca and llama at farm in my constituency include smithills open farm member may think they look rather incongruous on the great west pennine moor but i assure they that they be incredibly popular both in term of the opportunity to walk they around the moor and with school visit 
 i want to touch on a couple of point that the minister may pick up on relate to the opportunity that present themselves outside the criminal law to push for great responsible enjoyment of our countryside particularly in respect of increase investment in promote awareness of the countryside code i will read out some of the provision in the code to make people aware i think they be principle that everyone in this place can rally around 
 do not feed livestock horse or wild animal do not cause damage or disturbance leave no trace always keep dog under control and in sight dog poo bag it and bin it take your litter home 
 and most importantly be courteous 
 be nice share the space 
 with other that should be the golden thread that run through all our time spend in the countryside 
 it be worth i put on the record that the uk rank the low of european nation with regard to nature connectedness and out european nation survey the uk be in term of physical activity so there be great work to be do to provide access to nature but also on enjoy it and break down some of the barrier to opportunity 
 nevertheless i commend the hon member for chester south and eddisbury for bring forward the bill i very much appreciate the concern she have raise around livestock worry she have be a champion for that cause ever since she get elect to this place 
 i commend the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy   for praise her daughter in the chamber it be very important to praise child my aunty mary who move from newcastle in the blitz to become a schoolteacher just north of here in london would always emphasise to i how important it be to give child confidence in their ability and their quality 
 we be talk early about dog and david hockney so it would be remiss of i not to mention elizabeth blackadder a very fine printmaker from glasgow and of the united kingdom ’s most famous artist she be a real pioneer in revive printmaking in scotland in trongate we have the glasgow print studio project ability currently have an exhibition of art by people who have disability and mental health issue it be a wonderful exhibition if any member be go to glasgow they should go to that exhibition because it be absolutely wonderful it be a beautiful exhibition 
 the bill do not apply to scotland because it be a criminal matter and criminal matter be devolve to scotland in the constitutional settlement but this be an important issue in scotland there have be some discussion about the lack of prosecution for this sort of offence it be important that these offence be prosecute because farming be an important part of the british economy and the scottish economy i know that well because as a complete townie who get very uncomfortable if there be a lack of car and noise i marry into a family of farmer 
 my wife ’s family be dairy farmer on the solway firth which look over into cumbria where the bill will apply and have very important impact as sheep farming be very important in cumbria i do not think my lovely father in law andrew be particularly impressed with my farming ability help in the milk parlour do not go very well and apparently the fence i put up be not straight enough he generally think i be incompetent in the farming area i think now after year of marriage it be come up to our wedding anniversary on   july he think i be kind of all right as a husband and a father but i have not check this week 
 my wife ’s aunt and uncle elma and sam be sheep farmer sheep farming be a very difficult way of make money it be hard work farming be hard hard work whatever kind it be farmer have to get up very early to look after the animal they have to protect the animal and pay for the veterinary bill and so on it be a tough job i do not think we should underestimate how important this bill will be as a signal that this house support farmer and take into account their concern these be hard job 
 farmer be steward of the countryside across britain obviously glasgow be the most beautiful place in the world but i would not wish to get into a dispute about where the most beautiful part of cheshire be because cheshire be beautiful farmer be an important part of stewarde the countryside across our family of nation which be so important to we and this bill be important for farmer farmer be important for the british economy not just the farm themselves but our brilliant farmer who help to supply restaurant and shop create the great revival of british cooking and cuisine that we have see in our lifetime so this bill be very important and i hope that the scottish government look at it carefully and perhaps review the lack of prosecution of these offence 
 now i should say something of the bill itself because it be important i have cover the important constitutional aspect of it that it do not cover scotland but clause be key there be limited scope for the police to seize dog for prolonged period of time even when they be cause danger it be i be afraid regrettably common for dog that have be seize to carry out further attack pende the trial of their owner give the police the ability to seize dog for long period of time will therefore prevent those repeat attack i commend   the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth   for address that in clause it be an important provision and she be quite right to include it 
 as a recover lawyer i have at time have an interest in the investigation of crime of course whatever the legal system it be necessary to have sufficient evidence broadly to convince a judge or a jury to convict someone   rural crime be particularly difficult in that regard the reason be self evident when we think about it as a complete townie it have take i a bit of time to spot the self evidence of it 
 my hon friend consistently refer to himself as a complete townie a description that i would apply to myself too of course the fact that we reside in urban area do not in any way mean that we be unconcerned by the fortune of our fellow parliamentarian who represent agricultural area or indeed their community who play a vital role in sustain we the importance of food be something i often speak about for as much as we focus on whatever the lead industry be of the day society fundamentally come down to the question of whether we can feed and house ourselves covid in particular drive forward the point that the agricultural system in this country be vital 
 my hon friend ’s intervention typify his many thoughtful contribution he make an important point 
 i think all of we who live in city towny like i have a great yearning for the countryside in my constituency we have tollcross park which be a wonderful park i recommend that everyone visit it there be a city farm in the park which house llamas and alpaca to which the provision of the bill extend they be protect by it i would not want to sully this debate with a political point but i simply point out that the snp council regularly threaten to close that farm tollcross also have some wonderful rose garden which the council do not look after particularly well which be a real disappointment to my constituent they be right to be disappoint 
 turn back to the bill the investigation of crime in the countryside be difficult as there be not lot of people about there be no cctv and there be very few witness if any clause allow for the collection of forensic evidence which will be very important in link the dog to the animal that have be attack and the owner and in facilitate the prosecution of these serious crime and bring about justice it be fair to say that my hon friend   the member for crawley peter lamb   raise a very important issue 
 the improved power of entry and search in order to look for sample and take impression from a dog teeth impression and so on i assume be very important too again they make investigation of these crime easy it be important that we investigate and prosecute the crime if we do not the law will just sit on the statute book unenforce ignore and otiose if we do not have the enforcement mechanism we be waste our time in the house so the hon member for chester south and eddisbury be right to include they in the bill we do not want to waste our time everyone in this house agree that crack down on these terrible crime be very important 
 i be particularly pleased that the bill deal with road and path have help my father in law on many occasion utterly incompetently with thing like move animal around somewhat like my career in the petrochemical industry when i put diesel in the unleaded car it be not something i be cut out for   i know that animal can be attack and worry on road and path it be also right that attack livestock be deal with differently from worry livestock
