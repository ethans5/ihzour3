thank you very much mr speaker for grant the urgent question but if the rail minister be not available you would think that the secretary of state would be bother to turn up to the house on an issue of this importance 
 here we be yet again year of gross mismanagement and chaos come home to roost the government slash northern powerhouse rail then they bin hs2 to leeds then they announce that the line would terminate at old oak common for year to come and now it look as though they be consider cut the north of england out in its entirety if that be true what be we leave with we be leave with the tories flagship levelling up project that reach neither the north of england nor central london the most expensive railway track in the world which thank to terminate in acton will mean a long journey between birmingham and central london than the passenger currently enjoy what start out as a modern infrastructure plan leave by the last labour government link our large northern city will after year of tory incompetence waste and broken promise have turn into a humiliating conservative failure a great rail betrayal—£45 and the least possible economic    impact from the original plan £ and the north leave with nothing but frankly what else would we expect from a prime minister who do not travel through the north of england on rail he only ever fly over it today community and business do not need yet more speculation and rumour from the heart of this broken government they need answer 
 will the minister urgently explain if the photograph leak last friday reflect his government ’s position to slash phase altogether will he confirm the commitment his boss make in this house just a few month ago that high speed train will reach manchester by be his government plan for train to terminate at old oak common for good detonate the business case and overwhelm the elizabeth line have run our economy our public service and our railway into the ground will the country not now conclude that this be proof once and for all that the tories can never be trust to run our country again 
 i can now announce the arrangement for the election of the chair of the defence committee i declare the chair vacant on thursday nomination will close on   tuesday october nomination form will be available in the vote office the table office and the public bill office only conservative members may be candidate in this election if there be more than candidate the ballot will take place in the aye lobby on   wednesday october   between am and pm a briefing note with more information will be make available in the vote office 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to ensure an adequate standard of accommodation for refugee and asylum seeker 
 the asylum accommodation support contract ensure the provision of safe habitable fit for purpose and correctly equip accommodation for destitute asylum seeker the contract also require compliance with the law local authority licensing and good practice guidance we have be work with the department for levelling up housing and communities to minimise the potential impact on homelessness and have agree an asylum placement funding for local authority 
 we hear the government talk about £ per day be waste on hotel but we do not hear about the billion be fork out on private company such as serco and clearsprings ready homes both of which have see score of complaint include about unsanitary condition a lack of safeguarding and sexual abuse do the home secretary think that it be appropriate to entrust those company with taxpayer money to run asylum accommodation in hotel and former ministry of defence site 
 the safety and wellbeing of asylum seeker in our care be of paramount importance at the home office we expect high standard from all our provider and we have robust governance framework in place to manage the service delivery of asylum accommodation what we definitely do not do and do not propose to do be willingly accept thousand more illegal migrant into the uk from the eu house presumably in more hotel across the country as labour be propose i campaign for brexit to take back control of our border not for labour to surrender our sovereignty to the eu 
 of the justification for use service accommodation such as raf scampton be that it be suppose to be cheap but we now know the figure it be more expensive over year and over year the saving be absolutely derisory the figure be frankly be fiddle by overcapitalise the value of the base and be not base on survey the home secretary ’s official be now rip out service the council have issue a stop order on it i give notice that i will report the home office to the comptroller and auditor general for misapplying and waste public money because use the base will cost more than hotel the base be crown land so the local authority can not enter it do she accept that she would be act illegally and be liable to be sue if her official disobey the stop order 
 i have have several discussion with my right hon friend about the propose asylum accommodation at scampton i thank he for his very energetic campaigning on behalf of his constituent i very much appreciate the challenge that this nationwide mission pose for we all i do not agree with his assessment we have assess the proposal at scampton to be value for money ultimately it be not right that we continue to house ten of thousand of migrant in hotel in town and city across the country cost the taxpayer £ a day that be why our work to roll out large site be move swiftly and we propose to move asylum seeker on to they as soon as possible 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it have be more than a month since all asylum seeker be haul off the capacity bibby stockholm because of the detection of legionella but the home secretary be yet to give a date for when the barge will actually be ready for use we still do not know why she choose not to wait for the legionella result before plough ahead and why her minister be so slow to act once the result come in we be still yet to hear a denial from the home secretary that it be of the most lethal strain of the bacteria as report in the medium today will she set out her response to those question and confirm the exact cost of the barge half a pound per month to house asylum seeker on this float symbol of failure feel utterly extortionate why be it that the only boat this government have manage to stop be their own 
 i be somewhat surprised by the hon gentleman ’s change of tune he be on the record in the medium as support our use of the barge so a change of heart be welcome we have assess the barge it   have be under constant scrutiny and we will be re embark people on to that barge as soon as be practical and possible what be clear be that the hon gentleman simply have no answer for how to solve the broad problem the truth be that labour ’s policy have not survive contact with reality it have be denounce by the eu its shadow ministers be make it up as they go along and the leader have have to backtrack and it have not even be a week only the conservative party have a plan that be base on reality deterrence and delivery and it will stop the boat 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 opendemocracy recently reveal the extent of self harm and suicide in immigration removal centre in particular harmondsworth and colnbrook where self harm incident occur in march which be more than over the previous month combine emma ginn director of medical justice have say 
 we be not confident that the home office consider the value of the life of those in its care in detention as fully human 
 what be the home secretary do to ensure that those in home office immigration removal centre do not face such desperate circumstance that they seek to take their own life 
 as i say the safety of all of those in our care be a priority for the home office and the standard of habitation whether that be in our asylum accommodation estate more broadly or specifically in our immigration removal centre be that always as far as the law require meet high standard those standard be rigorously scrutinise and monitor and those who have concern have avenue to make complaint via the migrant helpline 
 what step she be take to increase police resource 
 what step she be take to increase police resource 
 i be sure that the whole house will join i in send our very sincere condolence to the family of sergeant graham saville who a week or ago so tragically lose his life in the line of duty save another in the constituency of my right hon friend   the member for newark robert jenrick our thought and prayer be with his family he make the ultimate sacrifice and we be grateful to he 
 to answer my hon friend question total police funding this year stand at £ a record level frontline policing receive an extra £ this year compare with last year and i be pleased to report once again that we have a record number of police officer across england and wales which be more than we ever have under the last labour government 
 as always the devil be in the detail in durham we see funding pressure on both police and fire service which be not help by our local tax base be so low we have a to c in most region the fire   service have a coherent albeit very challenge programme but the labour police and crime commissioner know year ago that newton aycliffe police station be go to be move away from the fire station and she be still scramble around do the minister agree that good plan help cost effective delivery and will he meet i to discuss funding and programme delivery for the police and fire service in durham that cover my sedgefield constituency do he also agree that elect robert potts the conservative candidate for the next pcc election in may would be a far well outcome for the police in durham 
 i will certainly meet with my hon friend and yes i do agree i be very disappointed to hear what he have to say about his labour pcc ’s performance which contrast with what conservative pcc have do only today pcc donna jones in hampshire announce that she would be open new police counter an example of what happen when we have sound conservative policy in operation 
 my right hon friend will recall his recent visit to uxbridge will he join i in call for the mayor of london to guarantee the future of uxbridge police station as fully operational include a full custody suite and a front counter for my constituent 
 i welcome my hon friend to his very well deserve place of course the mayor of london sadiq khan have plan to close down uxbridge police station along with many other until my hon friend force he into a humiliating u turn before he be even elect that be more than most of we achieve prior to come to parliament i join he in call on the mayor of london to keep uxbridge police station open and to add that custody suite but also to confirm the future of all those other police station around london that he have threaten to close just a few year ago 
 in my constituency we have experience a real escalation in antisocial behaviour and quite violent disorder in recent year particularly around bonfire night last year police have to deploy officer to just area of my constituency where local community be be terrorise what consideration have the minister make of additional power or resource for area up and down the country that be anticipate far unacceptable disorder ahead of this year ’s bonfire night 
 the hon lady be quite right to raise this issue antisocial behaviour concern everyone there be a number of power available to local police such as community protection notice and to local authority i be think in particular of public space protection order so i strongly urge she to work with her local authority and if she be concerned about a particular area to put in place a public space protection order ahead of bonfire night our antisocial behaviour plan envisage strengthen various antisocial behaviour power as of next april we will also be fund every single police force in the country to have antisocial behaviour hotspot patrol i be not sure whether her force be of the pilot area but every force will   have that funding from next april and the sort of situation that she describe sound like the ideal use for those asb hotspot patrol 
 the same shop and newsagent on kilburn high road in my constituency be constantly target by criminal who shoplift but also intimidate staff when i raise the issue with the police they say they receive call a day from central north london alone limit their ability to deal with it what plan do the minister have to increase the resource to deal with this sort of crime especially retail theft 
 i strongly sympathise with those affect by shoplift on kilburn high road i be the prospective parliamentary candidate in that constituency in and i remember walk down kilburn high road with dominic grieve when a shoplifter run out of poundland and straight into our arm it be a serious issue the metropolitan police have a record number of police officer about and i have recently be in discussion with amanda blakeman the national police chiefs council lead to increase patrolling in shoplift hotspot area and to have a more comprehensive response from the police in term of investigation such as always follow up cctv footage where it be available this be an issue not just on kilburn high road but around the country as i say we will shortly announce further action in partnership with police 
 whether she have have discussion with cabinet colleague and the scottish government on further devolution of drug policy to scotland 
 i have not have discussion on the devolution of drug policy which be of course reserve to this parliament but i do have regular discussion about co operate with colleague in the scottish government i have a discussion with the new minister just a few week ago and i think we be go to be meet in cardiff in just a few week time with ministers from the devolve administration to discuss how we can work constructively and collaboratively together 
 the minister will know that the lord advocate in scotland have issue a prosecution statement say that she will not prosecute anyone in possession of control substance in any pilot safe consumption or overdose prevention facility that might be establish in scotland can he confirm what the secretary of state for scotland indicate in the house last week that the uk government will not seek to use any administrative or legislative mean to frustrate or block the establishment of such a pilot facility 
 it be important to make it clear that the uk government ’s position on drug consumption room in england and wales be that we do not support they we be concerned that they condone or even encourage illegal drug use i want to put that on the record straightaway of course we respect the independence of the lord advocate as scotland ’s prosecutorial authority   provide that that power be exercise lawfully of course we be not go to stand in the way of it as my right hon friend the scottish secretary set out last week i understand that plan may involve a strong integration with treatment and some consideration of each case on its individual merit but we do not plan to interfere with the lawfully exercise prosecutorial independence of the lord advocate 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i be glad to hear what the drug minister say the home affairs committee ’s report on drug highlight good practice in scotland in particular with the naloxone roll out and the medication assist treatment standard for same day treatment academic evaluation have also find our enhance drug treatment service scotland ’s only heroin assist treatment service to have be successfully implement in particular with a group with very complex background will the minister visit glasgow to hear more about what scotland be do to reduce harm and save life 
 as i say to the hon lady at the bar of the house last week i be due to be in edinburgh in early december so i would be delighted to accept her invitation to visit the facility in glasgow 
 what step her department be take to reduce knife crime 
 what step her department be take to reduce knife crime 
 this government be determined to fight knife crime we have invest over £ in to fight knife crime include invest in violence reduction unit and funding hotspot police in the most seriously affect area 
 i welcome the news that the government be seek to close the legal loophole around the sale of so call zombie knife but do my right hon friend agree that stop and search and the like be powerful tool for the police to get knife off the street and to save life will he also look closely at scan and search to help to detect such weapon 
 my hon friend be quite right that we be look to tighten the law the offensive weapons act contain a loophole essentially which mean zombie knife without threaten writing on the blade be not illegal we be go to close that loophole i agree with he that stop and search be a vital tactic to keep our street safe when use of course respectfully the metropolitan police commissioner tell i that about knife be take off the street every month use stop and search in london alone so it be an important power i also agree with my hon friend ’s point the use of scan technology have the huge potential to enable officer to scan people for knife at a distance   without have to physically stop they and search they manually the technology be not ready to deploy just yet but i hope it will be in the relatively near future 
 in police officer be attack with machete in west bromwich town centre in the same year a year old boy be stab and kill in great barr in a teenager from my constituency be stab on his way to college in birmingham while the minister say we have already ban the sale of zombie knife that have not stop people purchase these dangerous weapon so i thank the government for take the next step to close the loophole will this change be bring forward as soon as possible 
 the change certainly will happen as soon as possible some of it require primary legislation but other element require secondary legislation and we be definitely go to do that as soon as we can as for the sale of these knife once the online safety bill pass parliament i hope very soon the sale of these knife via online marketplace such as facebook marketplace and amazon will also be prohibit address my hon friend ’s point about sale 
 we absolutely do need to get a grip on knife crime which be up by since alone be the minister content with the fact that only of crime of violence against the person actually make it to court if he be not what be he do about it 
 on the crime statistic the crime survey of england and wales be the only long term datum series endorse by the office for national statistics since the hon gentleman ask about datum since just to pick a date arbitrarily violence be down by that be to say violent crime be double under the last labour government compare with now knife enable crime be low in the late year compare with the year end december accord to police record crime but we would like to do more hence the grip hotspot patrol hence criminalise these remain zombie knife 
 to actually answer the hon gentleman ’s question i want that figure for prosecution be high and that be why the home secretary and i together with policing lead the college of policing and the national police chiefs council announce or week ago that the police be now commit to always follow all reasonable line of inquiry where they exist 
 order i love the full answer but i be really struggle to get even part way down the order paper 
 i draw the minister ’s attention to the sad fact that most mp have have the tragedy of knife crime in our constituency we have a dreadful incident in huddersfield be it not time that we understand more the culture that produce it this be about the way in which young people communicate on the internet and the fact that we no long have many youth club or youth service we use to have wonderful police go into school to talk about these issue can we have that back 
 i will try to be brief we have violence reduction unit design to provide those activity we be also fund research we have a social media hub in the met police that monitor social medium it be base in lambeth and i have be to it the thing that the hon gentleman ask for be be do because it be essential that we tackle knife crime 
 i call the shadow minister 
 rape at knifepoint be at a record high this year the number of case have more than double since i be currently support a case of a woman violently rap use weapon and the detective on the case tell i that he be the only detective in his team work on serious sexual violence the police foundation describe the current number of detective as a chronic shortage highlight a staggering vacancy be it any wonder that there have be a drop in the overall proportion of crime be charge since include almost violent crime and rape the labour party have propose require all police force to have a scheme that directly recruit detective with relevant professional background so what be the government do about this chronic shortage of detective and the abysmal charge rate that they preside over 
 the rape charge rate be a serious matter and operation soteria bluestone which the hon lady will be familiar with have be roll out around the country under the supervision of the safeguarding minister my hon friend   the member for derbyshire dales miss dines in the force that adopt that measure early rape charge rate dramatically increase by to time as that roll out around the country those charge rate will increase but we would like to go far 
 on the question of specialist train officer now that we have record number of officer across england and wales as a whole we will be target individual force with training and recruit a specified number of specialist officer to make sure that those people be in place to properly investigate these issue because we want to do a lot more in this area 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for justice on the adequacy of compensation for police officer injure in the course of their duty 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for justice on the adequacy of compensation for police officer injure in the course of their duty 
 the police injury benefit scheme provide ongoing and off payment to former police officer who have be injure or disable in the line of duty 
 i be recently shock to discover that police officer be entitle to official compensation only if they be injure while take an exceptional risk and a risk be consider exceptional only if it would not   normally be expect that sound strange do it not with more than assault against police in the past year and many officer ineligible for injury compensation because of that rule do the home secretary agree that these guideline effectively normalise violence against police and must be change 
 we certainly do not want to see violence against police normalise that be why we legislate to double the maximum sentence for assault against emergency worker just a year or ago my understanding be that the payment under the police injury benefit scheme can go up to of salary but since the hon lady have raise the point i will take a look at it 
 over recent year a number of police officer have tragically die in the line of duty and i acknowledge the service of pc nicola hughes pc fiona bone and sergeant graham saville labour have support call for a posthumous medal for fall officer why will the minister not do the right thing and acknowledge those who give their life to keep we safe 
 we do acknowledge that and it may well be that posthumous award be make we obviously do not comment on individual case and potential award prior to their be make but if i say that i strongly sympathise with what the hon lady just say i think she will understand what i mean 
 what step she be take to reduce crime 
 what step she be take to reduce crime 
 our community be safe than in with overall crime on a like for like basis down by we have put more police officer on our street a record number which be enable we to take action across the board to bring more offender to justice to well protect victim and to equip our police with the power they need to prevent crime 
 the fall in crime be welcome but do my right hon and learn friend agree that the police would deter and solve even more crime such as burglary the use of quad bike and general antisocial behaviour in place such as hatfield doncaster rossington and thorne in my constituency if they start put more bobby on the beat and stop promote unscientific ideology 
 my hon friend be quite right we pay the police to fight crime whether that be to focus on the antisocial behaviour the nuisance biker or the burglary he mention they be there to keep people safe we do not pay they to wave flag at parade to dance with drag queen or to campaign that be why i finally end all association with stonewall at the home office and why i expect all police and crime commissioner and chief constable to focus on cut crime and rebuild confidence not play politic 
 i thank the home secretary who recently come to warrington to meet the chief constable mark roberts and our police and crime commissioner john dwyer we be now at record number of police officer and alongside that we be at record number of arrest cheshire have the high charge and summon rate in england and wales for all crime in the last month of the concern raise by constituent at a recent surgery be the increase in cyber crime what step be the home secretary take to bolster action against fraud and online scam 
 my hon friend have be an indefatigable champion for his community and i very much enjoy join he at his local police station to meet his excellent chief constable mark roberts with the pcc cheshire be an example of common sense policing and protect the public with those arrest rate and a focus on domestic abuse on which cheshire constabulary have achieve some excellence it deserve all the praise that it get 
 when it come to tackle online scam and online fraud which be a feature of modern day crime fighting early this year with the prime minister i announce our fraud strategy pound from the spending review have go towards tackle fraud a portion of that will fund a new national fraud squad of specialist fraud officer across police and the national crime agency who will investigate the most harmful fraudster target the uk public 
 since the proportion of crime that result in a perpetrator face a punishment have go down by third be that because the government have a policy of cut police officer 
 i be incredibly proud of the increase resource for policing the increase power for policing with the new officer on the frontline that the government have deliver for the british people a record number we be at historic level and the overall fall in crime since yes there be more to do but on all those measure how do labour vote it vote against they and against the british public 
 the home secretary talk about tackle online and telephone scam and she be right to do so age uk recently come out with research that show that of people age over have be victim of online or telephone scam of some kind will she talk about how she will use that research and extend the resource she give to police authority such as in cumbria as well as work with bank and other outfit to ensure that more people be not victim of this outrageous uptick in scam 
 the hon member be absolutely right online crime and fraud have become a grave feature of today ’s criminality that be why our fraud strategy be all about target this emerge threat whether that be through the national fraud squad that i just mention ban sim farm increase specialism on the frontline or our police force work with the national crime agency other agency and importantly the tech and banking sector we will prevent fraud from become a reality as well as detect it and enforce against it far down the line 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the home secretary seek to paint a rosy picture on crime in reality retail crime be as describe by the co op out of control and with few neighbourhood police and police community support officer that be no surprise across all retailer there be more than act of violence or abuse every single day the co op also report that even when it detain someone suspect to have commit a crime of the time it have to let they go again because the police be stretch too thinly to come and make the arrest when will the home secretary drop this pretence that thing be go well and actually stand up for our shop worker 
 we take these matter incredibly seriously that be why my right hon friend the policing minister meet the co op and other major retailer recently to discuss this issue in detail shoplifting and retail theft have become a challenge for retailer and our community which be not right that be why a few week ago we make a nationwide commitment whereby all police force have agree to follow every reasonable line of inquiry that will mean that cctv footage online evidence of resale and other actionable evidence will be follow up by the police lead the investigation and justice process 
 what recent guidance she have issue to the police on apprehend illegal motorcyclist 
 the illegal use of motorcycle can cause distress and be dangerous to the public the police have all the power they need to police that and such use of motorcycle be illegal the college of policing ’s authorise professional practice provide advice to the operationally independent chief constable whom i urge to use their power to the full 
 dangerous motorcyclist be out of control in my area we have have death and life threaten injury we now have year old rid pillion on motorbike and people do wheelie down road pavement and amenity area with not a helmet in sight my police tell i that they need urgent guidance on safeguard officer who try to apprehend they and an urgent review of section of the police reform act on the requirement that officer be present in uniform at the time of offend would the minister get on to those specific issue please 
 i would be happy to look into those specific issue the police have power to pursue even where the motorcycle rider be not wear a helmet we have similar issue with moped in london or year ago for a time the police do not pursue they and mop crime shoot through the roof they now pursue they and it have go back down i urge bedfordshire police to use those power but i will certainly look into the question that my hon friend have raise 
 what recent guidance her department have issue to the police on uphold the right of child in custody 
 child should be detain only when necessary and must be provide with an appropriate adult the college of policing provide operational guidance for police and the concordat on child in custody support police and local authority to meet their statutory responsibility hm inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service also set expectation for the treatment of child in custody 
 when a child be arrest they must choose if they wish receive legal advice just like an adult but child be not adult and no should expect a child age or above to decide whether to exercise their right to a solicitor will the minister explain why the government believe that child should be force to make such a decision 
 i remind the hon lady that child be involve in crime child detain in police custody must have an appropriate adult statistic show that that happen in of case who can be of assistance i want that to be police custody remain a core part of the criminal justice system it be critical for maintain police confidence bring offender to justice and keep the public safe we must ensure that adult do not abuse child and be not attract to make child get involve in criminal activity because the police be too scared to put they into custody if necessary 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the potential merit of introduce a substance misuse harm reduction model to tackle acquisitive crime 
 we have not have any specific discussion on that but we have a year drug strategy which include spend an extra £ over year on extra treatment place we want to treat people who be addicted particularly to opioid to get they off drug and fully recover 
 a large number of people be be exploit into criminal activity whether through drug gang or acquisitive crime they need help and support from the state will the minister look at how to put a harm reduction model in place for those individual rather than criminalise they so that they can get the support they need to change the direction of their life 
 there be a twin track approach there be a comprehensive effort to ensure more addicted people get treatment be divert to it from police custody from the court system and when they leave prison as i say there be an extra £ over year we be in the of those year at the moment   but enforcement particularly against drug gang and organise criminal gang be important at the border and in the case of county line it be a twin track approach enforcement together with treatment 
 what recent progress her department have make on reduce antisocial behaviour 
 what recent progress her department have make on reduce antisocial behaviour 
 what recent progress her department have make on reduce antisocial behaviour 
 what recent progress her department have make on reduce antisocial behaviour 
 on   march the government announce the antisocial behaviour action plan back by £ of new funding police and crime commissioner be be support to increase hotspot policing and to run immediate justice pilot in july we announce round of the safe street fund to deliver a range of asb and crime prevention measure 
 i thank the home secretary very much for her recent visit to southend where she meet the excellent police fire and crime commissioner roger hirst and our excellent chief constable b j. harrington she hear about how southend ’s revolutionary operation union have drive down antisocial behaviour across our city by over that will be assist by the government ’s step last week to tackle nitrous oxide i thank she very much for tackle that menace however constituent be raise with i antisocial behaviour in and around pub include drug relate incident so can my right hon and learn friend tell i whether she have any specific plan to help local police deal with that particular problem 
 i be very pleased to join my hon friend in southend and to meet her chief constable and the office of the pcc she be right that the success of operation union have help to drive down asb but there be more to do to tackle the asb that blight community that be why i be pleased that her force essex have the most police officer ever and be do very well with its progress on the hotspot policing pilot 
 my hon friend talk about drug part of our plan on asb be to expand drug testing on arrest so that police can now test for more substance class b and c when they arrest someone on suspicion of drug possession 
 unfortunately there be instance of antisocial behaviour in the centre of keighley mostly around the bus station but of course there be other hotspot area the police and the local community be have to deal with this issue on an ongoing basis i be very pleased that the government make extra resource available to our west yorkshire police via the antisocial   behaviour action plan but will the home secretary join i in urge our labour west yorkshire mayor who be responsible for set local police strategy and our crime reduction action plan in keighley to be more laser focused on antisocial behaviour so that we can all ensure that the issue be tackle once and for all 
 i urge the pcc to take heed of my hon friend ’s warning and advice the government through our safe street fund have award the south yorkshire police area over £ in recent year funding that have go towards tackle asb and reduce crime it be up to the pccs to apply in the next round for funding to put forward project that can have a focus on reduce crime protect victim and secure safety for community 
 on occasion people use wrexham bus station have be subject to antisocial behaviour perpetrate by a small band of disaffected youth i would like to compliment inspector luke hughes and the wrexham city police team for their appropriate use of dispersal order will the home secretary join i in praise north wales police despite be slow down to mph by the welsh labour government for their pragmatic and no nonsense approach to uphold public safety 
 i be afraid the litany of ridiculous policy announcement by labour be reach record level i mean we only have to look at the last day a period of silence from the labour party would be welcome the mph zone be ridiculous my hon friend be absolutely right dispersal order be a regrettable but necessary power that the police have at their disposal we be go even far with our antisocial behaviour action plan by expand police power such as public space protection order and community protection notice enable the police to take rapid and effective action to disperse people and to stop nuisance and criminal antisocial behaviour 
 over the summer i have speak to many people in leyland who although we have manage to get the police station reopen be still report problem involve antisocial behaviour in broadfield worden and stars i have be out with the local bobby who be benefit from the government ’s police uplift to see what be be do to tackle those problem operation centurion our police and crime commissioner ’s attempt to use money seize from criminal to boost local policing temporarily in order to address antisocial behaviour be about to hit leyland but do the home secretary agree that we need a whole agency approach and that council should use the power at their disposal to issue community protection notice and work with the police to end this blight on the people of leyland 
 i be delighted that my hon friend have be able to work closely with her excellent police and crime commissioner andrew snowden who be another example of effective leadership at the police force in lancashire and whom i have have the pleasure of meeting it be also good that lancashire be of the pilot area for hotspot policing it be currently deliver hour a month of additional patrolling in antisocial   behaviour hotpot area and that be set to increase however i urge the labour council to listen to my hon friend ’s sensible word and ask the police and local authority to use all the power at their disposal to tackle antisocial behaviour through for instance public space protection order and community protection notice 
 constituent include pupil at lliswerry high school constantly raise with i the antisocial and dangerous use of e scooter and e bike i hold a debate on this last december but little have happen since and legislation need to catch up with the growth in their sale will the home secretary talk to ministers at the department for transport to see what can be do to address the problem 
 the behaviour of nuisance rider or boy racer whatever we want to call they be antisocial behaviour plain and simple it be criminal it can be harass it can bring fear to community and it can cause criminal damage the police work with local authority have the necessary power to end these problem and force around the country have organise pilot that have lead to success i encourage the hon lady ’s local police force to look at the good practice that be currently take place around the country 
 let we get this exactly right over the next year police number in scotland be due to fall by the highland and island police chief have say that something have to give i have think that barnett consequential would lead to an increase in scotland ’s police number rather than a decrease when it come to antisocial behaviour what a grim message this be for some of the most vulnerable in society 
 unfortunately it be incredibly tragic the scottish national party ’s obsession with separatism have lead to the high number of alcohol and drug relate death in europe on their watch fall police number in scotland when number be rise in england and wales that be what the snp bring we and only good government from the conservatives can stop crime and protect victim 
 what step her department be take to reduce the number of small boat transport irregular migrant across the english channel 
 we remain determined to stop the boat and deter people from make these dangerous journey to the uk and we be make progress we have by no mean reach the finish line but the number of arrival be down the legacy backlog have nearly halve and the number of albanian arrival have fall by this year while labour propose to take thousand of illegal migrant from the eu every single year let brussels decide who come here we be determined to stop the boat with our rwanda plan and our illegal migration act which labour oppose 
 a hotel in my constituency be housing illegal migrant they receive local nhs dentistry service and hospital access and of course their living cost be meet constituent write to i point out that they do not have access to all those service what can my right hon and learn friend tell they about how soon the use of hotel for illegal migrant will end 
 it be totally unacceptable that too many town and city around the country now house the asylum seeker who be in hotel cost the british taxpayer £ a day that be why we be stand up large site and vessel around the country we be also maximise the use of hotel so that we can open few hotel it be not right that the british taxpayer be fork out the cost what we be not do be the ridiculous plan set out by labour members they be either grotesquely naive about the problem or they have a betrayal plan to rejoin the eu after all most of they want a referendum either way we can all see it for what it be a plan for open border unlimited migration and rejoin the european union it be the same old labour on the wrong side of the argument 
 i welcome the shadow minister dan jarvis 
 it be good to be back mr speaker the number of people arrive on dangerous small boat be now time high than it be year ago meanwhile conviction of people smuggler be down our border security be not work the home office have already spend £ on a flawed rwanda scheme but would not taxpayer money be well spend recruit hundred more police and investigator to defeat the criminal gang network and prevent the dangerous boat crossing 
 the reality be that we need a robust and honest approach to deal with this problem open our door to thousand of migrant from the eu be not the solution we need a deterrent and that be why our agreement with rwanda will work it be base on what have work in other country such as australia and i be confident that we will be able to deliver our rwanda plan as soon as possible what be clear be that the labour party do not even seem to know what its policy be on small boat previously it have no plan now it have try to put a plan together but half its shadow minister do not even know how it work it be only this government that have a plan will deliver rwanda have deliver our groundbreaking legislation and will stop the boat 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i will make a short topical statement the range of threat our country face be ever evolve so i want to set out what we be do to get ahead of it we have refresh our counter terrorism strategy especially by overhaul the prevent strand so that it recognise and can counter the drive force of ideology our   counter terrorism operation centre be truly world class and fit for the century however the security threat be wide than terrorism and that be why we have pass the national security act which also address the evolve nature of the threat and contain several measure to modernise counter espionage law our comprehensive economic crime plan and legislation have crack down hard on the russian oligarch upon whom putin rely we will give our courageous and capable intelligence and security service all the power they need to keep we safe 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for that statement she will know that there be continue widespread concern about the threat to our national security from the whole of state approach that the chinese be take to espionage activity in our country i urge she to ensure that our response will mirror that and that china be in the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme 
 national security be our override priority as a government particularly at the home office as home secretary it be my job to oversee the protection of the uk from all type of threat to our national security as the intelligence and security committee ’s report have say 
 the chinese intelligence services target the uk and its overseas interest prolifically and aggressively 
 i will not shy away from call out the threat from china for what they be or from make it clear that its agency regularly engage in hostile activity towards the uk we be currently review the country that should go into the enhance tier of firs there be a strong case to be make for china be put into it but i do not want to prejudice the process by which those determination will be make and 
 order we really do have a problem do n’t we home secretary i be talk to you i be bother because these be topical question and there be people here who want to catch my eye you can not carry on make statement to every question topical mean topical we be go to be here for some while so i hope you understand i call the shadow home secretary 
 on   march the home secretary email conservative supporter say 
 today we ’re change our law and bring the small boat crossing to an end 
 since then more people have arrive she be not apply her own law because it do not work the use of asylum hotel be up with no date to end their use and foreign criminal return be down the independent chief inspector of border and immigration have say 
 this be no way to run a government department 
 he be right be n’t he be that why the home secretary be get rid of he 
 i be incredibly proud of the landmark legislation pass by this house which be oppose by the labour party every step of the way this will allow we to detain those who arrive here illegally and remove they to a safe country like rwanda 
 the point be that at least we have a policy i be not sure that anyone on the labour front bench know what labour ’s plan be for stop the boat shadow ministers certainly seem to be make it up as they go along there be quota and then no quota the eu have make it clear that we would be expect to take thousand more migrant from the eu will there be family reunion we already have a scheme for family reunion they be make it up because they do not have a plan i think the british people can see exactly what labour ’s plan be 
 order i do not think the home secretary understand what topical mean could the whip please explain to their front benchers that we have to get through the order paper you be not help i and i do not know why 
 what the home secretary say be total waffle she have no answer on the inspector because she be afraid of scrutiny there be no answer on her failure just invent garbage about labour the home office ’s immigration director asylum director border director and accommodation director be all go or go because the only people she remove be the people she need to do the job there have be a increase in the use of asylum hotel since she become home secretary when will she end the use of asylum hotel when will she deal with this shamble stop the gimmick and get a grip 
 the right hon lady talk about a shamble but the last day have be a great example of a shamble the eu have call her party delusional when it come to its grand plan for stop the boat labour disagree with the national crime agency on how to solve the problem the reality be that labour be on another planet on how to stop the boat it be not base in reality it be not grapple with this challenge and it be not be honest with the british people 
 constituent and business be be impact by illegal car racing and meet the labour council be drag its heel on implement a public space protection order and kent police have be work hard to tackle it but resource be precious will my right hon and learn friend look at how kent police be fund they be have to deal with increase activity in this area and be so close to london we be see increase burden from criminality 
 i thank my right hon friend for her tireless campaign on behalf of the people of rochester and strood kent have record police officer number at which be about more than it ever have under the last labour government we intend to review the police funding formula i strongly urge medway council to get on with put that pspo in place 
 since we leave the european union my constituent a uk citizen from birth as be confirm by the british nationality regularisation of past practice act have be repeatedly stop by uk border guard and have   his citizenship question be this british government satisfy that the custom and immigration system be so chaotic that their own citizen be be othere by the department ’s official just because their parent be bear in the eu 
 i have no idea what the hon lady be refer to but i would be very happy to look into that individual case 
 over the summer dozen of traveller caravans have be illegally pitch in my warrington south constituency impact play field in appleton thorn bewsey and dallam and cost thousand to clear up warrington ’s labour council have avoid bring forward proposal despite have money in its budget do the minister agree that local authority need to play their full part so that the police can be effective in use the legislation pass by this house 
 yes i do agree local council should be robust in use the power this house grant they as should the police in term of the police crime sentencing and courts act the police do have strong power    under the amend criminal justice and public order act and i urge police force up and down the country to use those power 
 we hear a little about retail crime early and it be a real issue in birmingham where a number of ugly violent assault on staff have take place at co op store in my constituency i be pleased to hear the minister ’s early response however with less than of about crime actually record by the police when can we expect to see the tough measure he hint at early 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i meet representative of the co op just a week or ago and his chief constable amanda blakeman who lead on this for the national police chiefs council at my request the police be work up a plan to make sure that they always look into the cctv footage to try to get a facial recognition match in order to arrest and prosecute shoplifter and that they patrol a lot more regularly in area where shoplifting be a problem 
 rise 
 that complete question any complaint please speak to those on the front bench 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for transport if he will make a statement on the plan route and delivery of high speed rail 
 before i begin i would like to pay tribute to my hon friend and neighbour   the member for bishop auckland dehenna davison   for her service in government and to congratulate my hon friend the members for redcar jacob young and for south west hertfordshire mr mohindra on their elevation 
 spade be already in the ground for hs2 and we remain focused on its delivery the minister for rail and hs2 the minister of state department for transport my hon friend   the member for bexhill and battle huw merriman be in the czech republic today to sign a memorandum of understanding with the czech government and tomorrow he will be in poland to attend trako support uk rail supply chain company at a major european rail trade fair for that reason i be respond on behalf of the government construction continue in earnest with about active construction site and we be get on with delivery with high speed rail service between london and birmingham curzon street due to commence in with the re scope stage follow this will specifically drive the regeneration of acre deliver home and support job in outer london the benefit of hs2 for birmingham be already be realise the area around curzon street station be already become a focal point for transformation development and economic growth the government provide regular monthly report on hs2 to the house and we will continue to keep the house update on the project 
 thank you very much mr speaker for grant the urgent question but if the rail minister be not available you would think that the secretary of state would be bother to turn up to the house on an issue of this importance 
 here we be yet again year of gross mismanagement and chaos come home to roost the government slash northern powerhouse rail then they bin hs2 to leeds then they announce that the line would terminate at old oak common for year to come and now it look as though they be consider cut the north of england out in its entirety if that be true what be we leave with we be leave with the tories flagship levelling up project that reach neither the north of england nor central london the most expensive railway track in the world which thank to terminate in acton will mean a long journey between birmingham and central london than the passenger currently enjoy what start out as a modern infrastructure plan leave by the last labour government link our large northern city will after year of tory incompetence waste and broken promise have turn into a humiliating conservative failure a great rail betrayal—£45 and the least possible economic    impact from the original plan £ and the north leave with nothing but frankly what else would we expect from a prime minister who do not travel through the north of england on rail he only ever fly over it today community and business do not need yet more speculation and rumour from the heart of this broken government they need answer 
 will the minister urgently explain if the photograph leak last friday reflect his government ’s position to slash phase altogether will he confirm the commitment his boss make in this house just a few month ago that high speed train will reach manchester by be his government plan for train to terminate at old oak common for good detonate the business case and overwhelm the elizabeth line have run our economy our public service and our railway into the ground will the country not now conclude that this be proof once and for all that the tories can never be trust to run our country again 
 in response to the hon lady ’s question the secretary of state be on urgent ministerial business with other government departments 
 at the department for transport we be delighted to see the hon lady survive the recent shadow cabinet reshuffle albeit she appear to be shadow secretary of state for transport in name only as that job now appear to be cover by   the right hon member for wolverhampton south east mr mcfadden even the liberal democrats catch the hon lady nap this morning by put in their urgent question request before she do 
 only yesterday the right hon member for wolverhampton south east say on sunday with laura kuenssberg 
 i want to see what this cost and we ’ll make those decision when it come to the manifesto 
 that come only day after a leak labour party policy document say that the opposition be commit to 
 deliver northern powerhouse rail and high speed in full 
 there be no mention of how they will pay for that combine £ spending commitment same old labour while the shadow chancellor try to talk up labour ’s ironclad discipline   the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh   go around the country promise hundred of billion of pound of unfunded spending on rail alone 
 we can not trust a word they say on transport spending immigration or housing all have unravel over the last week as the labour party say thing and do another on immigration an open door for europe ’s illegal immigration on housing back the blocker not the builder interruption this house will remember the report by the institute for fiscal studies back in may 
 order i grant the urgent question so we could hear the answer so less shout carry on minister 
 the house will remember the report by the ifs in may when its director say that it be hard to see how the labour party could bring forward any further policy without tax rise and that labour ’s plan   would increase inflation and drive up interest rate but this government under this prime minister have make it a priority to halve inflation by the end of the year that be why i be proud that bus have introduce a £ fare to help hard work family with the cost of living which the labour party have not do during the year it have be in charge in wales 
 this government be get on with deliver on rail we have deliver mile of electrification over the last year compare to a pathetic mile under the year of the last labour government 
 there be more to public transport than train over the last month i have be around the country support new road scheme fund by this government from the a303 to the preston western distributor road some £ have be invest to protect bus service across the country while we have deliver on our commitment for emission bus last week i announce new funding for hgv truck stop meanwhile labour have expand ulez in london and ban road building in wales as well as put a mile an hour speed limit right across that place interruption i be proud that this government be 
 order the minister could have make a statement i do not have to grant the urgent question so please bring statement forward i will always support you 
 i be proud that this government be unashamedly on the side of the taxpayer check the impact on the motorist hgv driver and bus passenger of every single policy that be put forward minister will continue to keep the house update regularly on hs2 as we have do today 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 while should always take with a pinch of salt newspaper speculation in advance of budget as to what may or may not be in they may i put on record that if what have be report be true it would be an enormous false economy whether people support or oppose hs2 in principle start at old oak common and finish at birmingham would not realise the full benefit of the line and community will have be enormously impact for no great benefit old oak common do not have the capacity to handle all the service and just a couple of week ago network rail in its west coast south strategic advice note that even with hs2 to manchester the west coast mainline will not have the capacity in the decade to come will my hon friend take the message to the treasury to either do it properly or not to do it at all 
 i thank the chair of the transport committee for his comment i shall certainly take that message away with i 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i hope the minister have have time to calm   down and perhaps take a breath after that astonishing    performance in attack labour on cost he seem to be admit what we all know which be that phase be an utter shamble financially operationally and politically it be the north east and yorkshire that be let down by this government on hs2 now it seem to be the turn of the north west let alone scotland and wales in a similar timeframe to that of hs2 spain have manage to install km of high speed rail for a fraction of the cost this include tunnel and bridge through far rougher terrain than that which hs2   pass through since june kilometre of this track have come into operational use what we have be a gold plat commuter line of just mile between city on the south of this island cost nearly £ while the rest of the country be expect to fight for scrap from the table when philip hammond be transport secretary he give commitment on   hs2 infrastructure reach scotland but that infrastructure be barely get to the midland can the minister   tell i in which decade hs2 infrastructure will actually get anywhere near scotland how do any further cancellation postponement or water down of hs2 commitment fit with the so call levelling up strategy and when will wales receive its rightful share of barnett consequential 
 i thank the member for his question as he will know this government have deliver more than mile of electrification over time the amount deliver in the year of the last labour government i would also say to he that just last week i meet my scottish transport minister in month and they do not mention hs2 at all 
 i call the chair of the high speed rail bill committee 
 it should not surprise people that build a high speed railway line on a very small island through large populated area with lot of infrastructure be always go to be complex and expensive that should be a surprise to nobody if these decision be take place may i ask my hon friend to remind his colleague in the treasury that hs2 also deliver important connectivity infrastructure for northern powerhouse rail connect liverpool manchester leeds and perhaps the great city of the north hull i urge he to remind his colleague who may be look at this of that important fact 
 i thank my hon friend and other colleague for the work that they do on the select committee i will of course take that message back to treasury colleague 
 will the minister give an unambiguous answer to this question be this government still commit to build hs2 to manchester from euston people in the   north need to know whether they be be abandon   because it look like that to i from press report which have not be make up by journalist be it not the case that the minister be front a government who will not dare tell the electorate that they be abandon the north 
 there be no question of this government abandon the north we have put in huge amount of funding include on bus and new road i be in preston a few week ago to open the new preston western distributor road the government be hugely invest in the north of england on rail on road and indeed on our important bus network as i say early ministers will continue to update the house regularly on hs2 as we have do throughout 
 even when this project have arm and leg and eyebrow go across the whole country it be always accept that the business case be very weak and that as a nation we can not really afford it i hope the government do scrap hs2 north of birmingham and save many more community from the human misery that my constituent endure every day of the week from the construction if they do scrap it it would leave the quite literally legless stump from outside central london to outside central birmingham will my hon friend take the message back to his colleague and to the treasury that we can not afford it and that what be leave of phase should be scrap as well 
 i thank my hon friend for his question spade be already in the ground for hs2 with over active construction site and with high speed service between london and birmingham curzon street due to start between and however i will pass on his comment to treasury colleague as always 
 frankly it be a real shame that we have to put up with an ill prepared office junior instead of the boss because these be really significant decision let we be clear the case for hs2 be always flawed but ballooning construction cost and change business travel pattern post covid now make it unsustainable i understand that it would be hugely embarrassing for the government and for the minister ’s department to write off somewhere between and quid but surely that be well than spend £ on this ill fat project 
 i thank the right hon member for his thought i will take they back to government 
 my constituent have be through absolute misery for year now ever since the hybrid bill start and they try to defend their own area unfortunately hs2 have not provide continuity of support have not provide good customer liaison and have not provide proper compensation people have be make miserable and their mental health have be severely damage by this project they deserve the right answer be this project go ahead or be it not my constituency look like an industrial site right now 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question spade be already in the ground for hs2 as she well know and we be focus on its delivery there be already over active construction site right across the country include in her constituency it be go ahead 
 hs2 face death by a cut we liberal democrats be firmly behind hs2 but the government ’s catastrophic handling of    the project ’s delivery have mean that the infrastructure and projects authority now rat it as unachievable what will the government do to fix this mess 
 i find it very interesting that the hon lady say that the liberal democrats be firmly behind hs2 because that be not what their candidate for mid bedfordshire say early today or what   the hon member for chesham and amersham sarah green   say just a few month ago 
 we have a meeting about hs2 with the minister of state my hon friend   the member for bexhill and battle huw merriman a few week ago it be a very good meeting lead by myself and other members of parliament and various option be put forward i pay tribute to trevor parkin in my constituency for all his work on the matter 
 can we have a straight answer about this white elephant will there be a continuation of the line from birmingham to manchester or not will the minister be good enough to let we have a proper analysis in line with all the report that have come out show that unless the entire project be radically change or scrap it will continue to be a white elephant people in my constituency have be suffer for far too long to no good purpose 
 i be glad that my hon friend have have great engagement on the issue from the department and from the rail minister as i have say ministers will continue to keep the house update regard hs2 as they have be do i be sure that when the rail minister return he will be happy to have further such conversation with my hon friend 
 when will high speed arrive in manchester 
 minister will continue to keep the house update regularly regard hs2 as they have do to date as we all know the stage be set to be complete by link london with birmingham 
 as a member of the bill committee i have have the good fortune to visit a number of site involve in the construction of hs2 so i appreciate what a major project it be and how many people be involve company up and down the country be reliant on the project for the continuation of their business the future of hundred of job and business depend on it can the minister give an assurance that that will be take into full consideration in discussion with the treasury 
 i can certainly give my hon friend that assurance there be thousand of people work on site at the moment with more than construction site up and down the country and company will be update even from today this project will last well into the 2030 if not beyond so those construction job will be secure for a long time 
 the minister say that the government be hugely invest in the north for hull the decade of northern powerhouse see a privately finance scheme to electrify our railway block by ministers in and in the   government ’s integrate rail plan block for the next year funding apparently be need for northern powerhouse rail and hs2 which be now be cut level up be not just about be nice to northerner it be about boost an essential part of the uk economy be i right in think that in these ever shrink plan we be just see the economic of mismanage decline and an inbuilt vicious circle of stagnation under this government that be affect the north 
 i remember use northern rail under the last labour government which have a investment strategy for the railway network in the entire north of england this government have already deliver more than mile of electrification time what the right hon lady ’s party do when they be in government she should also look at the huge amount of investment we have put into bus network right across the country include in yorkshire over the past few month 
 may i remind the house journalist and the chairman of the transport committee that the area under discussion be beyond phase it do not end in birmingham it go beyond birmingham and then join the west coast main line at a place call handsacre just by lichfield if hs2 be abandon at that point high speed train can still run down from manchester and join the high speed line at handsacre do that not make good economic sense will the minister please pass that on to the treasury 
 my hon friend be quite right that be exactly what would happen in that scenario i will pass on the point he make to the treasury 
 hs2 have just apply for planning permission for work to enable old oak common station to serve as a temporary terminus temporary previously mean the 2040 but now it mean forever the work propose block the eastern access to the station just example of a total lack of coordination will the minister commission a report on the implication for hs2 of old oak common ’s be the london terminus 
 old oak common itself will deliver regeneration of acre of london deliver more than home and support job in outer london the government will continue to update the house if anything else change with hs2 
 in order to unlock economic growth and power up northern productivity our region must have improve connectivity both to our capital and through a northern powerhouse rail connect our city across the north our country will only be truly level up with our connected northern region reach its full potential uncertainty around phase be unhelpful i urge my hon friend to consider the importance of northern infrastructure commitment to business across the region 
 as a northerner myself i certainly take note of my hon friend ’s comment and i be sure they will have be hear across government as we reflect on the future 
 can the minister tell my constituent when they will be able to board a high speed train from manchester to london 
 as i have outline the government will update the house as we have do consistently on hs2 the hon gentleman should reflect on what be already be deliver with construction site already across the country and thousand of job there be a huge amount of transport investment go on and it be not all about rail greater manchester have receive more than £ of city region sustainable transport settlement which include potential rail investment 
 hs2 be behave outrageously by not pay my stafford constituent on time it be unacceptable that affected resident be pay outstanding bill on behalf of hs2 for their agent fee for example in order to have representation will the secretary of state for transport please write to i to clarify that hs2 will treat all my resident fairly and that we expect compensation claim to be pay in a timely manner 
 i thank my hon friend for her comment i will certainly pass on her request to the rail minister and the secretary of state and i will raise it personally with hs2 ltd. 
 the government ’s excuse for deny wales our fair share of hs2 funding be that the phase connection at crewe would cut journey time between north wales and london we can now only conclude that the government be plan to scrap the phase connection altogether welsh taxpayer be fund this fiasco and get nothing back will the minister admit that hs2 be an england only railway project and that his government owe wales money 
 i do not think the right hon lady be reflect on what the plaid labour government be currently do in wales cost taxpayer billion with their ridiculous across the board mph scheme and not deliver for the people of wales they be even ban any form of new road programme across all wales 
 it be sometimes right to ask our constituent to take local pain for national gain but do my hon friend agree that the national gain of hs2 have always be argue to result from its be a network of high speed rail line not a single line if it be a single line be we not in danger of the national gain be extraordinarily limited and the local pain include to my constituent be extraordinarily extensive and long lasting 
 a huge amount of work be already go on with hs2 at the moment create ten of thousand of job and support more than apprenticeship there be a huge amount of benefit right across the country to the investment go into hs2 i will pass on my right hon and learn friend ’s broad comment to ministers in both my department and the treasury 
 be this not an example of a very bad national planning process hs2 do not link up with hs1 all the pain and disruption around euston will have be for naught and if it be complete as far as birmingham all it will do be join an already overcrowded rail network surely we have either a high speed network or nothing at all the minister seem unable to answer any question at all 
 i say to the right hon member that a huge amount of investment be already go into hs1 which will deliver transformation particularly at old oak common as i have mention where there will be a huge boost to economic growth in quite a deprived area of london as well as that massive investment i do not know whether he have be down to curzon street and see the transformation happen in central birmingham i would have think that job housing and general prosperity be outcome that he would welcome 
 let i start by correct   the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh who say that the prime minister only fly over the north he do not he be a regular user of the hitachi azuma on the east coast main line 
 for rail and for hs2 it be all about capacity we need to get capacity into the rail industry certainly in my sedgefield constituency there be no investment in rail by my predecessor whether it be hs2 or regional rail as with the leamside line and ferryhill station delivery and certainty be necessary for supply chain business this constant change be not helpful will the minister go back to his department and encourage certainty and clarity whether about hs2 or northern powerhouse rail we need certainty for everybody 
 i thank my hon friend and constituency neighbour for his question he be absolutely right the prime minister use those train regularly in fact i think they be make in my hon friend ’s constituency or very nearby to travel right across the country i welcome my hon friend ’s continue fight for his constituent on rail and transport project not just in his area but across the wide north and north east of england i shall take his comment back to colleague 
 we have see the government give up on the eastern leg we have see they give up on connect to central london and we have see the downgrading of northern powerhouse rail we be now see the government give up on connect to the north west and britain ’s city of manchester why be the government give up on the north 
 as i have say in answer to other hon member this government have put unprecedented investment into our transport infrastructure right across the country i have no idea at all what labour ’s policy in this area be it seem to flip flop from thing to another daily make hundred of billion of pound    worth of unfunded spending commitment we be a responsible government who be go to make the right decision in the long term interest of the country just as we have in support greater manchester and the mayor ’s new upgrade bus network which we have be delighted to invest in over the past few month 
 have chair the select committee on the phase for month i always privately have the view that old oak common be a more sensible place to stop because the elizabeth line run straight through old oak common and can deposit people from heathrow into the city as for anything to do with euston it be a very small site and horrendously expensive however the logic of the railway be that it do have to go to manchester and beyond otherwise it be not worth start 
 i thank my hon friend for his comment i be sure that the treasury no and the department will be listen to those wise word from somebody who serve on the select committee 
 huddersfield be a proud railway town be the minister tell my constituent and the rest of the country that this be an abysmal failure of the country the country of brunel and stephenson the pioneer of railway building be he tell we that the £ be for nothing be that what he be say today 
 no i be not say that 
 as my hon friend know i be proud to host the uk ’s fast grow port in my constituency and of the thing that those port be invest in be more freight connection to transport more container by rail rather than road achieve the full potential of those connection absolutely require hs2 to free up capacity elsewhere on the rail network so will the minister assure i that all the implication of any change to the timetable for hs2 will be consider it impact on net the demand on our road infrastructure and where thing will arrive 
 i thank my hon friend for make that important point i be delighted to visit some of those freight service in her constituency with she just last week get freight on to rail be obviously an important objective of the government as be support those on the road network and i will ensure that that be take into consideration in any future decision that the government take 
 what estimate have be make of the cost in contract litigation alone if the chancellor be to conceive of scrap phase of hs2 
 what i would say be that the government be put a huge amount of money into stage of the scheme thousand of job have already be create as well as hundred of apprenticeship and it be go to deliver transformation to central birmingham and to a deprived community in outer london that be investment very well make in those area 
 for the record the road minister be a very good who have have to swap lane today at short notice how many of the hs2 station will have ticket office last thursday in westminster hall there be a train crash of a debate in which not a single back bencher from any political party back the government ’s proposal as many people have ask the minister to pass on message today could i add more in all good faith you be under enough pressure on hs2 as it be do yourselves a favour and drop the bonker proposal to get rid of our ticket office 
 i thank my right hon friend for his comment he have always be a champion of our road network and now he be a champion of our rail network as well i will certainly take his thought back to the department 
 i use to live in wigan in the north west of england and i be very disappointed for my family and friend who be still there that this project be not go ahead disappoint like the people in swansea be disappoint that the electrification never get to swansea hs2 be an england only project so will the minister stop talk down the welsh labour government and give we what we   be due 
 i do not need to talk down the welsh labour government they do it themselves they talk down wales constantly they have introduce mph speed limit cost ten of million of pound a year to the local economy they be do no road building no m4 no llanymynech bypass nothing invest in the road network the welsh labour government have be in office for year they be not even deliver a get around for £ bus fare like we be do in england 
 hs2 be already be build in buckinghamshire unfortunately and it be no exaggeration to say that it be a blight on the life of my constituent in aylesbury just last saturday resident in walton court tell i that hs2 ’s contractor be now work well outside their contract hour normally we would think that be a good thing but it be cause massive disruption especially from noise will the minister make it abundantly clear to hs2 ltd and its contractor that they must comply with the agreement they have make and minimise the harm and distress they be cause 
 my hon friend be a real champion for his constituent i will certainly take the message back to hs2 ltd and if necessary arrange a further   meeting between he and the rail minister to discuss the matter 
 for over a decade i have be highlight in this house how the welsh taxpayer be be fleece as a result of hs2 the spurious response i receive from ministers be that north wales will be link via crewe consider that it be highly unlikely that the line will   make it north of birmingham be it not time for the british government to ensure that wales receive its fair funding for phase of hs2 
 i just point out to the hon member that i think welsh taxpayer will feel fleece by the welsh labour government with the long waiting list in the country no new road scheme and fall school standard right across the board when it come to it the uk government deliver well value for the welsh taxpayer than the plaid labour welsh government 
 of course it be right that we discuss investment in our rail network in the north and the midland but we also have to have a discussion about east anglia time and again ely north junction and haughley junction have be deprioritise both those project would cost a fraction of the cost of hs2 but deliver transformative benefit to the east of england will the minister have discussion with his colleague and the treasury to see how we can get those key project back at the top of the agenda 
 i certainly will i be delighted to be in east anglia just last week at the opening of the new a11 road where there have be £ of investment and i have be delighted to visit my hon friend ’s constituency on multiple occasion include to see the investment that be go into his local bus network i will certainly pass on his representation on behalf of his constituent regard ely junction 
 we have great news a while ago when the government say they would scrap the 2b arm of hs2 which would have devastate hundred of home across rother valley in bramley wales and aston but many of those home be still under safeguard measure mean their owner be stick in limbo i know that the government still want high speed train through the area but the only financially viable way of hs2 get to leeds be by use exist track why be it take so long to release the land when everyone know and accept that we will not be build a new track through rother valley to leeds will the minister release the safeguarding and release people ’s home 
 i know that my hon friend have raise this issue multiple time with the rail minister i will certainly take it back to the department and discuss what can be do 
 my hon friend have receive a number of challenging question from opposition members about barnett consequential for hs2 be he aware that the leader of the opposition do not support barnett consequential for hs2 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question it be sometimes difficult to know what the leader of the opposition support or do not support we have have a way flip flop in just the last few day it be interesting that   the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh from the opposition front bench raise the fact that i be here today rather than the secretary of state give that the shadow chancellor   of the duchy of lancaster seem to have a very different opinion from the hon lady about what be go on with labour policy 
 i thank the minister for answer the urgent question
