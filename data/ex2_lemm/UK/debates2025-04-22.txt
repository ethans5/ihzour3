with permission i will now make a statement to update the house on the supreme court judgment   in the case of for women scotland ltd v. the scottish ministers 
 this ruling bring welcome clarity and confidence for woman and service provider single sex space must be protect and this be personal to i before i be elect to this place i run a woman ’s refuge in the north east for woman and child flee domestic violence i know how important to survivor it be and always be to have single sex space base on biology place of safety after trauma time in a sanctuary   that allow they therapeutic support heal from unimaginable male violence and fear i remember how hard countless campaigner have to fight over many decade to get any single sex provision at all in order to create woman ’s refuge and rape crisis centre later i remember how hard it be to convince commissioner that young homeless woman try to heal from terrifying act of cruelty should not be leave in mixed sex accommodation i will continue to fight for that provision to ensure that woman ’s safety woman ’s privacy and woman ’s dignity be always protect 
 this government will continue as before work to protect single sex space base on biological sex now with the add clarity of this ruling and we will continue our wide work with commitment and compassion to protect all those who need it right across society this be a government who will support the right of woman and tran people now and always this be a government who will support the right of all people with protect characteristic now and always this be a government who will support the right of our most vulnerable now and always on that there be no change to announce dignity and respect for all now and always 
 but this be a judgment long in the making it begin in when scottish ministers issue guidance on the definition of a woman in the eye of the gender representation on public boards scotland act that guidance state that a woman in that act bear the same meaning as a woman in the equality act and include tran woman with a gender recognition certificate for women scotland challenge that guidance say that sex in the equality act mean biological sex so that a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate be a man for the purpose of the act the case be appeal to the supreme court and last week the court rule that sex in the equality act mean biological sex this mean that a person will be consider as their biological sex for the purpose of the equality act regardless of whether or not they have a gender recognition certificate 
 i know that the woman who bring this challenge have not always be treat with the respect they deserve this government believe in freedom of speech and in the fundamental right to protest but in no way do that extend to criminal damage there can be no excuse for defaced statue of feminist icon no excuse for threat and no excuse for harassment such act seek to drag down the debate away from common sense    and the sensible view hold by the majority of the british public that woman need single sex space that those space should be protect and that we can protect those space while treat trans people with respect as well as such the certainty that this judgment bring be welcome now it be time to move forward 
 there be now a need to ensure that this ruling be clear across a range of setting from healthcare and prison to sport and single sex support group the equality and human rights commission as britain ’s equality regulator be work quickly to issue an update statutory code of practice to reflect this judgment   and i look forward to review that code of practice in   due course 
 alongside these update our work to protect single sex space across society continue in earnest because for far too long under the conservative government single sex space be anything but and nowhere be that clear than in our hospital year after year the conservatives pledge to close mixed sex ward and yet year after year their use not only persist but grow massively year after year often in their most vulnerable moment woman be deny the privacy and dignity they deserve time after time conservative ministers include the now leader of the opposition come to this house and tour television studio tell the public that they be protect single sex space in our hospital the truth be very different because as last year ’s datum tell we the use of mixed sex ward rise by more than in year under the last tory government there be no well example of rhetoric divorce from reality and of a party playing politic with the safety of woman and we will never let they forget it by contrast this government will protect woman ’s ward and nhs england will soon publish guidance on how trans patient should be accommodate in clinical setting we will end the practice of mixed sex ward once and for all 
 it be not just in our nhs that we will act on behalf of woman in prison we will continue to protect woman ’s safety with single sex accommodation in woman ’s sport i have always back integrity and fairness biology matter for competitive sport and sporting body have issue rule to reflect that in our prison in our hospital in sport and in a whole host of other space what be true before the ruling remain true after the ruling this government protect safe space for woman under the equality act 
 for too many year we have see the heat dial up in this debate by the conservatives there be no real action to protect woman ’s space while under their watch the use of mixed sex ward increase an epidemic of violence against woman and girl spread across the country and woman ’s health be neglect this labour government will deliver for woman through our plan for change drive down waiting list month after month tackle misogyny throughout society and once and for all deliver justice for survivor of violence against woman and girl 
 i know that many trans people will be worry in the wake of the supreme court ruling so i want to provide reassurance here and now that trans people will continue to be protect we will deliver a full trans inclusive ban on conversion practice we will work to equalise all exist strand of hate crime and we will review adult gender identity service so that all tran people get the high quality care they deserve the law to protect trans people from discrimination and harassment will remain   in place and trans people will still be protect on the basis of gender reassignment a protect characteristic write into labour ’s equality act 
 this government will offer trans people the dignity that too often they be deny by the conservatives too often trans people be a convenient punchbag and the butt of joke make in this place by the conservatives culminate rather shamefully in the previous prime minister stand at this dispatch box try to score cheap laugh from his back benchers at the expense of vulnerable people by contrast this government be clear that trans people deserve safety opportunity and respect 
 this verdict be about clarity and coherence in the eye of the law but the supreme court judge deliver along with that verdict a vital reminder this be not about the triumph of group at the expense of another it be not about winner or loser and it be not about we or they that be the message i want to reinforce today in this house everyone in our society deserve dignity and respect those value be not and never will be a sum battle dignity and respect for all those be the value that lift we up and set we free those be the value that define and distinguish any modern and compassionate society those be the value that this government will do everything to promote and protect now and always i commend this statement to the house 
 before we begin i be sure the whole house will wish to join i in remember the life and service of his holiness pope francis he be both a humble man and a charismatic leader who be unafraid to confront some of the great challenge face the world he will be deeply miss by those of all faith around the world and in particular our thought be with member of the roman catholic community throughout the united kingdom as they mourn his passing 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to support female offender 
 what step her department be take to support female offender 
 this government ’s plan to support woman be clear and ambitious the aim be to reduce the number of woman go to prison and our woman ’s justice board will lead on this follow susannah hancock ’s review which be publish in march this government have act to prevent girl from be hold in young offender institution 
 i have be very concerned to hear hand report of female prisoner be handcuff during childbirth sometimes to male officer do the minister agree that there should be an independent investigation into the use of birth cuff in woman ’s prison across the country that consult all woman who have be or may be affect 
 my hon friend refer to a shocking situation our policy be clear that pregnant woman should not be restrain during hospital appointment except in the most exceptional circumstance there be an ongoing deep dive review take place into matter at hmp bronzefield commission by the prison minister in the other place 
 i thank the minister for his response in my constituency hope street be do incredible work to offer residential alternative to custody for woman we know that this model reduce the number of woman be send to prison prevent separation from their child who be likely to be take into care which we all know have a hugely detrimental impact can the minister share any plan to replicate and scale up the hope street model 
 i agree with my hon friend that for some woman support accommodation be very valuable exist provision include his majesty ’s prison and probation service lead community accommodation service and sector residential woman ’s centre include hope street which she rightly praise for its excellent work the women ’s justice board be explore option to increase use of robust community alternative to custody include residential option where appropriate 
 project she in somerset run by the nelson trust allow some woman who have be arrest for the time for low level crime an alternative to court work with offender on rehabilitation and reduce the impact on the community and the criminal justice system what support be the department provide for such scheme 
 these scheme be very important the hon member highlight a very good and the department continue to support those sort of scheme 
 do the minister agree that counselling service be crucial in support female offender as they address trauma addiction and mental health challenge furthermore will she join i in commend the charity uhub in my constituency for its exceptional counselling service for young woman 
 the hon member mention an excellent counselling service in his constituency which i praise these counselling service be crucial and a very important part of the system 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 it have be day since the supreme court hand down its landmark judgment in the case bring by for women scotland a judgment that confirm basic biological reality and protect woman and girl it be a conservative government who bring in the policy to stop male offender however they identify be hold in the woman ’s estate especially those convict of violence or sexual offence will the lord chancellor and her ministers confirm that the government will implement the supreme court judgment in full and that they will take personal responsibility for ensure that it be in every aspect of our justice system or do they agree with senior ministers in their party who now appear to be actively plot to undermine the supreme court ’s judgment 
 we inherit the current policy on transgender people in the prison service and we have continue the policy that the right hon gentleman describe during our period in office in the light of last week ’s supreme court ruling the department be review all area that could be impact 
 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the sentencing council 
 the sentencing council do important work bring consistency to judicial decision making but it be clear in recent week that it have move beyond that role to take in policy that be not mine and not the government ’s a review of the role and power of the sentencing council be ongoing and i will legislate far if necessary 
 draft guideline from the sentencing council now propose substantially low sentence for immigration offence than level agree by parliament so will the lord chancellor call on the sentencing council to revise those guideline so that they align with the time period agree by parliament 
 the guideline set a starting point for a sentence that be usually the point of the guideline judge can sentence outside the guideline range if they believe that be in the interest of justice the guideline set only a starting point not an end point which remain in the purview of judge sit in their independent capacity in our court we be not seek to overturn the immigration guideline in case there be hon member who be labour under misinformation i should say that it be an important point of fact that foreign national offender and immigration offender who receive sentence of less than month can still be deport and under this government they will be 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 when it enact the coroners and justice act parliament decide that the sentencing council should be chair by a judicial member appoint by the lady chief justice do the lord chancellor agree that member of this house should respect the principle of judicial independence when discuss the leadership of the sentencing council 
 when judge be act as judge they be act in their independent capacity all member of this house should respect judicial independence my hon friend will know that my disagreement with the sentencing council relate to where the line be draw between matter that be correctly within the purview of our independent judiciary and matter that relate to policy that be correctly within the purview of this place 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 today the justice secretary be belatedly introduce a bill to restore fairness in who receive a pre sentence report but it will not correct what the pre sentence report say under brand new guidance that the justice secretary ’s department issue in january pre sentence report must consider the culture of an offender and take into account whether they have suffer intergenerational trauma from important   historical event evidently the labour party do not believe in individual responsibility and agency instead of treat people equally it believe in cultural relativism this time the justice secretary have nobody else to blame but herself will she change that or be there tier justice be that the labour party ’s policy now 
 what a load of nonsense i be the lord chancellor who be rectify the situation with the proper distinction between matter of policy and matter of independent judicial decision through the bill that we will debate on reading later today i have already deal with the issue in relation to the immigration guideline the right hon gentleman have make some comment about that which do not bear resemblance to fact so perhaps he would like to correct the record on the bail guidance and on all other guidance that relate to equality before the law i have say that we be review absolutely everything i will ensure that under this government equality before the law be never a principle that be compromise although it be compromise under the conservative government 
 what step she be take through the criminal justice system to help tackle hyper prolific offending 
 what step she be take through the criminal justice system to help tackle hyper prolific offending 
 this government inherit a situation where around of offender account for over half of all conviction we also inherit rise level of theft and shoplifting in february i announce reform to the probation service that will focus more of its time on offender who pose a high risk of reoffende and i have ask david gauke to review how sentence could be reform to address prolific offending cut the cycle of reoffende and ultimately make our street safe 
 in my constituency there be a particular problem of hyper prolific shoplifting there be no credible deterrent and it be a scourge on our local community and shop owner can the justice secretary rule out any possibility of allow career criminal to avoid prison even for short sentence 
 in the crime and policing bill this government have remove the effective immunity from prosecution for theft relate to value under £ so we be already take clear definitive action to deal with the problem that the hon gentleman see in his constituency i will not pre empt the finding of the sentencing review i be interested in how we ensure that those who he correctly describe as career criminal turn their back on a life of crime because in the end that be the good strategy for cut crime and make our street safe 
 tool theft have a devastating impact on tradespeople and their family across the country that be why i be pleased to support the shadow justice   secretary sidcup police on the tools checkatrade and other in tool mark initiative and raid at boot sale where steal good be normally sell but there be more to do across the criminal justice system to tackle this issue will the government support conservative amendment to the crime and policing bill and ensure that these prolific offender face tough sentence and tradespeople get the justice they finally deserve 
 i hope the hon gentleman will welcome effort on the labour back benches relate to tool trade my hon friend   the member for portsmouth north amanda martin   have introduce a private member ’s bill as i say i will not pre empt the finding of the sentencing review but it be precisely because we take such offending very seriously that i ask the review to consider carefully intervention that will work in ensure that offender turn their back on a life of crime ultimately help we to cut the crime that they cause which create victim in the process i know we all want to ensure that that be the case as far as specific amendment to the crime and policing bill be concern i be sure that the ministers responsible will respond in due course 
 rise 
 follow his engagement i call alistair strathern 
 thank you mr speaker that be very kind in less encouraging news far too many retailer across my town and village include my local morrison be be hit by repeat shoplifting which be all too often drive by prolific offender and criminal gang how be the secretary of state work with the home office to ensure that we be finally take the scourge of shoplifting as seriously as we should 
 as i say we have already remove the effective immunity from prosecution for theft relate to value under £ reverse the previous conservative government ’s policy in this area we will legislate to ensure that assault on a retail worker be a new offence in the crime and policing bill so we be already take measure to help my hon friend and his constituent with the issue they face as i say it be because we take this type of offend particularly seriously that i ask the sentencing review to consider the specific of prolific offender 
 early this month bovis house in hartlepool which host a number of business be rob the people who do that be so well know that within minute of the cctv footage be put on social medium people be message i their name these be hyper prolific offender tiny number of people be responsible for huge amount of crime do the justice secretary agree that the only solution be to lock they up for long 
 the solution we pursue have to be show to work in the end we need solution that will work because these people be often lock up for considerable period of time and when they come back out they still offend again for some of those individual the problem will relate partly to addiction issue it be   important that we trial and use method that help people to cut their addiction and usage in order to stop they commit crime fuel by that addiction as i say that will need a multi layered response i be determined that we will crack down on the scourge of prolific offender that be the only strategy for cut crime and we be determined to pursue it we want to have measure that work which be why i ask the sentencing review to consider they specifically 
 what step her department be take to support young offender in staffordshire 
 this year the department will provide more than £ in funding to the staffordshire youth offend team to supervise child and support they in turn their back on a life of crime 
 at the election we promise to take action to reduce youth offending with a network of young futures hub and a crackdown on antisocial behaviour which cause so much pain to my constituent and to people up and down our country criminal must face the full force of the law and young offender can not be a lost cause will the minister confirm that this government will do whatever we can to divert young people away from a lifetime of crime 
 my hon friend be exactly right we must do whatever we can to move people away from a life of crime and keep the public safe this year despite the fiscal challenge we inherit we be invest more than £ in youth offend team across the country to identify child and divert they away from crime with turnaround funding staffordshire youth offend team deliver skill building activity for child in antisocial behaviour hotspot during a successful week summer programme 
 rise 
 be we really sure that this question be link to young people in staffordshire commit crime 
 it might not be about staffordshire but we also have young people in devon we have a case in my constituency of a young offender who have be arrest multiple time and put under a court order but the presumption be against incarceration because of his age local resident tell i that there be a disaster wait to happen 
 order the hon member be not link her question to the original so we be go to move on 
 what step her department be take to help reduce level of reoffende among young people 
 what step her department be take to help reduce level of reoffende among young people 
 the government be determined to reduce youth reoffende as part of our safe street mission despite the huge fiscal challenge we inherit we have be able to increase our core funding to youth offend team across the country allow they to support child away from crime 
 constituent across my community of loughborough shepshed and the village have be face the scourge of offroad bike often ride by young reoffender that cause havoc for resident it be dangerous for pedestrian and can be fatal for those who be on those bike those young reoffender often have little else to do as there be few education training or employment opportunity so can the minister please set out how this government will end the scourge of offroad bike and reoffende and how they will once again be tough on crime and tough on the cause of crime 
 my hon friend be exactly right in the past antisocial behaviour have be too easily dismiss as low level but as he rightly describe it can cause real distress and misery to our community i be pleased that the new crime and policing bill include measure to enhance police power to seize nuisance offroad bike and other vehicle use in an antisocial manner 
 engineer learning in derby teach welding skill to young people at risk of offend and reoffende a qualified experienced welder can earn more than £ yet we have a national shortage of welder do the minister agree that prevent reoffende and secure the skill our country need be a win win and will he look at how we can get more young life back on track learn trade such as weld 
 my hon friend be exactly right what engineered learning be do be a clear win win teach welding skill and move people away from crime the department will continue fund youth offend team to work with local education and employment provider to help young people get the skill they need to have productive career and positive life 
 aspiration and ambition be driver of social mobility and help to reduce deprivation and crime what discussion have the minister have with the department for education to increase apprenticeship and training so that these opportunity can be extend to all and we can reduce young offending throughout the uk 
 we have regular discussion with the department for education on these matter the hon gentleman be absolutely right the more young people we get into training education and work the less crime we should have on our street 
 i thank the minister very much for that answer quite clearly those who reoffend do so because they go back to where the peer pressure be where the unemployment be and where poverty level be high those be thing that must be address in order to help these young people not to reoffend they be big issue what can be do to ensure those thing in the locality where those young people live do not overtake they with the problem they have 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right that all those issue contribute to circumstance that might create offending but it be really good that we have the turnaround programme in place only of child who complete their turnaround intervention receive conviction in their year of the programme that be an example of the sort of programme we need to be engage in to turn young people away from crime 
 what step she be take to increase access to legal aid in rural area 
 wherever they be in england and wales people should benefit from equal access to legal support and legal aid remote technology and provision of online advice present the opportunity both to democratise legal advice and to deliver it to all who need to access it we be invest an additional £ to support the sustainability of the criminal legal aid sector and we be consult on fee increase total £ for housing and immigration to increase access to civil legal aid all of this will support legal aid across the country include in rural area 
 north norfolk be a legal aid desert my resident have precious little access to family criminal and housing legal assistance despite the good effort of local organisation such as the norfolk community law service we face huge barrier to recruitment and retention in rural area such as the cost of housing poor public transport and fee that despite the uprating be still too low thing need to change will the minister meet i and those work in the legal aid sector in north norfolk to discuss what we can do to support those in need in area such as mine 
 i thank the hon member for raise the issue of legal aid desert and i welcome his suggestion that he write to i about these thing i regularly meet legal aid provider and that be why we be invest an additional £ in legal support which provide that early advice that can make a real difference in area such as his 
 cornwall be a big rural legal aid desert we have many volunteer who would be prepared to help and citizens advice could act as an umbrella organisation will the minister meet i to discuss how we can get some of that funding for access to legal aid in rural area into cornwall 
 my hon friend be right to raise the importance of early legal support and legal aid that be why we be invest in online provision as i have say remote technology can make a real difference in area such as her before i come to this place i volunteer in a free legal advice centre so i know just how much of a difference such institution can make 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of policy apply to bail condition in domestic violence case 
 this government have commit to halve violence against woman and girl in a decade a broad range of bail condition can be impose to protect victim include electronic monitoring for those who meet the remand threshold exclusion zone and non contact order suspect can also be remand in prison 
 i raise this issue follow a meeting with a constituent whose case raise deep concern that be more widely relevant bail condition sometimes weak sometimes poorly enforce do not always protect victim of domestic violence from further harassment by their abuser secondly despite the increase in the time limit to year under the regulation the month limit for prosecution mean that some case time out will the minister meet i and my constituent to discuss what more can be do to ensure that victim of domestic abuse be fully protect from their abuser 
 i thank the hon member for raise this important issue from her constituency we know that more need to be do in this area and that be why this government have start to roll out our domestic abuse protection order to help victim of domestic abuse in select area we be see how that go we be develop policy in this area to protect victim and woman and girl in particular i would be more than happy to meet she to discuss what more we can do 
 have speak to essex police and other professional and have work for a homeless charity myself i know that often the hard part for victim of domestic violence be make the decision to leave what be sometimes the family home what work have the minister do with the ministry of housing communities and local government to address this issue 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue tackle violence against woman and girl be not just a ministry of justice problem to fix but a problem for every government department to fix that be why i have meet with my counterpart across the departments include in mhclg to discuss housing need we will be publish our violence against woman and girl strategy later this year and i look forward to discuss it with he in due course 
 what step her department be take to help reduce level of reoffende by people on probation 
 i take this opportunity to recognise the excellent work that our probation staff do day in day out probation be an indispensable part of the criminal justice system but the service currently face significant pressure that be why we will recruit a further probation officer by march invest £ in new technology to reduce administrative task for officer and focus effort on reduce reoffende 
 may i take this opportunity to wish you a belate pask lowen mr speaker 
 reoffender be among the most socially exclude in society and often experience complex mental health and social issue include drug and alcohol addiction we know that perpetually lock they up do not work and cost a fortune can the minister reassure i that he be work with both the home office and the department of health and social care to ensure that wraparound detox and rehabilitation support be available such as that offer by bosence farm in cornwall 
 yes i can reassure my hon friend we work with the department of health and social care and the home office to get offender into treatment at the early opportunity and have increase the use of drug rehabilitation requirement as well as improve link to ensure that prison leaver stay in treatment on release in the dhsc be provide £ in additional target grant to enable local authority include cornwall to improve service 
 because our prison be run at about capacity not only be exist prisoner more likely to reoffend but sadly as we allow more prisoner to be release early more people on probation will do so apart from the terrible effect on victim the ministry itself estimate that this cost a staggering £ a year in england and wales what be the minister ’s policy to help reduce reoffende 
 we have only just take over a system that be struggle under the weight of year of mismanagement and we be do our very good to get on top of it we have set in train an independent sentencing review and be commit to appoint new probation officer by this time next year 
 what recent discussion she have have with the northern ireland executive on trend in level of prison capacity 
 ministry of justice official regularly meet representative of the department of justice in northern ireland as part of the nations forum to discuss prison capacity this allow good practice to be share and emerge issue to be discuss the   prisons minister in the other place know the northern ireland prison system well and will be go there later this year to compare note 
 the minister have mention good practice the separated regime in northern ireland prison give those who have be commit to prison as a result of paramilitary activity a special kudo and when they be release they emerge with a certain status can the minister see the inherent danger of apply such a policy on a wide scale when deal with people who may have be radicalise while in prison and may when release bring the effect of that into a broad section of society 
 the hon member be right to suggest that we need to learn lesson from wherever they can be learn and he be right to caution against approach that might bring about result that people do not wish to see 
 what step she be take to tackle court backlog 
 this government inherit a record rise in court backlog the last conservative government let down victim of crime business worker and family all through their neglect and under investment this government be grip the crisis to date we have fund a record high allocation of crown court sit day for next year and we be and intend to be at or close to the maximum in every jurisdiction we be fix the last government ’s mess 
 i recently meet representative of the rape and sexual abuse support centre in my constituency they support hundred of survivor every year through counselling advice and carry out vital prevention work in school and the wide community but as they explain to i their work be be undermine by a justice system that be in crisis trial be routinely delay sometimes for up to year owe to a chronic shortage of judge and as a result some victim be consider drop their case not because they do not want justice but because they can not cope with such a traumatic experience that be a gross injustice i be grateful to the minister for her answer but will she expand specifically on how the government will help to prevent re traumatisation in the court backlog process and on how they will continue to fund organisation such as rasasc 
 we recognise the traumatic impact of delay in our crown court on victim of violence against woman and girl and indeed victim of all crime the good thing we can do for those victim be deliver swifter justice we will do that not just by spend extra money which we have do but through reform so we have ask sir brian leveson to propose bold and ambitious measure to deliver the swifter justice for which the hon member have ask 
 i recently meet in my constituency people whose son and daughter in law have be brutally kill in june nearly year on the case have yet to   come to court it have be delay time and a date in october have now be set on each occasion the delay have cause huge anguish to the family will the minister agree to meet i to discuss this matter and can she tell i what step the government be take to ensure that trial be conduct promptly so that justice can be receive by such family 
 i be desperately sorry to hear about the case that my hon friend describe once again the good thing that we can do for those family to ensure that they get swifter justice and get their day in court in a timely fashion be bear down on the crown court backlog that be why we be wait for sir brian leveson to report in the spring and why we will act promptly on his recommendation 
 what step her department be take to ensure child safety during private law proceeding 
 the welfare of the child must be the paramount consideration for family court which should follow the welfare checklist as set out in the children act our new approach to private law proceeding the pathfinder pilot court focus on problem solve put great emphasis on the voice of the child but we be acutely aware that more need to be do 
 the previous government ’s harm panel report state that there be a crisis in family court and that they be too pro parental contact despite there be concern about the child ’s safety as with many thing under the previous government the conservatives do nothing about the report will this government and the minister commit to reverse the parental presumption where there be concern about child abuse 
 as i have state the child ’s welfare must be the court ’s paramount consideration the presumption of parental involvement state that a court should 
 presume unless the contrary be show that involvement of that parent in the life of the child will further the child ’s welfare 
 i take this opportunity to state however that that apply only if the parent do not put the child at risk of harm we will publish our review of the presumption in due course 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the standard determinate sentence early release scheme 
 the last government leave our prison in crisis we come within day of run out of space entirely and the emergency release programme be design to stop that crisis happen number be rise again which be why this government be commit to build prison place by   compare with the that the last conservative government add in year and to reform sentencing so that we never run out of prison place again 
 last month the prisons minister say that the long time that an early release prisoner have be leave to wander the street without an electronic tag be day however just over a week ago it be report that prisoner have not be tag for up to day can the secretary of state please clarify this apparent inconsistency 
 we be transparent with the house about the problem with tag during the tranche of emergency release last year i will ensure that we publish the correct information and i can write to the hon lady with the exact figure but we have be hold serco to account because its performance on its contract have be unacceptable we have levy fine and we have say that all option be on the table for any further action that we might need to take 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 of the die act of the last conservative government be to shake hand with serco on an electronic tagging contract that channel ’s dispatches find be completely inadequate people with serious conviction be leave without tag for day and week victim and survivor be fail include survivor of those release early under the sds40 scheme what will the secretary of state do to hold serco to account for these failure and to clear up the mess that be fundamentally create by the failure of the last government 
 the hon member be right this be of the many difficult inheritance leave for we by the previous conservative government the contract with serco be agree by the previous conservative administration we acknowledge that the performance of serco have be unacceptable we have already be closely monitor day by day its performance and delivery under the contract and we have impose fine for poor performance some of the issue relate to the sds40 emergency release be ultimately deal with after close oversight by official and minister and we continue to monitor the contract very closely as i have say should further fine or other measure be require all option be on the table 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help tackle intimate image abuse 
 we be introduce new offence of take intimate image without consent and instal equipment with intent to commit such offence we be also criminalise create deepfake intimate image without consent i proudly co chair the violence against woman and girl ministerial group which oversee a cross government approach to tackle vawg include online abuse 
 i thank the minister for her answer sexually explicit deepfake be a scourge on our society whether it be young boy in their bedroom make they of their fellow pupil and teacher or those who create explicit image of celebrity to order how will the legislation the government intend to bring forward on this help victim of this disgusting abuse and punish those who perpetrate it 
 i thank my hon friend for that question this government be commit to halve violence against woman and girl over a decade and that include the horrendous degrading and humiliating crime of take intimate image without consent as well as create deepfake image without consent for far too long these crime have go unpunished with perpetrator allow to carry this out at will and to cover their sick behaviour under the rule of banter we will not stand for it we be legislate and we be protect woman and girl 
 if she will have discussion with the hm prison and probation service on the potential merit of review its guideline on bail 
 equality before the law be a cornerstone of our justice system and my position on this be clear later today this house will debate legislation to overturn guideline that the last conservative government welcome and i be not stop there i be review current policy and this guidance be be redrafte as we speak include on the approach to bail information for court 
 after the conviction of man for a string of horrendous child rape offence in keighley i wish i could stand here and say that justice have be fully serve but i can not because of these man dual national abscond during their trial be still evade justice and be know to be abroad do the secretary of state agree that in such serious case where dual or foreign national be charge with the most grotesque and serious sexual crime against child the court should be under a duty to impose strict bail condition include surrender passport and electronic monitoring or even to provide no bail condition to stop they flee the country and evade justice 
 i share the hon member ’s outrage over the crime that be commit in his community and the fact that of those individual have be able to leave the country and therefore evade the full force of the law and serve their sentence here he will know that the decision to remand an individual in custody or on bail be solely a matter for the independent judiciary and court be already require to consider the likelihood to abscond as part of that decision 
 more broadly court have the power to impose a broad range of robust bail condition include the surrender of passport electronically monitor exclusion zone and curfew he know that i can not comment on the specific because that be a matter for the independent    judge who sit on that case and make that decision but those be the rule that apply and i would be happy to discuss that far with he if he wish 
 what step her department be take to reform the prison system 
 we inherit a system in crisis from the previous government with prison over full we take immediate action to prevent the collapse of the prison system by change the automatic release point for standard determinate sentence we be build new prison place and we publish our year capacity strategy in december however we know that we can not build our way out of this crisis which be why we have also launch an independent sentencing review to ensure that we will never run out of place again 
 as ministers will know from previous question about parc prison parent in newport east have very serious concern about the welfare of family member there with worrying report continue to emerge in recent month can the minister give an update on any progress be make on prison safety mental health support and drug interception since parc have be receive targeted support 
 safety in prison be a key priority and we be work hard to make prison as safe as possible my hon friend be right to highlight the concern at parc i have recently visit hmp parc as have the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for pontypridd alex davies jones and the prisons minister in the other place on that visit i see how seriously the director be take these issue and engage closely with family on their very real concern 
 the catastrophic security failure at hmp frankland have expose the danger that terrorist prisoner can pose to prison officer and other inmate across the prison estate will the independent review also examine the culture of gang relate violence and intimidation that have contribute to such incident in our prison 
 there be an ongoing audit of all the review ’s recommendation our thought remain with our brave prison officer who be attack and with the victim of the manchester arena bombing and their family who be understandably concerned by the shocking event in hmp frankland my right hon friend the lord chancellor take immediate action to set a review in place 
 i call the shadow minister 
 personal protective equipment be now wear in all kind of job where people may have to deal with dangerous situation as professor acheson have say it be 
 stagger that frontline police staff work in condition of far great peril be not issue with stab vest capable of stop an attack with a bladed weapon 
 we should all be ensure that our prison officer come home safe to their love one union have call for this measure and i can assure the minister that they have the full support of those on the opposition side of the house will he act not in month or month but now to protect prison officer before it be too late 
 that be part of the review that have be announce my right hon friend the lord chancellor be meet the prison officers association tomorrow these thing need to be do rightly and properly and that be what will happen with this government 
 i thank the minister for his answer but i suggest that this be something we should just get on with it be common sense there be a more fundamental issue perhaps i can invite the minister to provide his assessment of the relative threat provide by different ideological extremist in prison which may be fuel such violence islamist terror suspect make up the vast majority of mi5 ’s caseload do they also make up the majority of radicalise criminal in our prison estate 
 the hon gentleman urge we to get on with it by my reckoning the conservative party have year to get on with it we be get on with it we set up the snap review straightaway interruption it ’ not party political he say well people might judge that for themselves by listen to the sort of question we have have today 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 key agent of reform in our prison be prison officer unlocked graduates be an amazing scheme that support the production of prison officer with new innovation but it have have the rug pull from underneath its foot beyond its current cohort there be mixed account of what have happen from different civil servant and other individual in government will the minister explain exactly what have happen why have the contract not work will he sit down with i and unlocked graduates to see if we can find a way forward 
 i very much praise the work that unlocked graduates have do over many year unfortunately when the contract be let previously unlocked graduates be unhappy to progress with the contract that be the situation obviously these thing be very difficult but i be very happy to meet the hon member to discuss matter far 
 what step she be take to increase the provision of legal aid service 
 on prison the inheritance be dire on crown court backlog the inheritance be dire and on legal aid service once again the inheritance have be   absolutely dire this government be rebuild the legal aid system for those it serve and those who serve in it that be why in december we announce up to £ more a year for criminal legal aid solicitor on top of £ already announce for duty solicitor in police station we be also consult on uplift as i say in housing and immigration legal aid fee worth an additional £ a year the increase in civil legal aid fee since 
 the conservatives leave legal aid in a mess like so many other thing so i welcome the sum the minister be announce but can she assure i that the money will reach ealing we have never even have a citizen advice bureau not in the year i have be the mp and not in the year i have be on the planet to refer constituent to can she assure we that my constituent can get the access to justice they deserve 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s question the legal aid agency keep contract under review to ensure that there be provision right across the country include in ealing as i say early the additional money go into legal support which include advice service such as citizen advice bureaux law centre and other advice provider will reach constituent just like her both remotely and face to face 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 the house will be aware of the attack at hmp frankland on   april the bravery of the officer involve undoubtedly save life and my thought be with they as they recover i think also of the victim of the manchester arena bombing and their family who be understandably outraged since the attack i have suspend access to kitchen in separation centre and close supervision centre an independent review will ascertain how the incident be able to happen what more must be do to protect prison staff and more widely how separation centre be run and the prison service will also conduct a snap review of the use of protective body armour in addition i can today announce that his majesty ’s prison and probation service will trial the use of taser in our prison wherever we can strengthen our defence to well protect our staff and the public we will do so 
 the horrific attack in nottingham on   june   cost barnaby webber grace o’malley kumar and ian coates their life i pay tribute to their family and the survivor many of whom be in the public gallery today the prime minister promise that we would heed their call for a public inquiry and i can today announce that a full statutory inquiry will take place chair by her honour deborah taylor and with the power to compel witness i will place its full term of reference in the libraries of both houses at the early opportunity the inquiry must be thorough in its assessment of the fact and unspare in its recommendation that be the very least that we owe those who have lose so much and fight so hard for this moment i be sure that this house so often divide will be unite on that at least today 
 i associate myself with the lord chancellor ’s comment and extend my sympathy to the family of those who be attack 
 in bordon the release of a sex offender to a property near the hogmoor inclosure frequently use by young people family and child have cause consternation in my constituency what be the lord chancellor do to ensure that people who have be convict of sex offence be properly monitor when release into the community do our national and local agency have the resource and power to ensure that these risk be monitor and the public be keep safe 
 we have robust process in place to ensure that those offender can be monitor effectively at both national and local level and that those monitor mechanism be as robust as possible i will happily look into the case that the hon gentleman raise and ensure that he get a ministerial response 
 the conservatives preside over year of total failure in our justice system   let i be topical to restore justice in this country and keep my constituent safe we can not just do more of the same we need more transparency about the time criminal spend in jail and common sense sentencing must mean exactly that how do the secretary of state think technology can help to make that possible 
 i must caution conservatives members against groan i appreciate that they might not be proud of their record i would not be if that be the record i have leave behind after leave government but groaning show the contempt in which they hold the public who have have to suffer the consequence of a truly dire conservative party legacy my hon friend be right that technology can and we hope will provide well solution to the management and supervision of offender in the community i look forward to the sentencing review ’s finding in that regard 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i support the lord chancellor ’s decision to commission a full statutory inquiry into the terrible attack in nottingham i know it will be welcome by the family and everyone in the city and across my home county of nottinghamshire i fully support her welcome decision 
 greg ó ceallaigh be a serve immigration judge who decide asylum and deportation appeal it take nothing more than a basic google search to uncover his past comment that the conservative party should be treat the same way as nazis and cancer as a sit judge he have publicly support labour ’s plan to scrap the rwanda scheme and for illegal entry into the united kingdom to be decriminalise do the lord chancellor believe this be compatible with judicial impartiality if not what do she intend to do about it 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his remark on the new nottingham inquiry i be very grateful for his support i be sure the whole house will want to see the inquiry come to a conclusion as quickly as possible 
 i say to the right hon gentleman that when people have a complaint to make about judge they can do so via the well place mechanism of the judicial complaint office if he wish to make a complaint he can do so but what i will not do be indulge in effectively the doxing of judge especially not when they be simply do their job of apply the law in the case that appear before they if there be complaint to be make about judicial conduct i be sure the shadow lord chancellor know how to go about it 
 order can i just say that we must be careful about what we do here we be not mean to criticise judge and i know that this house would not do so i be sure that we will now change the topic 
 mr speaker it be important that judge and the manner in which they be appoint be properly scrutinise in this house and i will not shy away from do so helen pitcher be force to resign in disgrace as the chair of the criminal cases review commission after a formal panel find that she have fail in her duty during of the bad miscarriage of justice in recent memory but she be still in charge of judicial appointment despite judge appear in the medium every week for their activism her commission have fail to conduct the most basic check on potential judge either out of sheer incompetence or out of sympathy with their hard leave view on open border the commission be break and be bring the independence of the judiciary into disrepute how much long will it take for the justice secretary to act and remove the chair of this commission from her position and defend the independence and reputation of the judiciary 
 i be afraid that the shadow chancellor can not elide the process for the appointment of judge with a wide attack on the independence of the judiciary i hope that he will take the admonishment from you mr speaker and the clear disapprobation of this house to reflect on the way that he be approach his role if there be complaint to be make about judicial conduct there be already a robust process in place for do so if the shadow lord chancellor wish to avail himself of that i be sure that give how active he be he will be happy to do so what be completely improper be to take his position in this house to indulge in a wide attack of the judiciary at a time when we know that judicial security have be compromise 
 order this be the time for topical question and we have other member to get in tension be run high so let we calm everyone down with a question from warinder juss 
 on a recent visit to featherstone prison near wolverhampton i come across a number of recall prisoner who be there for minor technical breach of their probation sometimes for up to a year can the secretary of state please outline what datum be collect on the reason for prison recall and how that datum then inform policy decision aim at reduce unnecessary return to custody 
 i be happy to write to my hon friend on the detail of the data collection and remind he that we have a sentencing review in process that will be look at all of those thing 
 in a single week in bradford we have see council leader once again reject my call for a full rape gang inquiry an ex police officer have be threaten with arrest for investigate these horrific crime and now a judge be block the release of official transcript from a major rape gang trial in bradford can the lord chancellor explain why our justice system be be use to block the truth about these trial 
 it be not appropriate in these difficult case to misrepresent what the correct position be the home secretary have already set out our position in this house and answer question on our approach to the grooming gang issue and the local inquiry on court transcript we be pilot artificial intelligence technology for accuracy so that hopefully in the future we can produce transcript at the moment the cost be prohibitive and the accuracy of the technology that be available be just not there 
 restrict patient be mentally disorder offender who be detain in hospital for treatment and be subject to special control by the justice secretary what additional support be my right hon friend ’s department provide to help mental health trust to treat and rehabilitate these patient so that they can be release from this secure environment in a timely manner 
 my hon friend ask a serious and difficult question the mental health bill introduce to parliament last november aim to stop restrict patient from languish in hospital unnecessarily while prioritise public protection and manage any risk the department also work closely with clinician and care team to make decision on restricted patient as quickly as possible in line with the publish guideline 
 release on temporary licence be deny when people say nasty stuff on twitter but grant for much more serious crime can the secretary of state tell i when i can expect a satisfactory reply to an urgent rotl case that i have already raise with the prisons minister and senior civil servant and that affect a grieve family in my constituency 
 i will chase that up this afternoon and ensure that the hon member get a response as quickly as possible she will know that release on temporary licence be a mechanism that have governor supervision if people follow the rule in prison they become eligible for release on temporary licence if they do not follow the rule they be not eligible 
 can the minister give an assessment of the potential merit of restrict triable either way offence to summary trial except for sentencing 
 at a time when victim be wait far too long for their day in court it be right that we look at all option we have ask sir brian leveson to consider all option in his review include the reclassification of some offence to summary only 
 we should all be really concerned that the government have quietly abandon their pledge to hold local inquiry into grooming gang the victim still need justice the public still need answer and we still need a full inquiry in the meantime can the minister tell we what specific action not just reference to ai her department be take to ensure full transparency and public confidence in the case that do come to court 
 sentencing remark be already available for some of those case we have a robust judicial system that can handle difficult case i have already deal with concern about transcript the cost of full court transcript be very prohibitive which be why we be look at technological solution ai in particular we have a number of pilot run the key thing be that we make sure that the transcript be accurate so that the information put into the public domain reflect what be say and do in the courtroom 
 although the extra sit day to reduce court delay announce by the secretary of state be welcome do the minister agree that the state of the court estate need some attention as some court be out of action due to disrepair issue 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the other day i visit the telford justice centre where of the courtroom be out of use because of mould and a leaky roof the government be make an additional capital investment of £ this year to maintain and restore our building so that they can be full and active for use we be also invest in new court building from blackpool to the city of london there will be new court and they will serve the public well 
 the passing of pope francis be a profound loss throughout his life he be a passionate advocate for a justice system that put reconciliation at its heart with the publication of the independent sentencing review expect imminently will the government take this opportunity to move our justice system towards that contain in the word of pope francis a horizon of hope and reintegration and will they commit to restorative justice be place at the heart of our justice system 
 restorative justice clearly have a role to play but the principle of our sentencing review with which i hope member across the house can agree be clear there must always be a prison place available for people who be dangerous and need to be lock up and we have to do more to help people to turn their back on a life of crime 
 compare with the same period in more foreign national offender have be remove since july when this government come into office may    i congratulate the lord chancellor on this achievement and ask what the new funding announce to speed the process up will do to increase the number be remove 
 we have already get off to a good start in the deportation of foreign national offender from our prison the new funding will enable more caseworker to speed up the removal of even more fno i be very pleased that we have see a high number deport this year compare to the previous year when the conservatives be in office 
 a british mother in my constituency have flee domestic abuse face force return to poland to stay with her young child under the hague convention on the civil aspect of international child abduction with no knowledge of the local language and no source of income there she risk either dependence on her abuser or homelessness that be because the convention ignore the issue of domestic abuse allow it to be manipulate by abuser would ministers support my bill on the hague abduction convention and domestic abuse which i will present soon and which would change the implementation of the hague convention in uk domestic law to protect mother from the threat of return in this way 
 i will happily meet the hon member to discuss her bill and tackle this issue head on 
 i thank my right hon friend the justice secretary for the announcement she make today and the government for listen to bereaved family and survive victim it be only right that the inquiry be statutory to ensure that it have the power to compel witness and hold those responsible for failing to account what assurance can she give that the inquiry will be conduct in a timely manner and that the lesson it uncover will be implement swiftly to help ensure that similar attack do not take place 
 i thank my hon friend for her comment for her support and for assiduously represent the need of her constituent as i say the inquiry will be chair by her honour deborah taylor who be an experienced senior retired judge i have every confidence in she she be already meet the family of the victim and the survivor and she have undertake to ensure that the inquiry work at pace and make its finding as quickly as possible 
 may i press the secretary of state on transcript when i ask recently for a transcript of a major trial manchester crown court tell i that the cost would be £ when press that go down to £ but that be still way beyond the reach of most people this be a travesty of justice other country include some american state have free transcript available now when will she sort this out 
 the right hon member will know that the issue at the moment be that transcript have to be physically transcribe by hand by a human listening back to what be say and do in court speech to text transcription be pilot by the previous government it be not accurate enough i be sure he   will agree that any transcript that be ultimately publish have to be accurate that be why we be look at ai model we hope to be able to find a model that give we the requisite level of accuracy and speed to be able to publish transcript and to do so cheaply 
 child adopt from care or live under special guardianship be currently disproportionately at risk of enter the criminal justice system later in life if early trauma go untreated give the recent change in the adoption and special guardianship support fund what step be the lord chancellor take alongside cabinet colleague to ensure the availability of more equitable access to such support 
 we know how vulnerable many child with care experience be and we be work closely with colleague in the department for education to help reduce their risk of enter the criminal justice system the government be commit £ to the adoption and special guardianship support fund this year 
 will the minister take a special look at the problem of rogue builder who repeatedly target our constituent often very vulnerable people they take thousand from they and wreck their home yet the only redress be say to be trading standard surely that amount to fraud and there ought to be a prosecution to follow 
 if any crime be commit or even allege to have be commit it should be report to the police in the instance victim have right under the victim code we have recently do a campaign to advertise the code to create awareness of it and we will soon consult on the code so that it reach all potential victim of crime more broadly 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 i thank the lord chancellor for establish the inquiry into the nottingham attack but freedom of information request by the charity families disclose last month that at least mental health patient in england commit or be suspect of murder or manslaughter between and the victim include susan and jeffrey farrance the elderly parent of my constituent will the inquiry consider case like that of the farrances so that we can learn all lesson necessary to prevent these tragic and avoidable crime 
 i thank the chair of the justice committee for raise an important issue for his own constituent that also have wide significance i will publish the full term of reference and place they in the libraries of both houses very soon regardless of whether the review go into the specific of every other type of case i be sure that it will make finding on how such case particularly involve people with mental health condition be properly manage i be sure that those finding will be of interest not just to our department but to other and will be implement by the government in due course 
 we have a case in my constituency of a young offender well below who be cause havoc he have be arrest many time and be not comply with a court order the assumption be against incarceration because of his age will the minister explain what work the government be do to crack down on prolific offending by young people well below who be cause stress and fear in their local community 
 i be very happy to answer query about that particular issue if the hon lady wish to write to i the government have increase the youth offend team budget this year and continue to invest in the turnaround programme as i say before it have be show that young people who be engage in that programme have only a chance of reoffende 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for housing communities and local government if she will make a statement on the disruption to waste collection and the deployment of the military in birmingham 
 before i start may i recognise on his passing the significant contribution of pope francis also as the minister for local government in england i wish everyone a happy st george ’s day for tomorrow 
 member across the house will be aware of the continue disruption cause by industrial action in birmingham the government have repeatedly call for unite to call off the strike and accept the fair deal that be on the table the commissioner and the council be undertake the necessary reform in the context of a challenging financial situation with the legacy of equal pay when woman worker be systematically pay less than their male counterpart in similar role though the council must chart that course itself our action speak to our determination to ensure the welfare of the citizen of birmingham 
 we have be provide intensive support to the council in its effort to address the backlog of waste that have be build up on the city ’s street and significant progress have be make in the last fortnight through a concerted effort and with the assistance of other council private operator and the endeavour of many hundred of determined worker who have work extremely long hour the result be that tonne of excess waste have be remove and level be now approach normal more than bin truck be out every day and regular bin collection have resume the council continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that waste do not build up again 
 this be a government who stand up for work people the industrial action be in no ’s interest because the deal on the table be a good deal the council have work hard to offer route to maintain pay through transfer worker to comparable role and in some case to upskill those worker in scope there may of course be detail to iron out but that be why talk be so important as we have repeatedly make clear unite should suspend the strike accept the deal and bring the dispute to an end the government will continue to be on the side of the people of birmingham and to support the council in create the sustainable fair and reliable waste service that its resident deserve 
 it be astounding that the secretary of state have have to resort to call in the army to cover her blush for her failure to resolve the situation be not intend to make an oral statement to the house and have to be drag before it by mean of this urgent question she be fail fail to stand up to the union fail to protect the resident of the uk ’s city and fail to protect the reputation of our nation and now resort to be bail out by our brave armed force which i note the minister do not even mention it be a national embarrassment 
 i realise that the minister and the secretary of state be not bear until but many in this house and in the wide country remember very well the 1970 and the winter of discontent it be clear that with this government we risk go back to those day to prevent that from happen i offer the minister and the secretary of state our support if the minister will clarify and confirm the following what be the project cost to the taxpayer of the military ’s involvement will he rule out the humiliation of service personnel ever have to collect refuse will he commit to use provision in the strikes minimum service levels act to ensure that resident receive a basic level of service and to reinstate legislation that would allow the council to commission agency worker to clean up the city until the strike be resolve 
 finally will he abandon provision in the employment rights bill that give union access to every single workplace in this country that lower the threshold for union recognition and that make it much easy for union to call strike do that now and the minister will have our support however if he and the secretary of state duck the tough decision to please her union paymaster the tail may once again wag the dog in this country which could take it back to the 1970 
 if that be a dog it be more like a bichon frisé attack on the government i ’m afraid it really do not land what do people in birmingham want in the context of an unacceptable situation where rubbish be accumulate the people of birmingham want it to be resolve what they have in this government be a government who do not pray in aid party politic or council row in the way the previous government do what we do be work together in partnership for the end that be important—[interruption conservative member have be carp from the sideline they have be do this for week now and they have offer every criticism but not a single solution we would be forgive for believe that they have not be in power for year when birmingham be send to the wall we be of course appreciative of our colleague in the mod for the support that they have offer and the logistic adviser have make a difference however as they themselves have say birmingham be more than capable of make sure that the round be collect and the truck be on the road as of this week that mutual support be important 
 i need to pull up   the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake   on a comment that he make early he speak about the humiliation of collect waste from the street and the humiliation of decent working class people go out to provide a public service to million of people across england it be not a humiliation it be a public service and that be critical to our nation ’s interest to say that the job be a humiliation i would say that working class people the bin collector across this country take pride in their work and they deserve more respect from the bloody opposition 
 i call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee 
 i associate myself with the minister ’s remark on the passing of pope francis may his soul rest in perfect peace 
 it be important for we to remember the innocent resident who be catch up in this dispute and the fact that they have be suffer for many week without that refuse be collect i think about the many family who have to celebrate eid while see all that rubbish continue to pile up in just over week there will be another half term and again many family will be at home it be important that the government continue to work closely with birmingham and all party to make sure that this be resolve 
 the minister outline some of the concern around the funding pressure that council of all political party have face over the past few year he will know that he and the government have hand out exceptional financial support for a number of council and a number of council continue to face challenge with their finance can he assure the house that in discussion with birmingham council and other we will continue to support hard work local government officer ensure that their finance be again fit and proper so that we do not face situation such as the we see in birmingham 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for that question which in a way go to the heart of the fragile situation that we inherit as a government after year birmingham and in fact many council of all political stripe have be send to the wall by the previous government the number of bankruptcy notice that be issue be testament to that we have be able to stabilise the sector through the recovery grant the time ever that that grant be issue and birmingham be the large beneficiary we have give that city the support it need but we want to ensure that the progress we have see over the past couple of week be maintain i completely appreciate that there be unacceptable scene where waste have build up on people ’s street that be not okay in normal time and it be certainly not okay in half term when child be play in their local park and on their street that be why we move quickly to ensure that that waste be remove the fact that tonne have be remove show the dedication of those frontline worker 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 it be unacceptable that this dispute have drag on into a week even more disgraceful the people of birmingham be now force to clean up their own street i thank those who give up their easter holiday to pick up rubbish for their neighbour but let we be honest they should never have have to do it 
 this go way beyond birmingham it start with an equal pay claim that bankrupt the council and with widespread local government reorganisation ahead of we all what will stop it from happen again as council merge staff will sit side by side do the same job but on completely different pay from each other that be unjust unsustainable and a tick timebomb year after the reorganisation of bournemouth christchurch and poole council which i lead pay harmonisation be still go on we could not afford to   meet everyone ’s expectation and neither can most council which teeter on the edge what be the minister do to stop this from spiral elsewhere and to protect resident from eye water tax hike or devastating service cut 
 i want to be careful not to stray too far from birmingham which be not affect by local government reorganisation however it be completely usual when look at the transfer of the workforce for negotiation to take place with worker and trade union to harmonise term and condition and pay that will take place in the usual way we need to be careful not to set hare run unnecessarily 
 the issue in birmingham the foundational issue in a way be equal pay for far too long woman worker be pay far less than their male counterpart for comparable role that go on for decade the council have to resolve that as other council do many year early woman can not continue to be pay less than their male counterpart in the end this be about harmonisation do in the right way 
 i thank the deputy prime minister and the minister for their support in address the public health concern in birmingham as the minister say tonne of waste have now be clear and weekly collection will resume i put on record my thank to everyone involve in the clean up include many volunteer they be the good of birmingham do the minister agree that it be right that the council resolve equal pay issue with over woman now due compensation that be precisely what the deal on offer do while ensure that no worker have to lose pay 
 that be precisely the issue with the wrco waste recycling and collection officer role that start the strike action to begin with an enhanced payment be make for that role that do not stand when it go through job evaluation compare with woman who be do similar role elsewhere in the council that can not stand there must be a red line whereby no agreement can be reach if it compromise the council position on equal pay and build up liability for the future i absolutely pay tribute to the community group and frontline worker who have make sure that the response to the clean up have be of co operation 
 will the minister make a point of thank the well run and cost effective conservative council that have either help or offer to help clear up this terrible mess will he bear in mind that it be not just the bin strike that my poor long suffer constituent in the royal town of sutton coldfield have have to endure but the pende closure of our library and the massive hike in council tax do he understand why so many of we want to see a proper judge lead inquiry into how bankrupt birmingham city council have get britain ’s city into this mess will he also bear in mind that this be a dispute between wing of the labour party whatever i may think of the council that he lead it be quite wrong that my constituent the leader of the council should have have a photograph of his house put on social medium by unite will the minister condemn that action by unite 
 let i be clear over the past few week photograph have be take of the house of union official and the same trade union have use photograph of the home of the council leader and cabinet member neither of those thing be okay this be already a fraught dispute it require the good faith of all party and negotiation through be in the same room and talk through the issue in the interest of the worker and the people of the city of birmingham our hope and our expectation be that although what have happen have happen a line be draw and we can move forward in good faith 
 i refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests the crisis over bin collection in birmingham have drag on for far too long and my constituent have suffer significantly as a result while i understand the financial pressure on the council clearly it be unreasonable to expect any worker to accept a pay cut will the minister commit to take all step possible to encourage good faith negotiation between both party so that a fair deal can be reach and this vital service can be restore without any further disruption 
 i do not think there be a single example although i be prepared to be correct where equal pay have not have winner and loser on the edge that be an element of equal pay that we have to accept the envelope be not limited so the book have to balance 
 on the issue of how the wrco role be be change and whether worker need to lose pay the council be offer a sideways move in the street scene division on the same grade which will mean no loss of income it be offer worker a move to an equivalent grade role even if training be require and it will provide that training it be also offer lgv driver training so that loader can upgrade to be a driver which carry a high payment than their current role 
 i recall ask the minister on a previous occasion about get support from military personnel and he say that i have go from to very quickly the difficulty with this government be that they have be very slow to react i be out last thursday pick up bin bag with youth worker from a local organisation who have work hour shift and be then spend their evening clean up the street the minister have fail to raise the fact that thousand of tonne of recyclable waste have not be collect encourage further fly tipping when will this government intervene and resolve the issue bin worker work hard up to of they will lose up to £ and that need to be resolve 
 i share the hon member ’s appreciation of community volunteer who be clean up the street just as i welcome the hard work of hundred of frontline council worker who have step in their effort have mean that tonne of accumulate waste have now be clear we can agree on that at least 
 on the question of when it be appropriate for the government to offer support it be when a major incident be declare as the hon member will know i have be in birmingham every week since then there have   be daily update call with the council and we have be provide essential support to the council to clear up the city 
 i thank the minister for his effort to keep birmingham mps inform on a cross party basis during this dispute i would also like to associate myself with the condemnation of the publication of photograph of the house of some of the party to the dispute my resident in birmingham northfield want to see a service that be not the same as before the strike it must be well and i know the minister share that ambition 
 we have hear today about the 1970 it be not so long ago that a conservative secretary of state stand at the dispatch box and say that he be delighted to announce cut to birmingham ’s budget the sharp of any unitary authority do the minister agree that the word miss from the shadow secretary of state ’s question be sorry 
 we have be here repeatedly for question statement and even urgent question in the house and on not a single occasion have the shadow secretary of state or shadow ministers accept their role after year of government in drive council of all colour to the wall we need to bear in mind that commissioner be bring in under the previous government and birmingham have to declare bankruptcy under the previous government the only difference now be that it have a government on side willing to meet it financially that be why the recovery grant be so important but also in spirit and through our action which be why we be work in partnership to clean up the street and get birmingham clean 
 which legacy be the minister most proud of rubbish and rat in birmingham or labour ’s breach of its promise to the electorate to freeze council tax 
 i be sure that sound a well question when it be be draft this morning i do not think anyone take pride in the strike action and the waste that accumulate on the street this be a very serious issue it be unacceptable that a major incident have to be declare and that public health concern be so prevalent that be why we take quick action it be why the street have be clean to the tune of tonne and it be why there be more daily collection take place now in term of tonnage than there be in routine time to make sure they catch up and do not slip back but we recognise that in the end the only solution be to deal with the underlie strike action that be cause the disruption 
 i refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests i be a member of unite and i be very proud of that i think generation of my family have be member not to rise to the provocation of conservative members but there be a difference between have military adviser and have troop on the street the latter would be see as an act of provocation and a worsening of the situation may i suggest that the minister or the secretary of state convene the meeting between the council and the union to secure progress in the negotiation 
 there have be almost daily communication with the council and the trade union have make representation too but we need to be clear about appropriate role and responsibility and about the line of accountability the council not the government be the employer of the workforce in birmingham and it be for the employer and the employee to reach an agreement that both can accept we urge both party to negotiate in good faith we believe that the deal on the table be a good deal the right hon gentleman be correct to say that worker have the right to make their representation but the council have to take into account all its workforce include over woman who historically be pay far less than their male counterpart for equivalent role that be the foundational issue at the heart of the dispute 
 despite assurance from the dispatch box before the easter recess we continue to see pile of rubbish on the street in birmingham the cost be mount and the rat the squeaky blinder continue to roam the street of britain ’s city freely so i ask the minister again what be his government and labour run birmingham city council do to bring an end to the strike enough be enough resident want an end to the situation 
 work be still take place i should address the question about rodent because that be a serious issue nobody want to see rat in the street particularly around the accumulate waste we welcome the council ’s decision to suspend the charge for call out p control so that household that report rodent be not financially disadvantaged on the government ’s response to the situation from day we say that the accumulate waste be unacceptable and a public health hazard the government step in to support the council to ensure that we could get more truck out of the depot increase the amount of waste collect and regularise the number of routine collection i be pleased that progress have be make but what will ultimately resolve the dispute be the trade union and the council reach an agreement that bring the strike action to an end 
 on the promotion of leeds united i call richard burgon 
 i take that as congratulation from the speaker of the house of commons on the promotion of leeds united so thank you very much mr speaker hon member hear hear that seem to be the most popular thing i have say in the house for some time 
 i be proud to be a unite member and a trade union member i remember the leeds bin strike when the conservative and lib dem run council try to cut the bin worker pay by up to £ a month strike follow that be ultimately successful have listen to the point make by member from across the chamber i would say that it be always wrong to castigate trade union as be the enemy within they be an important part of our civil democracy it be not union official who call this strike or any strike but trade union member so here unite the union mean the bin worker it be really important that we do not allow trade union and trade unionism to be demonise in this dispute or any other 
 we can certainly agree that people have the right to strike but people also have the right to go to work we see a restriction of the number of bin truck that could leave the depot which have a significant impact on the amount of waste that could be collect the direct result be the accumulation of ten of thousand of tonne of waste on the street in the end we really want unite as the negotiate body for the workforce it represent and birmingham city council as the employer to get around the table on the deal that have be table to iron out the difference if there be any and to reach an agreement if that will take long we strongly encourage unite to suspend strike action during the negotiation 
 birmingham city council be the large local authority in the uk by population sadly for many year it have struggle with severe problem that impact its resident the government have engage in local government reorganisation across much of the country large part of the area cover by birmingham city council may be well administer by body elsewhere outside the boundary of the city will the minister look at whether it be time to review the boundary of birmingham city council the council be so large that it can not function properly for its resident
