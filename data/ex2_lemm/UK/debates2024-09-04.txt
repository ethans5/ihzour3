thank you madam chair before i talk about plymouth may i celebrate the amazing speech that we have hear this afternoon and pay tribute to the wealth of experience and passion not just on the government benches but across the chamber it be really heartening my hon friend   the member for rother valley jake richards   speak about the spirit that we have all see in the community that we represent and the confidence that he have in that spirit to overcome some of the challenge that we be face as a nation and in our community i completely share that 
 let i now talk about plymouth the city that i call home and the city that i be so proud to represent in this place as the member for plymouth moor view i want to talk about our people our institution our roll hill grey warship glint in the south coast sun and the noise that argyle fan make on match day i want to talk about the gritty determination of staff at of the big hospital in the country and i want to talk about hope 
 i will frame this speech with principle that i live by during my time in the royal marines principle that be well know amongst the armed force community in plymouth a leader must be a dealer of hope when the chip be down leader have to step forward and give hope i believe that be our job in parliament too in plymouth community come together to give each other hope there be immense strength and resilience in the street the housing estate the front room and wherever folk get together and organise to change the life they and their neighbour be live make simple tangible change by address the need in front of they 
 we have whitleigh big local the greens community trust and connecting youth cic to name just a few work in partnership with the local community to improve the thing that matter and to bring hope i want to use my position in this house to empower our community to effect change and generate hope that life will get well and that family can be lift out of poverty 
 today relative child poverty in plymouth moor view be at set against the regional figure of i will not accept rise child poverty because the principle that i live by i believe a lot of us share be this the standard you walk past be the standard you accept if we see something that we know be wrong and   we keep walk we be effectively say we be happy with that situation the hard option be not to walk past but to take action 
 derriford hospital in plymouth serve almost people across devon and cornwall i have meet the nurse paramedic doctor and volunteer who do fantastic work under immense pressure they be people who do not just walk past however the hospital be up against it in june alone there be instance where a patient wait more than hour in a&e. that represent a series of personal tragedy for the patient affect with the new government i will work tirelessly to change that story 
 away from the hospital the beat heart of our city be plymouth argyle football club which be in its season now in the championship make it of the top club in the english football league yet in plymouth many family struggle to afford access to sport for their kid i be a keen footballer and i believe in the power of sport to set young people up for life i will use my platform to improve access to sport in plymouth because a standard where this country have the fine football league watch the world over but our own youngster can not afford to play be not a standard i will walk past i pay tribute to the excellent work that the argyle community trust and the plymouth football boot bank do already to broaden access to sport in plymouth 
 as a former royal marines commando it be a particular privilege to represent the city that be home to not only the large naval base in western europe but the royal marines who be still headquarter in plymouth ours be a city where so many resident have serve in uniform and i take this opportunity to thank every single of they for their service and dedication i also pay tribute to my predecessor for his heartfelt effort to raise the profile of the veteran agenda 
 for century plymouth have have a proud military history and the prime minister recently call it 
 the frontline of defence in this country 
 navy marines and army personnel have deploy from plymouth for hundred of year the tradition of proud military service run through our city like the writing in a stick of rock now as we find ourselves as a country in another moment of critical international instability plymouth be again a keystone of our national security devonport dockyard be the home port for the frigate survey vessel and amphibious shipping that be crucial for our safety it be also where the submarine that host our nuclear deterrent be maintain and will be for generation to come we be also home to highly skilled small and medium sized enterprise such as msubs maker of unmanned submersible craft use in the most special military project barden bearing and collins aerospace whose cutting edge engineering be integral to the uk ’s modern weapon system 
 from our military institution and our manufacture base to our hospital our football club and our dockyard we stand up and we serve in plymouth we give a lot to this nation but for all this if i can borrow a phrase from a friend and a constant source of advice my hon friend   the member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard plymouth do not get its fair share i will work tirelessly with the government to change that because in labour we respect service and our will be a government of service a government of hope   as i serve my country before in uniform so i will serve my city now in office as i be train to do in the marines i will strive to be a dealer of hope when it come to take action i will remember along with colleague on both side of the house that the standard we walk past be the standard we accept 
 thank you madam chair for allow i to give my maiden speech in this house like every member across this house it be the great honour privilege and responsibility of my life to represent my community of loughborough shepshed and the village i rise at the most difficult moment for our community and our country since the world war when many feel despondency despair and anger i know that every member across this house want our community to succeed and to contribute to our national success that be what my community have do before and will do again with hope and determination 
 my story do not begin in loughborough i be not bear there unlike my neighbour who be now my friend and who have make it my home my story instead begin in rural punjab mile away where my father be bear almost year ago his chance of die before his birthday be in today a child bear in the same place be around time less likely to die that be what economic growth mean it mean less suffering it mean less misery and it mean less death that be why i become an economist to build prosperity and to lessen misery 
 i learn my trade in the treasury and then go to work in somaliland of the poor nation on earth where i help to write its economic policy its budget and its national development plan that be where i see the horror of climate change lead to drought hunger and death but also where i learn that even in the darkest of hour and the most difficult of moment we can build prosperity 
 now i stand here as the elect member of parliament for my community it say something remarkable about our nation that the fact that i the son of immigrant be stand in this chamber be in and of itself unremarkable it speak to our common culture a culture forge of different background a culture that not only reject the violence we see over the summer but completely reject its reasoning too 
 my election represent an historic for my community i be a member of an under represent minority i be of course the member of parliament elect by the man and woman of loughborough to have a beard to the organiser of the beard of the year competition i say call i luckily for i my dad be not eligible for that particular competition i know that   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn   have win the award several time i hope he do not mind i win the prize this time as long as i let he win the argument 
 my predecessor in this place jane hunt be not a contender for that award but no can doubt her commitment to team loughborough and every single member across this house and across my community will wish she the very good especially as she have recover from cancer her predecessor baroness morgan have talent that be well know both in this and the other place before she be my good friend and mentor andy reed member who know andy will know that he be   still a lead figure in sport policy and they will also know that andy be the nice man in british politic it be his character that i hope to live up to in this place 
 however i rise to speak at the most difficult time for our community and our nation since our community be in crisis wage in my constituency be £ low than they would be have we grow at new labour rate the divide cause by deindustrialisation have widen from crack into chasm with young man who use to leave school and get good job now less likely to get any job in our most deprive neighbourhood life expectancy fall before the pandemic more than any fact or figure the despair the despondency and the anger across and beyond our shore war in europe once more with democracy in danger and most seriously of all a planet that be burn 
 for my community this be the hot summer we have ever know follow by the bad flooding we have ever see destroy home the prime minister and i see that destruction when we visit the home of ian and alan no should wake up in the morning to find their home destroy by flooding but that will only become more common in the year ahead what we do in the next decade will determine the fate of our community of democracy and of our planet either we will rise to this moment build prosperity for all protect democracy and stop emit carbon or everything we hold dear will crumble and fall 
 previous generation have show we that we can rise to this moment that threaten we our country stand alone against fascism in europe and win i think today of my constituent william williams year old who fly spitfires in the war as his generation rise to their moment so can we my community have show i that we can when the water come and the flood rise my constituent caz and carl do not pause to think if they could help but only how they could help they organise collection they provide refuge and they look after perfect stranger it be their spirit that i carry into this place ask not if but how how can we build prosperity and protect our planet from burn we can do so by invest in a green transition that create good job and get wage rise for the people and place leave behind when the factory close that be what we can achieve and we be see it work already in the united states 
 in my community there be world lead hydrogen research and industry we need green hydrogen for fertiliser and to keep our truck move it be not a coincidence that i have choose to speak in this debate with treasury ministers on the front bench i say to they get out the cheque book”—they be very excited by that—“because i will be ask for money from both the national wealth fund and gb energy 
 however this be about more than cash it be about rebuild hope and prosperity as a previous generation rise to their moment in the midst of the most destructive war in the history of humankind an economist write a report that still define our nation he write 
 freedom from want can not be force on a democracy or give to a democracy it must be win by they 
 it be win by they they build prosperity for all with good job across our country education for all housing for all and healthcare for all 
 as that generation rise to their moment so will we by build prosperity protect our planet and end despair and despondency as previous generation rise to their moment we will too with the hope and determination that define our community and that define our country 
 thank you ms ghani i start by commend my hon friend for their impassioned speech particularly my hon friend   the member for loughborough dr sandher he will be pleased to know that i will not be a contender this year in the competition that he mention maybe later menopause depend

 i be deeply humble to make my maiden speech in this debate highlight the importance of fiscal standard because during the election campaign so many people tell i that their mortgage have go through the roof or that they have lose the ability to buy or rent their home or indeed any home because of the action of the last government 
 i understand personally what it be like when a full time job do not even cover the bill my gramp be a train driver he teach i the importance of hard work and public service he introduce i to the trade union movement and to the labour party which i be proud to say have be at the centre of my adult life my mum be a factory seamstress and my dad be a plumber and then a police officer as a kid time be tough but our house be always full of love humour and determination my dad work job and my mum set about make childhood the very good it could be my gramp navigate the track with precision and care my mum sew with love and my dad serve his community i know i will bring the same attitude to my time in this house because the opportunity here be so very precious

 have be a teacher for year i know that not everyone have the start in life that i feel privileged to have have be allow to try thing and fail be a great lesson my working class background mean that i sometimes seem a bit impatient this be because i know that people from my background must fight hard and do not often get a chance so they have to seize   every opportunity as it arise as an mp i want to champion child and young people from all background across my city so that they be give every chance to succeed and fulfil their potential whatever that may be and wherever that may take they the child and young people in portsmouth deserve nothing less

 however not everything be about money and pay this be about pride pompey people be proud people they do not shout about success unless they be in football they rarely grumble equally unless it be about football many of they just get their head down roll   up their sleeve and get on with it and many feel betray and let down by those who should have be there for they for some trust in politician have disappear and i can understand why people on the doorstep and in the street be wary and feed up with broken promise many feel alone isolate and betray come from of the most trust profession in the country to of the least i get it i know that as the mp for portsmouth north the chance for opportunity and real change lie with i real change that people can see feel and be part of positive change that they can proudly shout about as alan ball say

 i be the brazilian jiu jitsu black belt to be elect to parliament and i use to run my own academy ms ghani i promise this be somewhat relevant when i leave the army i have offer to teach brazilian jiu jitsu across the world from abu dhabi to arizona but i pick swindon i be often ask why do you choose swindon but it be an easy answer for i i love swindon i love my hometown it be a wonderful town build on industry and be full of passion and hope our history be a proud history of reinvention we start life as a farming town with a focus on pig market then we transition and become a hub for the railway in   the century generation of railway worker and their family benefit from the cradle to grave healthcare that be rumour to have inspire the great nhs as technology develop so do swindon and we become home to the like of rover honda and mini but what be next 
 we be at a pivotal point in history for my town where do swindon go next my hope be that it will go as it always have into the future at the forefront of new technology and green technology i hope that my right hon friend   the member for doncaster north ed miliband   hear that it be my mission to foster green growth in swindon and see the town thrive again with high skilled well pay job i believe that in a grow stable economy we can see that happen swindon be not just famous for its high number of roundabout if anyone in the chamber have ever visit i be sure they will remember those fondly as we have also have the pleasure of not but james bond movie be film in the town

 it be the honour and privilege of my life to be stand in this chamber give my maiden speech as the member of parliament for chelmsford it be a wonderful young city locate in the heart of essex that i have have the joy to call my home for the past year or so the constituency cover the main urban area of the city of chelmsford it be bless with beautiful park and flank river that wind their way through the city centre pass the home of the essex eagles at the essex county cricket ground we have a thriving high street that attract shopper from mile around investment into the constituency from the public and private sector mean that its future continue to look bright 
 from waterhouse farm in the west to chelmer village in the east and from springfield in the northern reach to the southern boundary of goat hall and everywhere in between i be proud to call chelmsford my home and even prouder to be stand here today represent its constituent in this magnificent place 
 chelmsford have of the busy platform train station outside of london have now rejoin the rank of the commuter i know at hand the importance of the brand new station be construct just outside of the northern edge of the constituency the new beaulieu park station will have a significant positive impact on passenger from chelmsford give they more choice and flexibility and remove the need for many of they to travel into the city centre to commence their rail journey 
 a new station must not be see as job do however train travel in this country be expensive and complicated ultimately i do not believe that the public care too much about who run the train they care more about how much rail travel cost they whether the train run on time and whether they be comfortable and efficient they be often frustrate by the bewildering array of ticket option whose detailed restriction seem design either to make they miss their train as they try to work out which to buy or to make they buy the wrong ticket they be not design for the faint of heart or the novice traveller that seem like madness if we want to encourage more people to make use of public transport the whole system need to be simplify and i be keen to see the legislation pass yesterday do just that without an economy that can support investment in new rail station or the redevelopment of junction include the major army and navy interchange in the centre of chelmsford we know that such project be in danger of never happen at all 
 i be pleased to support the bill before we today to ensure that the terrible wasteful fiscal mistake of previous government be not repeat leave more headroom for investment in our country ’s future the new beaulieu park station be important to my predecessor vicky ford and i pay tribute to her dedication to that project it be the culmination of more than a decade of partnership work in chelmsford that vicky join after her election to parliament in knock on door   throughout this year ’s campaign many constituent be grateful for her help with issue they have raise with she they also note her visible loyalty to her party as she be rarely see without her trademark blue nail polish to match her little blue car and an outfit that almost invariably include a splash of blue i thank she for the time she spend serve the chelmsford constituency 
 from the very bottom of my heart i thank the constituent of chelmsford who have place their trust in i to represent they in this place i know they do not do so lightly indeed it have take year of careful consideration for the good people of chelmsford to send to this place anyone other than a conservative indeed it have be year since they make the choice to elect a liberal to represent they that slow pace of electoral change in chelmsford may lead those not familiar with essex ’s city to conclude that chelmsfordians have little appetite for innovation but nothing could be far from the truth 
 among other thing chelmsford have a rich and distinguished history in the world of science and technology most notably it host the ever entertainment radio broadcast in the united kingdom in from the marconi new street work right in the centre feature dame nellie melba that lead to regular entertainment broadcast from great baddow in the south of the constituency and eventually to what we now know as the bbc 
 it be hard to spend much time knock on door in chelmsford and speak to chelmsford resident without come across someone who use to work for marconi its modern day successor teledyne e2v locate little more than a stone ’s throw away from the site of the original marconi factory have more than take up the mantle of innovation in chelmsford many of my constituent be now employ there think of any space mission of the past few decade and the chance be that its imaging equipment contain component design and build by teledyne in chelmsford from nasa ’s new horizons mission to pluto and the kuiper belt launch in to the plan launch of ariel by the european space agency to observe the atmosphere of thousand of planet beyond our own solar system teledyne and its employee be reach for the star 
 that be what i want everyone to have the opportunity to do to reach for the star to feel that sense of opportunity and to know that even the sky be not the limit but they can do that only if we invest and the very good place for that investment be in our child and young people we be lucky in chelmsford to have excellent school i thank the teacher and other school staff who work so hard every day to give the child we entrust into their care the good possible start in life but they be increasingly do so with their hand tie behind their back with dwindle resource crumble building and ever great workload 
 i be the in my family to go to university and the elect to any public office let alone as a member of this house i have be able to achieve that because i have have a love and supportive family lot of incredible campaign volunteer and of course a sizeable dose of luck but i also know that a critical part of my success be owe to the amazing state school education that i receive the dedicated and inspirational teacher i be lucky enough to be teach by throughout my   school life and the extracurricular activity in my case largely music base that broaden my horizon and lift my eye to the star 
 i worry that that be not the overwhelming experience of those go through our education system today i worry that child be go through the day with little or no food in their belly i worry that school be have to cut club because they no long have the time or the resource to hold they and i worry that the perform art such as music and drama have be see for too long by previous government as expendable and an unimportant luxury without recognition that they provide child with the skill and confidence to stand up on large stage dare i say in parliamentary chambers and be hear if you be a child with special educational need or disability well good luck with that because the system be utterly tragically devastatingly break but i also take hope from the wind of change that blow just a couple of month ago we know that there will be difficult choice ahead but my hope be that we recognise that invest early on and give child the good possible start can pay much great dividend in the future 
 when guglielmo marconi bring his fledgling invention and experiment to the united kingdom in he do so because he believe that this be a country that can see potential and will invest in that potential for the long term it pay off and a whole industry grow from the humble beginning of a short radio broadcast in the heart of my constituency whatever choice be make by the government in the loom budget it be my sincere hope that they recognise the importance of give school and teacher the resource they need to allow all child to reach for the star 
 i would like to commend   the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman   for a great speech i know chelmsford well it be a beautiful town and i commend her passion for support young people in school and their journey which be very important and something that we need to protect 
 thank you ms ghani for allow i today to make my contribution to the house i think it be right to start off by thank my predecessor as mp sir james duddridge for year of dedicated service he become mp in when southend east and rochford be newly redrawn the rural area to the north of southend have be bring back within the constituency for the time in many year throughout many boundary iteration from southend east and rochford to rochford and southend east and back again you can see the creativity in rename the constituency the area have always be tory hold up until now i be particularly proud to speak here today as the seat ’s ever labour representative 
 the constituency consist of not just the city of southend but the village of great wakering canewdon barling paglesham stambridge and shoeburyness the suburb of southchurch and thorpe bay and rochford itself it be a beautiful constituency rich in culture where you should bring your walking boot as well as your swimming costume it be the place where dame helen mirren go to primary school and home to the   cliffs pavilion which host oasis in that might be tricky next time round depend on who can get ticket 
 as a southender i be contractually oblige to mention that southend be the site of the long pier in the world at metre with the option to walk or take a purpose build train i make the mistake some year ago of walk it with my son he be a little bit old now and he be up in the gallery my calf be struggle by the end of it 
 from watch the maiden speech of labour colleague past and present i have be strike by the nature of the local industry that be so often name check tin pottery steel textile and coal be among the staple product in historical labour seat those be noble and important good they be labour good but they be not the stock in trade of my own seat southend ’s primary industry and expertise have always be tourism good time escapism and happy memory those be our export 
 southend be a city that allow people to meet a sea turtle admire a vintage car win a large teddy bear and even have their palm read often during the course of a single day it be a place where past generation have go in search of freedom and pleasure and it be hard in today ’s world to think of a call more important than that indeed the musician billy bragg immortalise of the road that take people to southend in his song a13 trunk road to the sea the chorus name check shoeburyness and bragg later say that he hop his song would imbue the a13 i know this be a bit of a reach with the same romance as route in america the road to your dreams which run from chicago to los angeles that be a lofty lyrical ambition indeed and it be always go to be a hard ask but speak as someone who grow up in the east end of london in that era i can confirm that the idea of southend always carry a certain magic that be reason why i feel so privileged to represent the area today 
 another reason be the constituency ’s military heritage at the eastern part of my seat we find shoebury garrison an area steep in military history and in the north be southend airport which now serve holidaymaker but in a past life be rochford airfield a fighter base that help to fend off fascism during the world war as a former soldier i be station in the southend area for a short while of my great pleasure when canvass be run into old army friend still live in the seat if they be prepared to open the door to i 
 for i as someone who leave school with no qualification get into a lot of trouble as a young boy and need a chance night school and the military provide a lifeline i quite simply would not be here today in the mother of all parliaments without the opportunity that give i and the ethos of service that it instill in i 
 to properly understand southend we need to understand its proud military history the city be build on a unique blend the discipline and the dignity of the armed force be combine with the creativity and the freedom of the art a place for both the soldier and the singer if you like but there be a risk of get too misty eyed coastal area such as mine have be on the economic sharp end for or year the root cause of that most notably be budget air travel and that be not go away recent year have bring fresh challenge southend ’s economy be at the sharp end during the covid pandemic   the city be still in its recovery phase many of the jewel in southend ’s crown the kursaal venue on the seafront or the freight house in rochford remain unused or underused i be determined that these building will come back to life again as part of our future 
 i believe that change be afoot there be a southend renaissance at work the people of southend be ready to seize the initiative and want more southender be strong independent and unbelievably hard working this weekend we hold city jam an awe inspire international street art festival now in its year but we can not do this alone that be of the reason why i be so pleased not just to be southend ’s ever labour mp but to be of many time labour mps in seaside seat that we have never win before 
 seat such as southend east and rochford need a real and impactful regional policy too little thought have be put into how we build on exist asset and specialism to create a sense of place and an economic centre of gravity southend east and rochford ’s future will be find in modern technology modern infrastructure and green energy by identify opportunity in well pay modern job sector we need a year round economy not just a seasonal so that young people can move from seasonal work into well pay position 
 simply put southend east and rochford will need to regain its cultural capital this be something i have some experience in have be of the creative pioneer of east london ’s creative industry my wife debbie and my child be here in the gallery today and they have always be there for i certainly during my career pivot from the creative industry into politic i thank they for their unwavering support and complete belief in i i believe it be my duty to help shape and create the future job and business for this generation and future generation to grow into just like adebayo alaba and atinuke awesu my late parent who sacrifice everything as part of the windrush generation to leave their family and community behind in nigeria in order to raise a family here in of the most welcoming country in the world 
 simply put it be now my job to ensure that community such as southend east and rochford be vibrant dynamic stable and welcoming when we talk about the public finance as we be in committee today we should all bear that in mind our economy will be strong if we can fulfil the potential in every corner of the country include on the esplanade of southend and in the town centre of rochford and southend place that have so much to contribute to our economy and our culture yet too often have be sideline i look forward to represent my constituent in this house i look forward to contribute to future debate about our economic future and i look forward to contribute to many other discussion 
 thank you ms nokes for give i this opportunity to make my maiden speech before i do i pay tribute to the hon member   for southend east and rochford mr alaba who speak of his and his constituency ’s proud military past i be sure that he will see his constituency through these tough challenge and on to a bright future 
 it go without say that it be a great privilege and an honour of a lifetime to be here have be elect by the people of woking i thank they for elect i as their member of parliament however i must begin by address the bill and severe crisis face my local authority woking borough council despite be relatively small the conservatives leave woke with more than £ of debt follow risky investment decision this legacy be of negative equity service cut and unsustainable debt repayment it could be argue that the conservatives in woking invent truss economic before the former right hon member for south west norfolk have her small stint as prime minister what have happen in my constituency show why the bill be so important i fear that without support from the new government the situation in woking like the rest of local government will only worsen my constituent will suffer the most and that be unacceptable when it be not their fault i urge the government to step in and provide the assistance we so desperately need to ensure that my community can recover and thrive 
 most people might think of woking as a modern constituency but it have a rich history that stretch back through the century woking be mention in the domesday book sutton place famous for be the former home of paul getty date from and be of the old unfortified house in the country woke palace now sadly a ruin be a royal residence for both henry vii and henry viii as a result woke football club my local team be affectionately know as the cards after cardinal wolsey 
 several act of parliament have have an especially profound impact on woking for example the basingstoke canal be authorise by parliament in the canal run through much of woking constituency it have shape our area and be a popular cycling and walking route and a haven for nature but like so many place in the country woke as we know it today be shape by the railway with steam stone and iron woking be cast into the proud town it be today in the mid-1800 we lay the foundation to become the great commuter town we be 
 woking be also a wonderfully diverse and welcoming place home to the shah jahan mosque the old in the country a vibrant muslim community have develop in the town as a result more recently we have welcome ukrainian refugee and i attend many event to support our new ukrainian resident with my predecessor our former mp jonathan lord that be a powerful example of cross party co operation and i thank jonathan for his service as woking ’s mp especially on this humanitarian issue where there be no disagreement whatsoever although we be opponent at the last election i wish he and his family well for the future woking ’s mp before jonathan be humfrey malins who found the immigration advisory service in which to this day provide free asylum and immigration advice to those who need it he get a cbe for his work woking have a proud history of elect mp who welcome immigration and i be pleased to follow that tradition 
 our town be also know for its connection to mclaren it host its formula team and luxury car be build there i be privileged to make a visit only yesterday as a young child of around i remember watch with excitement as mclaren tour the town with its formula car drive by mika häkkinen to celebrate their success mclaren be win again much like the liberal democrats 
 the town also take great pride in be home to the world wide fund for nature we have press issue such as sewage in our river and the fight against climate change i be already work alongside the other newly elect liberal democrat mps in surrey to hold thames water to account for sewage dumping in our local river and stream of my act as an mp be to bring all the surrey mps together to meet thames water to petition it for improvement and a well service 
 woking be fortunate to be surround by green space i love walk my dachshund toffee on horsell common where hg wells famously land his alien in war of the worlds so it be not a great surprise when ed davey ’s liberal democrats turn up and start campaign with their out of this world stunt of course i ’m only woking”—i would not dare call my liberal democrat colleague alien 
 get back to the matter at hand my constituency have a much love local hospital woking community hospital despite feel like i be bear and breed in woking i be not actually bear in the constituency actually no have be bear in a hospital in woking for generation i be bear in frimley park hospital of the nearby hospital we depend on as woking lack maternity service however frimley park be plague with raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and its future be far from certain i will work with my hon friend   the member for surrey heath dr pinkerton   to press the government for a solution to rebuild frimley park hospital 
 another major issue be the cost of rent and mortgage as someone under just i understand these issue deeply they have be raise consistently by local people on the doorstep the increase cost of mortgage and rent in the past year be a further reason why the bill be so important 
 my journey into politic begin because of surrey county council ’s failure to protect vulnerable child at the time it be rat the bad county council in the country because of that failure we can not allow vulnerable child to be fail again 
 the wide theme of why i be elect and indeed why so many of my hard work liberal democrat colleague have be elect be that we understand our community local issue i have work for year in local government and serve as deputy leader of woking council i have see hand the crippling issue that some council face when i look at the face of the liberal democrat mps here i see people who have work hard in local government for year what a glorious theme for this new parliament a cohort of who understand the local issue our community face and a force for good in the country and in the chamber when we need it most 
 thank you ms nokes it be such a great privilege to speak in this debate and make my maiden speech after the hon member for woking mr forster and for chelmsford marie goldman my hon friend   the member for southend east and rochford mr alaba   make a fantastic speech about the city in his constituency which i have have the great privilege of swim in his speech do due justice to that great place my hon friend   the member for swindon north will stone   make a faintly terrifying speech about his brazilian jujitsu skill and he certainly do justice to swindon too 
 it be a great honour to speak in the chamber as the member of parliament for rother valley for so many on the labour benches in particular make our maiden speech be the conclusion of long and hard fought campaign in which we be ultimately victorious in the early hour of   july which just happen to be my birthday we celebrate the end of year of conservative government and the labour government of my adult life but we also humbly accept the responsibility that we have be give in the context of an often bitter and heated political campaign and from the thousand of value conversation i have in my constituency can not avoid the fact that we as a country face daunt and urgent challenge 
 we can not overlook the deep apathy towards the ability of politic and indeed this place to effect change there have be the rise of online disinformation blame bogeyman who do not exist conspiracy theorist and keyboard warrior purposefully ignore the complexity of the world around we for attention political culture too often thrive on division and controversy not the common good the hyperactive vitriolic politic see so often across the atlantic be seep into our discourse here undermine constructive dialogue there be an epidemic of alienation among our young people with level of self harm and suicide in my constituency increase all the time child be arrive at school still in nappy and too often without breakfast in their belly waiting list for mental health support now stretch to half a decade with many young people reach their majority by the time they be see too many people in my constituency feel they have to leave their village or town to get on in life there be a disillusionment that their home their community their place be no long offer the security and hope that people deserve there be a fear for the future i be tell so often during the election campaign what ’s the point of politic this country be break 
 perhaps some of those factor come to the fore over the summer recess when a group organise to attend a hotel just a few mile from my constituency in wath plan to set that building on fire know full well there be innocent people inside the picture on our television be difficult to comprehend i speak to a young mother who have be make homeless and be be temporarily accommodate there with her child the terror she describe will haunt i forever 
 but from the gloom of that violent act come hope the day after the hotel be attack i reach out to the muslim community in my constituency and be invite to a meeting after evening prayer i arrive eager to show solidarity but anxious about the fear and damage that the community would have suffer and yes there be plenty of concern but the question   i encounter be not of anger or retribution but instead a comment urge i to speak with the perpetrator of the violence in order to well understand the cause and motivation it be a moment of great generosity and sensitivity and that will always stay with i 
 indeed that spirit of togetherness care about the bond that unite we be everywhere to be see in the rother valley dinnington boxing club hold an event after the riot with several south yorkshire boxing club to show unity and togetherness a determination to portray south yorkshire in a different light that spirit run through the club i will always recall have a pint at the little mester in north anston when a young lad from the club arrive to rapturous applause only to explain that he have casually run a marathon that morning on his own wholly unorganised to raise money for a local child ’s hospice he have hear that it require more fund for toy 
 i think of the dementia café in winthrop gardens which provide such an invaluable service or the maltby lions who be out every week rain or shine to raise money for deserve cause i think of the community café at the beautiful ulley reservoir the work of the salvation army at the dinnington food bank the community fridge in kiveton park the volunteer gardener in harthill the community energy project in woodsetts or the macmillan coffee morning in anston this spirit ultimately win the day even in the shadow of horror 
 in a previous life as a pupil barrister i sit behind prosecute counsel at the trial of the murderer of jo cox mp i learn an awful lot not about legal process or criminal procedure but from jo ’s family who arrive each day at court with smile hold hand and with a bag of sweet that they offer to assemble journalist security guard and indeed the lawyer include the defence barrister i take inspiration from their strength it be an honour to campaign for my hon friend   the member for spen valley kim leadbeater   in that vital by election and it be even more so to share these green benches with she today 
 that spirit of generosity the strength of unity in the face of the dark force be what i will try to further in my role in this place in that spirit i praise alexander stafford my predecessor who be a hard work mp and who leave the house as his brother arrive no doubt   the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford   will follow in his brother ’s footstep in this place alexander will perhaps be well remember for his work promote the independence of somaliland and i know from my own social medium that many in hargeisa be very grateful for his adoption of their cause i thank he for his service 
 let i end by say that i will work every day in this place to do my utmost to tackle the force of division and darkness during my time here and to do my bit to bring people together because after all as jo cox tell we we have more in common than that which divide we 
 i pay tribute to   the hon member for dudley sonia kumar   for her excellent maiden speech indeed we have hear more than half a dozen excellent maiden speech today several of which touch on the climate crisis and the future of child in our country theme that relate to my amendment i be touch to hear the passion with which all the new members speak about their experience and commitment 
 my amendment require the obr to report on the impact of fiscally significant measure announce by the government on the uk ’s statutory net target the justification for my amendment be that we simply can not separate the economy and the climate they be interlink to deliver the green economic transformation that we so urgently need as reference by hon member speak early every single policy must be align with the uk ’s net target and every government spending decision should be as well 
 it make sense to increase the obr ’s remit on net to specifically consider the impact of climate risk on economic stability and how far policy introduce at fiscal event will reduce or increase these risk fiscal event namely budgets and spending review lock in what be happen in our economy for year to come even generation so it beggar belief that they be not properly take account of climate impact whether those policy be spend on new road subsidy and tax break for oil and gas investment in renewable infrastructure or giveaway like a freeze on fuel duty they all have direct impact on the uk ’s prospect of meet our net target those impact should be make clear and consider explicitly in the policy make paper we need to be think about the impact of today ’s economic policy on the prospect for future generation 
 the cost of fail to take an approach that consider climate impact be eye watering a report by the grantham institute find that climate change damage to the uk be project to triple by and more than double again year later so climate prudence and fiscal prudence be and the same thing give that the obr ’s main duty be to assess the health of the uk economy and the sustainability of its public finance it need to be charge with assess whether fiscal event be reduce or increase climate risk to the economy 
 bring net into the obr ’s mandate be consistent with the government ’s mission indeed in announce its clean energy superpower document labour say that it will add net mandate to all relevant regulator that need it i would argue that the obr be a relevant regulator that need a net mandate that be why i be propose this probe amendment today as other member have mention it would also represent increase transparency around how fiscal policy choice be impact the uk ’s progress towards our net target and help ensure that future government also consider that 
 it be also an important step stone towards a net test which would assess the aggregate climate and nature impact of every fiscal event again this be something that labour commit to in opposition in his winding up remark will the minister comment on whether he be able to ensure that this test be integrate into the legislation that he be propose 
 i hope that labour will use this opportunity to commit publicly to introduce a net test in government and will take a step towards do that by back my amendment 
 thank you madam chair before i talk about plymouth may i celebrate the amazing speech that we have hear this afternoon and pay tribute to the wealth of experience and passion not just on the government benches but across the chamber it be really heartening my hon friend   the member for rother valley jake richards   speak about the spirit that we have all see in the community that we represent and the confidence that he have in that spirit to overcome some of the challenge that we be face as a nation and in our community i completely share that

 today relative child poverty in plymouth moor view be at set against the regional figure of i will not accept rise child poverty because the principle that i live by i believe a lot of us share be this the standard you walk past be the standard you accept if we see something that we know be wrong and   we keep walk we be effectively say we be happy with that situation the hard option be not to walk past but to take action 
 derriford hospital in plymouth serve almost people across devon and cornwall i have meet the nurse paramedic doctor and volunteer who do fantastic work under immense pressure they be people who do not just walk past however the hospital be up against it in june alone there be instance where a patient wait more than hour in a&e. that represent a series of personal tragedy for the patient affect with the new government i will work tirelessly to change that story 
 away from the hospital the beat heart of our city be plymouth argyle football club which be in its season now in the championship make it of the top club in the english football league yet in plymouth many family struggle to afford access to sport for their kid i be a keen footballer and i believe in the power of sport to set young people up for life i will use my platform to improve access to sport in plymouth because a standard where this country have the fine football league watch the world over but our own youngster can not afford to play be not a standard i will walk past i pay tribute to the excellent work that the argyle community trust and the plymouth football boot bank do already to broaden access to sport in plymouth

 navy marines and army personnel have deploy from plymouth for hundred of year the tradition of proud military service run through our city like the writing in a stick of rock now as we find ourselves as a country in another moment of critical international instability plymouth be again a keystone of our national security devonport dockyard be the home port for the frigate survey vessel and amphibious shipping that be crucial for our safety it be also where the submarine that host our nuclear deterrent be maintain and will be for generation to come we be also home to highly skilled small and medium sized enterprise such as msubs maker of unmanned submersible craft use in the most special military project barden bearing and collins aerospace whose cutting edge engineering be integral to the uk ’s modern weapon system 
 from our military institution and our manufacture base to our hospital our football club and our dockyard we stand up and we serve in plymouth we give a lot to this nation but for all this if i can borrow a phrase from a friend and a constant source of advice my hon friend   the member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard plymouth do not get its fair share i will work tirelessly with the government to change that because in labour we respect service and our will be a government of service a government of hope   as i serve my country before in uniform so i will serve my city now in office as i be train to do in the marines i will strive to be a dealer of hope when it come to take action i will remember along with colleague on both side of the house that the standard we walk past be the standard we accept

 coatbridge and bellshill have a rich history of heavy industry but follow year of empty rhetoric and empty soundbite from the previous uk government and the current scottish government there have be a failure to honour the legacy of industry across scotland and deliver a long term sustainable and coherent strategy what step will the secretary of state take to ensure that industrial job in scotland be as much a part of its future as they be of its history

 i agree with the right hon gentleman and congratulate he on his role when he be in the scotland office we hope to emulate much of the work that he do i have meet the european marine energy centre and those involve with tidal resource in his constituency this be critically important to our net ambition and in get to clean power by i be due to meet they when i visit his constituency in the come week and i will make sure that this be top of the agenda 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i congratulate the secretary of state and welcome he to his place i associate myself with his early remark particularly about scotland ’s olympians and paralympians i be delighted to hear the recognition in his answer of the role that our university will play in a new industrial strategy which be go to be vital in scotland particularly in the light of the recent admission about the mess that the scottish national party have make of our economy in scotland that be why i be baffle to see the uk government cut £ from a supercomputer project at the university of edinburgh that have the potential to support research on drug discovery climate change and advanced engineering what discussion do the secretary of state have with the chancellor of the exchequer about the impact of that

 what step he plan to take to support work people in scotland 
 i be proud to be part of a uk government that will oversee the big upgrade of worker right in a generation we have set out the new deal for work people and will write it into law within our day   over reform will deliver on a core part of our growth mission to raise living standard and up to worker across ayrshire stand to benefit from labour ’s plan to make work pay 
 in addition to this government ’s action on the new deal for work people we should ensure that there be a fair deal for those who power our country in the past from my previous work with the coalfields regeneration trust i know the vital difference that that extra support make to those community and their family can the secretary of state give an update on the proposal to end the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme before it be too late 
 mineworker from my own constituency of midlothian from my hon friend ’s constituency and from across our coalfield power this country so i be delighted that our labour manifesto commit to end the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme by conduct a review of the unfair surplus arrangement and of transfer the investment reserve fund back to member i would be delighted to write to my hon friend and to other members represent coalfield seat with a further update in due course 
 i welcome the secretary of state to his position he will know that the scottish government have their own tax raise power he will remember criticise the scottish government for not use they then criticise the scottish government when we do use they nevertheless this generate £ of extra revenue in scotland and tax those who earn more slightly more allow we to tax those who earn slightly less even less than be the case in the rest of the united kingdom what advice would he give the chancellor to mirror those effort in scotland to have a more progressive and fair tax system for our worker 
 the member will be aware that the institute for fiscal studies have say this morning that the tax policy of the scottish government have actually cost scotland money rather than raise it he will know too that this government have have to undertake a comprehensive audit of spending to make sure that we can clear up the mess that we have inherit the £ black hole be real and the treasury reserve have be spend more than time over he will be aware that the focus of the chancellor be on make sure that we fix the foundation and get the economy back on track 
 what step his department be take to support delivery of the borderlands inclusive growth deal

 i congratulate the hon lady on her appointment and i particularly congratulate the secretary of state on his be on your own in this house be a tough gig and he exercise it in exemplary fashion over year but as i find have new colleague bring a whole new set of challenge of its own 
 will the hon lady ensure that the mountain bike centre at the caerlee mill in innerleithen be prioritise there have be a suggestion that the project will not now go ahead in that location it be vital that we have that centre and it be vital that the mill be refurbish 
 the uk government have pledge £ for the mountain bike innovation centre project as part of the borderlands growth deal my official be work closely with all local partner include scottish borders council to progress this project i expect to provide an update on the development of the project shortly 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on the effectiveness of the relationship between the uk and scottish governments 
 i congratulate my hon friend on win glasgow east the people of scotland want their government to spend more time fight for they than fight each other which be why reset the relationship have be a priority for this government and indeed the prime minister i have have numerous productive meeting with scottish government ministers include the deputy minister we have have day of visit across scotland and member of the cabinet have already visit there have be dozen of call between secretary of state and cabinet secretaries i look forward to work with the scottish government to deliver our share priority for the people of scotland 
 scotland ’s official economic forecaster the scottish fiscal commission have say of the scottish budget that 
 much of the pressure come from the scottish government ’s own decision 
 do the secretary of state agree that the scottish government must accept responsibility for the catastrophic state of scotland ’s public finance 
 my hon friend be right the scottish fiscal commission do say that while this new government be clean up the mess of the previous conservative government the snp seem to be clean up its own mess in audit scotland say 
 the scottish government ’s projection suggest that it can not afford to pay for public service in their current form 
 as we have hear the ifs say this morning that snp decision have reduce the tax take rather than increase it this be about treat taxpayer money with respect and be honest about the tough choice we face an honest assessment of the snp government ’s budget be that these problem have be store up for year tough decision have be kick into the long grass and money have be spend recklessly it be a problem of the snp ’s own making and the scottish people will suffer as the snp try to clear it up 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i too start by congratulate both ministers on their appointment to the scotland office i love my time at the scotland office and i know they will be very well support by the department ’s excellent team of official some of whom be in the box today 
 labour plan to end the winter fuel payment take money away from elderly people who have work all their day age scotland have say 
 at minimum a quarter of a pensioner in scotland on the low income or live in fuel poverty will no long receive this vital financial support over the winter month while hundred of thousand more on modest income be go to struggle 
 labour have cut the winter fuel payment across the uk and the snp be do labour ’s dirty work in scotland what do the minister have to say to the elderly scot who be in poverty and struggle with the decision of labour and the snp 
 i welcome the shadow secretary of state to his new post 
 during the inheritance statement a few week ago the chancellor set out how the current government be fix the foundation and try to clear up the dreadful legacy leave by the government of which the hon gentleman be a member the chancellor do not want or expect to make these decision but they have to be make to try to get the finance in balance and to make sure that we can fix the foundation to deliver on our manifesto that be the legacy of the previous government and as i say in my previous answer the snp have make a mess of the public finance over the last year as we see in the scottish parliament yesterday the snp have hell of a mess to clear up and it be scottish pensioner and the scottish people who will pay the price 
 labour be take a leaf from the snp playbook by refuse to take responsibility for its own action this be happen because of choice make by this labour government that have be pass on by the snp in edinburgh labour ’s election slogan be all about change and under this labour government pensioner do not seem to have any change to spare a woman call lesley tell age scotland that the winter fuel payment 
 be literally a life saver for we 
 another person brian tell age scotland 
 i would freeze without it or go hungry
