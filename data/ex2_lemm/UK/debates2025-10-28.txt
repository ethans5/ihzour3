 the citadel of british liberty 
 this house and this chamber continue to play a vital role at the heart of our democracy today i be sure the whole house will want to join i in mark this important anniversary i invite member at be tomorrow to attend the chamber for a commemorative photo to mark the occasion 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion she have have with her counterpart in the united arab emirates on the situation in sudan 
 i join you mr speaker in mark the anniversary of the rebuilding of this chamber and the tribute to democracy 
 i know many people will have concern for family and friend in jamaica in the face of hurricane melissa and i will make a further statement on the uk ’s response during topical question 
 on sudan i strongly condemn the escalate violence in el fasher and the very grave report of civilian casualty and suffering it be estimate that between and civilian be in the city at grave risk of atrocity follow the advance of the rapid support forces i have hold meeting and discussion include at the un general assembly and since then with a series of country include the united arab emirates and member of the quad as we call for a desperately need ceasefire 
 it have be widely report in the press that the united arab emirates be arm the rsf in sudan the rsf be of the war faction in   sudan and it be find by the un to be responsible for crime against humanity include murder torture enslavement rape and sexual violence as per uk government export datum the uk export nearly £ worth of arm to the uae via standard individual export licence between and if the uae be indeed arm the rsf the uk be breach its arm export licensing criterion specifically criteria 1f and importantly those criterion look beyond consider whether uk export weapon ultimately reach sudan and they instead consider the uk ’s international obligation give this what step have the uk government take to verify whether the uae be arm the rsf 
 order this be a very important subject and other members need to come in as well these be mean to be question rather than statement i recognise the importance of this matter and i be sure you be go to come to the end of your question now 
 my apology mr speaker will the uk cease all arm shipment to the uae until it be prove that the uae be not arm the rsf 
 let i make point in response to the hon gentleman ’s question as he will know the uk have extremely strong control on arm export include to prevent any diversion that remain important and we will continue to take that immensely seriously 
 secondly we need all country with influence in the region to push the rsf and the sudanese armed forces to ensure the protection of civilian there be real deep concern about atrocity in sudan include sexual violence and the use of rape as a weapon of war the hon gentleman will be aware of the new work be do through the quad country the us saudi arabia the uae and egypt which have condemn the violence and call for an end to external support for the war party we be press for the urgent implementation of that work 
 as penholder at the un security council for both sudan and the protection of civilian the uk have a special responsibility follow the fall of el fasher and the appalling report to which the foreign secretary refer will she call an emergency session of the security council focus on the protection of terrified civilian in darfur give recent event she talk about the quad that statement be before the appalling event of the last day will she push every country in the quad the us saudi arabia egypt and the uae to act now to prevent further massacre 
 i agree with my right hon friend that sudan the escalate violence and the humanitarian crisis must be on the agenda for the security council we be press for that meeting to take place as soon as possible and to ensure that the protection of civilian be at its heart there be already a humanitarian crisis in sudan with huge number of people at risk of famine even before the escalate violence i also agree on the urgent need to press all party to cease the violence and to ensure that humanitarian aid can get through 
 the news overnight from el fasher in darfur be truly dreadful with evidence of summary execution and undoubted ethnic cleansing give the pivotal role that britain play as set out by the former minister for development   the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds will the foreign secretary urgently review everything that we be do in order to prevent el fasher from become another srebrenica 
 the right hon gentleman be right to raise the grave nature of this crisis and the seriousness of the violence take place in el fasher i agree that we need to put on every possible pressure through both the united nations and directly through the quad we need urgent action to get a ceasefire the humanitarian truce call for by the quad as well as humanitarian aid and the crucial protection of civilian in place he will know that the uk double aid for sudan and have continue to protect that but the aid be unable to get through as long as this terrible fighting be take place 
 as we have hear about a quarter of a civilian include child be trap in the city of el fasher follow a brutal siege that have last month this be a critical moment amidst the world ’s great humanitarian catastrophe in sudan what can the uk government do with our ally to ensure that we get humanitarian exit route out of el fasher for those civilian 
 i agree with my hon friend that get civilian pathway out of the city to safety be urgently need we be urge for a ceasefire to take place we need all side to pull back from this escalating and incredibly dangerous violence we be see the scale of atrocity at risk of take place but the most immediate and urgent thing be to get a safe way out of the city for civilian 
 what step her department be take to support the gaza peace plan 
 what step her department be take to support the gaza peace plan 
 what step she be take to help secure a just and last peace in gaza 
 the ceasefire agreement in gaza as a result of president trump ’s peace initiative be a profound moment of peace and hope but it need to hold and to become a last peace after year of the most horrendous suffering our immediate priority be ensure that unconditional humanitarian aid be flood into gaza where more action be need but we be also work with partner to support the implementation of phase of the peace plan include the disarm of hamas the establishment of a palestinian committee as transitional government and a pathway to state live side by side 
 we be grateful to the united states for its co ordination this must not be a temporary peace that fade away as the foreign secretary say the ceasefire remain fragile with both side accuse of violation and fight on the occupy west bank continue will my right hon friend assure the house that the uk will continue to play an active role in support the peace plan and hold all party to their commitment 
 my hon friend be right give the horrendous suffering that we have see over the last year we need to ensure that the ceasefire hold part of that involve get the humanitarian aid into gaza we be urge for more crossing to be open and for restriction on humanitarian aid to be lift and we be work on some of the crucial next step in conjunction with the us arab state and many other state that have be involve in support the ceasefire include through the disarmament of hamas and the development of new governance arrangement 
 despite the most welcome peace plan we have already see breach in the form of israeli air strike with the restriction of lifesave supply enter gaza what be we do to ensure that sufficient humanitarian aid can get through to end the famine swiftly and that the israeli leadership be hold accountable for violation of international law so that we can finally see an end to the conflict with no more innocent palestinian or israeli life be lose 
 it be important that all side hold to the ceasefire and implement all the step commit to as part of president trump ’s point peace plan that involve get the humanitarian aid in place and maintain the ceasefire we be work with the us and other country to support an effective monitoring arrangement so that there can be a proper process in place to ensure that all side hold to the ceasefire and keep move forward 
 over week into the ceasefire in gaza israeli force be still kill palestinians many be be shoot at as they attempt to return to their home near a yellow line mark by israel a line that israeli medium be increasingly call a new border what will the government do to ensure that this supposedly temporary yellow line do not become a permanent border and effectively cut gaza in half 
 we have be clear that not only can we not divide gaza but that this phase have to be part of the journey to a state solution that include gaza east jerusalem and the west bank that be the only way we will get a just and last peace transition arrangement be set out as part of the point plan but it be really crucial that we not only maintain the original ceasefire agreement the phase but that we keep make progress on the rest of the point in the point plan and the phase 
 thankfully the live hostage have be return to receive medical attention and go back to their family but very sadly the body of the deceased hostage have not all be return that be a key element in this ceasefire treaty what action be the foreign secretary take to ensure   that israel be support and if necessary that the palestinians be support to identify the body of the deceased hostage and that those body be return so that there can be closure for the family 
 the hon member make an immensely important point we will all have see the incredibly moving scene of hostage return after the most horrendous captivity and be return to their family but there be those who have lose love one those whose loved one be take in that barbaric terrorist attack on   october and be still wait to have their remain return i have speak to family whose love one be lose and who have have the remain return but i know how difficult this be and that people need to be able to grieve and pay tribute to their love one we be continue to press for all the hostage remain to be release we have also offer support for example demine capability where there be concern about ordnance that might prevent the recovery of remain 
 how will the united kingdom help to ensure that the gaza peace plan include measure to restore access to clean and plentiful water the main source of fresh water in gaza be the coastal aquifer which be contaminate by sea water sewage and chemical up to of gaza ’s tap water be unfit for human consumption surely the foreign secretary agree that there can be no just peace amidst thirst and squalor 
 the hon member be right to highlight water as a crucial humanitarian aid and support i have speak to tom fletcher who be co ordinating much of the un support and to the egyptian and israeli foreign ministers about the importance of ensure that the crossing be open so that water can be provide and critical infrastructure rebuild that will require financing and my hon friend the middle east minister have already be involve in look at way in which we can finance reconstruction for the long term 
 i thank the secretary of state very much for her response the peace plan can succeed only if hamas be not part of it hamas need to return the dead hostage to the family and they need to be disarm we also need to ensure that they be not carry out summary execution of fellow gazans as they be currently do if we be go to have a peace plan that last hamas need to be remove from the situation we can then have peace 
 the hon member will know that i have always describe hamas as a barbaric terrorist organisation and that remain the case crucially we have see the arab league condemn and reject hamas and join we and other country from across the world in be clear that hamas can play no role in the future governance of gaza or of palestine the uk have particularly be offer support on the decommissioning of weapon and the disarm of hamas a crucial part of the peace process so that palestinians and israelis can live in peace and security 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 as the foreign secretary know hamas continue to terrorise the people of gaza carry out summary execution and deprive people   of aid terrorist tunnel and their infrastructure remain in place so what role be the foreign secretary play in negotiation and dialogue about the elimination of hamas what be the government ’s view on how the international stabilisation force will operate and will the uk be play a role in the board of peace alongside her former leader and friend tony blair 
 the shadow foreign secretary be right to highlight the importance of the disarmament and decommissioning of hamas that need to involve the tunnel as well as weapon and the whole infrastructure of terror that be build up over many year that be why the uk have be propose different way in which we can help in the process of decommissioning and disarm hamas use expertise that we have build up over very many year that will be a central part of maintain this peace process for the sake of a just and last peace the shadow foreign secretary will also know that further discussion be under way about what the governance process need to be for the palestinian committee and the board of peace that be identify as part of president trump ’s point plan those further detail be still be negotiate but we be clear that whatever the arrangement we will continue to play a crucial role in support this peace process 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i echo the foreign secretary ’s word about hurricane melissa and our shared concern for the people of jamaica and the british citizen on that island 
 at this hopeful but fragile moment for gaza all side must fulfil their ceasefire obligation that include hamas which must return the remain hostage body and israel which must reopen all aid route into the strip we must also preserve the condition for a state solution this gaza peace plan be not sufficient to deliver a last peace between viable and secure state last week the knesset vote in favour of annex the west bank a move that would undermine palestinians right to self determination the strong criticism from us secretary of state rubio be notable and welcome so will the foreign secretary work with the american administration to bring forward a un security council resolution that unreservedly condemn that vote and reaffirm the illegality of seize territory by force 
 as i hope i have be clear the future of palestine need to include the west bank east jerusalem and gaza we have always strongly condemn any proposal to annex the west bank as well as illegal settlement in the west bank and it be significant that not only secretary of state rubio but president trump and vice president vance have make clear their condemnation of the proposal for the annexation of the west bank in order to have security and peace for israelis alongside security and peace for palestinians we ultimately need to work towards that state solution state live side by side 
 what step her department be take to support ukraine 
 on friday i welcome president zelensky and the coalition of the willing to a meeting at the foreign office chair by the prime minister to demonstrate our continued support for ukraine in the face of russian aggression since i set out in this house new strong sanction against russia ’s large oil producer rosneft and lukoil i be pleased to say that the us have follow suit and the eu have also introduce further sanction we need to tighten the economic vice on russia in order to bring putin to the table and get a pathway to peace 
 i welcome the uk ’s leadership on the issue of russian sovereign asset what further conversation be the foreign secretary have with her international counterpart to accelerate that work and ensure that russia pay for its illegal war 
 the issue of russian sovereign asset be an extremely important both i and the chancellor have have many discussion with our counterpart particularly in europe but also through the g7 we want to be able to mobilise those sovereign asset in order to support ukraine the eu have set out proposal for reparation loan which we think be the sensible way forward because fundamentally russia need to pay for the damage it be do to ukraine 
 i welcome the foreign secretary ’s comment about russian frozen asset she will possibly agree with i that the us be an increasingly unreliable partner for ukraine can she tell i what discussion she have have with european counterpart about secure ukrainians long range missile with european partner so that they can well defend themselves 
 this issue be discuss as part of the coalition of the willing where nato be present as well as many country from europe and across the world those discussion be about continued military support to ukraine as well as this crucial economic pressure the us package of sanction that have now be announce which be similar to the package that we announce on rosneft and lukoil be extremely important because we need to choke off access to the market for russian oil and gas 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i be pleased yesterday to see the foreign secretary write in the times 
 now be the time for international action to use russia ’s freeze sovereign asset to support ukraine 
 the trouble be that over the past year month and day there have be a lot of talk about use these asset and nothing have happen i know that the foreign secretary know that the last thing that ukraine need be warm word we need action particularly against a background of the russians renew their bombing campaign against civilian in the city the question be if there be go to be a plan when will it happen when will this considerable sum of money be use to rearm and rebuild ukraine 
 i echo my right hon friend ’s comment about the civilian attack that we have see include the most horrendous attack on a kindergarten in ukraine she be right that we need to ensure that these asset be mobilise obviously a lot of that need to be do in conjunction with the european union where many of the asset be currently hold the eu have have a series of discussion and make significant progress through the work do by the eu commission many of the other individual nation be press to go far and we be work closely with they to do so we need to get this investment mobilise to support ukraine 
 the us president be willing to meet the russian president in budapest in spite of the fact that we give assurance in budapest in that memorandum that have since be ignore although that meeting will not now go ahead can the foreign secretary share the government ’s late thinking about future security guarantee for ukraine 
 security guarantee remain an important part of our support for ukraine reason that the coalition of the willing be bring together be to set out what those security guarantee would be that will continue to be the case work with the us to do so the most immediate issue be to ensure sufficient economic pressure particularly on oil and gas to bring putin back to the table while president zelensky have say that he be willing to negotiate and support an immediate ceasefire president putin be simply escalate the war 
 i call the shadow minister 
 russia ’s war in ukraine be fuel by oil export revenue sustain by country refinery in india turkey and china they process and re export russian crude as refined product often to sanction state these country be fuel putin ’s war chest last month president trump call on turkey to halt russian oil import do the prime minister follow president trump ’s approach and demand that his turkish counterpart stop the star refinery and tüpraş from buy russian oil 
 we have these discussion with country across the world urge they to support sanction or to reduce their dependence on russian oil and gas which will reduce those import and help we choke off the supply of russian oil and gas from the market that be why we have also begin to sanction designate refinery not just in russia itself but across the world 
 what assessment she have make of the level of threat china pose to uk interest 
 the former foreign secretary my right hon friend   the member for tottenham mr lammy set out to parliament early this year the full spectrum of threat pose by china include espionage cyber attack transnational repression and support for russia we challenge china robustly in relation to all those threat china be also our large trading partner and a country that we need to work   with intensely on international issue such as climate change we need to challenge china on security and compete and co operate on economic and global affair 
 in her former role the foreign secretary write to the planning inspectorate raise no objection to the chinese super embassy application she do not mention any concern about the secret basement some people describe they as dungeon on the application and she raise no objection to the proximity of the application to key data cable in the city of london in her new role do she now regret her previous lack of action 
 the hon member will know that the government take action to ensure that security measure be in place and we do so through a series of different route he will also know that the planning process be independent and will follow its course 
 when it come to the uk ’s relation with china it be not a simple binary choice between national security and growth national security must always be our non negotiable red line but subject to that do the foreign secretary agree that when there be specific sector where economic engagement with china promote growth we should be open to that 
 my hon friend be right we already have substantial trade with china there be also investment from both the united kingdom and china and we have always be a trading nation that work and trade with country across the globe but as my hon friend say national security must always be the priority that be why wherever there be national security threat we take they immensely seriously and will always challenge china on they 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 speak of challenge china will the foreign secretary comment on the recent threat make by the chinese government towards britain over the embassy application the spy case and taiwan and will she tell the house whether there have be any meeting with the chinese government british ministers jonathan powell and other official in which they have discuss the now collapse spy case have china at any point request that the case be drop and will she now apologise for back the embassy application 
 the shadow foreign secretary have perhaps forget the position that her government have previously take towards china on a range of issue we have make it clear that the planning process in the uk be independent and have to involve the normal planning process as be appropriate we also ensure that security measure be always take immensely seriously and we have a range of different way of do so as for the china case to which the right hon lady have refer i remain extremely frustrated about the collapse of that case and my view remain that the kind of activity that be allege should face the full force of the law that be why i support the strengthening and   updating of the law in this area to make prosecution easy and it be a shame that the right hon lady ’s party take so long to do it 
 what progress she have make on implement the uk eu agreement on gibraltar 
 it be fantastic to visit gibraltar recently for its national day and also to meet my european union and spanish counterpart the agreement reach between the uk and the eu in june be welcome and significant it will mean job investment and stability not just for gibraltar but for the whole region all party have agree to work together to finalise the treaty text and ratify the agreement as quickly as possible and i will update the house in due course 
 like the minister i have the pleasure of be in gibraltar in the summer at the invitation of the government and i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests i see for myself the vital necessity of this deal to secure the economy and the social fabric of gibraltar and in particular the movement of people across the spain gibraltar frontier every day can the minister commit himself to bring the treaty to the house at the possible opportunity so that the detail can be give the full possible scrutiny 
 absolutely the hon gentleman mention the challenge that have exist at the border i have be stick in those queue mr speaker and you may have be as well this deal will mean an end to that and a new positive relationship indeed much will be positive for the economy and for all the people of gibraltar we will bring the treaty to the house as soon as possible as soon as it be finalise and it will go through the normal process parliament will of course be able to debate its term if it wish to do so 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 it be an honour to welcome gibraltar ’s minister to last week ’s annual general meeting of the all party parliamentary group on gibraltar as a cross party group we wholeheartedly welcome the treaty but can the minister assure i that it will produce economic benefit for gibraltarians and an increase in the prospect for tourism 
 i absolutely can assure my hon friend i thank she and the whole appg for their work cross party in support of gibraltar i know of course that this deal be firmly back by the chief minister of gibraltar and his government and will bring important benefit for the economy job and people of gibraltar as she mention tourism we might now see more flight come into gibraltar airport from elsewhere in europe which will be very positive for gibraltar and the region 
 what step she be take to promote a palestinian state 
 the uk ’s commitment to a state solution remain steadfast the uk have provide £ of aid to the palestinian people this year i be proud that on   september the prime minister announce the uk ’s recognition of the state of palestine that be to protect the viability of the state solution and support a path towards last peace meanwhile the uk government be continue to provide technical and financial support to the palestinian authority as they build a viable and effective state of palestine in july we announce £ in technical support to strengthen governance accountability and civic space in palestine i and the foreign secretary remain in touch with our palestinian counterpart 
 slow as it be that be welcome indeed but will the government go beyond suspend new trade deal and actively review exist trade deal with israel include both good and service originate from the illegal settlement to ensure that uk trade policy do not undermine the prospect of palestinian statehood 
 the foreign secretary have already be clear about the importance of a single effective palestinian state which of course include the west bank the hon member have hear from i on a number of occasion about the different trading standard for both israel itself and the occupy territory we of course keep these question under close review but the whole house will appreciate that our focus now need to be on ensure that the ceasefire hold as we move into the point plan and towards the state solution that we all want to see 
 we all welcome a ceasefire and the recognition of a palestinian state but we must now support the palestinian people the head of the united nations humanitarian affair team have say that drive through gaza city be like 
 go through the ruin of hiroshima 
 the people of gaza who have endure this hellish war and survive now face a humanitarian disaster they urgently need aid and the uk along with many other country stand ready to provide it the block to this aid as so frequently have be the case be the israeli authority what step be the government take to ensure that israel stop block this urgently need aid and humanitarian supply and to get they to the people who be desperately in need 
 i want to update the house on this very important question we be see a great flow of aid into gaza that is of course supremely welcome and something that we have long await but it be not yet at the level we would wish to see there be still restriction on that aid go in and as the foreign secretary have be clear on vital crossing remain unopened we continue to engage with all our partner on this and i and the foreign secretary will be travel to the region this weekend to pursue that work 
 what assessment she have make of recent trend in the level of human right violation in hong kong 
 the continued erosion of democratic right and freedom in hong kong be deeply concern last week the foreign secretary submit to this house the government ’s late monthly report on hong kong which detail how national security legislation be diminish hong kong ’s political autonomy the government will continue to champion the right and freedom of the people of hong kong 
 a constituent of mine who now live in haywards heath come to the uk from hong kong under the british national overseas visa route after the deterioration of human right there leave she and her daughter with no choice but to seek safety she be now deeply anxious about report that the qualifying period for settlement and citizenship may be extend i think the whole house can agree that the human right violation in hong kong be abhorrent so what representation have the minister make to her chinese counterpart and can she explain how she will protect bno visa holder who have make their home in the uk 
 indeed we agree that any attempt by foreign government to coerce intimidate harass or harm their critic or other abroad especially in the uk will not be tolerate the government be also strengthen effort to tackle transnational repression include through the introduction of dedicated police training and online guidance to support victim indeed we be commit to the people of hong kong as exemplify by the bno visa route it be our historical and moral commitment and the hon lady will be aware in relation to the change in the immigration white paper that the government will bring forth more detail about the consultation and work in due course 
 pro democracy party in hong kong have disband recently activist joshua wong be rearreste and face further charge under the national security law and jimmy lai remain in prison do the minister agree that the national security law continue to be use to erode the right and freedom of hongkongers and can she confirm that the uk continue to strongly oppose it 
 i can absolutely confirm that we continue to oppose the national security law as outline in the report that the foreign secretary present to parliament last week the hong kong authority continue to apply national security legislation to diminish the city ’s political autonomy and political pluralism include freedom of association freedom of assembly and freedom of information indeed hong kong now rank out of in the world press freedom index enter the red zone for the time this be indeed a very serious situation 
 what diplomatic step her department be take with international partner to help tackle organise immigration crime 
 we know that people smuggle gang work across border to operate their vile trade so we too must work across border to disrupt their supply chain dismantle their network and undermine their business model that be why we be strengthen co operation with other country include through our illegal migration sanction regime the of its kind in the world and we be target the leader of people smuggle gang wherever they be base 
 i thank the minister for his answer i know this be an issue of great concern to my constituent across bexleyheath and crayford follow last week ’s west balkans summit could he provide an update on the measure that be be take to reduce the number of illegal migrant be bring to the uk via the western balkans 
 i thank my hon friend for his very important question and he be absolutely right tackle illegal migration be vital to our strategic relationship with the western balkans last week we announce new sanction against gang leader passport forger and illicit financier many of whom have tie to that region and we be enhance collaboration between our country for example through the border police chiefs forum the expansion of the joint migration taskforce and the deployment of uk border security officer to the western balkans 
 do the minister agree that foreign national convict of serious drug offence in northern ireland should be deport without delay will he ensure that his department work with international partner and prioritise swift removal agreement to stop those involve in organise immigration and drug crime re offend on our street 
 i absolutely agree with the sentiment of the hon lady ’s question she will know that in our year in government we deport over foreign national offender a increase on the previous month we be speed up the early removal scheme so that most foreign prisoner can be deport after serve rather than the previous of their custodial sentence 
 what step her department be take to provide sustainable funding for the bbc world service 
 the bbc world service remain the world ’s most trust international news source and support our national security growth and development objective that be   why we provide a increase in government funding for the world service this year funding allocation for the next year will be announce in due course 
 the institute for global prosperity and creativepower have produce an excellent report on the sheer impact of the world service which reach people globally and be trust by in a key market for the government india—75 people listen to or watch the bbc how will the government maximise the opportunity of the world service which be of our good soft power asset and the good way that we can have conversation with the rest of the world 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question the government wholeheartedly agree with he that the bbc world service be of our strong area of soft power he will be aware that the charter review start next year and we think that be of the good way we can work towards establish the funding stream we be work with the bbc world service on way in which it can innovate to ensure that it reach even far as the most trusted news network on the globe 
 i recently meet senior journalist who have be exile from russia follow putin ’s clampdown on any form of free trustworthy medium despite the huge challenge they be still provide vital accurate reporting for all those in the region who need it most will the minister commit to sustainable funding guarantee for our soft power and continue to support these courageous journalist who be force to move country and be often threaten by rogue state 
 i agree with my hon friend about the work of the bbc world service and we be work with the bbc i be shortly due to visit broadcasting house to see at hand the work it be do particularly its innovative work to deliver and develop its funding programme which will form part of the charter review in response to russian interference in the medium around the world i echo my hon friend ’s support for the journalist who work in the world service who do so much to expose what be happen globally particularly around conflict 
 what step her department be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what diplomatic step she be take to help ensure that humanitarian aid can reach people in gaza 
 alongside our international partner the uk be work to get aid into gaza on the scale need to ease the desperate humanitarian crisis that be take place in recent day the foreign secretary have speak with tom fletcher of the united nations egyptian foreign minister abdelatty and israeli foreign minister   sa’ar about the importance of open more crossing and remove all restriction on aid we be ready to play our full part in provide that aid we have announce £ of humanitarian funding already this year include the £ announce at the peace summit in egypt 
 i fully support the minister in welcome the us broker ceasefire which have enable the delivery of much need humanitarian aid into gaza as the minister be aware the un and its partner have significantly scale up their operation provide essential supply such as food water medical aid and fuel however give that border closure and ongoing political tension continue to obstruct the flow of assistance what step be the government take to ensure unimpeded humanitarian access and to prevent aid be use as a tool of political leverage 
 my hon friend be absolutely right follow the us lead ceasefire agreement and the un ’s work more truck be start to cross the border but that need to be scale up much more rapidly and we need the rafah crossing fully open alongside other aid route we need international non governmental organisation in and able to operate in gaza unimpeded civilian in gaza can not wait 
 the norwegian refugee council say that between and   october request by international ngos to deliver aid to gaza be reject by israel on the ground that the organisation be not authorise to deliver humanitarian aid to gaza yet these trust agency have operate there for decade can the minister tell the people of gaza who be live in makeshift shelter and who be hungry and thirsty what the uk government be actually do to compel the israeli authority to immediately allow aid delivery into gaza 
 we need to see the agreement implement in full the foreign secretary have raise this particular case with the foreign minister of israel we will continue to press for the full flow of aid that need to go in the hon member rightly ask i what i say to the people of gaza i say that we understand the urgency and that the aid need to be in there now we will continue to press those point on the phone and when we both go to the region this weekend

 in what proportion 
 as i have say that will be publish in the annual account of each department 
 i call the shadow minister 
 last week labour vote against our amendment which would have give the house of commons a say on the government ’s reckless decision to surrender £ of taxpayer hard earn money to mauritius for the privilege of give away our own sovereign territory but we still have no certainty from the government about the fate of the vital diego garcia base after the year period what be stop mauritius demand billion more if the uk wish to extend the use of diego garcia for another year would it not be more sensible to save the money ditch the surrender deal and the keep the chagos island british 
 as the hon gentleman know from the many question that i have answer on this issue and indeed the debate we have in this place that secure the bill ’s reading the cost of the agreement in today ’s money be £ and the net present value over year be £ however much he come up with other fantasy figure they be simply incorrect these be verify by the government actuary ’s department if he want to talk about spending and value i will not apologise for spending on our national security and keep this country and our ally safe for comparison he might like to reflect on the fact that the annual payment be less than the cost of the festival of brexit

 my hon friend be an incredibly thoughtful long stand commentator on these issue both he and his family have make a great contribution to uk israeli relation it be an act of great foolishness to prevent he from enter israel and the occupied palestinian territories we call on the israeli government at the time as we do in previous such instance we can not prevent the israeli government from make decision that be not in their interest but that be clearly of they 
 the government ’s position seem to be that communist china can and do pose a wide range of serious threat to the united kingdom but be not a threat itself how can that possibly make sense 
 the right hon gentleman will have hear i set out very clearly the threat that china pose to our national security include those of transnational repression support for russia and espionage he will know that range of threat and that be why it be deeply frustrating that the prosecution have not take place he will also know that china be a trading partner and that we continue to have strong economic relation it be possible for both those thing to be true

 i inform the house that i have not select the amendment i call the shadow chancellor to move the motion 
 i beg to move 
 that this house call on the government to reduce public expenditure to fund the abolition of stamp duty land tax on primary residence purchase by uk resident in order to get britain work to grow the economy and to give people a strong stake in their community through the security of home ownership 
 there come a time in the career of some in this house when they stand too close to the edge when they play with fire and when they fly too close to the sun to continue that astronomical metaphor we have a chancellor who have truly throw herself headlong into a colossal black hole entirely of her making the chancellor have trash our economy and she will blame anybody but herself the office for budget responsibility the legacy the conservative party donald trump brexit whatever it be as long as it be not herself 
 however we on the conservative benches know the clear truth we know exactly what have happen to our economy we know that we have a government who when they be in opposition say that there be no way they would be put up taxis left right and centre yet within short month have do precisely that layer up taxis on business and destroy growth at the same time as talk down our economy then there be the fictitious £ black hole which ironically be debunk as not legitimise by the obr at the behest of the labour party itself we know that labour have borrow colossal amount of money and be due to spend around half a pound more than the plan it inherit 
 what have be the consequence of that it have be elevate inflation we now have the high inflation in the g7 and the international monetary fund tell we that next year we will once again have the high inflation in the g7 the consequence of that through monetary policy be that interest rate will be high for long bear down on those who have mortgage and on business who wish to borrow critically when it come to our burgeon national debt which be soar under this government the cost of service that debt be now run at £ a year rise to £ across this parliament that be twice what we spend on defence indeed if the servicing of our debt be a department of government it would be the large in whitehall none of that money be go on public service it be simply go to pay off the creditor who be owe money as a consequence of the profligacy of the labour party 
 would the right hon gentleman agree that liz truss ’s disastrous mini budget impact on work family up and down this country result in the astronomical mortgage interest rate that they be still struggle to fund 
 we will take no lesson from the labour party when it come to the mismanagement of our economy what i have just set out have lead to a chancellor who have a budget in october last year in which she blow all the headroom and more rebuild it in the spring and be now as we all know head into the budget on   november   with a gap black hole that she will have to fill that be due to economic incompetence and it be cause huge uncertainty 
 i speak to business up and down the country none of they know what to expect they be all fearful about the tax rise that be yet to come and that be down to this chancellor the consequence be that we have the high level of unemployment in year we know that every other labour government in history have leave office with unemployment high than that it be when they come into office in the retail hospitality and leisure sector alone job have be destroy under this government young people be bear the brunt of these policy under the conservatives youth unemployment fall by around under the last labour government it rise by around the same amount and this government be on course to do that too young people be particularly affect because the national insurance change involve not just an increase in the rate but a reduction in the threshold that affect young people who be desperate to get their job and their foot on the career ladder the most 
 do my right hon friend agree that even in such a short period of time this government be show that it be they who can not be trust with the economy and the future of this country be it not time they wake up to the reality 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right we see that in inflation which be run at about twice the bank of england ’s target and about twice the rate that this government inherit from we on the day of the general election within that we see food inflation rocket up at over damage and impoverish the very people that labour claim to want to stand up for 
 do my right hon friend agree that we also see hypocrisy an example would be cabinet ministers who say build baby build while at the same time write letter to the mayor of london try to block home in their constituency 
 as usual my right hon friend make a characteristically poignant point 
 there be another act of damage that this government have create some of the most successful high net worth wealth creator in our country have simply go they have leave it be estimate that have go over the time that this government have be in office socialist will say who care good riddance but they should dwell on the fact that the tax pay by those people be probably equivalent to between a of a and half a people on average earning hard work people up and down our country be pay the price of labour ’s policy 
 there be choice it do not have to be like this we can reduce taxis if we get on top of and control government spending at my party ’s conference we set out £ worth of saving across government include £ in saving across the welfare budget what do the government do when they try to tackle the welfare budget they show we that this be a dad ’s army of a government with a captain mainwaring of a chancellor they be no match even for the rabble behind they 
 we know that we need to have responsible tax cut that mean that they need to be fund and they need to lean into growth that be why we have announce that be we in government we would be abolish stamp duty on primary residence it be of the bad taxis in our tax system the obr state that a increase in stamp duty would lead to a decrease of between and in the number of transaction yet on this government ’s watch the stamp duty due on a home value at £ will have double during their time in office 
 the shadow chancellor be make a powerful speech be he aware that recently in the treasury committee we be give evidence by a range of tax specialist all of whom endorse abolish stamp duty 
 yes and i thank my hon friend for the excellent work that she have be do on the committee particularly when she chair it in the last parliament 
 do my right hon friend agree that this government be not only tax young people ’s job but tax their chance of own a home through the increase in stamp duty and the rumour increase on the capital gain on principal private residence 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the reason that we need to abolish this tax include the fact that it stand in the way of young people get on to the housing ladder to use the word of paul johnson it gum up the entire system of house purchasing in our country he say 
 it may look like a tax on wealthy people who move house but it also act to reduce effective supply for everyone 
 that include time buyer 
 my right hon friend be make an excellent speech do he agree that stamp duty also gum up mobility so that people be unable to move and if they lose their job under this labour government it will be more expensive for they to move to another house 
 my hon friend be exactly right the tax do precisely that it stop people move to where the work be to get well job and further themselves who want to move to place and pay stamp duty and then move to another to pay more stamp duty it do not add up 
 be my right hon friend aware of the study by jackson stops which look at people age and over to see how much abolishing stamp duty would help to move the market along the study estimate that in the year   abolish the tax would allow people to downsize to free up home for family and in the year stamp duty be a real blocker do he agree that that study show the power of this policy 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the tax be a blocker on the aspiration of those who be grow their family and simply want to find a home with more bedroom often they can not find those home because empty nester those whose child have leave home be not prepared to face the huge eyewatere stamp duty involve 
 be not the reality that people can not find home in england because his government fail to build they while in power 
 we build home since and a in the last parliament it remain to be see how many home this government will build 
 another huge advantage of abolish stamp duty be that it will generate more transaction which will benefit more plumber electrician builder designer estate agent surveyor and conveyancer and allow local economy to thrive above all it will increase the effective supply of housing and that mean a fair society and a strong economy 
 the shadow chancellor talk about the huge advantage of his proposal be he aware that someone who own a home worth £ would benefit to the tune of £ this be a tax cut for millionaire be that what he want 
 i have already apprise the hon gentleman of the fact that on his party ’s watch high net worth people have leave the country to the huge detriment of our economy we can not tax our way to growth we have to abolish this tax across the piece and that be recognise by think tank across the political spectrum indeed the institute of economic affairs say 
 abolish stamp duty be the single good reform any government could make to britain ’s tax system 
 the resolution foundation which may be more to labour members taste say of stamp duty that it be 
 of the most economically harmful way of raise revenue 
 that be a simple fact 
 do my right hon friend the shadow chancellor accept that the housing market be virtually stagnant it be moribund the house and flat that we want in this country be not be build and of the barrier be that the cost of stamp duty be so high that individual do not want to pay it 
 my hon friend be absolutely right i have already set out the estimate from the obr that a increase in stamp duty mean a to reduction in transaction it be a horrendous and terrible tax and it remain to be see whether labour member choose to defend it 
 the hon member for welwyn hatfield andrew lewin   talk about millionaire get a tax cut but we be talk about young family get on the ladder do my right hon friend the shadow chancellor agree that while labour member engage in the politic of envy we will always engage in the politic of hope 
 my hon friend be absolutely right as paul johnson formerly of the institute for fiscal studies i quote he early say this tax 
 also act to reduce effective supply for everyone 
 right across every age and every section of the income scale 
 if only the parliamentary secretary to the treasury   the hon member for swansea west torsten bell i see he be not in his place who be a former director of the resolution foundation could show some backbone and at least agree with his former self and the quote that i read out from the resolution foundation the fact be clear the government should support this motion today if they believe in growth a fair society and a strong economy 
 as we approach the budget through a period of great uncertainty the chancellor face a clear choice a choice between still high taxis and control spending and get taxis down between continued anaemic growth and get the size of the government under control between destroy job and get people off benefit and into work and between do the right thing for our country and simply duck the challenge the opposition know what must be do even at this late stage to save our economy perhaps even the chancellor herself know deep in her heart that we be right yet be it not the truth that face with the serried rank of obstinate delusion array behind she she be just too weak to act no plan no backbone no wonder that under this government we be star into the abyss 
 i thank the shadow chancellor for open today ’s debate with characteristic theatricality i know that opposition member be desperate to forget their time in office they be desperate for we all to forget the damage that they cause to the economy and to public service on their watch surely however they can not have forget how the budget process work so they will know that no treasury minister particularly in the week immediately before a budget will speculate on tax change any decision on tax will be take at the budget by the chancellor in the usual way—[interruption i see surprised face among opposition members but i remind they that that be how the budget process work they will know that the obr produce a forecast and the chancellor will take decision in the round base on that forecast when she present the budget to this house on   november 
 notwithstanding those limitation on what i and indeed any minister can say i will seek to address some of the idea that the opposition have try to raise with this motion let we be honest stamp duty be hardly a popular tax move house and buy a home be a complex and often stressful process and stamp duty must be pay at a point when most people probably feel   they have enough to worry about already if there be a cost free way to get rid of stamp duty i would not expect long queue of people line up to keep it but there be of course no cost free way of do so figure show that the tax raise £ in 
 at this government ’s budget we make change to stamp duty to help to give time buyer and other people who be buy a home to live in an advantage over those who be buy or further home if an opposition party propose get rid of a tax that raise nearly £ a year it need a plan for do so be a credible opposition mean propose thing that could actually work frankly the motion expose the current conservative party ’s total lack of seriousness and its complete failure to learn any of the lesson of its time in office 
 the chief secretary to the treasury indicate that if there be a plan to fund the proposal he would back it the shadow chancellor have clearly set out that we do have a plan to fund it so will the chief secretary back it 
 the right hon lady be attempt to bring some humour to the chamber by pretend that the opposition have some kind of a plan for their proposal to call their motion half baked would be not to go far enough in fact it show the recklessness in their approach to the economy it may be halloween on friday but the ghost of liz truss be here today because the economic recklessness that the former prime minister embody be back in front of we in this chamber we have a half bake motion from the opposition build on the wholly unworkable premise of more unfunded tax cut year on from their disastrous mini budget they have learn precisely nothing 
 rise 
 i will be interested to hear the right hon gentleman ’s link 
 i will be interested to hear what the minister intend to do to un gum the housing market i think he will accept that it be an important part of our economy and he say that he be very keen on growth so what will he do to un gum it and what do he say to those legion of tradespeople electrician plumber and kitchen fitter who be all look to the government to provide they with some relief in the month ahead 
 i would say to everyone who work in build home that labour be the party that be get on with building we be make change to the planning system to get those home build despite his attempt to make a link to my previous comment i notice that the right hon gentleman do not address that fact that this motion be entirely half baked it be a genuine shame for british politic that we have an opposition who think that they can put forward a motion like this for serious debate in the house of commons to be fair the conservative party be steep in century of be in opposition and in government but it have become deeply unserious by put forward motion such as the today the motion simply say that the   conservatives plan to abolish stamp duty be to reduce public expenditure that it be that be the sum of their plan 
 the minister be right to say that the opposition have not be clear about how they would fund this tax cut but there be some clue the shadow chief secretary to the treasury   the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller tell a fringe event at the tory party conference that we should look at the australian system of state pension and essentially a means test state pension do my right hon friend share my concern that under the tories the state pension would be under threat 
 my hon friend be right to point out that the state pension would be under threat be the conservatives to win the next general election he be also right to draw the house ’s attention to comment make by conservative members at their party conference they may think that people be not listen to what they say at those conference fringe meeting but we get the report so we know exactly what they say 
 from their recent conference we know that they think that they can find some £ through cut to public spending as the shadow chancellor say but let we look at the detail at least half of those fantasy saving come from a welfare plan that amount to a menu with no price a list of measure that the conservatives say will raise £ in total but with no breakdown whatsoever of how in june last year just as they be on their way out of downing street they say that they could cut £ from the welfare bill now they have double that without explanation frankly if the shadow chancellor think that he have any credibility on this matter he be sadly mistaken he be far from the good person to make this argument give that he personally oversee the big increase in benefit spend in decade during his time as the secretary of state for work and pensions 
 the minister be in no position to lecture on reduce the size of the state give that when labour attempt to reduce the welfare bill it march all of its mps up the hill only to march they down again when it buckle under the pressure from its own back benchers 
 as member from both side of the house know we be determined to get people back into work because that be the way to bring the welfare and benefit bill down and to make people well off what be not the right thing to do for this country be to follow the conservative plan for £ of cut for which they have no plan and that would represent nothing less than a return to austerity if their £ be to come from cut to public service that would mean few nurse cut every police officer in the country twice and cut the entire armed force funnily enough none of that detail be in their motion today 
 to have propose the motion be a shame for british politic because with the conservative long history they really should know well be it to be the greens plaid cymru or reform propose policy with little regard for the consequence i would not be surprised   because they have never have a chance to implement they but to see the party that be in charge for year act this recklessly show just how far it have fall 
 the minister be always generous with his time and always have a smile which be a welcome thing in this chamber government spending this year be approach £ but minister could not save £ because of their own back benchers be it his complete failure to make even the small saving on that monumental budget that make he find it impossible to believe that other would have the will to do so 
 what i find it impossible to believe from the conservatives be that they now have a shadow chancellor who claim to have a plan for £ of welfare cut when he himself preside over the big increase in welfare spending in decade when he be the secretary of state for work and pensions that be the record that give he no credibility whatsoever in this debate 
 in their motion the conservatives also claim that they want 
 to get britain work to grow the economy and to give people a strong stake in their community 
 yet they spend their whole time try to claim that britain be break they have join the rank of those who be try to co opt our flag for their own end by claim that it be in tatter i can not believe that so many who claim to be proud of our country be so willing to talk it down our country be not break we be a great country fill with great people and great business we be willing to roll up our sleeve and work together for a great future however it be clear that many people across our country feel stuck under the last government our economy stall our public service be starve and opportunity dry up 
 the minister be always generous with his time i thank he for give way and i be always smile in the chamber as   the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart   will know conservative members seem to be suffer from collective amnesia will my right hon friend remind i if the national debt go up or down under the last government interruption 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to the conservatives record interruption in i think the national debt be about of gdp but it be about by the time that they leave office 
 order member on both side of the chamber be have their own conversation on the side i can not hear the minister and everybody want to hear the minister 
 thank you mr speaker i be confirm what i think everyone in the chamber know about how bad the previous government ’s record on the economy be we know why that record be so bad it be because previous ministers fail to invest and we know that investment be the fuel for our economic engine that be why we be take a different approach 
 on help ministers with amnesia do the right hon gentleman acknowledge that there be a pandemic that require a huge amount of intervention or be he claim that he would not have support so many people during that period 
 speak of amnesia a lot of conservative have forget liz truss and be not prepared to talk about the impact she have 
 speak of amnesia would the right hon gentleman like to remind the house what the deficit be in when we form a government 
 be you bear by that time minister 
 i have definitely be bear by that time mr speaker i be do my math very rapidly but i can be confident in say that i seem to have quite lose my way after your intervention mr speaker but let i return to the main thrust of the argument that i be make a few moment ago 
 we be a serious government who be a serious partner for the private sector which be why we be invest in thing that will get our country move again it be early day the damage that the tories do will take time to unpick and there will be more difficult decision ahead but since we come to power this government have announce £ of new investment commitment create ten of thousand of job the bank of england have cut interest rate time mean that someone on a tracker mortgage of just over £ be already around £ a month well off 
 we have cut red tape and change planning regulation so that we can deliver new home over the course of this parliament we have act to accelerate the construction of nearly new home which be previously stick we be the fast grow g7 economy in the half of this year most telling of all since the general election real wage have rise by more than they do in the year of the conservative government 
 the conservatives answer to the nation ’s challenge be always the same austerity they want to cut spending increase debt and accept decline in contrast we will never accept austerity and we will never gamble with the public finance
