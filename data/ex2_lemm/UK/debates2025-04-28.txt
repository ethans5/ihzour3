as have be mention only football league club be represent by a conservative mp and that be the mighty bromley football club my effort to bring about a chant of you ’ve get the only tory across opposition stand in league be ongoing and i will keep the house inform of how well they proceed 
 hayes lane the club ’s ground since stand proudly in my constituency bromley fc be a football fan ’s dream we have go from strength to strength in recent year earn promotion to the conference south league in the club be crown champion year later we climb the national league reach the fa trophy final in and earn promotion in but our rise do not stop there bromley face ryan reynolds ’s wrexham at wembley for a shot at the fa trophy in it be an amazing day and that i remember well while we may not have have deadpool we do have michael cheek cheeky the maradona of bromley who secure the silverware with the game ’s only goal i love michael cheek and i congratulate he on be name league player of the year last night it be well deserve last year a moment year in the making arrive as bromley be promote to the english football league for the time in its history 
 why be this story relevant bromley ’s football dream be realise thank to sound management private investment and raw talent not a state regulator and i congratulate robin stanton gleaves mark hammond hammo and andy woody woodman on all that they have do for the club as a ravens fan when i look at labour ’s supposedly independent football regulator   i have to ask whether it would help bromley fc or aspire club like it and in its current state the answer be a resound no when the bill be propose it be propose with the right intention it would protect cherished community club from bad owner and would prevent a breakaway european super league however labour ’s regulator be morph into a meddling costly political deadweight for english football because the regulator will be neither independent nor impartial this be cronyism at its bad 
 supporter of low league football club know the score relegation all but confirm millionaire financier abandon desperately cling on to former glory leaky at the back midfield absent not much go on up top leadership completely out of their depth but enough about the conservative party despite the conservatives attempt to turn this debate into a game of face i have a serious point 
 in business partner yasuaki kagami and george synan become majority shareholder at plymouth argyle which have be shortlist to host game at the world cup have england ’s bid be successful it be not of course so their interest in the club collapse finance be withhold and argyle with eye on the premier league be relegate to the championship then league and then league in the space of year they be on the brink of insolvency before they be rescue by james brent 
 english football club such as argyle should never become cash cow for vulture such as kagami and synan our large club should never become money launder operation for oligarch tie to murderous dictator our football club be the beat heart of our community around which local economy thrive identity friendship and rivalry be forge and our culture be export 
 i broadly welcome this bill for the regulation of ownership that it will introduce but there be no mention of slavery or human right in the ownership test will the government answer whether they consider those issue important in the fit and proper ownership of club 
 i have more point it be unfortunate that the government vote down an amendment from the lords that would have reduce gambling advertisement and sponsorship in english football there be an obvious opportunity here to protect our young people from a toxic industry that deliberately prey on the vulnerable i do not often give too much credit to arsenal alumnus   but i know that paul merson would have want this will the government tell i why they vote down that amendment 
 i welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important piece of legislation and what it will mean for football fan in hertford and stortford thousand of   whom travel week in week out to premier league game in london to which we be ably link by our rail service 
 before i turn to the specific measure in the bill i would like to touch on why football be so important to community such as mine since my election in july last year it have be a pleasure to visit and watch a number of the non league club across hertford and stortford and to meet some of the manager coach player and volunteer who keep they go and bring our community together so many player at non league club such as those go on to much large team in the future too we can not overestimate the importance of grassroots football in our community and i pay tribute to bishop ’s stortford football club sawbridgeworth town fc hertford town football club and ware football club i particularly pay tribute to ware and sawbridgeworth which have just avoid relegation in the late season 
 i would also like to briefly update the house on the birthday of john staines some member may remember that i have raise the topic of hertford town football club ’s drive to get people down to their game against flackwell heath to mark john ’s birthday follow more than year of dedicated support for the club of they as a volunteer it be heartwarme to see our community turn out to recognise john ’s contribution to the club and i be pleased to report that we see just over people turn out in hertford to do so 
 it have become apparent in recent year that we need to protect our game and i applaud the bill ’s aim of protect and promote the sustainability of english football in the interest of fan and the local community that football club serve i welcome its core objective of ensure sound club finance and systemic financial resilience and safeguard club heritage in particular the creation of an independent football regulator be most welcome deliver on this government ’s manifesto commitment to protect club and empower fan 
 in the time i have leave i want to mention quick point that be raise with i by some of our non league club ahead of this debate which i would be grateful if the secretary of state could address club have highlight the disparity in contract regulation between non league and professional football currently non league player can be offer a full time contract only at the age of while in professional football player can be contract at to ensure fairness to our grassroot club will the secretary of state consider equalise the age at which non league club and professional club can offer full time contract to player in the future 
 it have be my absolute pleasure to spend time speak to our local non league club i know that our resident be immensely passionate about football and it be fantastic that this bill be be bring forward to put our fan right at the heart of that great game 
 i completely agree with my hon friend ’s comment and i pay tribute to the work of blackburn rovers in their community 
 we be probably all aware of the example of everton and manchester united both be up to their ear in debt while either building or plan to build stadium that cost between £ and £ if we look low down the league the sum be still eye watering york city lose £ last season salford city lose £ and stockport county lose £ it be difficult to see how at some stage without regulation more and more club will not simply go to the wall the financial precarity in football be such that it leave the club open to bad actor seize on their financial vulnerability to offer a route to potential success i be of course refer to dirty money and the pernicious practice of sportswashe by dubious owner who see club ownership as a pr vehicle to airbrush their misdeed and human right abuse to reconstruct their reputation and exert geopolitical influence it be deeply regretful that this odious and morally corrupting practice have be allow to establish a foothold in our game since roman abramovich come to england as the owner of chelsea football club with dirty money from russia he be find to have fund or donate over £ to illegal settlement expansion in the west bank 
 the other issue i want to raise be around agent fee in to over £ be pay by premier league club to agent and facilitator and in the football league over £ be pay in agent fee some agent be act on behalf of both the player and the club and receive remuneration from both if that be not a conflict of interest or a potential bribe i do not know what be i strongly encourage the government to look at this and try to stop as much money go to agent and get it back into grassroots football 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to help support send child not in full time education 
 we be committed to reform the special educational need and disability system we be also act now through the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill child not in school register and a duty on local authority to provide advice to eligible family we will help local authority identify and support these child to achieve and thrive 
 i recently meet a constituent at my surgery whose son have miss out on more than hour of education that be despite her attempt to find special educational provision for her son in different school across our region she be now very concerned because the council have say that he be at risk of criminal exploitation and can not be leave alone will the minister meet i to discuss this case and also provide reassurance that this government will ensure that vulnerable send student get the educational provision they deserve 
 of the ministerial team will be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss the important issue that he raise all child be legally entitle to a full time education which be important for their educational progress their wellbeing and their wide development it be the local authority ’s responsibility to arrange suitable education when it be not already in place and i encourage my hon friend to contact his local authority to discuss this matter far 
 i have meet child who have experience significant trauma who be not in full time education and who be support through the adoption and special guardianship support fund on   april the government announce that that funding would continue which be welcome however on   april it be announce that funding would be reduce by cap the support at £ per child for the academic year that reduction will be devastating for family and therapy provider do the minister agree that without proper funding enable specialist support we risk placement breakdown and increase pressure on already stretch mental health service 
 this government be commit to break down barrier to opportunity so that every child can succeed and thrive the under secretary of state for education my hon friend   the member for lewisham east janet daby   who be responsible for this area have commit in the house to £ of funding for this programme she will have hear the question and will respond in due course 
 i call the shadow minister 
 have tell this house in answer to an urgent question from   the hon member for twickenham munira wilson   that the adoption and special guardianship support fund would continue ministers somehow do not manage to mention that the funding per child would be cut by they then slip that out during recess meanwhile ministers will spend £ on advertising can they at least agree to publish the impact assessment on cut what be available from this fund 
 as i say this government be commit to break down barrier to opportunity we will take no lecture from the conservatives they have absolutely no plan for education other than to reintroduce private school vat reduction interruption what 
 when will the government publish the impact assessment 
 we will respond in due course to those issue 
 what recent assessment her department have make of the adequacy of local authority funding for send 
 what step she be take to ensure sustainable funding for send provision in school 
 this labour government inherit a lose lose lose send system in the word of the tories last education secretary but we have invest an additional £ in high need budget and £ to pave the way for pupil with send to achieve and thrive in mainstream school just last week in derbyshire i meet family with experience of the send system who have be badly fail by the tory county council this labour government know that the send system need far reach reform to deliver well life chance for all our child 
 the secretary of state be well aware that the east riding of yorkshire receive the low level of funding for child with send and i hope that the current review give the government an opportunity to rectify that on a wide point parent like i often look ahead to the school holiday with a sense of dread because the provision for out of school activity for child with send be so limited and what be available be often expensive as part of this review will she look at what more can be do by local authority to provide opportunity for young people with send outside term time 
 i know that the hon gentleman care deeply about this issue and bring real passion and determination to try to ensure that all child include those with send be give the support that they require for the purpose of wide reform i will look carefully at the funding issue that he have identify and also at the issue of broad support parent have the right to request wraparound holiday childcare place and we update the relevant guidance this year we want to ensure that all child receive the support that they need and that apply to childcare for send child age up to 
 the last government leave send education throughout the country in crisis the national audit office find that there be no consistent improvement in outcome from onwards i see that   at hand when i meet calder valley parent of send child at highbury school in rastrick where i see committed parent and teacher struggle with a fail system what will my right hon friend do to fix the mess that the last government make of the system 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his passion and interest in this subject let i also congratulate he on his effort in yesterday ’s london marathon he be not only a brilliant advocate for child but a fantastic runner he be right to say that this labour government have inherit a terrible mess when it come to support with child with send we want all child to have the support that they need in order to achieve and thrive and as part of the wholesale reform that we will deliver we will listen to parent child stakeholder and school to ensure that we get the system right for child and deliver well outcome and that issue such as those identify by my hon friend be a thing of the past 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer to my hon friend   the member for bridlington and the wolds charlie dewhirst but each child with special educational need in the east riding receive £ whereas in camden the figure be £ i be sure she agree that a child in camden do not have time the need of a child in the east riding will she undertake to ensure as part of the review that in principle we will have fair funding for child throughout the country with educational need relate to for instance dyslexia or autism at the end of that process as oppose to where we sit now 
 the right hon gentleman bring real expertise to this issue and i know that he also care deeply about ensure that we get the system right for child with send our allocation be make on the basis of the funding formula that be already in place we intend to look carefully at all these matter as part of our wide reform of the send system but as the right hon gentleman will appreciate they be complex and it be important for any change to be make in a way that be responsible and focus on well outcome for child 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 the crisis in the send system be a source of distress for parent and child who have to fight far too hard for support and for professional work in local authority and school who face an extremely challenging funding situation do the secretary of state agree that in this context blame parent and gps for the increase in the number of send diagnose as some reform party politician have do in recent day be both inaccurate and insulting and that solve the send crisis require listen to parent and professional rather than denigrate they 
 i could not agree more and i pay tribute to my hon friend and the other member of her committee for the important work that they be do through their inquiry on this matter we look forward to hear more from they in due course 
 my hon friend be entirely right just day before the local election the comment of   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   will have send shiver down the spine of so many parent throughout the country his comment be completely irresponsible and totally wrong this government be focus on well outcome for all child include those with send 
 what step she be take to ensure that non levy pay employer receive apprenticeship funding 
 labour be transform the tories fail apprenticeship levy into a growth and skill levy the government offer a range of support to non levy pay employer include assistance with training cost and payment to take on young apprentice new foundation apprenticeship in construction will unlock opportunity for up to young people apprenticeship participation achievement and start have already increase under labour and we be go far and fast for growth 
 as the minister will know employer in northern ireland pay substantially into the apprenticeship levy but have no direct access to it what step be the minister take to enable they to receive direct benefit through the levy so that we too can enjoy the benefit of which she speak in her answer when she be have a dig at the conservative party 
 as i be sure the hon member know skill be a devolved matter and funding in the devolved administration remain the responsibility of those government however we will continue to engage with they as we deliver the levy fund growth and skill offer for england 
 my constituency of tipton wednesbury and coseley in the black country be a proud manufacturing area and the birthplace of the industrial revolution will the minister please tell i what she be do to increase the uptake of manufacturing and engineering apprenticeship across the country and in the west midland 
 too many young people have be lock out of access apprenticeship opportunity and apprenticeship start by young people under fall by almost between and under the previous government we be develop new foundation apprenticeship to give more young people a foot in the door at the start of their work life 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the british chambers of commerce have say that the lack of clarity around the future of the apprenticeship levy be create uncertainty among business and be worrying and destabilising employer in university be worried about plan to cut high apprenticeship and the institute of chartered accountants have say that plan to axe level apprenticeship will lead to work leave the uk altogether will ministers agree to the proposal from the campaign for learn for a   skill immigration worker test to be carry out before any cut be make to level apprenticeship so that we do not go from simply invest in british worker to just import worker from other country 
 we be very excited about what this government be achieve for young people in our apprenticeship scheme there be of course tough choice to take on how funding should be prioritise to generate opportunity for young people so that they can make a good start in fulfil career go forward the department have receive a wide range of representation regard level apprenticeship and we will communicate our decision go forward we be absolutely committed to make sure that people be on the right apprenticeship course and that we have a wide range of apprenticeship available 
 what step her department be take to support the mental health and wellbeing of school student 
 this government be commit to break down barrier to opportunity and help pupil to achieve and thrive in education we be provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school so that every child and young person have access to early support to address problem before they escalate 
 in my constituency i be in touch with a family of a child who have complex need and severe mental health issue who have not be able to go to school for a whole year the child ’s deteriorate mental health need be not be meet because they have not be give a school that fit their child and adolescent mental health service assessment have the minister make an assessment of how the department might well avoid situation such as that which leave child without the service they need 
 we will deliver on our commitment on mental health to make sure that it reach every child i be very happy to meet the hon gentleman to discuss the specific case that he raise 
 admission to acute medical ward for child and young people with mental health concern increase by between and give that gain parity of esteem between mental health and physical health be so important will the minister update we on the talk with the nhs about ensure that there be mental health provision and support in every school 
 i know my hon friend be a real champion of these issue we will recruit an additional new mental health staff to treat child and adult as well as open new young futures hub which will provide support for child and young people across the country the department also provide a range of guidance and resource on promote and support pupil mental health and wellbeing and i thank he for his question 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 addictive algorithm that serve up harmful content be fuel the child ’s mental health crisis as well as worry behaviour both inside and outside the classroom with almost third of child have a social media account by the end of year will ministers commit to work with their counterpart in the department for science innovation and technology to support the liberal democrats amendment to the data use and access bill which would stop tech company trade on our child ’s attention by raise the digital age of datum consent from to so that they can not process child ’s datum to feed toxic algorithm without parental consent 
 protect child from online harm be a cross government priority and ofcom ’s draft code of practice for child safety set out why it be so important that we continue with our effort to protect child from july the child online safety regime will be fully in force and ofcom will be able to take robust enforcement action against those fail to comply with the child safety duty i know the dsit secretary of state will want to look very closely at any future further proposal 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of increase school cost on the adequacy of school funding for 
 what estimate she have make of the potential impact of increase in employer ’s national insurance contribution on the number of teacher employ in school 
 what estimate she have make of the potential impact of increase in employer ’s national insurance contribution on the number of teacher employ in school 
 what estimate she have make of the potential impact of increase in employer ’s national insurance contribution on the number of teacher employ in school 
 the tories leave a trail of devastation across our school with building crumble and teacher leave in their drove through take tough decision at the budget to fix the foundation labour have be able to increase school funding by over £ as a result there be a forecast of £ of headroom in school budget nationally the tories only plan be to cut school budget to restore private school tax break we be get on with the job of deliver for child 
 many head teacher and support staff who be worried about school budget have be in touch with i i recently have a letter which be send to the secretary of state from a therapist in a school say 
 i have recently be inform that i be be make redundant most of the school in the trust be make cut in order to stay afloat staff that be be cut or have hour reduce be teach assistant social emotional and mental health staff and other support staff 
 how would the minister answer the question pose by my constituent who be be make redundant who ask 
 why have labour vote for unfunded pay rise and national insurance tax increase if they can not support school with the cost 
 of these proposal 
 the government be commit to support teacher to stay in the profession and to thrive which be why we accept the schoolteacher pay review body recommendation in full implement a pay award that mean that teacher and school leader have have a combine increase of over the last year we really need some humility from conservative members about where these problem stem from 
 headteacher be warn that the gap in funding to cover the chancellor ’s job tax be equivalent to lose more exist teacher than the government be plan to recruit i have hear that message loud and clear from headteacher on my recent school visit and unfunded pay award will just make this bad why be the education secretary not stand up for our school 
 this labour government have make some tough decision to fix the foundation of our economy and our public service we make no apology for do what the last government fail to do while in office the extra money from national insurance contribution mean we can protect key educational priority the conservatives should be honest what would they cut to pay for our school 
 can the minister solve this equation vat be push more student into the state sector and increase in national insurance be squeeze staff budget yet the government say their ambition be to improve school standard and staff retention how do that add up 
 this be just scaremongere from the conservative party because the tories have no plan for the future of our education system they have no plan to deliver high and rise standard their only education priority be to hand tax break back to private school which mean cut free breakfast club cut school base nursery and cut school building 
 i have be contact by school in my old bexley and sidcup constituency that be outraged that labour ’s tax rise be force they to cut resource and staff while the government demand that teacher do more teacher tell i that as a proud trade unionist she have always vote labour but feel completely betray she say 
 labour have make the situation in school 10x worse let student and teacher down 
 she be right be she not labour have betray teacher student and school 
 school funding be increase by over £ compare with mean that core school budget will total over £ this year the last government sit on the pay review   recommendation leave it for this government to clean up the conservative party ’s record on education be dismal school building be crumble and teacher be leave the profession this government be focus on return education to the centre of public life 
 i recently meet student councillor aadam olivia adam and remy at fixby junior and infant school they give i a guide tour of the school and highlight how the playground be long overdue for an upgrade but the school be face increase cost to resurface it on behalf of the student council can i ask the minister what additional funding and support be available so that pupil can access high quality play area 
 we absolutely support child to have the ability to play and that be really important in school as well we understand that some school require additional support we be work closely with the sector to ensure the good outcome for all child not just some child as the previous government focus on 
 local conservative council candidate in mansfield say on the doorstep that they want well funding for our school however in the pursuit of restore private school tax break which of these measure do the minister think the tories would cut new teacher speech and language support mental health counsellor career advice or work experience 
 rise 
 order i can save the minister that question be about opposition policy which be not her responsibility 
 i be deeply concerned about the funding of howden le wear primary school in my constituency after year of real term cut it be now make teaching assistant redundant i will write to the minister on that to seek her support but the elephant in the room be that the pay of the chief executive of the multi academy trust of which it be a member have increase £ over the last year take it to £ that be the equivalent of teaching assistant which do she think would be well ceo or teaching assistant 
 executive pay must be justifiable and must reflect the responsibility an individual take on alongside local retention and recruitment need we engage with trust on level of executive pay and i would be more than happy to discuss the matter far with my hon friend 
 i be deeply concerned about prudhoe community high school in my constituency which be open and a half year ago after be build under a conservative secretary of state and conservative education department unfortunately in february this year crack be discover in the structure and the student be be teach in washington which be quite a significant journey can i ask the minister to not only back the student and staff at prudhoe community high school but have an urgent investigation into how   the school get into this state do she agree that after year in charge the legacy of the tories in west northumberland be crumble 
 i absolutely recognise the challenge prudhoe community high school be face in particular those due to sit their gcse and a level exam i wish good luck to they and to all young people who over the easter holiday have be work very hard towards their exam official have be work closely with the school to ensure they be accommodate in the right way but my hon friend raise a really important point about how a school build year ago be crumble and indeed all the school across the country that be crumble after year of a tory government that do not prioritise education 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 not only have the education secretary introduce a bill to this place that will destroy standard in english school but now she have break her promise on national insurance contribution compensation and be leave school in an impossible funding situation every mp have hear from headteacher who be stress beyond belief at how to manage their funding can the secretary of state guarantee that worry headteacher up and down the country will not have to make teacher redundant because of her broken promise yes or no 
 the right hon lady have a firm grip on anonymous briefing in the paper than on the detail of the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill she be more focused on petty political game in westminster than on improve the life of child and family up and down the country the bill will get qualified teacher in front of classroom it will teach a cutting edge curriculum it will drive down the cost of send child to school it will provide breakfast club for child who need they it will stop vulnerable child fall through the crack it be a single most important piece of child protection legislation in a generation the conservatives vote against it they can snipe from the sideline we will get on with deliver change 
 let we have another marathon runner to ask the next question 
 what step she be take to help increase the number of teacher train in the provision of send education 
 improve the quality of teaching be the good way to drive up standard in school which be why the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill will get expert teacher in front of the classroom drive high and rise standard we be improve teacher training so that teacher be equip to properly support pupil with send to achieve and thrive but we know there be more to do we be pave the way for far reach reform through our plan for change 
 i thank the minister for her reply excellent teacher in my constituency both expert in special educational need provision set up an organisation call the mighty oak initiative whose work be focus on help young people with special educational need who be not attend school at the moment either not fully or at all its work be exemplary would the minister meet mighty oak and myself to look at how we can support the organisation learn from what it do and apply it elsewhere so that young people with special educational need can get the good out of their educational experience rather than be leave on the sideline 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and congratulate he on be on his foot after run the london marathon we be absolutely committed to improve attendance rate of all child but particularly those with send and to address challenge in the school setting to ensure that child have the support to achieve and thrive i would be happy to engage with he on any good practice in this area that can support we in our endeavour 
 in derby like in so many community across the country we face a lack of available send school placement with appropriately train teacher in alone derby city council spend £ on placement outside the city it be wrong that pupil and their family be not get the support that they need in their community will the minister outline what step the government be take to increase the availability of send school place in derby in the east midland and across the uk 
 the secretary of state have a useful and interesting visit to a school in derbyshire   to see for herself where progress be be make or unfortunately where not enough be be make to support child with send we know that high quality teacher training particularly in send be vital to ensure that every teacher be a teacher of special educational need and disability we will continue to work to ensure that local authority deliver on their obligation to all the child in their local area but particularly those with special educational need and disability 
 there be significant gap in the understanding of autism profile from teacher and school support staff the evidence show that there will be massive benefit in school attendance and educational performance if that understanding can increase i urge the secretary of state and the team to ask the specialist neurodiversity group that they have set up to look specifically at initial teacher training to see whether more autism focus element can be add 
 this work be already ongoing i recognise what the right hon gentleman be say we want to ensure that every teacher get that high quality training from their initial teacher training to their year in a school to ensure that they be confident and able to teach child of a whole range of ability we be determined to have the right number of teacher with those skilled professional qualification so that they be able to thrive in the profession and indeed to support child to thrive too 
 what step she be take to increase the number of construction skill training opportunity 
 construction skill be essential to rebuild britain as part of our plan for change and to deliver home this labour government be cut red tape and reform english and math requirement to deliver more apprenticeship a year and prioritise investment with £ in additional spending to boost construction skill and train additional skilled construction worker this parliament that be more foundation apprenticeship more industry placement and support for further education as well as new technical excellence college specialise in construction skill across england 
 our plan for the renewal of central gateshead be by far the most exciting investment opportunity in north east england with £ of inward investment thousand of new home and public transport infrastructure mean construction job over the next few decade gateshead college right at the heart of the development zone be rapidly increase place on its superb construction course but much more be need will the secretary of state meet i and gateshead college to discuss super charge construction skill to deliver our plan for growth 
 i have visit gateshead college to see the fantastic work it do on digital skill but i know that it have also develop innovative flexible apprenticeship for career in build design and construction which i hope can be replicate elsewhere i would be happy to meet my hon friend and perhaps to visit gateshead college to learn more about what it be do on construction 
 further education college such as chichester college in my constituency be vital to the delivery of construction apprenticeship and skill training many college however have raise a concern with i that a loophole in the last government ’s skills and post-16 education act which bring college back into the public sector mean that they can not go out and get public investment into their college what be the minister do to address their concern and ensure that fe college can invest in the facility and course need to train our future construction workforce 
 the hon lady raise an important point about that reclassification through the construction announcement we make ahead of the spring statement we create a capital pot for employer lead and match fund project to ensure that we be really work to deliver some of the programme that be need we be also invest more in further education again through boost teaching in this area and make sure that young people have access to industry placement which we know be crucial in make sure that they succeed especially in area like construction 
 what step her department be take to improve support for child with send 
 what step her department be take to help ensure that send child be be adequately assess 
 colleague across the house will know about the lose lose lose system to use the tories own word that we inherit we be invest an extra £ into high need budget £ into create new place and have restructure the department to put send at its heart the system need far reach reform we be engage with parent and we have bring expert on board to assist we in this important work 
 merton council in which most of my wimbledon constituency be situate tell i that there be a national shortage of send specialist therapist and educational psychologist in particular which be negatively impact its and other local authority ability to produce education health and care plan in a timely fashion this seem to be a particular problem across london where in more than a decade there have be almost no growth in the number of local authority employ educational psychologist despite a large increase in demand will the minister update the house on plan to address this issue and meet i to discuss the particular challenge in london 
 we know that local authority have be impact by the increase demand for education health and care plan and workforce capacity issue so much more efficient and effective service delivery and communication with school and family will be central to make those improvement we be work with local authority and across the department to ensure that there be as much effective early identification as possible i be more than happy to continue engagement with the hon gentleman on these important issue 
 i often hear account of constituent wait over year for education health and care plan assessment from surrey county council when those assessment finally come they be frequently carry out remotely with assessor never actually meet the child headteacher report that these delayed and inaccurate assessment result in inadequate funding leave school under resource and simply unable to meet the child ’s need family in surrey deserve assessment that be timely thorough and centre around the child what reassurance can the minister offer family in surrey that the broken system will be fix and when 
 the hon lady set out what be unfortunately a common picture for far too many child and family we know that the system need reform and we be work at pace to deliver on that we be work with expert and engage with family and local authority we be determined to deliver a well outcome for child with special educational need and disability and their family and we will continue to update on progress as we make it 
 school support staff teach assistant and learn support assistant the unsung hero of our school often provide that crucial day to day support for child with send what step be the minister take to ensure that we upskill our school support workforce so that they be well place to support those child 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to recognise the role of school support staff in support school in general and particularly child within the school system with special educational need and disability we want to encourage more inclusive mainstream school and we need a really strong and qualified workforce to deliver on that i recently visit a school that have a fantastic group of teach assistant who be undertake the apprenticeship and specialise in issue such as special educational need to make sure that they can continue to develop their skill in the workforce that be a really positive story and that i hope many school can take up 
 my constituent martyn hodgson have adopt child both have suffer extensive trauma in their short life and the old son be diagnose with autism and learning disability they rely on the adoption and special guardianship support fund he say 
 this support mean so much to family of look after and adopt child as a child ’s social worker and adoptive parent i have see at hand the impact this funding can have on their life 
 for martyn and so many other like he in hartlepool and beyond please will the minister urgently reconsider the cut to this fund 
 i absolutely take on board the issue that my hon friend raise where people take on the responsibility of adoption that be to be applaud and support as far as possible the government be obviously consider all the financial matter in a very difficult context and make some difficult decision but we will continue to bear in mind the issue that he raise we want to maximise the number of child who can access the fund and get the vital support that be need 
 what step she be take to protect freedom of speech at university 
 it be labour that enshrine freedom of expression into law that be why in january i announce plan to fix the higher education freedom of speech act make it robust and workable today i sign the commencement regulation to impose strong free speech duty on high education provider and the office for students from   august we be take common sense decision to fix the foundation of high education and to deliver change for student 
 the minister will know that the university of sussex of my local university have recently be fin over £ a record amount follow   a and half year investigation by the office for students into freedom of speech i know that the ofs be independent but do the minister share my concern that it reach this conclusion without ever speak to the university or its current staff and student do she recognise the very wide implication of this ruling and will she meet i and the university to discuss this 
 my hon friend will understand the limitation on what i can say in answer to his question because this be a decision by the office for students which carry out independent regulatory function i would be happy to arrange for he to meet the relevant minister but only once legal matter have conclude 
 can the secretary of state confirm that the new freedom of speech provision will ensure that if any member of a university ’s staff give the same definition of a woman as the prime minister do in his most recent iteration of it they will not be no platforme or drive out of their job 
 in set out the government ’s position in the statement on tuesday i be very clear that we accept the supreme court judgment and that be the right basis on which thing ought to be take forward through the commencement regulation we have give tough power to the regulator we have also reform the regulator since july with a much sharp focus on financial sustainability something that i know be important to member across the house 
 i call the shadow minister neil o’brien 
 at the start of january the secretary of state say that she need more time to consider the overseas funding transparency measure in our freedom of speech legislation it be now nearly may in the meantime there have be several concern the report in the press about uk university work with chinese institution that be designate as high risk and have tie to their defence and security apparatus this legislation be pass in when will the secretary of state reach a decision 
 this be an important area and this government will always make sure that issue of national security come measure be already in place to address foreign interference in the high education sector from vet international student in sensitive area of research to specific requirement around freedom of speech and expression we continue to keep all these matter under review and when we be in a position to do so i will of course update the house 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of level of funding for pupil referral unit 
 my hon friend be a champion for young people with send and their family in his constituency the government have invest an extra £ into high   need budget to help local authority to maintain their pupil referral unit of course the system we inherit from the conservatives be break but we be pave the way for far reach reform to restore parent confidence and to support every child to achieve and thrive 
 i recently visit chaselea alternative provision academy in cannock and meet headteacher mr archer who tell i that it receive £ less per pupil than the average for pru due to the unfair funding formula with year after year of real term funding cut under the previous government chaselea have to stop all off site education and halt new admission which mean long stay for student will the minister confirm that this government will ensure that prus have the resource and support they need to do the vital work of help young people return to mainstream education 
 i agree that it be important that funding be available to support young people back into mainstream education staffordshire county council be be allocate through the high need funding block over £ of its dedicated school grant and will need to consider how good to deploy that funding to achieve this aim i know that my hon friend ’s constituent will be well serve by a labour council deliver on this issue and will want to think about that ahead of this thursday 
 my constituent a child who attend alternative provision be physically restrain by his passenger assistant on school transport which cause significant distress to he and his family the department for education have publish guidance on the use of reasonable force in school in england but it appear that there be a gap when it come to the use of reasonable force on school transport will the minister meet my constituent and i to discuss this case with a view to close this loophole with the funding that it require 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point and it be that we be look at as a department obviously home to school transport be an important aspect of access education but it need to be safe for all child i would be more than happy to discuss the issue far with he 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of high education funding 
 the tories be more interested in pick ideological fight than ensure that university be financially sustainable they leave student and taxpayer to bear the brunt labour have take tough decision to shore up high education as we pave the way for reform we will fix the foundation of high education to deliver change for student 
 over half of uk university include the university of york be again consult on academic and staff redundancy in line with the university and   college union ’s stop the cut week of action do the minister agree that we need an urgent review into high education funding and visa arrangement for international student and their dependant and that we need to protect student from poverty to safeguard our world class university and ultimately drive research innovation and their economic output 
 we be commit to secure the future of our high education sector and we absolutely recognise its excellent economic value which be crucial to our future economic growth we welcome international student who enrich our campus forge network with domestic student and become global ambassador we will set out our plan for reform in the summer 
 over the past few month bournemouth university have have to take step to suspend of its course due to financial pressure and rise operational cost most be art and humanity course include english photography sociology and politic what option exist for university to access other source of funding and what assessment be be do to protect art and humanity course across our high education sector 
 i thank the hon member for her level of concern high education provider be autonomous and responsible for manage their own budget if they be at any risk we would work with the office for student to ensure that student be protect the government reserve the right to intervene to protect the interest of student the strategic priority grant be also available to support teacher and student in high education in more expensive subject 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 today in place such as leicester birmingham county durham gloucestershire worcestershire and northumberland some of the last of our early adopter school will launch their free breakfast club we be now provide pupil with the good start to their school day boost parent work choice and child ’s life chance evidence show why that matter so much when school introduce breakfast club behaviour improve attendance increase and attainment grow it also give parent minute of free childcare every day to juggle work and family life that be why we will cement those freedom and that opportunity through the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill deliver on our plan for change 
 to follow on from the previous question university job have be cut nationally and the university and college union project that more will be cut by the end of the year in bradford up to further job be at risk bradford university ’s nursery service face the chop and some course be long go in a bid to meet funding shortfall what step be the secretary of state take to protect staff and student in place like bradford give the grow crisis in high education 
 i understand my hon friend ’s concern we be focus on put university on a firm footing as the under secretary of state for education my hon friend   the member for lewisham east janet daby say we will set out further reform in the summer so that high education deliver for student and the taxpayer we have to make tough decision to increase tuition fee limit in line with inflation for the next academic year but i know that my hon friend   the member for bradford east imran hussain   recognise as i do the enormous economic value of university in town and city right across our country that be why we have reform the regulator to put university on a much firm footing for the future 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 despite the education secretary ’s good attempt to rewrite history we conservatives do not need a court to tell we that biological sex be real she have on her desk the draft guidance for school on gender questioning and the final cass report be publish a year ago if she be serious about protect woman and girl why have she not publish the guidance 
 i be serious about protect the right of woman and girl that be why i run a woman ’s refuge for child and woman flee domestic abuse flee male violence flee some of the most unimaginable abuse that anyone could ever see i need no lesson on the importance of such provision 
 the shadow secretary of state ask a specific question which i will answer this be a sensitive area we be talk about child ’s wellbeing often very vulnerable child who be experience stress although i recognise the importance of provide clarity and guidance for school leader we have to get it right the conservatives publish draft guidance for consultation only a matter of month before the general election it be right that we take stock follow the full and final review from dr cass which we accept should be the basis for how we take thing forward 
 that draft guidance be produce a year and a half ago the education secretary want to talk about her record well let i remind she that of her act on come into post be to pause implementation of the higher education freedom of speech act which would have protect gender critical voice she be more concerned about listen to student union activist than to woman will she apologise to the gender critical woman who be force to spend eye watering sum on legal fee to fight for their right because of her action 
 from that question i do not think you would know who have be in government for the past year mr speaker the conservatives have ample opportunity to clarify the position the ruling of the supreme court be that labour ’s equality act be the basis for its judgment confirm that biological sex should be the basis for provision of single sex service alongside that the court be also clear that everyone in our country deserve to be treat with dignity and respect and that trans people continue to receive protection in law the conservatives publish guidance in draft form a matter of month of before   the general election it be right that we take this issue seriously and get it right we do not need this shameless opportunism this be about child ’s wellbee 
 the exam season be well under way in scotland and i think the whole house will join i in wish pupil in livingston and across scotland luck over the come week and in thank teacher for prepare during the academic year close the attainment gap between the rich and poor pupil in scotland be the snp government ’s define mission but the late statistic show that it be increase year on year and pupil be leave scottish school without any qualification at all 
 order we have other member to get in as well i call the secretary of state 
 i join my hon friend in send my good wish to child in scotland and across the uk as their exam get under way and thank the brilliant staff work hard to support they he be of course right about the many failure under the hopeless snp administration scotland deserve a new direction and a well education system and that will only come with labour 
 i call liberal democrat spokesperson 
 last year the secretary of state say 
 there can be no goal more important and more urgent than extend opportunity to our most vulnerable children”.—[official report   july vol c. 
 action speak louder than word so will she commit to reverse she cut to the grant available through the adoption and special guardianship support fund so that vulnerable child be not make to pay the price for the conservatives financial mess 
 the hon lady will know that we have confirm £ for further consideration will be for the spending review we have make change in order to maximise the number of child who can access the fund in addition to the funding that be provide there we be also trialle kinship allowance invest more in foster care and invest another £ in provide local authority with the support they need to provide preventive service i agree that it be important that vulnerable child who have be through the adoption system and beyond get the support that they need to thrive 
 we know that young people be at the sharp end of the mental health crisis so can the minister update the house on the progress his department be make on our manifesto commitment to put specialist mental health support into our school and tell we how gap in support for neurodivergent pupil as highlight in the trailblazer programme will be address 
 this government will provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school so that every young person have access to early support   include those who be neurodivergent nhs fund mental health support team will continue to roll out across school and be expect to cover at least of pupil this year 
 the secretary of state may be aware of the tragic death of genevieve meehan who die in a nursery in cheadle she be just month old despite claim that the nursery be safe gigi ’s death be entirely preventable gigi ’s parent john and katie be now campaign for change in the law around nursery safety will the secretary of state meet i gigi ’s parent and the lullaby trust to talk through this campaign and commit to help to ensure that this tragic story be never repeat

 the pay review body have recommend a pay rise for school staff will the department for education pay and will that really be expect to come from exist school budget 
 we will set out our approach to the recommendation in the usual way but i say to the hon gentleman that of the very act of this incoming labour government be to accept the previous recommendation to fund the pay award for teacher that have be sit on the desk of the conservative government 
 sadly after year of tory government few young people in southampton itchen be successfully engage in employment education or apprenticeship compare with the national average what specific step will the secretary of state take to ensure that apprenticeship and university route be equally value and equally accessible to the young people in my constituency 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that point our youth guarantee will provide tailored support to young people help they to access high quality education training and employment we want young people to be earn and learning and we be waste no time about that youth foundation apprenticeship provide more opportunity for young people and we want to ensure that we expand access to university for disadvantaged student and that all learn be on an equal footing 
 national per pupil funding criterion be a blunt instrument for fairly fund school in rural area like mine on the isle of wight which be also separate from the uk mainland by sea will the minister meet i and representative from the isle of wight council to discuss how fair funding for isle of wight primary school can be provide so that no more of they close unnecessarily 
 i appreciate the concern that the hon gentleman raise i know that the isle of wight local authority be work to address the issue of surplus primary place in the good way i recognise the challenge around funding it will take some time to look at that but the system be design not to give every school the same amount of money but to address some of the need that he outline i be more than happy to continue this discussion as i appreciate the issue be very important in his constituency 
 have the department make an estimate of how many child with send be at risk of lose therapeutic support as a result of the recent change to the adoption and special guardianship support fund 
 i hear the concern around the adoption and special guardianship support fund we have have to make some really difficult decision but we have choose the fair approach to manage tight resource in the face of increase demand for support we will continue to review the situation 
 i recently have the opportunity to visit echelford primary school in my constituency where i see an extraordinarily different approach to oracy from those i have see in other school will the school minister visit to see that for herself 
 we be always look for good approach to raise standard whether in phonic math or oracy and to give child the confidence that will set they up for life i would be keen to hear more detail about the programme that the hon gentleman describe

 what assurance can the minister provide to concerned adoptive parent in my constituency who benefit from the match funding element of the adoption and special guardianship support fund and whose funding could be cut from £ to £ will she consider reintroduce this vital element of the asgsf 
 the adoption and special guardianship support fund still enable those who be eligible to access a significant package of therapeutic support to meet individual need the fund be important which be why we have continue to fund it but it be not the only source of adoption and kinship support responsibility for which lie with local authority and regional adoption agency our £ of funding to support adoption england can assist that

 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 no should have to live in fear of such horrific violence the appalling event in headingley on saturday have leave a community shock and woman with really serious injury my thought and those of all the liberal democrats be of course with the victim their family and all those affect by a crime of such awful brutality this be yet another devastating example of the violence face by woman and girl across the country which we must all work to end it be also yet another example of a violent attack in which a crossbow have be use of too many in recent year my hon friend   the member for richmond park sarah olney among other have urge the government to review and strengthen crossbow regulation i note the government ’s amendment to the crime and policing bill include new clause and the minister ’s response to   the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel can the minister confirm when the government ’s formal response to the call for evidence will be publish

 i wish the victim of the headingley attack a full recovery my thought be with their friend and family and the community just this morning i welcome joan whelan to westminster to meet the minister for crime policing and fire i thank the minister for her time and her sage advice and counsel follow the tragic loss of joan ’s beloved partner dave peck dave be fatally strike by bolt fire from a crossbow into an open busy pub in westcliff in my constituency of southend east and rochford in dave be affectionately know as west ham dave and be a large than life   character dave and joan together have grandchild who no long have their grandad in their life the crossbow be purchase by a resident with paranoid schizophrenia who have a history of mental health struggle it be purchase freely unchecked and unlicensed on the internet do the minister agree that more need to be do to stop crossbow fall into the wrong hand will she join i in thank joan for her bravery in share her story 
 i thank my hon friend for bring joan to see i today she be an incredibly brave and impressive person and we hear directly from she what the loss of dave mean to she her family and her grandchild in the few word that my hon friend use he make the case effectively for further change to the law around crossbow 
 the minister mention her meeting with laura sugden and i pay tribute to laura for her campaigning on the issue it be more than year since anthony lawrence brutally murder laura ’s partner shane gilmer laura be attack with a crossbow and be pregnant at the time i know that a response to the consultation be come but can the minister give we more detail about the timetable for that response what next step will we likely see 
 i also pay tribute to laura an incredibly brave woman who face a horrific attack when her neighbour get into the house through the roof space and attack she and her partner in answer to the hon gentleman i can not give a specific date i use to really dislike it when i be sit on the opposition benches and a government minister would say shortly or imminently but i can guarantee that i be do my good to ensure that we respond to the consultation from last year as soon as possible 
 i express my sympathy and those of the people of central ayrshire to the victim of this horrific attack and those affect by it i note the presence of the mayor of west yorkshire in the gallery do the minister support the excellent work that the mayor be lead to keep woman and girl safe in west yorkshire will the minister commit to work with mayor and police and crime commissioner across the country to tackle the rise of misogyny 
 i do not want to get into trouble with you mr speaker but i be very conscious of the excellent work do by the mayor of west yorkshire and her deputy alison lowe on violence against woman and girl and of their real commitment to make policy that will have a dramatic effect on the woman and girl of west yorkshire 
 unhinged individual be roam the street of our town and city with crossbow knife saw and other dangerous weapon and no tinker around with legislation or licensing will stop this madness be it not about time we have mandatory jail sentence for people who carry such weapon 
 we be work as quickly as possible to understand and identify the nature and scale of the grow cohort of predominantly young man   and boy who be fixate with violence we want to ensure that we have a proper approach and multi agency intervention to manage the risk that they pose the prime minister have already say that if the law need to change in recognition of this new and dangerous threat we will change it quickly 
 i thank the minister for come forward to respond to the urgent question let i put on record my deep sympathy for the victim of this terrible incident and their family member on both side of the house have talk about the victim of crossbow attack and i find the whole issue very shocking especially as someone who regularly visit westcliff on sea be there any more that we can do as a government to support victim of these terrible attack and their family 
 my hon friend have raise the important issue of how victim of such attack be support as i say this morning i talk to joan about the support that she receive after the horrific attack on dave peck and i have hear about the support and help that laura sugden have receive since she be attack with a crossbow but i be well aware that there be more to do and i will talk to my counterpart in the ministry of justice about that 
 do the minister share my surprise at just how easy it be to get hold of of these weapon a few click will buy someone a guillotine x+ compound crossbow for £ plus £ for delivery or a jaguar deluxe for £ with free delivery these thing be as deadly as shotgun yet we do not license they as such will the minister in the plan that she have herald consider seriously go down the same route as other european country and ensure that these deadly weapon be properly control 
 in just a few sentence the right hon gentleman have make a compelling case for why change be need in this regard i can not go any far today but i hear what he say and i share his concern about the fact that people can go online and with a few click buy of these item 
 a number of people have mention to i that they have be to university in leeds or have kid who live in below clarey in harrogate and go to university in leeds there be quite a high density student population in the area what conversation have the government have with local authority and other partner to ensure that university student and parent feel support and reassure may i also echo the sentiment of member on both side of the house who have thank the emergency service 
 the hon gentleman have make an important point about reassurance for the public so that they can feel confident about go out in local    community i know that west yorkshire police be ensure that through the extra police presence and my hon friend   the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel   will be work with community group and the university also my right hon friend the home secretary and the minister for security be properly brief about the incident over the weekend there be engagement across the board and all the key stakeholder be part of those conversation 
 i join all the other members in wish the victim of this horrific crime a speedy recovery i note that counter terrorism policing have be involve in intelligence gathering and that there be concern about online incitement to violence will the minister join i in condemn the recent statement by the so call irish rap band kneecap who be report to have tell their audience that they should kill their local mp and that the only good tory be a dead tory 
 yes of course i would condemn any such comment clearly i can not comment on anything that be post online in relation to the case we be talk about today but the hon gentleman will know that we work in partnership with technology company to ensure that they understand their responsibility to tackle illegal content on their platform and we have be clear that they need to act quickly to identify and remove such content from their platform once it have be post more generally the online safety act place duty on platform to swiftly identify and remove illegal content which we expect they to abide by furthermore these platform have a moral responsibility to keep their user and the general public safe and we expect they to take all reasonable step to do so 
 order it be very important that this matter be raise but i be not sure that it fit in here it might have be well if the hon gentleman have raise the issue in the house by make a point of order at the end 
 i thank the minister for her answer our thought be with the victim and indeed with the police officer and the emergency service worker who respond in such a positive way like other i believe that such incident highlight the fact that police officer and particularly police community support officer need to be on the ground so that they can deal with the use of crossbow put in place measure to ensure public safety and send the message that the police be close by that need to be the case not just in headingley but across all of this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland 
 the hon gentleman make the case for what this government be do on neighbourhood policing we be put police officer and pcso back into local area and community to provide not only a police presence but public reassurance which be so important to the people we all represent 
 urgent question to ask the home secretary to make a statement on the child rape gang scandal 
 the shadow home secretary be away when i update the house on the government ’s response to the independent national inquiry into child sexual abuse and on the action that we be take to investigate and tackle child groom gang across the country as i have say many time people up and down this country be understandably horrify by the appalling crime commit by despicable grooming gang child be subject to the most unthinkable sexual violence frontline service local authority and elect politician turn away or even blame the child rather than their rapist i know this because i speak to victim week in week out and i have do so for decade 
 this government be determined to get to the truth of both historical and current grooming gang to ensure that perpetrator be punish and to deliver justice and accountability for victim and survivor that be why we be press ahead with the key recommendation of the independent inquiry include the mandatory duty to report baroness casey who conduct a no hold bar review into groom gang offend in rotherham be currently oversee a national audit of group base child sexual exploitation and abuse the audit will identify what further work be need it be look at the scale nature and profile of group base abuse include the characteristic of offender it will conclude in the come week and i have already commit to publish the finding 
 the home secretary and i have always be clear that the priority in tackle this heinous offending be get perpetrator behind bar and get justice for the victim and survivor that be why all police force in england and wales have be ask to review historical groom gang investigation that be close with no further action and to pursue new line of inquiry and reopen investigation where appropriate
