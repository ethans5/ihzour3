i commend my hon friend   the member for reigate rebecca paul   for secure this important debate i understand more than most the issue with property service charge because i be a leaseholder where i live in hoddesdon a quarter of my constituent live in flat or maisonette and of property transaction in broxbourne last year involve leasehold property but shockingly as we have hear it be hard to find any leaseholder who have a good word to say about their landlord or their service charge 
 landlord and solicitor do not provide enough information to new resident and far too often prospective resident be not properly inform before they move in about how much service charge have increase in previous year they be then hit with huge rise down the line it be also unclear where the money be go 
 a resident in waltham cross tell i 
 the service charge have skyrocket from around £ to £ for each leaseholder yet live condition remain extremely dire resident here face ongoing issue include trespasser mould break security door mouse infestation and squatter our building also have several defect include weak floor fire safety issue and ongoing leakage at point my flat become uninhabitable after a severe leak that take month to resolve 
 i hear these story again and again from constituent who come to i as the contact of last resort after month and sometimes year of neglect to their property in that case i meet the management company involve rmg early this year but nothing have change whether it be rmg firstport bamptons en8 homes or warwick estates leaseholder deserve well from their landlord and management company who focus purely on collect ever high charge for bad service 
 however by far the bad treatment of leaseholder in my constituency have be at the hand of i hope the minister be listen to this point labour run enfield council i be contact by resident on the whitefield estate in may last year and what i hear leave i outraged completely out of the blue enfield council be demand up to £ from each leaseholder for urgent repair roof that have never have a leak be earmark to be replace and window would be fix even though they have be use for year without issue understandably my resident immediately ask what about my service charge well as the leasehold advisory service say many landlord collect money out of the service charge for a sink fund to help cover the cost of exactly these kind of major work but not enfield council no it expect my constituent to stump up all the cash even after raise the service charge that year and as far as the resident be concern have not spend a single penny on the estate in decade 
 the whitefield estate tenant association and in particular leaseholder nicky mccabe have work incredibly hard to bring the community together in response to this issue they simply demand straightforward answer to straightforward question but they be meet with confusing statement from enfield council representative who find it far too easy to say that ’s not my job i attend the meeting there be a number of director from enfield council there all of whom earn significant sum of money and they could not answer basic question from my constituent about how much they would have to pay and what be go to change on the estate the communication be shocking my constituent fight be still ongoing and they have my full support

 i will not take the dig about be short personally mr speaker 
 the industrial strategy and the strategic defence review both offer great opportunity to the entire united kingdom can i seek reassurance from the minister that he will work with the northern ireland executive to ensure that northern ireland and northern ireland business get benefit out of both 
 i can absolutely give the hon member that reassurance i have already meet with my opposite number in the northern ireland executive the hon member mention defence industry in particular and it feel like every single month there be a significant defence order as part of the industrial strategy it show that these be not just word on paper but that we be deliver within the real economy 
 i welcome the minister and indeed the whole front bench team to their place well do 
 on the industrial strategy what step have be take to fund high quality workforce apprenticeship in sector such as technology manufacturing and hospitality to provide young people with opportunity for employment and live in those industry will the minister undertake to discuss these matter with the relevant minister at the northern ireland assembly 
 as i say to   the hon member for south antrim robin swann   a moment ago we have already meet with the northern ireland executive on these issue skill be an essential part of the industrial strategy because we see again and again industry around the country that be desperate to grow and have the order but be unable to create the high pay job that we need that be an absolute priority for we as we implement the industrial strategy 
 i call the shadow minister 
 labour ’s industrial strategy recognise that housing and infrastructure be vital to drive regional investment but as i hope the minister will know across the road the treasury have be quietly consult on change to the landfill tax end the decade long exemption for quarry that change would add million of pound on to infra- structure project and increase tax cost for construction business across the country how would such a move help grow our economy and build the home and infra- structure that we need 
 we be fast approach the time of year when i have to tell my child that they will have to wait until christmas to find out what their present be the hon gentleman know that he have to wait until the budget to find out what be in the budget he mention plan we have make huge change to planning rule which have result in a saving of about £ in red tape cost for business so we be ensure that that sector in particular have the environment it need to contribute to growth 
 i be afraid that be not good enough the industry be face deep uncertainty around the kite fly go on across the road at the treasury i realise that he be not responsible for that but he need a well answer for the construction industry the construction   products association have just cut its growth forecast for the sector to barely next year warn that the uncertainty over new taxis be choke investment i will ask the minister again how on earth will add £ to the cost of a new home or to road construction cost through a new builder tax do anything other than cement the slowdown that labour be oversee in our economy 
 to stand up and raise uncertainty and then complain about it be quite something the shadow minister say that we be slow growth we be the fast grow economy in the g7 in the half of we be now the large exporter in the world and we have have interest rate cut in a row 
 do you even know what the question be 
 order mr timothy you use to be an adviser who specialise in not answer question we do not need any help laughter

 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i also welcome the ministerial front benchers to their new role the liberal democrats have long champion an industrial strategy in government we create the green investment bank the british business bank and the regional growth fund and we oppose the conservative government ’s damaging decision to scrap the industrial plan we welcome the industrial strategy ’s return especially its focus on invest in skill 
 however business know that the apprenticeship levy do not work funding be hard to access and million go unspent we welcome the pledge in june to replace it with a more flexible growth and skill levy but firm and young people be still await detail will the minister provide detail of what training this will fund so that business and young people can plan ahead with certainty 
 i thank the hon lady for her kind word on my new appointment i will not get ahead of announcement on that but give the importance of skill to the industrial strategy we be not wait for those announcement we have have techfirst a £ investment in secondary school pupil undergraduate phd student entrepreneur and business to help they get ahead on that we have the engineering package of over £ and the defence package of £ we be make those investment now to ensure that the pipeline be there for those industry which be the priority within the industrial strategy

 leigh and atherton have many exceptional sme that be drive local growth particularly in manufacturing engineering and construction what step be the minister take to make sure that sme in area like mine receive target support as part of effort to address regional imbalance and reduce reliance on our major metropolitan centre

 my constituency have nearly sme all of which be face increase business rate and taxis threaten job and growth will the minister signal his support for sme by follow the conservative party ’s lead and completely abolish business rate for pub and restaurant on the high street 
 i gently say to the hon member that he do not do that in year in government indeed the conservatives be set to remove the relief on small business rather than repeat the mistake of the liz truss budget with unfunded tax commitment we be give real support to business now include by increase the employment allowance so that more and more of the small business that he describe do not pay national insurance contribution at all 
 i recently meet with discover adventure a small business in coombe bissett which be genuinely struggle to engage with government over the recent package travel regulation it sit ambiguously between dbt the department for transport and the department for culture media and sport indeed a question be throw back today have be table in the table office may i sincerely ask the minister to help i locate the correct minister to deal with the association of independent tour operators this be a vital small business sector in this country and it need someone to engage with in government over these regulation 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his constructive question i be very happy to pursue that within government the wide point be that both the small business strategy and the industrial strategy be important because they be cross government strategy as lot of sector and individual business be face challenge that be not just the responsibility of minister i will certainly follow up on that

 i thank the shadow minister for her welcome she be absolutely right about the anchoring effect of post office on high street all over the country we know not just that as we mention in the green paper if people go to their post office they be likely to spend money in local shop but that post office be essential as i find out during a visit to the day before yesterday in give small business somewhere to take their taking the green paper set out the option for maintenance of the post office network and it be certainly our intention to maintain it

 in new car be now purchase through the motability scheme this present an unprecedented opportunity for the british car industry as the scheme stipulate what car its user can buy have the secretary of state consider that we could hugely increase the sale of british car by stipulate that only british build car can be buy and this be public money by motability user which would not just safeguard thousand of british job but create a world lead industry in accessible vehicle 
 that be a very thoughtful contribution and i be very grateful for it the motability foundation be an independent charity and be regulate by the charity commission but it do engage fully with the government in the most respectful way as my hon friend would imagine i have instruct my official to work with those in the department for work and pensions to see how we can make recommendation and certainly to support the take up of british car as much as possible this government be of course commit to the growth of the automotive sector we be provide support through programme such as drive35 the electric car grant which will invest up to £ of support into emission manufacturing across the uk

 i thank the minister for her response but with the cost of living pressure continue it be clear that deliver increase real income and well living standard be our no priority can the minister say a little more about which further sector be most ready for fair pay agreement and what step the department be take to meet the uk ’s obligation as a member of the international labour organisation to extend sectoral collective bargaining as a means to raise pay and improve living standard

 the secretary of state be right that any threat of an imminent increase in us beef import in particular be clearly not the problem but it have not go away either the us department of agriculture have a foreign agricultural service with different office embassy and trade mission they work with us farming group around the world to promote their product and they be not spend that money just to stand still what will the secretary of state be do to ensure that our farmer have the same opportunity so that they can see free trade agreement not just as threat but opportunity too 
 i be grateful for the right hon member ’s insightful and thoughtful contribution as i say strike trade deal be vital that be why we put so much energy into it and have have so much success and there will be more to come it be very important that the whole british economy and government make sure that we exploit the full opportunity that all these agreement offer the department for business and trade have embed highly talented trade expert right across the world and they be try to do just that on the frontline of all the economic opportunity we perceive around the world and that include agriculture if there be   specific area where the right hon member perceive that the agricultural sector either in his patch or across the united kingdom have an opportunity that be not yet be exploit i want to hear from and work with he to make sure that british farmer benefit

 my right hon friend be absolutely right to ask this question she will know of my keen interest in this issue over many year include during the time in my career when i be work with oxfam in her constituency on these issue and with our late close friend jo cox on past atrocity and appalling situation in the conflict in sudan the report of mass atrocity against civilian and of the forced displacement cause by the rapid support forces advance in el fasher be horrify and deeply alarming the scale of suffering be unconscionable what be happen be often base on people ’s ethnicity woman and girl face widespread sexual and gender base violence and there be evidence mount of defenceless civilian be execute and torture with aid worker also be target as they try to reach the most vulnerable community face famine 
 as the united nations security council penholder we have call an emergency council session later today to maintain the spotlight on this situation and to build pressure on the rsf to de escalate in line with un security council resolution yesterday the foreign secretary issue a statement condemn the killing of aid worker include the execution report in the saudi maternity hospital which be of the last function facility in el fasher that follow her statement on   october which call on the rsf to protect civilian and urgently facilitate safe rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access 
 as the large donor we be mobilise £ of the £ announce in april to support the emergency humanitarian response in north darfur that will support those face sexual violence and go towards the delivery of lifesave food and health assistance by partner such as the international committee of the red cross the sudan humanitarian fund and the cash consortium of sudan 
 as the foreign secretary say the rsf leadership be responsible for the action of their force all party to the conflict must urgently act to protect civilian and facilitate safe rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access i can confirm that our special representative have be in contact with the rsf and tasis to press for restraint and respect for international humanitarian law and they be press for a call with hemedti now 
 mr speaker i be very grateful to you for grant this urgent question the scale of suffering in sudan ’s war on civilian be almost impossible to comprehend a population the size of australia ’s be live in acute hunger a population the size of london ’s have be force to flee their home there be consistent report of conflict relate sexual violence and consistent warning that if the international community do not act we will effectively see a slow motion srebrenica the minister set out the report of what may have happen at el fasher ’s maternity hospital yesterday evening people could have be slaughter in a maternity hospital patient their companion and medical staff this surely must be a turning point in the war and for the international community ’s focus on it 
 the minister talk about the special representative ’s contact but what specific conversation have the foreign secretary and ministers have with their counterpart particularly in the quad country the united states say it want to take a leadership position on these issue but also in saudi arabia egypt and the united arab emirates on the issue of civilian protection 
 secondly i be pleased to hear that an emergency session of the security council have be call what will the uk government press other country in the un to commit to at that session thirdly be the government confident that the arm control export regime have be robust in this case give recent report 
 what be the government ’s assessment of claim that el fasher appear to be at the start of a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of fur zaghawa and berti indigenous community through force displacement and summary execution finally what be the government do to prevent what be happen in el fasher from also happen in tawila to which so many thousand of terrified civilian have flee

 my right hon friend ask some specific question we be in regular contact with our partner in the quad and engage with all the country regularly at both ministerial and official level senior official include the special representative be speak on an ongoing basis and ask all party to show restraint and to refrain from activity that prolong the conflict 
 my right hon friend ask about the situation in tawila we want to ensure that people be support particularly those who have flee as i say we have mobilise   £ to support the emergency humanitarian response i be happy to come back to she with further detail 
 my right hon friend ask about the position that we will take at the security council it will be very much in line with the position we have take throughout which be to call for an immediate end to the violence and to ensure that international humanitarian law be respect and uphold that sexual violence be bring to an end and that we protect civilian in line with international law 
 it be crucial that we continue to support accountability effort for such atrocity particularly as evidence emerge we support the centre for information resilience and non governmental organisation look to collect evidence of atrocity we will not rest until all evidence have be collate and action be take to hold people accountable 
 we recently support for the year run lobby effort to secure the mandate renewal of the un fact find mission at the un human rights council on   october that be the only un mechanism investigate human right violation and abuse in sudan as hon member will be aware it have not be allow access by either side in the conflict so it be incredibly difficult to establish what be happen but we be look carefully at all the evidence 
 my right hon friend ask about the importance of our export control regime i confirm that we continue to emphasise to all party the importance of refrain from action that prolong the conflict indeed we want to see people come to the negotiating table to seek a political resolution we take seriously any allegation that any equipment may have be transfer to sudan in breach of any of our arm embargo or condition i assure she that i be in contact with our official on these matter we must absolutely ensure that nothing be get in that could facilitate these horrific scene we share my right hon friend ’s horror and will continue to play a lead role include at the united nations security council later today 
 i call the shadow minister 
 if i may i will start by thank the minister for his update on hurricane melissa on behalf of his majesty ’s official opposition i add my thought and solidarity for all those affect at this time 
 i be grateful to you mr speaker for grant the urgent question and to   the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds   for raise the matter because the report of a massacre at the saudi maternity hospital in el fasher be appalling the deliberate targeting of civilian include woman and newborn be a disgrace these late atrocity underline the urgent need for renew international resolve to protect civilian and ensure accountability for those responsible 
 the conservatives have consistently call for strong co ordinated international action in sudan as the un security council penholder the uk have both the platform and the responsibility to lead will the minister tell the house what concrete step the government will take next will there be far target sanction what diplomatic action be be take to deter the entity whose support continue to sustain the conflict 
 the government host the international humanitarian conference on sudan early this year what have materialise from that have new funding be disburse what progress have be make since those pledge be announce 
 the collection and preservation of evidence be vital if perpetrator of these terrible crime be to face justice will the minister tell we the late development in the uk ’s support for accountability mechanism will the government now redouble those effort 
 on humanitarian assistance million remain displaced with aid route under constant threat will the minister update the house on whether british aid be reach those most in need what assessment have be make of its efficacy 
 sudan matter to its people to regional stability and to our shared humanity the uk must not shrink from its responsibility to protect civilian to pursue peace and to support the path to a democratic future 
 i associate myself with the shadow minister ’s comment and with her horror and concern about this situation which i think be share across the house 
 the right hon member ask about our work at the united nations as i say to my right hon friend the member for oxford east we will be use the session today to call for all party to adhere to their obligation under international law and to say that the perpetrator of crime must be hold accountable we need to see an end to this violence and the late report be simply shocking and horrific 
 the right hon member ask about diplomatic action as i have say we be in close contact with member of the quad and all other give our role as the penholder at the security council and i be happy to update she on that in due course she ask about sanction she will know that we do not comment on future designation but i assure she that we keep these matter under close review 
 the right hon member ask about the humanitarian response and our assistance be aim at support people we be the large donor and more than people in sudan have benefit from uk aid since the outbreak of the conflict in due to action take by her government and by our since the election 
 we continue to use every forum we can to act during the united nations general assembly session baroness chapman the minister for international development and africa in the other place co host a high level event with liberia and the netherlands on these issue and condemn the party disregard for international law 
 urgent accountability be the last issue that the right hon member raise and i assure she that that be central to what we be do the support that we provide to different organisation be clear include our long stand support for the international criminal court and other organisation bring all those responsible for atrocity to justice indeed the conviction have take place at the icc in relation to activity in darfur in early phase of this terrible conflict 
 the massacre of civilian at el fasher maternity hospital be just the late in a series of atrocity in sudan and pregnant   and breastfeed woman face famine and malnutrition sexual violence be widespread and the rapid support forces be use rape as a weapon of war in blatant violation of international law what assurance can the minister give that the uk be act to alleviate this humanitarian disaster and can he assure the house that there be no risk of uk manufacture arm be use by the rsf 
 my hon friend rightly raise the horrific report of sexual and gender base violence in this conflict we be provide specific support on that through our woman ’s integrate sexual health programme and the diplomatic action that i mention in relation to my colleague baroness chapman and other we be also look at new programme where we can support woman lead organisation in respond to the atrocity that have be go on as i say that accountability will be key my hon friend ask about the arm control regime and i assure she that we keep these matter under close review and take any allegation incredibly seriously 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i associate my party with the remark about hurricane melissa and wish those on the island of jamaica all our good wish at this difficult time 
 i be grateful to   the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds   for secure this urgent question and to you for grant it mr speaker as everyone have state the report of the massacre of civilian by the rsf in el fasher be truly horrific yet the tragedy be that the international community be warn and there have be a pattern of these terrible atrocity by the rsf the question for the minister today be have the uk do enough 
 on   june the prime minister say that we do not spend enough time on sudan in this house that might be because the minister for africa sit in the other place but when lord purvis ask baroness chapman on   july   about the uk ’s work to enforce un security council resolution on the protection of civilian in el fasher she say 
 i often find myself ask what the point be of many of these declarations”.—[official report house of lords   july vol c. 
 be the minister equally defeatist about the uk ’s role as a penholder at the un or will the uk use its position today to press for a sudan wide arm embargo 
 on the role of uk weapon in the conflict which have be widely report will the minister today ban arm sale to the uae until it be confirm that the uae be not use british weapon to arm the rsf 
 the hon gentleman raise important issue give his previous career and have work with he in the past i know of his sincerity on these matter ultimately the party involve be responsible for the conflict if the allegation turn out to be true we be clear that anybody responsible must be hold accountable and we will not rest until that be do both through our role at the united nations and in relation to support accountability for any atrocity that have be commit 
 we of course engage on a very close basis it be not just about statement it be about direct contact by our special representative richard crowder and the team in addis ababa with the party and other member of the quad it be also about our role in galvanise international attention on the issue i agree that for a long time the conflict have not receive the attention that it should have receive as i have always make clear we be have a direct impact through the aid and support that we provide particularly in relation to the horrific impact on woman and girl 
 the hon gentleman ask about arm export i can assure he that we have of the tight and most restrictive arm export control regime in the world we constantly keep these matter under review i assure he that i be in regular contact with official on these matter and we will take any allegation that be make very seriously 
 i would like to give the minister the opportunity to be as robust as possible on the issue of arm export do the government consider the report that uk military equipment export to the uae have be find on the battlefield to be credible have the uae be challenge on that be the relevant export licence under review and if need will we cancel they 
 i assure my hon friend that we take these issue very seriously we take allegation that any uk make equipment may have be transfer to sudan in breach of the uk arm embargo very seriously that reflect the point make by the liberal democrat spokesperson the uk have of the most robust arm export control regime in the world we constantly assess our licence for the risk of diversion and we regularly prevent export that might be divert to an undesirable end user or end use we be aware of report of a small number of uk make item have be find in sudan but there be no evidence in the recent reporting of uk weapon or ammunition be use in sudan i will keep these matter under close review 
 i thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker as you have do with a number of other but this important issue should not have to come to the floor of the house by way of an urgent question the government must be more proactive the minister for africa give a commitment to the international development committee that they would be more proactive during this parliament and i hope that that commitment will be honour will the minister set out more fully what discussion there have be with the uae not only be there concern about the use of weapon but it be clear that the uae have significant influence over the rsf and be a key player it be state by the government that we have influence with the uae so be we use that influence to ensure that it use its influence with the rsf 
 i note the right hon gentleman ’s comment and will ensure that my colleague in the other place be aware of they we be actively engage on this matter our team our official and our special representative be work on this issue every day so i do not want he to think that we do not take it serious we absolutely do particularly in light of the   new allegation that have be make in recent day we be the big donor and the penholder and we have be show leadership on the issue over the past year and before that include under the government in which he serve as he know 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the quad and the uae we welcome the effort of the us lead quad in seek a resolution to the conflict he will know that the quad issue a statement on   september which be a significant development but we remain in close contact with all the relevant stakeholder and party in push for a humanitarian pause a wide ceasefire and a sudanese lead political transition we will continue to support quad effort in that regard include through our role at the un security council 
 i thank my right hon friend   the member for oxford east anneliese dodds   for secure this urgent question on this devastating topic my constituent of sudanese heritage alongside the whole community of the cities of london and westminster be appal by these atrocity will the minister update the house on the situation with consular access what might uk citizen expect for their family and friend in the region and what kind of support be this country provide to reach out to they 
 my hon friend speak powerfully on behalf of her constituent and i know that she be not the only as i mention my own constituent have great concern about family friend and other in sudan and have do so for a long time it be absolutely right that she put their concern on the record if i may i will get back to she on consular access there be obviously extremely challenging circumstance on the ground even humanitarian organisation and the united nations be unable to access the region but i will get back to she on what step we can take through our consular service 
 can the minister explain to the house what be the attitude of other state in the region towards this conflict be there any prospect that they could unite and possibly make some form of physical intervention to separate the war side in sudan 
 obviously it be not for i to speak to the individual policy of country in the region but the right hon gentleman will know that regrettably to date it have not be possible to find a consensus in the united nations security council on a way forward we push for that and always attempt to do so in our engagement as the penholder we will do so again today particularly in the light of event but ultimately it be the party to the conflict that be responsible for what be happen we be in direct contact and be urge restraint 
 we be all horrify by the attack on el fasher maternity hospital overnight and the increase death toll the minister have highlight the scale of the humanitarian crisis in sudan with more than people displace from their home over the past   year and sadly child under the age of now suffer from acute malnutrition we can not allow that to go on can the minister tell we what we be do to get humanitarian aid to the million who desperately need it especially child 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this issue the prime minister the foreign secretary and my noble friend the minister in the other place have make it clear that we will continue to play a key humanitarian role and we have commit to protect our funding to support people affect by this crisis over the next year we will provide in total £ this year deliver aid to more than people which make we the large donor my hon friend can be absolutely assure that this issue be at the top of our agenda particularly the situation for child as she rightly mention 
 with so many conflict around the world i be sad to say that we have fail they as a house as a country and as humanity whether it be in ukraine or in gaza but what we have not do be forget those other conflict this conflict be now in its year with more than dead and the bad humanitarian crisis as we speak we have not only fail they but forget they that be what the sudanese diaspora in this country tell i all the time will the minister agree to meet with the darfur diaspora association uk and hear its concern because it feel unheard 
 i absolutely recognise the concern of the sudanese diaspora in this country indeed i have many different member of the sudanese diaspora in my constituency of cardiff south and penarth and i absolutely assure the hon gentleman that they have not be forget by this government or by many member of this house many of we have speak on these issue over many year and have work to try to find way forward to ensure that support be give and there be an end to this terrible conflict he can be absolutely assure that we engage regularly with different group i will pass on his request to my colleague in the other place and hope to be able to get back to he in due course 
 i be grateful to my experienced right hon friend   the member for oxford east anneliese dodds   for her urgent question as the grandson of a proud jamaican i be grateful to the minister for update we on effort to mitigate the impact of hurricane melissa 
 the event in sudan be inexplicably evil the brutal murder of people at a hospital in recent day and over many month be frankly crime against humanity and i add my voice to urge the minister to engage as much as he can with the sudanese diaspora not just in newcastle under lyme but up and down the country the word we have not yet hear be african union can the minister tell i what engagement have take place with the african union in recent day to ensure that the power of that body be exercise as quickly as possible 
 we need much short question please 
 we engage across a whole range of diplomatic relation our special representative and other do so and we do so in the united nations i be happy to come back to my hon friend specifically on what contact we have have with african union representative in recent day 
 there be many displace people in other country in the region as a consequence of the violence in sudan what additional support be the uk government give to those country to support those displace people 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to talk about displace people my right hon friend   the member for oxford east anneliese dodds   mention tawila i can assure he that our humanitarian aid be target to have the big impact and we look very closely at the situation of displace people particularly those who have also experience atrocity and especially woman and girl who may have experience sexual violence that will remain at the top of our agenda 
 i thank the minister for his statement it be good to have somebody at the dispatch box who both understand and care about this issue we have spend no shortage of time in this chamber talk about the conflict in the middle east and in ukraine but i think all of we be guilty of not talk enough about sudan the international criminal court be investigate some report of atrocity in sudan do the minister feel that that investigation should extend to those who knowingly export weapon into the conflict 
 my hon friend be right to raise the issue of accountability i have already refer to our support for the work of the international criminal court and indeed wide investigation into allegation of atrocity we work to support non governmental organisation and other i must also highlight the work of the medium in this space particularly the investigation of the bbc and other medium organisation as i have say we keep our export licence under close review and we take allegation very seriously i can assure he that i be speak to official about these matter 
 give that it have be widely report in the press that the uae be arm the rsf do the minister have a view on the follow point if any party be export weapon to the rsf we would be in breach of our export licence criterion if we be export weapon to that party secondly it be irrelevant whether or not our weapon be be export and end up in sudan if that party be export weapon to the rsf 
 i be very happy to write to the hon gentleman with further detail of how our arm export licensing criterion operate but i can assure he that we have of the tight and strictest export control regime in the world it be compliant with our international legal obligation and all potential export be assess against the strategic export licensing criterion specific allegation have be make in this case and   i can absolutely assure the hon gentleman that we will always look into allegation very seriously and consider they in the wide round
