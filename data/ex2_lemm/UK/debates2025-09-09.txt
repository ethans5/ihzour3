i be pleased to be able to say something in the debate the point make about the history of this really need to be amplify a bit more it be a disgraceful deal do in by the then labour government that create biot and lead we on the pathway to expel the chagos islander from both diego garcia and the wide archipelago that be do when mauritius be still a british colony and the us be put on a lot of pressure to get a base to fuel the vietnam war that be the context in which the deal be do 
 the treatment of the chagos islander which have be write about extensively by some brilliant writer be unbelievably brutal they be drag out of their home put on boat and send to either seychelles or mauritius with no right no acknowledgment and no real support whatsoever they live for a long time in poverty in both those place former members of the house who have sadly pass on do quite a lot to try to support they the late tam dalyell former mp for linlithgow go to mauritius to meet len williams the new governor general at the time and ask why people be sleep on the street of port louis he be tell and from that point he take up the cause of   the chagos islander because he think they have be disgracefully treat the late robin cook also take the matter up both at the time and much later when he become foreign secretary we should pay tribute to they for what they try to do 
 the reality be that it be the chagos islander themselves who manage to get some decency and recognition olivier bancoult who have become a great friend of mine write to i in i think it be a beautiful handwritten letter say dear mr corbyn could you do anything to help the chagos islander we keep in touch indeed i have meet he many time since include recently at the launch of his book 
 the chagos refugees group be found and it operate from olivier bancoult ’s house it make demand on the mauritian government demand on the british government and enormous demand on somebody who later become the british high commissioner to mauritius namely david snoxell he and olivier bancoult do not always get along the latter ’s pressure on david snoxell be enormous he once go to the extent of lock he in his office until they have a proper meeting olivier bancoult be a feisty guy and the group be feisty people we should recognise that the group ’s determination bring about compensation and a litany of court case all over the country and the world i have be to many of the hearing i have hear argument make in the decolonisation committee and at the un human rights council and at a whole series of court process in britain to try to get compensation and recognition of the right of the chagos islander 
 today we be deal with the consequence of the unbelievable heroism of the chagossian people who have be seek recognition and justice i regret that there be now difference within the chagossian community tam dalyell and i strongly support the move to get a right to british nationality for chagos islander and to amend the relevant nationality act that be eventually achieve and that be how i be pleased to say they now have unfettere access to this country i be also pleased that the treaty continue to include that unfettered access i hope that the minister when he come to reply can explain what discussion he have have with all the element of the chagossian community the last thing we want to see be division in a community that have suffer so much and deserve so much decency and recognition 
 if the chagos island in their entirety be not pass over to mauritius and mauritian sovereignty there be consequence there will be even great dishonesty than we think there be in and secondly britain will be in breach of an icj judgment if that be what people want if that be what conservative and reform members want so be it but they would be act illegally by hang on to the island biot will go and there will be mauritian sovereignty over the whole area 
 i support the principle behind the marine protection zone although i do not support the no take element that be include at the beginning i want chagos islander to be able to return to the archipelago and to undertake sustainable fishing and so on i be assure that the mauritian government support and recognise the need to preserve the pristine beauty of the ocean around there i be less convinced that the military and the united states force be equally committed to the preservation of the natural world and the environment   the record be not good not perfect i hope that the minister when he come to reply can assure we that there will be proper inspection not just of the outer island but of the sea and the land of diego garcia 
 it be wrong that the islander be remove it be right that they have an opportunity to return which be what they have always campaign for i find it unfortunate beyond belief that they will only be allow to visit diego garcia imagine if we could only visit the home where our parent live or the graf where many of our relative have be bury there be an emotional relationship there that will be break by the refusal of the right of abode in future i understand from previous discussion with the minister and other that there could be a possibility of the return of a right of abode i be not sure maybe he can reply to that 
 be i happy about there be a huge military base on diego garcia no be i happy about the rhetoric that have be use in this debate which seem to be crank up the idea of yet another cold war when we should be look for a world of peace rather than of war i find that depressing and not really fit for this debate 
 there be a right of people who live under colonisation to achieve their independence that be achieve by mauritius but it be thwart in by agree now to return all the island and the archipelago to mauritius we be complete a process that should have take place in prior to mauritius ’s independence in have that happen and have there be no separation and creation of biot in we would not be have this debate today because the issue would simply not have arise

 thank to labour ’s fiscal rule the government have unlock private investment in uk infrastructure and strengthen investor confidence the year infrastructure strategy will revitalise all part of the country ’s economy include in scotland and in my constituency of west dunbartonshire do the chancellor agree that the uk labour government have put scotland at the heart of economic growth with unprecedented support for scottish industry job and public service in stark contrast to the snp scottish government 
 my hon friend be a great champion for the people of west dunbartonshire and i know he be work very closely with the ministry of defence at the moment to secure defence investment in his constituency during the summer i have the opportunity to spend some time in scotland see the result of our infrastructure investment in the defence sector carbon capture and storage in aberdeenshire transport investment in glasgow the supercomputer and raf lossiemouth and how the trade deal be benefit industry in scotland include scotch whisky 
 can the chancellor outline the impact on economic growth in the north east of england she expect from the record break £ spending package award early this year for transport infrastructure in the region 
 my hon friend have be a good advocate for his constituent he and i as well as the labour mayor kim mcguinness know that invest in road cycleway and the metro will make a real and practical difference this build on the £ that the north east be receive through the city region sustainable transport settlement of which £ have be earmark for durham of course my hon friend ’s constituent will also benefit from the wide economic benefit of extend the tyne and wear metro link washington with newcastle and sunderland 
 in my view stone railway station be of the most attractive and beautiful station on the west coast main line sadly though its platform be too short mean that inter city train can not stop there would the chancellor of the exchequer be kind enough to speak with her transport colleague about   what future option there be for stone to benefit from the extension of platform which would improve its connectivity to not just birmingham and manchester but also london 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question relate to his constituency it be a shame that the conservative party do not invest in extend those platform when it be in power for year i be very happy to discuss with my colleague at the department for transport how the his constituent can benefit from the extra £ that this government be put into capital investment 
 over the summer heathrow finally publish its proposal for a runway it be very clear that a lot of support road and rail infrastructure will be need if that expansion go ahead could the chancellor outline to the house what estimate her department have make of the amount of public investment that will be need heathrow exec have be clear that they be not go to fully fund it themselves 
 this government back a runway at heathrow we be a country that be open to global trade and investment we have do trade deal with country around the world and have secure £ of inward investment heathrow airport ltd and other have now put forward a bid to build the runway and have be very clear that they will be invest in the infrastructure to make that possible i welcome investment into britain and i hope that party all across the house will do the same 
 if the chancellor be look for some quick win infrastructure project that will unlock economic growth i recommend take a look at a pass loop on the south fylde line which would well connect train to employment and education site through more reliable service it would also act as a boost for the tourism industry on the fylde coast people across lancashire maybe from other great town such as chorley like to visit lytham st annes and the fylde coast and would be able to do so on half hourly rail service will the chancellor take a look at that fantastic opportunity to boost economic growth in lancashire and the fylde 
 i have huge respect for the hon gentleman and no in this house would want to do anything to upset mr speaker i be very happy to look at investment opportunity in the hon gentleman ’s constituency and right across lancashire include just up the coast in blackpool where we put in significant investment at the spending review early this year to build the housing and infrastructure our country desperately need 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the chancellor once claim that she have a plan for fix the foundation with infrastructure at the very heart now through a consultation that the government hop nobody would notice she have find a way to tax the foundation by look to impose a new levy on quarry labour could add billion of pound more to the cost   of infrastructure project across the country that can not be right can the chancellor please provide the construction industry the very people who will grow our economy with an assurance that this propose builder tax will not go ahead 
 the government be currently consult on a landfill tax it be a consultation and it be open for comment from right across industry but this government be invest in infrastructure compare with the plan that we inherit which would have see capital investment fall as a share of gdp we be instead put an additional £ in as well as £ through the national wealth fund crucially that be leverage in private sector investment in transport infrastructure include road railway and airport and digital infrastructure we be grow the economy a far cry from what the conservatives do in their waste year 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of change to employer national insurance contribution on economic growth 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of increase in employer national insurance contribution on business 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of change to employer national insurance contribution on economic growth 
 minister welcome 
 thank you mr speaker the immediate task face the labour government be to take action to stabilise the public finance and invest in our public service on national insurance we do that in a way that protect the small business by increase the employment allowance from £ to £ that mean that employer will pay no national insurance contribution at all and more than half will either gain or see no change 
 the national insurance increase in last year ’s budget not only increase national insurance but impact on part time worker many of whom the hospitality industry rely on hospitality company in north east fife have write to i directly but they have also start to share with their customer the real impact of the cost increase they be see do the minister agree that there have be an impact on hospitality and will he commit to ensure that the chancellor deliver a hospitality friendly budget come the autumn 
 i thank the hon member for be the parliamentarian today who have not ask i who will you be back in the labour deputy leadership contest i appreciate that very much 
 when it come to small business in particular those in hospitality overall employment have increase by since the government come to power this week i will be have discussion with member of ukhospitality to think about how we can support the sector more through the change to business rate announce last year we will come forward with more detail on that in the budget later this year 
 i be not particularly interested in who the minister be back in the deputy leadership contest but i welcome he to his place lebanese please be a fantastic restaurant in weybridge but like many hospitality company it be struggle with the impact of national insurance increase if the partly new treasury front bench team be consider go for a team lunch i recommend the warm hospitality of runnymede and weybridge where they can see for themselves the impact that this horrid harmful tax be have on local business across the country 
 i would not presume to know where the next treasury ministerial awayday will happen but perhaps we will have to consider the restaurant in the hon member ’s constituency he be a strong advocate for the business in his constituency i hope he know that i advocate from the back benches and will continue to do so in government for policy that we can implement to boost economic growth and living standard so that more people have more money to spend in business such as the he mention in his constituency 
 i have have many meeting with business owner across wokingham whether that be world leader in the defence industry gp surgery medical manufacturer farmer hospitality company or exporter it be clear that labour ’s hike to national insurance contribution have create immense financial burden for those company this policy have prevent many from hire more staff and devastate their profit and it be stifle growth what step be the minister take to give business like those in wokingham hope that this government do have their back 
 the big picture on all of those question be that at last year ’s budget the government make the decision to increase national insurance in order to raise £ we have put that money into our public service make sure that waiting list have fall pretty much every single month since the election that mean that we have deliver more appointment many more people have be see and waiting list be fall in my constituency and across the country that be the difference that this government be make we be repair the foundation and make sure that we can look after people now and in the future 
 this month we see an expansion of childcare that will benefit family in my constituency to the tune of £ which will go back into their pocket what assessment have the minister make of how that spending power will benefit growth across the economy and productivity 
 the investment that this government be make in childcare which will increase the number of hour available to family with child age   month or old be the right investment in the future it be an investment in those child and an investment in make sure that parent can return to work so that we can improve productivity in our country and have more people who be able to get back to work and enjoy the benefit that that can bring 
 uk business confidence have hit a month high accord to the late figure from lloyds banking group do the minister agree that this be due to the work of this labour government not least the consecutive interest rate cut and the new trade deal 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the fact that we have have interest rate cut since the election that have reduce the cost of mortgage for family up and down the country and reduce the cost of borrow for business that be think about investing it be good to see that there be more investment come both domestically and internationally particularly as a result of our investment summit that i be pleased to attend last year 
 when i be elect for the time last year my constituent tell i that they want this labour government to rebuild our public service which be what our tax change be deliver do the minister agree that opposition party of whatever colour want the benefit of our investment in public service but be not willing to take the tough decision to deliver they 
 yes i agree strongly with my hon friend that opposition member continue to will the end they want the spending on public service but be not willing to come forward with a plan for the mean and the money to invest in our public service so that we can change thing for people up and down this country 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the job tax have hit small business the hard with statistic from the office for national statistics show that vacancy among small business alone have drop by this prove that the job tax be not only crush growth but crush opportunity especially in hospitality have treasury ministers commission their official to look at any of the fairer revenue raiser that we liberal democrats have put forward such as taxis on the bank the tech company or the gambling company in order that the treasury could scrap the job tax at the next budget 
 when the liberal democrats be last in government they make the decision to whack up vat on business whereas this government be do all we can to reform business rate so that retail hospitality and leisure industry can get the support that they need from the business rate system the national insurance change that be make last year protect the small business with many see low business rate or not see increase 
 if she will meet farming representative to discuss the potential impact of change to agricultural property relief and business property relief on farmer 
 if she will meet with representative of the farming industry to discuss the potential impact of change to agricultural property relief and business property relief on that sector 
 if she will meet with representative of the farming industry to discuss the potential impact of change to agricultural property relief and business property relief on that sector 
 in my former role as the minister with responsibility for the uk tax system and on the chancellor ’s behalf i have meet farming representative and farmer those discussion have include the national farmers union the tenant farmers association the country land and business association the central association of agricultural valuers the ulster farmers union nfu cymru nfu scotland and the farmers union of wales after listen however the government continue to believe that the approach we have set out be the right 
 last weekend i attend the sennybridge show where i meet young farmer from brecknockshire who be recruit new member and fundraising for good cause there be question to which they would like to hear an answer from the chancellor why be the government target family farm for tax rise rather than go after the big bank which be close branch right across my constituency why should young farmer have to pay for the mess leave behind by the conservatives 
 the hon gentleman talk about good cause i assume he would agree that the nhs be a good cause that public service be a good cause and that a stable economy that encourage investment in our country be a good cause to pursue as hon member have say many time already the opposition party include the hon gentleman ’s be very happy to reap the reward of spending and investment but be totally incapable of take any of the difficult decision to raise the revenue necessary to support they 
 give the prime minister ’s clear commitment to growth that benefit every community in every corner of the uk his ministers will no doubt be disturb at polling show that fifth of farmer have postpone or delay investment since the budget be it not time for a rethink of this policy if not on ground of fairness then on ground of investment productivity and economic growth 
 i have be involve in many debate in this house that the right hon gentleman have be a part of as well and we have set out how the decision we have take mean the system come in from april next year will maintain generous tax relief within the   agricultural property relief and business property relief system while also raise revenue in a fair way to support the public finance that money for the public finance as i and my right hon and hon friend have say many time today be crucial to have economic stability and to get our public service back on their foot 
 the chancellor elicit much public sympathy with her recent tearful appearance on these benches but over the summer i have have dumfries and galloway farmer in tear at the loss of the next generation of farming a new centre for the analysis of taxation report say that hmrc ’s own figure indicate that these change to taxis be unfair and unbalanced will the minister please think again 
 the hon gentleman be wrong the centax report he refer to be independent analysis demonstrate that in its opinion the reform improve on the current position and be expect largely to meet the government ’s objective in fact the report validate the government ’s position 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we liberal democrats oppose the family farm tax but in the spirit of constructive opposition last november i recommend and request that ministers look at the idea of a family farm test such as the one use in france and ireland such a test would ensure that they could close the loophole on big equity company exploit land but it would not cover family farm in the process since i raise that suggestion last november have treasury ministers ask official to look at it 
 as be the normal process in develop any policy we consider a range of option but we have decide that this get the balance right raise revenue in a fair way while offer generous relief within the agricultural property relief and business property relief system let i just say that when i hear the hon lady stand up and begin a sentence with we liberal democrats oppose i be hardly surprised 
 what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of level of government debt interest payment on public finance 
 what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of level of government debt interest payment on public finance 
 we be invest in britain ’s future and put in place the plan need to get britain build again after year of tory failure since the election we have have interest rate cut wage have rise more in the month of this labour government than they do in the year of the previous conservative government and we be the fast grow economy in the g7 in the half of this year 
 i thank the chancellor for that response this year interest on debt be expect to total £ which be of total public spending what be the chancellor ’s plan to rebuild confidence in the gilt market and how confident be she that we will not be relive the bad bit of the 1970 
 the good way to make sure that we continue to have confidence in the gilt market be to keep the tories and liz truss as far away from run the economy as possible we have bring stability back to the economy and there have be cut in interest rate this be in sharp contrast to the disaster of liz truss and the clown show that we witness at the reform conference at the weekend those party would lose control of spending and push up mortgage cost and inflation they have do it before and they would do it all over again 
 so why do the chancellor think that the united kingdom be be charge more in interest even than greece 
 the spread on our gilt over the central bank rate be low in the uk than it be in greece so maybe the right hon gentleman should look again at his evidence the truth be that we have have cut in interest rate since this government come to office we be pay high level of interest on the debt but the debt be accrue by the conservative party which destroy our economy and public service all at once we be fix the mess that the conservatives leave 
 the trust of financial market depend not just on the policy of the government today but on whether we keep that trust tomorrow the opposition squander that trust when they be in government by try to push through tax cut that they could not afford that the uk could not afford do the chancellor agree that labour too have to resist the temptation to duck the tough choice on spending which would not only risk economic stability but hold back growth 
 i very much agree with my hon friend that be why we publish the spending review early this year the review set out plan for day to day spending for the next year and capital spending for the next everything in the review be fully fund and fully cost through the difficult decision that we have to make in the budget last year to increase taxis at the same time the deficit be expect to fall by percentage point of gdp this year 
 both the conservatives and reform want to repeat the medicine that liz truss inflict on this country push interest rate and mortgage through the roof be not the contrast that this government have provide stability and confidence that as a result we have record level of private investment in this country and that we be on the right track to rebuild this country as a success story which can be see in the fact that we have the fast growth in the g7 as well 
 the office for budget responsibility forecast that debt be go to fall during the course of this parliament something that never happen under the conservative government and that the deficit as a   share of gdp will fall by percentage point this year this be a government who have a grip on the public finance and on public spending because of the choice that we make all those choice be oppose by all the opposition party 
 in the spring statement early this year the chancellor say that the responsible choice be to reduce our level of borrow in the year ahead that be a noble sentiment which i applaud if she be not try to fix a watch with a hammer this be the chancellor that have see uk debt interest now soar to a year high while annual debt interest be almost twice the cost of service the ministry of defence give her catastrophic budget what reassurance have she get for scottish business that thing will not get even bad when she finally have her next budget in the winter 
 i will not take any lecture from the snp which have put up taxis on ordinary work people in scotland the snp scottish government have the big settlement since devolution in real term at the spending review this year that be only possible because of the tax change that we make in the budget it be now up to the snp government to use that money wisely and to see waiting list fall in scotland in the way that they have in england and wales waiting list be still rise in scotland what do that say about their government 
 will the chancellor remind we whether the national debt go up or down under the previous government 
 let i just check oh yeah it go through the roof at the same time that our debt level go up we have see our public service whether that be our school our hospital our transport or our infrastructure on their knee the conservative government manage to destroy our public finance our economy and our public service what an achievement that be why there be only of they and they be sit on the opposition benches and they will be there for a long time to come 
 i call the shadow minister 
 uk long term borrowing cost be now consistently above the range of g7 country something that do not occur at any time under previous coalition or conservative government it be because market be price in the specific weakness of this labour government ’s economic policy the cost of that weakness mean rise price low investment and less money for public service in the long term have carpet bomb the private sector with extra taxis will the chancellor rein back the splurge of unproductive public spending that she let rip last year 
 the only person that carpet bomb our economy be liz truss and the conservative party the hon gentleman support liz truss in leadership contest and throughout her time 
 indicate dissent 
 he say he do not but he serve in her cabinet so i will take no lecture from conservative member the country will have hear what the leader of the opposition say today she be talk down our economy in a desperate attempt to get attention the truth be as member on the opposition benches know that that be not serious and it be irresponsible the only thing in britain that need a bail out be the tory party from its fail leadership 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help increase economic growth through reform to the planning system 
 in the spending review we put significant money into build more house as part of our commitment to build home during the course of this parliament the planning and infrastructure bill be currently make its way through the house of lords but more than amendment have be table to it mainly by peer from opposition party the labour party and this government back the builder whereas the opposition party back the blocker they be stop young people get on the housing ladder stop renewable energy be build and stop the transport infrastructure that we desperately need to be build instead of oppose and table amendment the opposition party should back that bill so that we can get britain building 
 i have be bang the drum for some time now that ilford be the good place to live and with elizabeth line station that have never be more true than now bark and dagenham council and redbridge council be both capitalise on ambitious regeneration plan like the development at billet road and padnall lake what be the government do to encourage business to seize on this investment by make investment of their own back ilford its community and its economy 
 i thank my hon friend for everything that he be do to champion ilford south and to bring more investment into his local community it be great to have labour council work with a labour government to bring investment to local community through housing and crucially through infrastructure the school and the doctor surgery that go alongside that new housing so that we build not just home but community 
 as the chancellor try to cut through the bureaucratic red tape around planning outline can she undertake that if successful over the course of the next to month she will share that success with the other region and nation in the united kingdom so that we can all benefit from simplified planning procedure which will bring benefit for all our constituent 
 over the summer i have the opportunity to spend some time in belfast where i visit thales the defence manufacturer and studio ulster where i see some of the fantastic work in the creative industry i also have the opportunity to talk about some of the   blocker to growth we need to well reform our planning system not just in england but in northern ireland and scotland as well so that we can get thing build in britain again people be cry out for hope growth offer hope and investment offer hope and that be what this government offer too 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s commitment to the hope of decent home in my constituency child and family be leave in drove and school be close because of a lack of properly affordable housing she know as i do that whatever we do in planning without the skill that we need to build those home there will be a block there be she work with the new secretary of state for work and pensions who now have the skill brief to ensure that we be invest in those skill and super turbocharging the people who can help to build those home 
 just this september new construction college have start open around the country to train up the next generation of builder plumber and engineer so that we can build both the housing infrastructure and the other infrastructure our country desperately need we have reform the apprenticeship system so that we can have more foundation apprenticeship for a short period of time to quickly get people the skill they need not require people to have a grade c or equivalent in math and english to access an apprenticeship programme be also so important for young child who maybe do not get the grade they want in their gcse but deserve a chance of a good apprenticeship and a job offer a decent wage 
 there be plan permission in this country for property that be as yet unbuilt so maybe the issue be not that the planning law be too restrictive but that they be not prescriptive enough in my constituency the average income need to buy the average house be £ a year—11 time the average income in my community be it not right to ensure that if the chancellor change plan law we have to build more genuinely affordable home in community like ours rather than give developer carte blanche 
 that can not be an excuse though for block development and block people who own land from build more home on that land in the end the simple law of supply and demand mean that if we be not build home price will continue to be unaffordable for the hon gentleman ’s constituent we be not allow builder to build carte blanche and he absolutely know that we put the big investment into the affordable home programme that have ever be see because it be important that the home be build be affordable for family in his constituency and in mine we must not just always block thing whether they be airport housing or other infrastructure we have get to back the builder 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government want to drive growth through house building but even before the departure of the deputy prime   minister they be predict to miss the new home target by half a how do the chancellor and her team of tax raiser think a hike in the builder tax add £ to the cost of build a new home will help to deliver the new home that young people need rather than consult on it why will she not rule out this damaging tax rise 
 i think opposition members will recognise that building company have strongly welcome the reform we have make to get the country building and they be very much against the conservatives the liberal democrats and other in the house of lords oppose the planning and infrastructure bill which could have be give royal assent by now without that opposition instead of scaremongere about something that be be consult on the shadow minister might want to get on and back the positive thing that the government be do 
 finally i pay tribute to the former deputy prime minister my right hon friend   the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner for the amazing work she do to get housing on the agenda to build the home that this country desperately need and for be an inspiration for so many people from working class background i applaud her effort and her work 
 what progress she have make on establish the well future fund 
 what progress she have make on establish the well future fund 
 in july the chancellor announce the well future fund the large social outcome partnership fund in the world to break down barrier to opportunity for up to vulnerable child and young people the fund will boost pupil achievement and could fund programme to reduce reoffende or provide specialist worker for child struggle with exclusion mental health or crime the department for culture media and sport be responsible for the design and implementation of the fund and it be engage extensively with other government departments the impact economy civil society sector and local government partner over the come month 
 the well future fund be a big step forward in work with the impact economy as the chair of the social co operative and community economy all party parliamentary group for the social enterprise sector i be really pleased to see how it can unlock extra resource from social investor private business and philanthropy to tackle the country ’s urgent problem will the chief secretary ensure that the principle behind the fund be match with the target approach advocate by the independent commission on neighbourhoods to make sure that the money go where it be well need 
 i thank my hon friend for his support of what we be seek to achieve through the well future fund he be absolutely right that the fund will be design to ensure that the money go where it be most need and where it will have the big impact principle   i think we can all agree on as i mention early dcms will be work extensively with other departments local partner and other to design the scheme and as it get establish 
 our north east mayor kim mcguinness be take child poverty seriously with the recent announcement of £ for the north east child poverty action plan include funding for a local pilot to expand specialist youth provision and support to open up pathway to future employment opportunity how will the chancellor work with mayor mcguinness from the early stage of development of the well future fund to ensure that it meet the need of child and young people in my constituency of blaydon and consett and across the north east 
 i be pleased to meet kim mcguinness just last week and to hear about the excellent work she be do to champion the north east on the well future fund more broadly we know that the design must truly be a joint endeavour it must be build up through an open dialogue with a range of different partner who will be involve in the delivery i reassure my hon friend that dcms ’s stakeholder engagement include mayoral strategic authority as they will be part of that process 
 the well future fund rightly target the need of vulnerable child and such group be those who be subject to adoption or kinship arrangement last week the department for education announce that it would renew the adoption and special guardianship support fund for year but do not say that it would reverse the cut in per child funding that be announce in the spring do the minister agree that reverse those cut be vital for protect family and keep child in adoption arrangement and will he meet adoptive family from mid sussex so that he can well understand the benefit to the treasury that invest in adoptive family will bring 
 the hon member ask about an important matter as a constituency mp i have meet family who have an interest in the fund and who be in the process of adoption themselves so i know on a personal level from my constituency work how important it be what the department for education be able to announce last week be important in confirm the extension of the fund which will offer some certainty to the affected family i will continue to work with colleague in the dfe to ensure that we be do all we can to support those family who be play such an important role for their child and for society 
 i thank the minister for a very positive answer and for that commitment what step be be take and what discussion have take place to ensure that vulnerable young people in northern ireland can benefit fully from the well future fund particularly in the area most affect by educational disadvantage 
 we want to ensure that the well future fund be target where it be most need and that the investment be spend in a way that really improve life   chance in particular for young people and child who face some of the big challenge ahead i note what the hon gentleman say about the area he represent and the part of the uk he come from it be something we will consider as we develop the detail of the fund 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential merit of undertake a base review of all tax relief before the autumn budget 
 tax relief be an important feature of the uk tax system and his majesty ’s revenue and customs have invest significant resource in improve understanding of their cost and effectiveness since it have produce costing for relief include detailed analysis of the large non structural relief which cost more than £ a year 
 the minister detail that about relief have be assess but my understanding be that more than tax relief be on the book amount to hundred of billion of foregone revenue for the treasury give that the treasury examine the spending of all departments in detail over the summer i wonder whether it be consider apply the same level of scrutiny to itself 
 it be worth note that some of the relief the hon member mention ensure that the tax system operate as intend by define the scope of tax correctly and that it operate fairly and simply i be sorry to disappoint the hon member but i will not be able to comment specifically on any change that we may or may not make to tax relief any decision will of course be announce at the budget which be not today 
 what step she be take to reform the financial service sector 
 our financial service growth and competitiveness strategy set out the government ’s year plan for the sector make clear our ambition that by the uk will be the global location of choice for financial service firm to invest grow and sell their service throughout the uk and to the world to support this ambition the government announce the leeds reform which be the most wide range package of reform to financial service regulation in a decade the reform will turbocharge growth put more money in the pocket of work people and create more good skilled job right across the country 
 i welcome you to your new role 
 i also welcome my hon friend to her new role small business in burnley padiham and brierfield be the lifeblood of our community provide job and livelihood to our people grow manufacturer and exporter such as the brilliant barnes aerospace in burnley be do an excellent job at take britain    across the world will the economic secretary set out what the government be do to support small and medium sized business particularly our manufacturer with access to finance 
 my hon friend raise an important issue and it be very good to hear he champion business in his constituency the government publish the small business strategy in july which set out how we will make the uk the good place to start and grow a business and put sme at the heart of our growth mission that include tackle the barrier that sme face when access finance that be why the government be commit to increase the total financial capacity of the british business bank to £ and introduce a new business growth service which will make it easy and quick for business across the uk to get the help support and advice that they need to grow and thrive 
 i warmly welcome the new economic secretary to her role over the summer i look at issue around liquidity in the london stock exchange and the deterioration that have happen give that only of share trade attract stamp duty and much more trading be conduct in a dark environment will the new economic secretary meet with i to hear my concern and the concern of those in the city so that we can move forward in a positive direction 
 i pay tribute to the right hon member ’s work in this area and i would be more than happy to meet with he to discuss those concern 
 i call the shadow economic secretary 
 i also congratulate the hon member on her elevation to economic secretary to the treasury i be sure she will do very well 
 the uk banking sector provide a valuable service to our economy keep money in circulation fund business and mortgage and all the rest of it the financial service sector be the uk ’s big export sector accord to uk finance uk bank generate around £ in tax every year but because of thing like the bank levy uk bank now pay an effective rate of around which be high than competitor in new york frankfurt dublin and singapore the chancellor of the exchequer have manage to dig her own £ black hole in the economy but can the minister reassure the city of london and this house that there be no plan to increase taxis on our banking and wide financial service sector in the upcoming budget in november 
 order the market will be close soon i call the minister 
 i be grateful for the lecture but i note that it be the conservatives who introduce the bank levy the government be commit to responsibly promote the growth and competitiveness of the sector and of course we keep the bank tax regime under review 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 sorry mr speaker bear with i laughter this government be commit to grow the economy and we be the fast grow economy in the g7 in the half of this year we have do trade deal and cut interest rate time and i do not even need my note to remember all that 
 new polling by the trades union congress show that the public overwhelmingly support package of taxis on wealth on bank and on gambling company it also find that of labour voter who be now lean towards reform back those measure will the chancellor commit to protect work people from high taxis on their income by ensure that wealth pay its fair share rather than impose cut and regressive measure 
 in the budget last year we get rid of the non dom tax status we put up capital gain tax we start treat carry interest as income not as capital gain we introduce new taxis on private jet we put vat and business rate on private school fee and of course we change the rule around agricultural property relief so that people who have farm worth more than £ will pay inheritance tax although at half the rate that everybody else do we take a number of measure last year to ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share 
 some country around the world do have a wealth tax but country like switzerland for example do not have inheritance tax i think it would be a mistake to get rid of inheritance tax and replace it with an unproven tax without know what revenue it would bring in 
 i call the shadow minister 
 may i welcome the new member of the treasury team with their courage in join it i also do so for the shadow chancellor of the exchequer my right hon friend   the member for central devon sir mel stride who can not be with we today may i particularly welcome the new chief secretary who replace the old chief secretary   the right hon member for bristol north west darren jones who be now another new chief secretary 
 early this year labour make a mess of its welfare reform proposal because they be rush out to help plug a £ gap in public finance the result be chaos and a humiliating reversal for the chancellor welfare spending be too high it do need reform and today the leader of the opposition have pledge conservative support to help the government to develop a thoughtful plan on welfare reform will the chancellor take up this offer of support 
 order i remind the shadow minister that it be topical for everybody 
 while the leader of the opposition be talk down the british economy we be set our sight on grow the economy and make work   people well off no we will not be take any advice from the leader of the opposition who be part of a government who crash the economy send mortgage rate spiral and put pension in peril 
 i fear that the chancellor ’s dismissive response fail to acknowledge either the serious state of public finance or the serious difficulty of her own position have extend economic uncertainty until just before christmas will the chancellor at least confirm that the november budget will include saving from welfare reform 
 in the universal credit act which pass before the summer recess we reform the universal credit system to reduce the gap between what people on the health element and those on the standard element get that reform will help more people into work as well as the £ package of measure to help people particularly those who have be long term unemployed get back to work interruption   the hon member for north west norfolk james wild   say that that be spend actually get people into work and pay taxis as well as pay less on benefit be good for the economy and good for those people who get back into work 
 last friday i visit demelza child ’s hospice which do amazing work for child and their family but it need certainty and sustainable funding to survive will the chancellor consider extend the child ’s hospice grant for the next year increase it in line with inflation to help it to plan and deliver those vital service 
 the government be invest £ to improve hospice facility and a furth £ of revenue funding to support child and young people ’s hospice this year that be the big investment in hospice in a generation detail about the funding arrangement for will be set out by the department of health and social care in due course 
 pub be at the heart of the community in north shropshire whether community own pub such as the white lion in ash and the horse and jockey at northwood the bailey head in oswestry which be the campaign for real ale ’s pub of the year or attach to a microbrewery like the stonehouse brewery in morda but all those hospitality business be buckling under the strain of high business rate the national insurance increase and high energy cost may i add my plea to those of my liberal democrat colleague and ask the chancellor that in the upcoming budget measure be put in place to support our struggle hospitality industry 
 as set out at the last budget we will introduce permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure business with rateable value below £ the relief that we inherit from the previous government be due to end entirely in april of this year we extend it for year to give we time to legislate for permanently low tax cut for pub across this country 
 i recently visit the ghost terminal at ashford international train station where year ago eurostar shamefully cease to have its service stop a report last month find that bring back those international train to ashford could benefit our local economy in sussex and kent by over £ which would mean more job and more visitor for my constituent in hastings and rye will the chancellor join i in call on the train operator and the rail regulator to grasp that opportunity for growth 
 i thank my hon friend for the work that she be do to help grow the economy in all part of the country include kent and sussex the government have make significant commitment on the expansion of international rail service and we be work closely with the german and swiss government on direct link between our country work be under way to understand the prospect for expansion of the number of service on the channel tunnel rail link i absolutely agree that new opportunity at ashford and ebbsfleet have huge potential to help grow the economy give more opportunity for people in those community to access good job and other leisure opportunity 
 the pub in my constituency provide vital community space yet they tell i that this government have hit they disproportionately hard with their increase in employer national insurance contribution on top of soar energy price and as yet unfulfilled promise on business rate ahead of the autumn budget will the chancellor say what measure she will take to protect our local independent pub and small business 
 i absolutely recognise that business face challenge but they also have low borrowing cost because of the cut in interest rate which the bank of england be able to make because of the stability that we have return to the economy it would be good to have a bit more honesty from political party if they oppose the national insurance increase then they oppose the extra money for the national health service if they stand up and say that they might get a little more respect and credibility 
 in   macclesfield we be lucky to have a thriving life science sector at astrazeneca we have people employ in well pay job across the pharmaceutical value chain what be the treasury and the government do to ensure that we take advantage of the innovation we produce here in the uk for the benefit of our local life science economy 
 my hon friend be a proud advocate for his constituent in macclesfield and be do great work to bring more investment into the local area life science be of the sector that this government as part of our modern industrial strategy be champion that be why we put record investment into research and development in the spending review early this year and why we be support our university to help create more spinout to ensure that we can have more   home grow british business as well as back the big business such as astrazeneca that operate in his constituency 
 give that the government be consider a dramatic increase in the landfill tax how do the chancellor think that this country will build the home we need by the end of the parliament if we add £ on average to the average house price how will that help my constituent to get a home 
 there be a consultation go on and i welcome the hon gentleman and other feed into that however if he be serious about back the builder and not the blocker why do the liberal democrats fail to support the planning and infrastructure bill both here and in the other house 
 as the rich economy in the world we should not have child live in poverty the former prime minister gordon brown have propose raise £ by look at reform gambling taxation will the chancellor consider undertake those reform so that we can end the epidemic of child poverty 
 the issue of child poverty be incredibly important to this government and the child poverty taskforce will report later this year i would like to add that this be an important personal issue for i i grow up in family with very little money and i receive free school meal as a child for those child across the country who be live in poverty right now i hope that they and their parent know that this government be on their side and that we will do all we can to invest in our welfare system in our economy and in ensure that more people can get into work so that we can get poverty down rather than have it rise as it do under the previous government 
 hiking excise duty by over the past year be expect to raise £ for the treasury in duty on spirit but it have actually cost £ with of spirit produce in scotland this be nothing short of a tax on scotland the chancellor have day to back scotch support scotland and sustain growth in this iconic and entrepreneurial sector will she therefore commit to reverse the government ’s attack on a great scottish success story by bring down whisky duty in the budget 
 over of scotch be export and be therefore not affect by the measure that the hon member have just mention but it will be affect by be the big beneficiary of the trade deal with india which be set to reduce tariff from to initially and then to over time this be what a government get on with back the scotch industry look like 
 i have be campaign for a long time on the reinstatement of tax free shopping for foreign visitor particularly those from europe recent evidence from business suggest that we be lose £ of income from this potential change and £ in extra vat generate from those tourist will the chancellor undertake to look at this matter again the potential exist for those high spend tourist to benefit our hard press hospitality industry and that could be a quick win win for this country 
 this matter be look at by the previous government several time and i understand that there be pressure for their ministers to look at it again they do so and they come to the same conclusion which be not to proceed with reintroduce it 
 the bellfield interchange be situate on the a77 its location have significant strategic importance in the south west trunk road network connect to the a71 the a75 and the a76 make it critical for transport and economic connectivity across the ayrshire region and beyond east ayrshire council have previously submit a bid to the levelling up fund under the previous tory government to upgrade the interchange but it be reject give the chancellor ’s recent announcement of £ of uk government investment in scottish transport infrastructure will my hon friend join i in call on the scottish government to invest in and agree to vital infrastructure project such as upgrade the belfield interchange to support the ayrshire growth deal to unlock growth and to deliver job and prosperity across the region 
 i agree with my hon friend that it be critical that the scottish government use the funding they have receive to invest in vital infrastructure project that support growth and put more money in people ’s pocket 
 rise 
 i be sorry but we have to move on to the urgent question 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade to make a statement on the cyber attack on jaguar land rover and on what assistance the government be give to business to help protect they against cyber attack 
 i welcome the minister to his new job 
 thank you mr speaker i fully recognise the anxiety and deep concern that employee at jaguar land rover and across the supply chain will be feel the government and the national cyber security centre will do everything in our power to help resolve this as soon as possible we be engage with jlr on a daily basis to understand the challenge that the company and its supplier be face and we be monitor the situation closely i have speak to the company myself and i will have a further meeting with the chief executive officer later this week i understand that the company have also invite local mp to a question and answer session this friday 
 the national cyber security centre have be work with jaguar land rover since last wednesday to provide support in relation to the incident i be sorry that there be a limit to what i can say on the specific because i do not want to prejudice the ongoing investigation 
 the cyber security of the uk however be a key priority for the government crucial to protect the public our way of life and the successful grow economy we have be take significant action to help protect business against cyber attack we be reduce cyber risk across the economy by make technology more secure by design that include the product security and telecommunications infrastructure act introduce by the previous government which require manufacturer to build security into the manufacture and operation of internet connect device the software security code of practice which set out how vendor and developer should make their software more secure and the ai cyber security code of practice which set out how ai developer should design and operate ai system securely 
 we be also provide business with the tool advice and support to protect themselves from cyber threat that include the cyber governance code of practice which show board and director how to effectively manage the digital risk to their organisation the highly effective cyber essential scheme to prevent common attack reduce the likelihood of a cyber insurance claim by and a wide range of free tool and support from the national cyber security centre include training for board and staff the check your cyber security tool to test it system for vulnerability and the early warning system to get notify about cyber threat to network i urge all business to take up these tool and improve their cyber defence 
 it be not for i to announce future business of the house but when parliamentary time allow the government will introduce the cyber security and resilience bill to raise cyber security standard in critical and essential service such as energy water and the nhs 
 i be grateful to you mr speaker for grant this urgent question as a north west mp you know what a large employer jlr be in the region as we have hear this serious cyber attack on jaguar land rover have stop production and halt sale and staff have be instruct to stay at home the car plant at halewood in my constituency and in solihull and other production facility around the world have be unable to operate from what have be report jlr shut down its it system in response to the attack i believe that dealership have be unable to register new car and initially at least garage that maintain jlr vehicle be unable to order the part they need 
 the jlr halewood plant in my constituency be an important and value employer many of my constituent be employee which be also the case for my neighbouring merseyside mp thousand of job in the supply chain have be affect i be disappointed that despite the cyber attack happen just over a week ago to of our most important business which have nearly direct employee and of course a huge supply chain no statement have be make to parliament on what action have be take to help the company or to prevent future attack 
 the late attack raise wide issue follow on from the attack on marks spencer the instance in themselves be very worrying would like to believe that all company review their cyber security after the m&s attack if these attack continue there could be an ongoing and even more serious effect on our economy what be the government do to help protect our business from cyber crime i have hear what the minister have say today but it be in our national security interest for they to work closely with business be there an underlying weakness in how business be deal with cyber security in that regard we hear from ciaran martin former head of the national cyber security centre on the today programme this morning suggest that company be perhaps focus more on protect customer datum at the expense of the security of their operation 
 this house need to hear more in the come month about what the government be do to work with business and to help prevent these attack be successful because they be a threat to our economy and to national security 
 i commend my hon friend on seek this urgent question and you mr speaker on grant it my hon friend make the important point that jaguar land rover be not only an iconic national brand but a very significant employer it employ people in the uk include in his constituency and worldwide he be right that we need to ensure that cyber security be something that every company in the land take seriously and every public sector organisation in my previous ministerial role i be conscious of the attack on the british library which be actually of the most financially significant attack heretofore and it point the way for some of the other issue arise across the economy which be why we have be keen to bring forward a bill on this as state in the king ’s speech we will introduce such a bill soon”—i think i can get away with that with the chief whip and the leader of the house although in the word of humpty dumpty when i use a word it mean precisely what i choose it to mean no more and   certainly no less as my hon friend say there be serious issue that we need to address across the whole of the economy to ensure that we get this right 
 my hon friend point to person i point to another richard horne the chief executive officer of the national cyber security centre who recently stress that the uk face increasingly hostile activity in cyber space we simply can not afford any degree of complacency in this there be major criminal operate in this space as well as some malicious state actor and some of company in the uk report last year that they have face some kind of cyber attack it be a very important issue that we take seriously 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i congratulate   the hon member for widnes and halewood derek twigg   on secure this important urgent question i welcome the minister to his new role although i will never be able to rival his literary quotation 
 this attack on jaguar land rover be extremely concern the impact on that world lead business and on its supplier and worker have be significant i hope that the whole house agree that we must use the full force of the state to crack down on cyber criminal i appreciate that the minister be constrain in what he can say but when be the government and the national cyber security centre inform of the attack what kind of support be the government and law enforcement agency able to offer jaguar land rover how much long do the government expect the disruption which be impact on the supply of vehicle to continue 
 the attack be just another in a series against british brand and iconic institution the minister say that of our business have be affect include the attack early this year on marks spencer will he elaborate on what the government be do to prevent future attack have he identify who be responsible for the attack can he rule out its be a state sponsor attack if the group responsible for the attack on jaguar land rover and marks spencer be link what progress have law enforcement agency make in pursue they 
 i be not sure whether the shadow minister be in a new role 
 indicate dissent 
 she be not i will not welcome she to her new role then i welcome she to the dispatch box none the less she ask a series of question and i will try to answer those that i can as precisely as possible 
 the shadow minister ask when the ncsc be notify and engage it have be engage since last wednesday we have an undertaking that when people get in touch with the ncsc the response will be very immediate 
 the shadow minister ask what engagement there be from the government the primary engagement be through the ncsc which be fully engage and devote to the work it be also in the public domain that the information commissioner ’s office be notify i should clarify that that be not because jlr be certain that there have be a data breach but it want to ensure that it have dot every i and cross every t which be why it notify the information commissioner ’s office 
 the shadow minister ask about a timeline for get this resolve i wish that i could provide but i can not i think she will understand why this be a very live situation that have be ongoing for a week i note the point that jlr have be make as i say there will be an invitation for all local mp my hon friend   the member for widnes and halewood derek twigg   should already have have for a q&a session on friday morning when jlr hop that it will be able to provide more information 
 the shadow minister ask what else we be do this summer the home office undertake a consultation on our policy on ransomware i be not say that that relate specifically to this case we do not know that yet and i be not come to any foregone conclusion but that be of the thing that we must address and it be hearten to see resolute support from the vast majority of company in the uk for our ransomware policy maybe we will come to that later 
 the hon lady ask whether i can say who be responsible i be afraid that i can not i note what be in the public domain but i have no idea whether that be accurate and i do not want to impede the investigation she ask whether the attack be state sponsor again i do not want to jump to conclusion and i can neither confirm nor deny anything she also ask whether the case be link with that of m&s. again i can not answer that as fulsomely as i would wish simply because i do not know and i do not think anybody have come to any secure decision on that in sense all cyber attack be link in that it be the same problem which be relatively new the previous government be seek to tackle it and we be seek to tackle it in broadly the same way some of the technique use be remarkably old fashion such as ring up helpline which be design to be helpful that be exactly the same as when news of the world be ring up mobile company and try to get pin to hack other people ’s phone this be an old technique the new bit be that sometimes people use ai generate voice which be remarkably accurate and can lead to further problem i be not say that that be what happen in this case but some of the pattern be across the whole sector 
 i call the chair of the business and trade committee 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for widnes and halewood derek twigg   on secure this urgent question and warmly welcome the minister to his new role this be an extraordinarily serious issue and the business and trade committee will soon table its recommendation on tackle economic harm such as this many company such as jlr now confront a much big threat surface and the peril of state back threat that be why this will be a much big issue in the future and why company in this country will need more than new law they will need new investment incentive to clean up legacy infrastructure that be currently not safe enough 
 when we take evidence from archie norman and marks spencer in the wake of that cyber attack we be give a distinct impression that more could have be do by agency to help m&s. will the minister reassure the house that all the lesson from how the   m&s case be handle have be learn and that the state will bend over backwards to ensure that jlr have every assistance it need to get back up and run and to prosecute the guilty 
 the single most important thing we can do be ensure that we end up prosecute the guilty and that people be send to prison such as the gentleman well the person in the united states of america who be recently send down for year as part of of these network which be important i be a minister in the department for business and trade but the minister for security my hon friend   the member for barnsley north dan jarvis and the under secretary of state for science innovation and technology my hon friend   the member for vale of glamorgan kanishka narayan who be on the front bench be actively engage in these discussion and we must ensure a cross government approach i look forward to what we will hear from the business and trade committee i be intrigue by what my right hon friend be say about investment incentive and i hope he might come up with some clever idea that we could put into practice once he have produce his report 
 on the main point about whether we have learn all the lesson from m&s i certainly think we have i have read archie norman ’s evidence to the committee and i hope that m&s have also learn the lesson that he lay bare i hesitate in try to make too immediate a connection between case and another because as my right hon friend will know i do not want to prejudge what have happen in this particular set of circumstance 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i welcome the minister to his new role there have be a spate of cyber attack on important uk company such as jaguar land rover on supermarket and on the legal aid agency what be the government do to restore public and just as importantly international trust in the uk ’s cyber security network do the government think that the attack have come from overseas 
 that be the time i have be ask whether this attack have come from overseas although i suppose that be a slightly different question from about state actor again i be not go to prejudge the investigation i can tell that the hon gentleman know that because he be smile he refer to uk company but be i speak to any of my counterpart in europe or in most country in the world i would find that they be go through exactly the same issue qantas pandora adidas chanel tiffany co. cisco all those company have have major attack over the past month and unfortunately that be simply a part of modern business it be a despicable practice and a set of criminal action we must prosecute those who be responsible and ensure that they go to jail for a very long time so that we can protect our industry in the uk and co operate with other international agency to ensure that we do the same around the world 
 i congratulate my hon friend and neighbour   the member for widnes and halewood derek twigg   on secure this urgent question i use to represent the halewood plant until boundary change and hundred of my constituent work at that plant with many more work in supplier company they be at home and be pay at the moment but the sunday times report that prospect of a quick end to the saga be limited and that the worldwide shutdown be cost £ a day in lose sale despite request local mp have have no meaningful information from the company although we have a minute zoom call on friday which be a start what can the government do to ensure that this disaster be bring to a close as soon as possible these attack threaten our economy and our national security so what help can the minister offer the company and my constituent at this worrying time thing do not seem to be get any well 
 i pay tribute to my right hon friend for all the work that she and i do together particularly on space in my old job and in her she be an excellent minister to do business with and i slightly fear have she on the back benches as she be a very redoubtable person many supplier include evtec whs plastics sertec opmobility and a series of other be in an even more complex situation than jaguar land rover and i will try to co ordinate the activity that we be do in our department to ensure that we provide every possible support to they i note the tone in which my right hon friend say that mps be get a half hour zoom call on friday i will try to ensure that all mp get the support they need so that they can do the job of reassure their constituent early today i make that point forcibly to jlr and as i say i intend to have a meeting with its chief executive later this week when i possibly can i want to keep mps update either individually in constituency or the whole house 
 i call the father of the house 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman on survive the reshuffle this minister add to the general merriment of the nation so we will miss he when he ’ gone—[laughter we ’re all mortal may i ask a serious question about the public sector as it happen i be an enthusiast for the prime minister ’s idea of a national digital id card as a means of counter illegal working but it raise a whole new spectre if ten of million of people have an id card on their mobile phone in their pocket and malign force russia and elsewhere seek to attack we what work be the government do with their bill and in the national cyber security centre to try to get this right 
 the right hon gentleman be right on point and to take his point a little far datum be a wonderful thing a gold mine in many way but it be also a potential vulnerability we must ensure that if we take people into a digital future with digital id card i be not say that we be but if we be to go down that route or wherever we go for instance with a digital driving licence which we will have soon we must ensure that it be safe secure and that people ’s data be not imperille 
 i do not know what the right hon gentleman mean about i survive i love he too 
 i warmly welcome the minister to his place in the light of the cyber security breach survey publish in april which report that of business and of charity experience a cyber attack last year what step be he take to strengthen national cyber security how be the government work with business and charity to improve prevention and ensure well intelligence sharing as a matter of national security 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who be on the business and trade committee which i will be before next week i think on ransomware of the question be whether we know the full extent of what be go on in the uk that be why we have suggest mandatory reporting it be interesting that more than of business in the uk agree with what be in the consultation that the home office produce in the summer and i hope that we can introduce further measure when the bill come forward i have refer to some of the mean of provide support to business up and down the land but i be happy to fill my hon friend in with more detail if she want to grab i afterwards 
 as have be say jaguar land rover be not the british household name this year to experience cyber attack in a recent business and trade committee meeting the chairman of marks spencer say that he wish that somebody would ride in the cab with they for this experience he feel like there be too much way traffic and not enough dialogue between the government and the business can the minister reassure we that the department have learn those lesson can he reassure we that jaguar land rover be have that way dialogue and that someone be in the cab with it at the moment 
 we want to make sure that be the case as i have say i have speak to jaguar land rover and i intend to have a further meeting with the chief executive later this week though he be depart in november new ministers from the department for business and trade be here our job and our absolute determination be to ensure that business can flourish in this country because in the end business largely pay the bill keep the light on keep the nhs functioning and keep everything go that be why we be determined to have a strong work relationship with business in this and many other area 
 we have hear from my hon friend and the minister how wide the impact of the cyber attack have be across the economy hon member have mention the national security threat the minister give evidence to the joint committee on the national security strategy in his previous role and speak about his confidence in the robust contingency plan in place for critical national infrastructure to quote a phrase he use to what extent do he have the same confidence when it come to cyber attack 
 the evidence that my hon friend mention relate to subsea cable for which i think the situation be robust in fact we have another cut to of the subsea cable during the summer month it be   i think repair within day we be of the good country in the world at repair subsea cable but we be also of the more vulnerable country because we be an island nation i assure he that we minister the under secretary of state for science innovation and technology my hon friend   the member for vale of glamorgan kanishka narayan the minister for security and i will apply exactly the same diligence and lack of complacency to this issue as to the issue of subsea cable 
 i thank   the hon member for widnes and halewood derek twigg   for seek and secure this urgent question it be good to see the minister in his place with his perennially cheerful tiggerish demeanour follow the reshuffle 
 in the royal town of sutton coldfield we be extremely concerned about this incident the minister mention whs plastics which be base in minworth in my constituency i speak to the chief executive yesterday in some detail he have employee and plant and the vast majority of his business go to jaguar land rover the minister will know that throughout the west midland there be probably more than people in the supply chain who be directly affect and i understand that all the factory globally have be shut down 
 may i ask question to the minister and support what be say by the chair of the business and trade committee   the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne can we have an absolute assurance that we will have full help from all the relevant agency of the state and that they be seriously and engage in all this secondly will the minister press for maximum transparency so that the staff who be be send home in very large number and who be naturally very anxious and worried about this issue can be reassure to the great extent possible 
 yes all the agency will be engage to the full possible extent as the chair of the business and trade committee say we will bend over backwards and do everything we possibly can to ensure that this issue get resolve as soon as humanly possible i do not want to say when that will be because i simply do not know if   the right hon member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell   would like to pass on the detail of the chief executive of whs plastics i be very happy to have a call with they and with other in the supply chain later this week it be often not just individual company but the whole supply chain that be affect as for tigger i seem to recall that the final line in the song be 
 the most wonderful thing about tiggers be i ’m the only 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for widnes and halewood derek twigg   for secure this urgent question and the minister for come to the dispatch box jaguar land rover be a value employer in wolverhampton north east and an iconic british brand so the disruption to production and the impact on the wide supply chain have cause much concern what action be be take to protect business and supply chain from ransomware and cyber attack 
 i lay out in my initial answer some of the thing that the government be already engage in such as the ncsc which have have involvement with jaguar land rover since last wednesday there be really good online aid that can help many company work through how they can protect themselves well some of those thing be relatively simple but some be more complex it depend on the size of the organisation as i say we have consult on ransomware as we have say previously pay the criminal do not get we out of the hole they be not to be trust and people should be extremely cautious we do not recommend people pay ransom in any circumstance it do not solve the problem and actually add to the business model of the criminal whom we want behind bar 
 i welcome the minister to his role and thank he for recognise the anxiety of the staff in the supply chain jaguar land rover be a huge employer in my constituency not least because i have the factory in elmdon which employ thousand and there could be an effect on ten of thousand through its supply chain many of my constituent will be really anxious not least because there be a lack of information at the moment i echo the comment of   the right hon member for liverpool garston maria eagle   about briefing for mp can the minister reassure my constituent that this government will give the ncsc all the resource it need to pursue the perpetrator i be more than happy to work with he on that give the report of loss be make every day have there be any request for financial support be he talk to chancellor about anything like that or be it too early to say 
 i be tempt to say that it be too early to say as the hon gentleman give i that get out clause at the end the main thing i want to ensure be that all mp have the information they need on a secure basis so that they can provide reassurance to their constituent i be sure that there will be all sort of rumour spread around some of which may be very wide of the mark and i want to ensure that jlr be able to provide information to everybody we be go into recess next tuesday otherwise i would have be more than happy to gather mps to have these discussion in a private setting it be probably good if we see how we go on friday i do not think that half an hour will suffice for a zoom call with jlr i will make that point to the chief executive
