the current law prohibit the sale of vape to under-18 year old we be not propose a change in the law on the prohibition of sale i be simply highlight that young people grow and those who become addicted to vape under the age of be much more likely to carry that addiction into young adulthood that be the point that i be seek to make we can expect a pipeline of young people become addict to vaping which may stay with some of they for the rest of their life 
 this government have be asleep at the wheel on child and vaping they have the opportunity to vote for measure to protect child from vape last year but fail to do so the measure that the minister have announce most recently be well late than never but be simply inadequate to the task ash be clear that while educate young people on the risk of vape through a new resource pack for school be welcome the evidence suggest that education alone will not stop child from vape 
 there be substantial evidence on what work in reduce smoking rate among child in when england start monitor smoking rate among child just in child be a current smoker year later in the proportion be exactly the same not because child be not educate about the danger but because adolescent be risk taker between and smoking rate among child fall from to just 3%—not because of well education or enforcement but because the regulatory framework during that time ratchet up year by year under the last labour government all point of sale advertising and display of tobacco be prohibit a comprehensive anti smuggling strategy be implement by hmrc and the uk border force which dramatically reduce sale of illicit tobacco and cigarette be put in standardised packaging with all the brightly coloured glamourise packaging remove 
 what be true for the strategy to tackle smoking be true for the challenge of vaping without much tough regulation we will not succeed in drive down vaping among child and young people regulation on packaging advertising and labelling be essential labour be call on the government to ban vape from be brand and advertise to appeal to child and to work with local council 
 i reassure the hon lady that work be go on in that space my ministerial colleague from the department for work and pensions be look at this and will be update the house shortly 
 the minister for women and equalities be ask 
 when she plan to bring forward legislative proposal to ban conversion practice 
 the government remain committed to publish a draft bill on ban conversion practice for pre legislative scrutiny by a joint committee of both houses in this parliamentary session 
 it be now over year since the government make a commitment to legislate on conversion therapy and more recently there be a promise that legislation would be table this spring can the minister elaborate on some of the reason for the delay and perhaps be more clear about when the legislation will be bring forward 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that we be absolutely committed to introduce the bill in its draft stage as soon as possible it be a complex matter it be something that i have feel very passionately about over many year but it be right that we get the legislation right i hope that we will be able to present it as soon as possible 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 do my right hon friend agree with i and indeed with the former prime minister that conversion therapy be abhorrent if he do agree do he think it be abhorrent for everyone 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for her question i absolutely agree that it be abhorrent moreover it do not work that be a serious point yes i do believe that that be with regard to everyone 
 give that the minister have agree that conversion therapy be abhorrent and give what my hon friend   the member for north down stephen farry   say about year have pass since we be tell that it would be ban we be then tell that the bill have be scrap then that it would be come back and then that it would come back with a loophole about consent do the minister   agree that that confusion be cause unacceptable stress confusion and fear among the lgbt community will the government commit to end the confusion soon 
 i do not want anybody in the lgbt community to feel fear i have have that experience myself and i would not wish it on anyone that be why we be make sure that the bill be a good bill that deliver good law to ensure that we outlaw those abhorrent practice i recognise that the delay have cause some issue for the community but i assure they that we be on their side 
 through my personal dealing with the minister i know how much he be committed to make sure that this legislation come forward can he reassure i that despite what some have say the bill be not about stop parent from have meaningful conversation with their child who may be question their sexuality 
 my hon friend raise an important point that be why we need to consider the evidence carefully those conversation that parent have with their child be really important i will never forget the conversation i have with my mum and dad who help i when i be come out 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 some day have pass since the government promise to ban conversion practice that be long than it take to make a good bill it be long than it take to build the empire state building and the shard put together we be tell in january that a bill would be publish shortly month later can the minister tell lgbt people how many more day week month or even year they must wait 
 i refer the hon lady to the answer i give a moment ago 
 the answer that the minister give a moment ago be that we would see something before the end of this parliament i be afraid that be not good enough for those lgbt people who have be wait for too long 
 i will ask the minister another question we hear from the government during their consultation on this ban even that be almost year ago now that they would let some of the bad practitioner off the hook by include a consent loophole do the minister seriously think that lgbt people can consent to abuse and if not will he end the charade and remove that loophole so that every lgbt person be protect 
 i respectfully say to the hon lady that she have not see the bill yet so it be a bit early to make those comment this be exactly why we be make sure that a joint committee of both houses look at the bill it be a very complex piece of legislation we want to make sure that it outlaw those awful practice but also ensure that people clinician parent teacher and so on do not feel a chilling effect it be right that we get stakeholder and people from this house engage in that process so that when the bill be present to the house for debate it be in the good possible position 
 what discussion she have have with the secretary of state for work and pensions on increase the uptake of pension credit among old people 
 since april last year we have be run a substantial campaign to raise awareness and increase take up there be strong indication that this campaign be work application for pension credit be around high in the year to may than in the same period the year before 
 my retired constituent from dennistoun to ruchazie from carntyne to blackhill and across the north and east of glasgow know that i be a champion for their right that be why i set up the all party parliamentary group on pension credit and why i and my team have sit with hundred of old constituent and help they to apply for pension credit which be after all their right i choose to do this as a constituency mp but it be our role to champion the right of old people and the minister be not tell i anything that be give i any comfort that she be actually go to champion they when will she start do that 
 i thank the hon lady for the work that she do for her constituent many mp use the help to claim service or the benefit calculator to assist constituent i think she will be keen to know that the minister responsible for pension my hon friend   the member for sevenoaks laura trott announce the innovative invitation to claim trial which will be hold in local authority across great britain this summer it will involve the department for work and pensions send letter to pensioner household identify by housing benefit datum and most likely to be entitle to pension credit that be on top of the wide range communication we be already do 
 i thank my hon friend for the answer she have give clearly there be a reluctance among people who be entitle to this benefit to actually claim it what action be she take to break down that taboo so that people who be fully entitle to this money and desperately need it actually claim it 
 i thank my hon friend for that point because some people do not come forward it be in their make up we need to help they to be encourage that they be absolutely entitled to the benefit i reassure he that the dwp receive around claim in the week in the run up to   may which be up compare with the corresponding week in so the action we be all take be work 
 what step she be take to help ensure that public body implement the requirement of the equality act 
 the government have publish a range of advice and guidance to help public body comply with the equality act the equality and human rights commission also publish technical guidance on comply with the public sector equality duty i will shortly be reissue my december update to ministers on how to comply with the public sector equality duty especially when it come to complete equality impact assessment and i hope that that be distribute widely 
 with the met police force reluctant to investigate murderous threat towards sit mp for their lawfully protect belief and characteristic a convict criminal call for violence against woman at trans pride incoherently defend as freedom of expression by that same force and broadcaster journalist faith leader and even the equalities and human rights commissioner for scotland all have have their bank account close for what appear to be their lawfully protect characteristic will the minister meet i and other affected member to consider how we tackle this dangerous misinformation rampant homophobia and misogyny be promote in our institution by organisation such as stonewall 
 i take the point that the hon gentleman have make very seriously and i would be very happy to meet he we be a free and fair society and we must protect free speech and allow open discussion as long as it do not break the law 
 on bank account closure bank and other payment service provider occupy a privileged place in our society and it would be a serious concern if financial service be be deny to anyone exercise their right to lawful free speech i need to express this a notice period of fair and open communication with a customer must apply in those situation that relate to termination on ground other than suspect or actual criminal offence or when otherwise allow by law the government be currently review evidence on whether the exist payment service and account termination framework be operate effectively or if further clarification be need 
 we be all delighted that the government appoint an independent inquiry chair by lord etherton to look into the disgraceful treatment of lgbt soldier sailor and air people before and the fact that those wrong have not yet be put right that report be give to the government some week ago now and i understand that the government have say they will produce it before the summer will they also answer the report at that time will they give we a date for it and will there be an oral statement in this house so we can quiz the government on the report 
 i will speak to my ministerial colleague in the ministry of defence who have receive the report and ensure that my hon friend receive a response 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help increase the number of female lead business 
 i be work with cabinet colleague to harness the skill innovation and talent of uk female entrepreneur and widen opportunity for the next generation of woman set up business that be why we launch a woman lead high growth enterprise taskforce build on the work of the rose review it bring together some of the country ’s most successful female entrepreneur lead by the founder of starling bank anne boden 
 i thank the minister for her answer we have brilliant successful female entrepreneur across anglesey include laurel knight at medic lynne farr at the beaumaris artisan market helen evans at the amlwch artisan studio and jo weir at beau ’s tea rooms we also have some fabulous successful male entrepreneur such as celfyn and emrys furlong they be support by organisation such as alison cork ’s make it your business the british library ’s business and ip centre the federation of small businesses wales and small business saturday uk how be this government support those organisation to broaden their reach and empower even more fabulous female entrepreneur 
 my hon friend rightly mention some of the highly successful initiative lead by entrepreneur male and female across anglesey which we fully support those be exactly the sort of organisation that we like to see flourish across the uk just last week i speak to the woman and enterprise all party group alongside my hon friend   the member for north warwickshire craig tracey that be attend by female entrepreneur from across the country who talk about how the government be invest in woman and how the rose review and the high growth enterprise taskforce be have an impact on their life and business 
 pathway a new approach for woman and enterprise be commission by the scottish government it have begin to implement along with key stakeholder include enterprise agency the scottish national investment bank and private investor way to include under represent part of society in the business system what step be the uk government take to weave inclusivity through the business support system in a similar fashion to that in scotland 
 we believe that business be well place to do that themselves and we provide as much advice guidance and support as possible for example the british business bank have lead many scheme and initiative to promote inclusivity in the workplace however if there be something specific where the hon gentleman think there be a gap in the market i would be happy to hear about such an initiative 
 i call the shadow minister 
 under the conservatives just of executive director of ftse company be woman a gap that will not close until at the current rate woman who want to go into business can not wait for the conservatives to get their act together they need a new deal for work people a review of the gender pay gap and a menopause action plan in the workplace that be labour ’s pro business pro women plan to smash the glass ceiling and break down the barrier do the minister have a plan 
 i be afraid that the shadow front bench spokeswoman be confuse all sort of different thing ftse director be not the one who need support get into the workplace she be talk about a menopause action plan but we have have complete and deliver it while labour member be just talk about bring in which show that they be not pay attention we be the only one who will be do what be right to promote gender equality in the workplace 
 if she will hold discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential merit of include policy relate to man on the list of government equalities office responsibility 
 the government be already take action to improve outcome for man and boy for example through the introduction of share parental leave man now have more opportunity to take time away from the workplace to care for their child we continue to work closely across government to embed equality policy for both man and woman 
 i thank the minister for her answer but do she believe that there should be a minister for men as there be a minister for women 
 i thank my hon friend for his hard work in this space as chair of the all party group on issue affect man and boy he know this be with my health hat on of the work that we be do to improve lung cancer outcome for man and about the suicide prevention strategy that will be come forward we know that middle aged man be at particular risk i reassure he that the equality hub have responsibility for both man and woman to ensure equality for all and i will speak to the minister for women and equalities so that we can be clear about how that work impact on man 
 current legislation require all public facility to have sanitary bin in female and gender neutral toilet however as highlight by the boys need bins campaign hygiene bin need to be provide in man ’s toilet what step be the minister take to introduce legislation that address that issue 
 i reassure the hon lady that work be go on in that space my ministerial colleague from the department for work and pensions be look at this and will be update the house shortly.[official report   july vol c. 9mc 
 what step the government be take to help tackle a gender and b racial inequality in the workplace 
 what step the government be take to help tackle a gender and b racial inequality in the workplace 
 the government have take numerous step to tackle gender and racial inequality in the workplace as see    with the comprehensive action outline in our landmark inclusive britain strategy as well as various initiative to support woman in the workplace as outline in our inclusive britain report we be work towards a new voluntary inclusion confident scheme to support employer on clear manageable advice on effective diversity and inclusion intervention 
 like most thing in this place this government ’s policy on parental leave be in the dark age research by pregnant then screwed show that well pay parental leave for all parent would bring well equality in the labour market yet this government seem dog in their determination to stand still why be the government block great gender equality in the workplace 
 i completely disagree with the hon lady this government have do more than any other to promote gender equality in the workplace include bring in policy such as share parental leave we have also bring in extend redundancy protection for those on maternity leave and introduce carer ’s leave and we be support legislation to strengthen the protection against harassment in the workplace 
 a new report from the fawcett society show the motherhood pay penalty and how mother with child take home less income than woman without child impact on a woman ’s income and earn power throughout her work life it compound the effect of the ethnicity pay gap will the uk government tackle that by make flexible work the default and introduce mandatory gender and ethnicity pay gap reporting 
 we have just finish a private member ’s bill that make the right to ask for flexible work mandatory that strike the right balance for business rather than make it mandatory for people to demand flexible working not every business can provide it and it be not something that will improve equality in the workplace 
 when i ask black and minority ethnic resident in basingstoke about their experience at work their response be concern i have be work especially with our big local employer the local education authority and the nhs to tackle the issue what be my right hon friend do to ensure that public service be exemplar when it come to race equality in the workplace 
 if my right hon friend see the work that we have put into our inclusive britain strategy she will see that almost everything that be in action be about the public sector there be so much we can do to promote racial equality in the workplace but we need to do that fairly and transparently as well as universally the equality act protect characteristic not group if she would like to work with i on any specific initiative i would be keen to hear more from she about what she have be work on 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 there be grow concern about new technology such as artificial intelligence and automation software be use in recruitment and employment study show that ai   perpetuate bias across gender race age and disability as well as dialect and regional difference of speech what recent assessment have the minister make of the equality impact of ai use in recruitment and the workplace have she raise that with cabinet colleague 
 yes i have raise it with cabinet colleague in fact i have a meeting with the government chief scientific officer just last week on this issue it be a concern that ai can embed bias and that mean we need to look at the dataset and large language model that be inform the ai be use equality impact assessment apply to the public sector equality duty and much of ai be be do in the private sector we will do our part but i be keen to hear from member about specific initiative that they think can help 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 in february this year we announce the stem recharge pilot to support parent and carer back into science technology engineering and mathematic role since then we have recruit and train the cohort of engineering and technology returner in the midland and the north of england they have receive personalised training and support to help to get they back into the workforce and we be now recruit a cohort who will use insight and lesson learn from the pilot to develop new guidance so that stem employer across the uk can benefit from the full wealth of the return stem group 
 the summer holiday which be approach see a spike in domestic abuse do my right hon friend agree that it be important that people know there be help available will she lend her support to the campaign i be run in basingstoke with the police and crime commissioner donna jones to help to make sure that victim of domestic abuse in north hampshire know they be not alone and that there be help there 
 i agree with my right hon friend   it be important that people know where to go for   help when they have experience domestic abuse the government be provide police and crime commissioner with dedicated ringfenced funding for at least independent sexual violence and domestic abuse adviser and will fund an additional bring the total to more than by 
 the cost of live crisis disproportionately affect disabled constituent who be reliant on specialist diet and equipment and now face increase food and energy cost will the minister confirm what cross governmental action the government can take   to well support disabled constituent with those additional cost 
 the government recognise the challenge for disabled people and those with health    condition the £ disability cost of live payment should be see as part of the overall package the benefit calculator on gov.uk will help people to claim the wide benefit that be out there that be just of the payment 
 last week i host the institute of physics and its campaign to increase diversity in physics which be the most popular a level for boy but only the for girl what step be my hon friend take to encourage more girl to study physics beyond gcse 
 study stem a level such as physics can boost potential earning and with a grow demand for student with stem qualification in the job market it be important that girl take that opportunity we be therefore work with the department for education in fund the inclusion in schools project which be design to increase the uptake of a level physics among student from under represent group include girl 
 homelessness be on the rise and it disproportionately affect young lgbt+ people the youth lgbt+ homelessness charity albert kennedy trust have report a increase in new referral over the past year will the minister work with cabinet colleague to well understand the specific challenge that people in the community face with homelessness and look at what more can be do to support they 
 the hon lady raise a very important point i be pleased to report that i have meet colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities and we have hold a roundtable to discuss exactly those issue of the key element which we really need to do be to gather the datum so that we can well understand some of the cause and what the solution might be to help those people 
 how many discussion have the secretary of state have with department for education colleague about forthcoming guidance on trans identify child 
 i have be work closely with the education secretary because it be important that we get the guidance for school right it must show school how to be compassionate to pupil question their gender in a way that be compliant with the equality act include ensure that single sex space be maintain and the safety and wellbeing of all pupil be not compromise 
 conversion therapy should be ban entirely not with a voluntary loophole as this government intend which we know mean that conversion therapy will be open to coercion the loophole be so large that it will leave any bill meaningless will the minister commit to a full ban on conversion therapy as support by organisation such as stonewall and time for inclusive education in scotland 
 the hon lady raise some important point that be exactly why we have take considerable care to engage with a whole range of stakeholder to consider all the issue that need address it be precisely because of those point that we be go for pre legislative scrunty so that all of those issue can be look at again to ensure that we present the very good bill to help people who be subject to these horrible crime 
 gambleaware figure show that the number of woman seek help for problem gambling double between and with up to woman deem to be at risk datum also show that woman be less likely to participate in sport bet instead they be more active in online bingo and casino style game what work be my right hon friend do with cabinet colleague to highlight the risk of online gambling to reduce stigma and to help woman seek treatment 
 my hon friend raise a really important point we recently publish the gambling white paper in which we address a number of those issue stigma be a very important we want people to come forward and get the treatment they need we be also introduce a statutory levy on gambling operator to ensure that we have the prevention and treatment need to help those suffer with gambling harm 
 early this year the government cut almost £ of funding for a save the children programme provide education and other service to girl in afghanistan despite a promise to put woman and girl at the heart of the foreign commonwealth and development office ’s work will the secretary of state work with colleague at the department to deliver on the government ’s commitment and reinstate that funding 
 educate girl be of the top priority under the british government ’s international development strategy indeed it be the way to change the world over the last year for which figure be available the british taxpayer procure a decent education for more than child in the poor world 
 the prime minister be ask 
 whether he have make an assessment of the impact of a potential reduction in oil production by saudi arabia and russia on domestic energy price 
 i have be ask to reply 
 global oil price have remain largely stable this year this have not change follow the announcement of additional production cut by saudi arabia and russia we expect that the impact of the cut will be   mitigate by the increase in supply from other producer and a decrease in global oil demand as we have see previously 
 if we want to insulate ourselves from future price rise we need to invest in a greener future the united states get it it have commit $ to net energy the european union get it it be set to match that figure in scotland we get it we have the ambition to lead the world on renewable energy we have the energy but not the power why be westminster try to block scotland ’s path to a safe green future 
 we of course will continue to invest in renewable but i say to the scottish national party that we should also invest in our energy independence and that mean invest in the north sea if we fail to invest in the north sea we will be more reliant on foreign producer and we will have high carbon emission as we import from elsewhere 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday july 
 my right hon friend the prime minister be in vilnius attend the nato summit it be an opportunity to build on the work we have do over the past year strengthen nato and support ukraine in addition to my meeting in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 new labour ’s old mantra be education education education its new seem to be tax education tax education tax education do the deputy prime minister share my disgust at labour ’s plan to tax education of choice which could lead to pupil be send into the state sector with a cost to the taxpayer a number of english language school in my constituency be concerned that this will also apply to they as well as to out of hour tuition and sport training do the deputy prime minister object to those measure as strongly as i do 
 once again we have see the labour party put the politic of envy above the interest of child in this country as my hon friend rightly highlight recent analysis show that it could lead to over pupil leave the school they be in place further burden on exist school and cost £ 
 i call the deputy leader of the opposition 
 i know you be a keen historian mr speaker so i look up the last time a prime minister miss session in a row for other engagement it be march i be very proud to be fill the boot of lord john prescott but i think it be safe to say that the deputy prime minister be no heseltine john prescott ask why be it that in tory britain ten of thousand of family be face repossession negative equity and homelessness can the deputy prime minister tell we year later why i be have to ask the same question 
 clearly the right hon lady do not listen to my previous comment the prime minister be at nato of course that would not be a problem if she have have her way her old boss want to abandon ukraine abolish the army and withdraw from nato and he certainly would not be go to any summit when it come to house building i will take no lecture from the labour party on home ownership my parent would not have be able to buy their own home if it be not for margaret thatcher and the reform introduce by her government and this government be build on those with record house building 
 i think the right hon gentleman be take lesson from the former prime minister on tell the fact the last labour government work hard to dramatically reduce the number of child in temporary accommodation but under the tories the number of homeless child have rise by i be proud of our record on tackle child poverty do the right hon gentleman feel ashamed of his 
 i will tell the right hon lady what this government have do we have lift child out of child poverty we have introduce the national living wage something the labour party totally fail to do and we have increase the national living wage by the large amount ever mean £ for work people and cut their taxis by double the personal allowance that be the sure way to ensure we lift people out of poverty and it would never have happen under the labour party 
 it be like the ghost of prime minister past i tell the right hon gentleman that he should be careful about the stat he use because the child ’s commissioner warn the other prime minister about peddle false narrative on child poverty around those figure the truth be that rise bill soar mortgage and plummet real wage be push more and more family to the brink those already struggle be be hit hard by the tory mortgage bombshell and rise food cost so can the right hon gentleman tell we how many primary school child have be push into poverty since his government take power 
 i say to the right hon lady that it be this conservative party not the labour party that extend free school meal to all and year old something the labour party fail to do and that sit alongside many measure we be take to help people with the cost of living we pay half of family energy bill last winter fund by our windfall tax and we be freeze fuel duty help family with childcare and deliver on our pledge to reduce the debt it may come as a surprise to she but balance the book mean more than work out how many more million to take from her union paymaster 
 once again the right hon gentleman talk about balance the book his party crash the economy and he seem to be completely oblivious to what it be like for work people in this country at the moment new research out today show that more   primary school age child be grow up in poverty since his government come to office why do he think that be 
 i will take absolutely no lecture whatsoever from the labour party about how we help child in the most need it be record investment from this government in education—£2 more this year £ next year which be give those very child the good possible start in life ensure that we have the high reading standard in the western world i have to say to the right hon lady her leader say he hat tree hugger but they seem very keen on hug that magic money tree 
 the right hon gentleman do not even acknowledge that child poverty be rise let alone explain why what hope have he get of solve it let i try a simple question how many kid do not have a permanent address today compare with when labour leave office in 
 we can exchange all these number across the dispatch boxes but these be the number that matter there be few people in absolute poverty under this government few child few pensioner and few people of work age because the single good route out of poverty be a job and record number of people—4 more under this government have get a job that be the difference between this conservative party and the labour party which always leave office with unemployment higher 
 what matter be what people feel every single day at the moment go to work yet they can not afford their mortgage their rent or their bills because of this conservative government there be more child without a permanent address today compare with when the tories take office year ago we have go from a labour cabinet focus on tackle child poverty to tory ministers who will not even admit the problem just as in march they can offer only excuse not answer john prescott ask michael heseltine that day 
 how can the right hon gentleman be so complacent in the face of the sheer misery create by the government ’s policies?”—[official report   march vol c. 
 year on why be we ask the exact same thing 
 i know there be an opposition reshuffle come up but this audition for john prescott ’s old job be get a little bit hackneyed it be this government who have lift child out of poverty i hear the right hon lady claim that labour be the party of work people but under their policy people can not even get to work they support just stop oil protester block our road they support their union paymaster stop our train and of course they support the hat ultra low emission zone stop car across our capital while conservative get britain move labour stand in everyone ’s way 
 give that the mansion house compact do not encourage our pension fund to invest specifically   in british company what more can the government do to encourage great investment in our company especially climate technology start up which increasingly be go abroad to find the funding they require to the benefit of our competitor 
 my hon friend raise an important point about both start up capital and ensure that we get more money to high growth company the chancellor ’s pension compact be a very important step forward which will unlock £ of additional investment i be quite confident that large amount of that will go to uk company and it sit alongside measure such as the edinburgh reform to financial service which will help improve financial service in this country and unlock money for those industry 
 i call the snp deputy leader 
 last month the deputy prime minister dismiss warning from the snp benches that mortgage rate be nearly back to where they be after the disastrous mini budget this week mortgage rate have surpass those level how high do they need to go before he and his government take this seriously 
 the hon lady know people around the world know that the driver of high mortgage rate be high inflation and high inflation be cause by russia ’s invasion of ukraine and by the post covid supply chain what we have to do be make sure that we halve inflation it be only by get inflation under control that we will be able to get mortgage rate down and that require discipline discipline on spending on public sector pay and on energy supply all of which be lack from the snp 
 the bank of england predict that mortgage payment will rise by at least £ for a household the prime minister say that people need to hold their nerve the chancellor say just last night that mortgage holder should just shop around speak of his own party   the hon member for south west devon sir gary streeter   say 
 if the circus do not stop by christmas it ’ over 
 do the deputy prime minister understand that people can not afford to wait until christmas and that they need help right now 
 the fundamental thing that we have to do be to halve inflation that be an approach that the international monetary fund strongly endorse because high inflation drive high mortgage rate but that be not all we be do with the mortgage charter sign up to by of mortgage provider we be give people help to extend their term to go interest only and to reduce their monthly payment that action be support by martin lewis a real money save expert unlike the big spender on the snp benches 
 last year i visit abbeyfield house in wednesfield and be impress by the model of assisted living for old people that give they the independence of a self contain flat but the ability to eat and socialise together i be deeply concerned   to hear that a consultation be under way to close   abbeyfield house in wednesfield i go back there to speak to old people and they unanimously want to stay there abbeyfield be a charity his majesty the king have be a patron for year now and it can not meet the cost of update the estate to meet environmental standard will my right hon friend meet i to see what support the government can offer to abbeyfield so that resident do not have to leave the home they love 
 i be of course very happy to give my hon friend that assurance i note that we have provide £ of additional funding for social care and discharge on energy specifically we have an energy advice service to support small business and we have be pilot new audit and grant scheme that may also help 
 in january emily book an appointment with her local dentist in chard somerset for   june only to be tell by a neighbour at the end of may that the surgery have close in april emily no long have a dentist all the remain surgery be not take on any new patient and emily do not know what to do so will the deputy prime minister tell emily and million of people like she when they can get an appointment with a local nhs dentist 
 the right hon gentleman may have miss it but our nhs workforce plan be invest an extra £ into training and retain crucial nhs staff include dentist and gps the number of dentist will rise by i say to people across that constituency that the good way they can ensure well service for their nhs be to vote for faye purbrick the conservative candidate 
 will the deputy prime minister let we know when we can expect allocation from round of the levelling up fund when it come will it be true to the prime minister ’s pledge that all part of the country will benefit include the south east and most particularly the very deserving town of andover 
 as well as my right hon friend have be an excellent minister i know how committed he be to the town of andover we will shortly announce the new approach to the round and further detail will follow shortly 
 there be thing we encounter in political life that be certain to horrify appal and sicken we but i do not think i have ever see anything quite so grotesque as the painting over of a child ’s mickey mouse mural as the home office do at a detention centre in kent no minister have so far rouse the necessary compassion or concern to speak out about this will the deputy prime minister look into the deep recess of his soul and simply condemn it 
 i will tell the hon gentleman what real compassion look like stop the vile people smuggle trade across the channel that be condemn woman and child to death this government be   take action to deal with it through our stop the boat bill which the scottish national party shamefully vote against time last night

 as my right hon friend the chancellor set out in his autumn statement we be explore the good approach to consumer protection from april as part of wide retail market reform i reiterate that we pay half of energy bill in scotland last winter thank to the strength of our union 
 may i remind the deputy prime minister and the house that yesterday be national remembering srebrenica day may i particularly point out a little know fact british soldier take about civilian out of srebrenica in april those british soldier be from b squadron 9th/12th lancers it be not widely know but under my command they save a huge number of life by take those people out of srebrenica they too should be remember for their very gallant action because it be very dangerous

 it be thank to the strength of our united kingdom that record sum be go to wales under the barnett consequential indeed in the spring budget we increase devolve administration funding by £ which include £ for the welsh government we be ensure that resource be go to wales so that they can enhance their transport infrastructure

 we all love the diversity of wildlife in this country and particularly on the north norfolk coast which my hon friend represent he make a strong point about the balance between that and ensure that people have access to modern communication facility and i shall certainly take that up with natural england 
 day in day out the public and business be hit by endless chaos and confusion across government departments for they clearly britain be not work paraphrase what the deputy prime minister say early we know there be a government reshuffle come up so will he tell we be this down to obstruction and incompetence in the civil service or be it rather that so many of their ministers be just not up to the job 
 we can see from the record of this government whether on cut nhs waiting list or on provide record funding for our school and hospital that we have an excellent team who will continue to serve 
 last week we all celebrate the anniversary of the nhs but hon member may not be aware that it be also the anniversary of newton aycliffe a new town in my constituency design by william beveridge will the deputy prime minister ask the prime minister to come and visit i as his constituency neighbour and celebrate these year and indeed the year of the community newspaper provide by the howarth family

 the day i have to phone my bank to tell it that i be have difficulty pay my mortgage be that have live with i for year i find that because my income be so low at the time ironically i be not eligible to switch to an interest only mortgage or get any help i never want my constituent to feel the terror and abandonment that i feel that day can the deputy prime minister understand that the complete lack of empathy in his response to the deputy leader of the snp group suggest not i welcome the temporary measure but they be temporary this mortgage crisis have be year in the making do he and the prime minister really think they be go to fix it in month 
 it be deeply disturbing upsetting and worry for anyone to contemplate lose their home that be exactly why my right hon friend the chancellor have introduce the mortgage charter which of the mortgage market have now sign up to and which will provide support to people in addition after month people on universal credit can apply for further support 
 a government survey have show that of british business support improvement to the uk ’s sick pay system yesterday my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland   launch a report alongside wpi economics and the centre for progressive change with idea about how that could be do will my right hon friend the deputy prime minister ensure that we get a meeting with the chancellor ahead of the autumn budget to see what idea can be develop they could provide an economic boost of £ to the uk economy 
 as ever my hon friend have make a strong case the chancellor be sit next to i and i be quite sure he would be delighted to meet with he 
 the forced isolation of people in care home or hospital from their love one from the beginning of the pandemic and its terrible consequence as well as the many who die alone have leave a profound trauma we have learn the hard way that the care of a love be not an optional extra it be an essential part of dignified care my care supporters bill would guarantee that fundamental right while the government recognise that there be a problem their recently announce consultation relate to visit and not a legal right to a care supporter at all time would the deputy prime minister speak to the prime minister about bring forward legislation in the next king ’s speech 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight the need for care supporter to be able to have that kind of access i will take away the point he have raise and raise they with my ministerial colleague 
 mr speaker you know the value of inter parliamentary relation and in particular the inter parliamentary union which be found nearly year ago in this place we be honour this week to be join by the president of the inter parliamentary union mr duarte pacheco would my right hon friend join his campaign to get the usa to rejoin this important international organisation 
 as my right hon friend know the united kingdom be a found member of the inter parliamentary union i would very much like the united states to rejoin and i be happy to help make that case 
 not a day go by without serious sexual harassment allegation in organisation up and down the country my private member ’s bill on workplace protection from harassment could go a long way to address some of these serious issue indeed the bill have full government support it be currently stick in the other place but a compromise be now in sight so that the bill can pass through the house of lords our rule require that any amendment make in the house of lords need to come back to the house of commons will the deputy prime minister ensure that a small amount of government time be make available in this place between now and the end of the parliamentary session to ensure that this important bill will become law 
 as the hon lady know we have support the bill and we be work on it my right hon friend the minister for women and equalities be very happy to meet the hon lady to discuss the measure far 
 on a point of order mr speaker i do not know whether you be as shocked as i be but the deputy prime minister have the opportunity to correct the record today after he mislead the house on   june he fail to do so 
 order as we know we can not say mislead he must have inadvertently mislead the house 
 well 
 no no we do it that way 
 mr speaker the deputy prime minister inadvertently mislead the house but do not come to correct the record even though we have make it clear that he have do so i refer to the idea of £ cost mortgage payer £ a year the only place that that appear be in the daily mail he be disrespect you mr speaker he be disrespect parliament and the house and accord to the ministerial code he should now resign mr speaker can you advise i on this he be in breach of the ministerial code how can i ensure that he resign 
 i thank the hon member for give i notice of her point of order as i say last week the responsibility lie with the minister to make any necessary correction to the record it be on the government to look at themselves if the ministerial code be not be adhere to i really think that the rule need to be look at again so that minister do not forget that election change ministers as well ensure that this house hear the fact i will leave it at that 
 on a point of order mr speaker this be a related point of order i write to the prime minister on   january   to ask he to support my elect representatives codes of conduct bill which aim to restore confidence and trust in politic and politician by among other thing allow the independent adviser on ministerial standard   to commission their own inquiry unfortunately i have still have no response from the prime minister i follow this up with a letter on   june which include a series of question about the process by which he decide not to ask his independent adviser to undertake an inquiry into the home secretary in relation to she allegedly pressurise official to assist she with a speeding offence 
 i appreciate that we be about a week from recess so i wonder whether you can advise i mr speaker on how i can get a timely response from the prime minister 
 let i thank the hon member for give i notice of her point of order as she will know this be not a matter for the chair but there be clear expectation that correspondence from hon member will be deal with within a reasonable timeframe i stress that member deserve early reply on behalf of their constituent it be the constituent who put mps in this house i do not mind which part of the chamber they come from but i expect ministers who all seem to want the job to take the job seriously and ensure that hon member get the reply in due time 
 i be sure that those on the treasury bench be make a key note of this to ensure that that reply will be here before the house rise i be sure as i know the hon member that she will remind i before the house be up if that reply have not arrive none the less i stress that it be time that this government respect member from all part of this house it be become apparent that they be disrespectful and it be not acceptable 
 on a point of order mr speaker i wish to correct the record during yesterday ’s debate on the illegal migration bill i inadvertently say that the minister have remind we that we have take refugee since it be an obvious error i want to put it on the record that what i mean to say be that the minister have remind we that we have take refugee since a number of which we can still be proud 
 i thank the hon member for give notice of her point of order i be also grateful that she have come forward to correct the record i hope that she have set an example for other to follow i thank she   for that 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require the secretary of state to appoint an independent reviewer to prepare a quarterly report contain an assessment of primary care service to require the secretary of state to lay before parliament each report prepare by the independent reviewer to require such report to include the independent reviewer ’s assessment of any measure take to improve general practice service dental service community pharmacy service optometry service and mental health service and for connected purpose 
 primary care service across the country be in crisis people can not get a gp appointment when they need some pharmacy be close people be resort to diy dentistry and waiting list for mental health appointment be sky high the government point to their recent long term workforce plan as evidence that they be take action but that plan be only partially fund and will do nothing to increase staff level now perhaps if the government have not spend a year whip their mps to vote against any attempt to put a workforce plan into law they might have make some progress but we be where we be and it be legitimate for the british public to expect a government who can plan for the long term while take more immediate measure 
 to be blunt it be clear to i that mps on both side of the house be lose patience and be worried about the lack of urgency and action from the government in fix the front door to our nhs the bill seek to force the government to come clean about the challenge face primary care health service specifically such as gps and dentist by appoint an independent reviewer to report on the state and condition of primary care service every month so that we can hold the government ’s foot to the fire on progress 
 the bill can not come soon enough for patient let i start by detail some of the urgent problem in gp service use a story that i have receive from gareth in wimbledon morning recently gareth develop sudden loss of vision in the entire left field in both eye render he partially blind gareth try to get an appointment with his gp but due to a lack of appointment that day and a non existent online booking system he be instruct to call at be the follow morning it be not until the next day that he manage to get an urgent referral for a brain mri scan which confirm that gareth have suffer a small stroke with all stroke the hour be critical to reduce the chance of subsequent stroke his gp be undoubtedly deal with hundred of other urgent case that day but for gareth lose hour due to a lack of capacity at his local gp could have be catastrophic that be the real world impact of the government ’s failure to recruit and retain gps and their failure to invest in it infrastructure 
 let we remember that back in the government promise to deliver more gps not only do they break that promise but the number of fully qualified gps have fall by more than since they make it those fall number have hit some area hard than other in place such as somerset the fall number of gps be cause a shortage of appointment indeed   the number of gps have fall by since in the area and the number of patient per gp have increase by a massive shockingly that be far high than in the vast majority of england in my county of hertfordshire there be now patient per gp i have hear from denise who spend the good part of the day on hold before give up and try the online booking system which again turn out to be non existent while she be on hold for hour on the phone to her gp by contrast it take just minute for denise to book an online appointment at specsavers everybody know that the technology exist it just have not be fund for our gp service 
 all that be why the liberal democrats have pledge to ensure that we will have more gps work in the system within year with a campaign not only to train and recruit but to retain experienced practitioner with that expand workforce everyone could see their gp within day for a appointment 
 however it be not just the number of staff that be put pressure on gp service the royal college of general practitioners recent infrastructure report show that of general practice staff say their premise be not fit for purpose even when integrate care board want to spend money on primary care infrastructure in city centre for example outdated treasury rule do not allow they to something that be happen in my st albans constituency and which i raise in this chamber again just yesterday put retention measure in place accelerate improvement in it infrastructure fix outdated treasury rule on investment in primary care infrastructure be just of the challenge in general practice on which an independent reviewer could report progress to this house every month until they be fix 
 in dentistry too we see government incompetence at work last year there be a £ underspend on the nhs dentistry budget despite million of people need an appointment and thousand of dentist want to provide nhs care it be absurd why be we in this position because the contract that the government offer nhs dentist be so badly design that dentist will not take it on as they lose money on nhs dental treatment 
 the liberal democrats have be call for reform of the nhs dental contract so that it encourage and incentivise dentist to take on nhs patient meet patient need and demand rather than arbitrary target and finally put an end to dental desert just yesterday   the hon member for winchester steve brine   forewarn the government that the health and social care committee which he chair would be publish its finding on nhs dentistry and say that they would make for uncomfortable reading 
 again locally in place such somerset the real world impact be that there be now only dentist deliver nhs dental service for every people somerset be among the area of england that have see the big rise in patient per dentist since with each dentist now see more than additional people 
 however what be truly an outrage be that tooth decay remain the most common reason for hospital admission among young child it be a question not just of get child the care they need but of good use of public fund the cost of treat a child for tooth decay in hospital far exceed that of regular check up   supervise tooth brushing training for child and remove the value add tax on child ’s toothbrush and toothpaste as the liberal democrats have call for would make a huge difference and cost next to nothing in comparison with dental surgery those be thing the government could be get on with right now 
 of course we know that community pharmacy be in crisis too and we can see the impact that be have for example peter from winchester use to go to the pharmacy in sainsbury ’s until this year when it be close the location be perfect with plenty of space to park and be easily accessible for disabled people now it be close peter must take a special hour long round trip to the next pharmacy along heavily congest road to a car park on a hill with only disabled parking bay as someone who be mobility impaired his access to pharmacy service have be severely limited and his independence curtail as a direct result of the pharmacy closure now take place across the country 
 this situation be completely unsustainable the government can not just do a dorothy they can not just click their heel together say deliver deliver deliver and expect that gp and dental service will magically improve they need to do thing they need to make decision and they urgently need to improve primary care for patient right around the country this bill would in effect be a force mechanism which would enable mps every month to hold the government ’s foot to the fire on their action or their inaction on fix the front door to our nhs give the crisis face our primary care service it can not come soon enough 
 question put and agree to 
 order 
 that daisy cooper wera hobhouse tim farron richard foord and munira wilson present the bill 
 daisy cooper accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday november and to be print bill 
 i beg to move 
 that this house recognise that the automotive industry be the jewel in the crown of british manufacturing and believe it can have a bright future create good job for people across the uk regret that after year of conservative neglect the uk risk lose this world class industry put thousand of job under threat condemn the government for its lack of an industrial strategy and the negative impact this have have on investment in the uk ’s automotive sector call on the government to urgently resolve the rule of origin change which be due to take effect in work with partner across europe to negotiate a deal that work for manufacturer and far call on the government to adopt an active industrial strategy to build the battery factory capacity need to secure the automotive sector for decade to come 
 it be a real pleasure to open this debate on an issue that i know be close to the heart of many colleague and constituent many member present represent some of the most iconic name in uk automotive production for i it be very much an issue of huge personal significance sunderland where i grow up be of course renowned not just for its wonderful football team but for the tremendous success of the nissan plant i be very proud to say that many friend from my childhood still work in that plant of all the great business that i get to visit that be of my absolute favourite and i know that colleague will feel just as strongly about the part of the automotive industry that they and their constituency be associate with 
 that industry be full of skilled and committed worker innovation export success and huge growth potential however we have call this opposition day debate because even the most ardent defender of the government could not fail to be worried about the health of the sector as it stand the british car industry should and could be boom as should the wide automotive sector yet production have slump by over a under the conservatives there be huge concern about a series of major policy failure include domestic battery production facility trade barrier post brexit and high energy cost and other supply chain issue although this be an opposition day debate i know that those concern be share widely across the house and i hope that by have this debate we be able to express the clear political commitment of this house to that crucial sector 
 my hon friend will be aware of the world class toyota engine plant in my constituency that produce the high quality hybrid engine of the plant outside japan to do so do he agree that hybrid be part of the solution not as the government think part of the problem 
 i do not know whether i be suppose to declare an interest but i drive a toyota hybrid myself i have a large family and have to get between manchester and london and that be a pretty sound option for do so i be aware of the issue that my hon friend raise as be the shadow transport   secretary my hon friend   the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh we must be careful to ensure that there be certainty so that that transition we be all seek can happen i know that there be particular issue relate to that sector and that side of the industry we be alert to those issue and we will of course work with he his constituent and the expertise in this country and beyond to ensure that that timescale be do properly for many people seek to make the transition we be see a huge response from the public on that that be the option that be currently available particularly for family we must bear in mind that the solution have to be something that work for all our constituent and we must be cognisant of their concern i be grateful to he for raise that point at this stage of the debate 
 i worry at time that the government and maybe especially the secretary of state for business and trade do not have a great deal of time for industry at all artificial intelligence tech and financial service be all crucial sector but we should not for moment think that there be no role for industry nor should we ever believe that there be a false choice between service and manufacturing support for the automotive sector be not nostalgia many of the plant that we will talk about in the debate be the lifeblood of their community provide good work and good wage however just as in other crucial industry steel be another good example i get no sense that secure the long term future of the sector and manage the transition to a low carbon economy be priority for the government 
 that be not just the view of the labour party it be what industry itself have be tell the government mike hawes of the society of motor manufacturers and traders say at its recent conference 
 we need a response urgently 
 stellantis have warn that 
 if the cost of ev manufacturing in the u.k. become uncompetitive and unsustainable operation will close 
 the automotive industry face a series of challenge that must be take seriously the rule of origin which be due to come into force from january next year will require of a vehicle ’s value to be make in the uk or the eu or a tariff will be impose that will destroy most profit margin entirely of course those requirement increase significantly over time we have a lack of progress on battery manufacturing germany already have time the battery make capacity of the uk we have wide business challenge include the high industrial energy cost in the g7 and rise inflation and borrowing cost 
 however what we have see from other country be that none of those challenge be insurmountable other country be pull ahead china be home to numerous battery giant such as catl and byd while the united states famously have tesla but the eu have also ramp up battery production through initiative such as the european battery alliance and how have battery factory in place in contrast the uk be yet to develop a robust battery manufacturing sector which make we heavily reliant on import and risk the long term presence of automotive production in this country 
 i think we all recognise that over time vehicle will be build where the battery be make not the other way around we will never be able to match the sheer fiscal   firepower of the us inflation reduction act but we do have advantage competitive advantage on workforce and skill and on research and development and if we have a government with sufficient political commitment the future could be very bright indeed 
 last month i visit the new caterham cars production plant in my constituency to which the company have have to move because its production be insufficient to meet the demand that it have at the moment it will take on more employee and apprentice and it will manufacture more of the vehicle for which it be famous i remind the shadow secretary of state that that expansion in the industry have happen under a conservative government do he welcome that news 
 i be incredibly happy to welcome that news and the positive story that the hon member set out but i do not think that any of the success that he have see detract from the fact that there be significant policy challenge the overall number of vehicle have decline as he will know and yes the pandemic and the semi conductor supply chain issue happen but that do not remove the need for this house to take seriously the rule of origin the battery make capacity and so on we be not in any way on track there be also frankly the international competitive position other country be simply indicate that they want those industry and that investment much more than we do it be not so much that the conservative party have turn up to a gunfight with a knife but that it be not show up to the fight at all 
 what we need be a plan of action that be what the labour party have develop and it be what we want the chance to implement should we form the next government our plan address battery capacity and charge infrastructure as well as key issue such as planning and grid regulation we be up front about the challenge that we face but we be ambitious for the future frankly that be nothing short of what be require our plan start with have an active industrial strategy i know that some conservative do not like that kind of terminology but i say simply that all country need an industrial strategy to go back to the example of nissan that be part of an explicit strategy by even margaret thatcher ’s government to attract automotive expertise to the uk the absence of any coherent modern industrial strategy be hurt investment into the uk 
 other country be simply push ahead recognise that the challenge that we be face have to be meet nationally by government with skin in the game industry be cry out for stability and secondly for a partner and some clear policy signal that be exactly what it will get from a labour government that be why we have say that we would put the new industrial strategy council on a statutory footing give some reassurance that the instability of the conservative year be at an end 
 our green prosperity plan will part fund the battery make gigafactorie that be so essential to our future that will be catalytic public investment to unlock the much great sum of private investment we need the reality be that no battery factory in the world have be develop without that kind of government commitment we know that the government be in talk with some   firm about potential investment decision and i say in good faith to ministers that be good we want you to succeed where those company need assurance from the opposition should a change of government occur we will of course have those talk however it would be far well and a far well deal for the taxpayer to make those offer publicly and to be negotiate with a range of potential partner to get the good deal for britain because domestic battery production be so important 
 could the shadow minister clarify how many gigafactorie this government have enable to be build in the uk 
 i be more than happy to my hon friend will know that we currently have facility which be the envision facility at nissan in sunderland the overall number will depend on how big those factory be but broadly we will need to in the interim and by we will need to 
 germany for instance already have to gigafactorie up and run a further be almost up and run and it be in talk for a further advance on that position the sense be that germany be genuinely time ahead of we in that capacity and while people might think well germany be a country with incredible automotive history reputation and strength there be other country that we be already lose out to spain for instance have a very active industrial strategy when it come to the automotive sector and eastern europe have have tremendous success in that area because automotive be about regional market simply see what other country be do will have huge consequence for the potential for investment in this country crucially we should be play to the uk ’s strength in area such as research and development like the fantastic programme at the uk battery industrialisation centre in warwick which my hon friend the member for sheffield heeley and i be able to visit recently 
 my hon friend have rightly talk about produce battery but the position with hydrogen be very similar if we look at what germany be do particularly with bus and big vehicle we be year behind we really need to invest in that area 
 i thoroughly agree the scale of ambition that i see around the world daunt i when i compare it with this government ’s ambition there be some incredibly exciting technology out there include sodium ion battery that would reduce our dependence on lithium and almost certainly cut cost in battery production hydrogen be clearly go to be extremely exciting as be fuel cell and there be market for off road vehicle that could be huge potential market for the uk we should also not forget bus that be an area in which new technology could contribute to thing like clean air as well as well transport 
 do the shadow minister agree that on top of battery innovation and hydrogen innovation the uk be lead in another field that of synthetic fuel however give the automotive sector a really strong future in this country involve a whole system analysis not just of how the vehicle be manufacture but how the energy that will run it be manufacture that involve look again at the   tailpipe standard that be come in because if we have that whole system analysis we will get to green technology and greener transport but with a whole picture effect 
 i agree with part of what the hon gentleman have say i agree about the whole system analysis many part of the decarbonisation journey that industry will need to take on will be a much big question than simply unplug form of old fossil fuel technology and plug in another for instance the steel industry will have to think about scrap if it be to make the conversion to electric arc furnace and if we be to move towards synthetic fuel we will clearly have to look at where the feed stock be come from 
 however of the most defining feature of the past year i say this without any kind of partisanship have be a series of very ambitious target from this government in area that relate to decarbonisation but with no real mean to deliver they that target be then pull away and confidence in the british state to decarbonise fall apart i be think particularly about the famous cut the green crap comment from the former prime minister david cameron regard home insulation when we talk about change exist government policy we should not underestimate just how little confidence the international business community have in this government ’s promise at time broadly the approach have be very ambitious target but with no mean to actually deliver they which undermine the case 
 my hon friend be make a very effective speech as he be talk about target will he come on to the roll out of charge point my constituency have motorway in it and incredibly high level of pollution we need to remove all the barrier both to net and to reduce that pollution do my hon friend agree that constituency in the north such as mine need that situation address it be shameful that as i understand it more charger be instal in westminster this year than across the whole of the north of england we in the north have those issue of pollution and we need to move fast in address they my hon friend may be plan to come on to that point but it be an important 
 i be incredibly grateful to my hon friend for make those point the approach of the front bench from she from i on industrial policy and from my hon friend the member for sheffield heeley on transport policy must bring those thing together we need the policy in place that will make this country a world leader in the production of vehicle and ensure that it also work for consumer she raise the fact that there be more charge point in westminster i know my hon friend ’s constituency which be not far from mine and the difference between comparable part of this country north and south in the level density and availability of charger be unthinkable let alone in comparison with norway for instance not only do we not have enough charger but grid maintenance and connection issue often mean they be out of order i absolutely assure my hon friend that when we as a shadow cabinet and a potential government think about these issue both vehicle production and consumer be paramount clearly consumer want to purchase   electric vehicle that be the growth part of the market but too often we do not have the infrastructure in place it can not be some form of novelty i have drive electric vehicle around greater manchester when it be something of a novelty i could get access to charger and at time preferential parking space near deansgate which be no small thing but for mass market usage neither the policy nor the infrastructure be yet in place that need to be widely recognise 
 on the international trade position it be always imperative to have a domestic battery industry but it have become an existential issue because of the government ’s approach to our trading relationship with the eu as discuss in relation to regional export market in vehicle make in the uk last year be export so it be widely recognise that the impending cliff edge in the trade and co operation agreement with the eu on rule of origin be a serious challenge to the future of the sector in the uk the government have be far too slow to realise the scale of that danger and while they may promise that a deal be come soon i be afraid that soon can not come soon enough major uk manufacturer include stellantis jaguar land rover and ford have all warn that a failure to reach a deal would cost job in the uk 
 it have be and a half year since the trade and co operation agreement be formally sign that be precious time that could have be use to plan and prepare but those be word that this government often fail to understand what have they do in that time they have not secure investment in battery capacity they have not improve our relationship with our big export market and they certainly have not work with industry to find solution 
 we know that a breakthrough be need and we would use our plan to make brexit work to ensure that the rule of origin work for british manufacturer we can not achieve a compromise without work with our partner in europe and i believe that only labour can be that good faith partner our plan to invest in battery capacity alongside compromise on the rule of origin be the sensible way forward to meet our climate objective and trade obligation and retain our industrial base 
 we will make the uk a clean energy superpower by with net carbon electricity lower cost for the uk car industry by no long leave uk industry prone to the volatility of international gas price alongside well grid connection and planning reform to ensure that make in britain do not become a thing of the past that be the prospectus for action we need right now this country need some optimism the mantra of this government that this be as good as it get be as depressing as it be wrong 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 go on then 
 there be a news report about a new global company be launch by the french motor giant renault and the chinese manufacturer geely that will invest € here create job be that not exactly the kind of optimism conservative members talk about 
 i think those company must have see the opinion poll and be wonder whether a labour government be come if there be as positive news as that could be i would simply say to all conservative members that on any aspect of industrial policy there be too often on their side a desire to pick individual story or statistic and try to pretend that substantial and significant issue do not exist if we talk to anybody reasonably objective in this sector they will point out on battery production rule of origin charge infrastructure industrial energy price that there be real challenge and they require some serious engagement from the other side which to date have not be forthcoming 
 i would like to add to that comment my hon friend be make an excellent speech by the way what be say at the industry conference hold by the society of motor manufacturers and traders a couple of week ago the industry be speak as and i be afraid it be critical of the government say all these year on remember that baldrick at least have a cunning plan sadly the government do n’t 
 i follow that conference very closely my hon friend the shadow transport secretary speak at the conference and i have speak at that conference in the past and that be absolutely the sentiment perhaps humility do not come easily to conservative mp but i ask they to take on board those genuine view from the industry on the situation we find ourselves in 
 the automotive sector could be a practical illustration of the transition to new job and new opportunity that we all want to see we have lay out our plan for the sector some conservative colleague may disagree but let we have from they some alternative proposal because the status quo will not do our motion be a plan to deliver £ in economic growth in the part of the country that need it most it be a plan that could create additional job good job of the kind that people can raise their family on it be a plan for britain that would mean we once again lead the pack and feel confident for the future i believe the choice be clear a plan under labour or further decline under the conservatives and i think we all know whom the public would prefer behind the wheel 
 what a disappointing opening speech there be an opportunity to praise promote and protect the automotive sector and to talk about all the positive news story but all we have hear for the last or minute be the automotive sector be talk down i appreciate that the timing of this debate have not go well for the opposition as my hon friend   the member for bosworth dr evans   mention today we have hear about the renault group and geely have choose the uk as the headquarters of a new company develop ultra low emission engine and potentially invest billion of pound in the uk up to € that show not only the confidence of the automotive sector but its commitment to the uk and these be the opportunity or the story we should be talk about 
 the hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds   constantly reference the smmt statistic but he forget to mention the one he should have report at the dispatch box so that we could once again promote how healthy and dynamic the automotive sector be car production in britain rise for a straight month in may the smmt have confirm that a total of car roll out of the factory gate a few month ago which be an increase of more than passenger car number be boost by a great appetite for hybrid electric motor build in britain the boss at the smmt have say that while there have of course be challenge around the world manufacturer have 
 defy the challenging economic backdrop to fulfil customer demand for the late british build model at home and overseas 
 so that manufacturing and production be indeed up 
 this be a positive news story and any opportunity we have to speak about the automotive sector should be positive not negative or all about political point scoring this be a serious topic and a serious industry i know the hon gentleman be keen to be very ideological within the westminster bubble but i would suggest he step a little outside it i know my hon friend   the member for south derbyshire mrs wheeler who be a champion for toyota which have the large manufacturing plant in her constituency would welcome a visit by labour members so they can see how the sector be boom just in her constituency there be over people work at the plant in south derbyshire and involve in the supply chain and of the car manufacture be export to europe export be up by the way which i will get on to toyota continue to innovate and it be at the forefront of produce hybrid car it have be cut emission for over a decade and take net seriously have energy from solar panel all around the plant the point she would want to make be get out of the westminster bubble visit south derbyshire see what be happen at toyota”—and at many other firm as i will go on to say—“and you will see the work be go well our job be to protect promote and praise not to talk the sector down 
 it be all very well and good talk about optimism but do the minister accept the reality face the automotive industry in the uk today and the stark warning give by stellantis about future job loss if the government do not sort out the rule of origin problem 
 i want to state for the record and for the hon lady who be obviously sit there while i be speak that that be not optimism those be the fact and figure promote not by government but by industry representative i have a meeting with stellantis recently we know that a number of challenge be reflect globally not just in the uk such as be able to recruit into the sector the hon member for stalybridge and hyde miss another opportunity to talk about the fantastic job that be available of course on rule of origin that be an issue not just in the uk it be an issue for lot of other country that want to export and import too 
 the minister talk about the importance of the toyota factory in my constituency i have the engine plant which produce quality hybrid engine why be this government oppose to hybrid engine 
 this government have a strong mandate to reach net and the consultation have just take place on say mandate the right hon member will know that i have be spend a lot time with the automotive sector include take delegation to meet the minister of state department for transport my right hon friend   the member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman who will be oversee that my job i also chair the automotive council be to champion business and on occasion to try to remove all the barrier it need remove for it to manufacture more and export more i know that the transport minister will be speak more about that later
