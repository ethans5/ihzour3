i know that this issue be very emotive for all of we with constituent who be worried about their pension age i remind they that pension credit provide a safety net for people on low income so they should look at the benefit calculator on gov.uk there will be a full debate on the ombudsman ’s report tomorrow and the government will take all view into account as we identify and implement the next step the ombudsman ’s report be complex and substantial and the investigation cover year i appreciate that all party want to see the situation resolve as quickly as possible as the secretary of state for work and pensions have say there will be no undue haste and we will be listen to everyone 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right there be impact on both freeholder and leaseholder different type of property and tenure be impact in different way element of the rent charge regime will be extinguish by the act which he rightly reference in that have be in law since before i be bear however there be a number of other issue that need addressing and the leasehold and freehold reform bill be introduce to address some of they a whole range of reform be necessary across the leasehold sector and the bill seek to address that but as my right hon friend outline there be main issue that this discussion of port marine have highlight the variable service charge and the rent charge point which he just speak about a little more 
 the bill as it stand will absolutely make progress on variable service charge in a number of way it will not fix what have happen in the past but it absolutely seek to minimise the chance of it happen again unjustified increase in variable service charge be not acceptable any service charge must be transparent and communicate effectively and there should be a clear route for challenge they if thing go wrong the bill ensure that all leaseholder will receive key minimum financial and non financial information regularly include a standardised service charge demand form an annual report of charge the timely provision of service charge account and the right to obtain other relevant information that be a significant step forward as i know from discussion with both leaseholder and freeholder in my constituency and from have speak with colleague from all around the house who have similar issue we be also take measure on service charge to ensure that leaseholder be not subject to unjustified legal cost for the time they can when appropriate claim their cost from landlord if they go through the tribunal process and win there will be a significant change on variable service charge as and when the bill pass through both houses 
 on fix rent charge the bill introduce a framework to empower homeowner and to hold estate management company to account for the service they provide there will need to be transparency of information there will be a new legal requirement that estate management charge must be reasonable for the time there will be an ability to challenge excessive cost through the tribunal and to ensure that estate management company be hold to account the measure will also cover admin fee include deed of variation my right hon friend highlight that point as i say there will for the time be a right to apply to the tribunal for redress if there be a strong view and proof that the manage agent in charge be do something inappropriate or be not fulfil their duty people can apply to a tribunal to have a substitute manager appoint that will for the time provide an opportunity for resident to highlight problem and remove people who consistently cause problem 
 as i say in committee we recognise in committee and from previous debate in the house the strength of feeling among colleague that have be show again by my right hon friend in this debate and by the contribution of other hon member we be consider far whether we can look at this area in more detail i hope that i can soon say more from the government front bench about that although i can not do so tonight 
 to conclude my right hon friend be absolutely right to raise the issue in this case and to highlight the key challenge that we see daily to do with when this system do not work he raise how and when this system be not work for port marine i hope there be restitution and that a solution come as soon as possible i recognise the individual example of when thing be not work but the government be take action in a very conservative way recognise that we have to deal with these monopoly smash the rent seeker and remove distortion to make market more perfect we must ensure that there will not be another port marine in   or year time when the bill go through we will significantly improve this market and leasehold and significantly change rent charge so that people who want to buy their house and have the benefit of owner occupation we want to do all we can to empower people gain real control over their future we look forward to colleague support the bill as it go through its final stage in the house in the come week 
 question put and agree to 
 house adjourn 
 the minister for women and equalities be ask 
 if she will make an assessment of the adequacy of government support for people with disability 
 the government deliver wide range support for disabled people include in work and education we continually seek to enhance support for example via improvement to the health and disability benefit system and in the accessibility of home and transport and through delivery of the national disability strategy and the disability action plan 
 the united nations have find that the government have breach the right of sick and disabled people include their right at work and the uk ’s own equality watchdog have say that the department for work and pensions have discriminate against sick and disabled people give that only of participant in the government ’s work and health programme have a successful job outcome what meaningful proposal do the government have to reduce the disability employment gap 
 i thank the hon lady for her point which take i back to our time on the work and pensions committee i genuinely feel disappointed about that report and the government strongly reject its finding in but we will continue to implement the un convention on the right of person with disability and the committee ’s recommendation through many of our policy to improve disabled people ’s life whether that be workwell our disability employment adviser or the work we be do on fit note reform we be absolutely determined to support disabled people in work indeed in the quarter of there be disabled people in employment which be an increase of on the year before 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 i know that my hon friend be absolutely committed to disability employment but can she please outline exactly what she be do both at the dwp and in her   wide role across government to ensure that inclusion be embed in policy and leadership so that disabled people particularly those who be neurodiverse be support into civil service job 
 i thank my right hon friend for her point and for her work in this area we be deliver on the buckland review and all ministerial departments be sign up to disability confident progress to disability confident leader status and have evidence independently validate on that work arm ’s length body be also sign up to disability confident and we be work with parent departments to encourage more of they to do the same in senior civil servant declare themselves to be disable and since the proportion of civil servant with a disability have increase to 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be already a little confuse by the minister ’s answer this morning in december i raise the issue of the disability pay gap and she reply from the dispatch box that the government be close the disability employment gap she have mention this morning that that be apparently happen but the number tell a different story in the period from january to march few people with disability be in employment compare with the same period month early why do she think the plan be not work 
 the hon lady and i could trade statistic but what i be interested in be opportunity for disabled people and people with health condition hence the work we be do on the buckland review and indeed on entrepreneurship and the lilac review there will be far update on that to the house shortly if the hon lady be ready to listen i can reassure she that we be work on the disability confident scheme and be do further work on the employment goal and i will update the house soon 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to support woman experience menopause at work 
 in march last year we appoint helen tomlinson as the government ’s ever menopause employment champion she have be work up and down the country visit business large and small and give they advice on policy to support menopausal woman in the workplace she recently publish her month review shatter the silence about menopause 
 i be grateful for that reply labour be the party of woman ’s equality the previous labour government do more to advance equality than any other and the next will match that record we be commit to support woman experience menopause to thrive at work by require large employer to adopt menopause action plan will the minister do the same 
 as usual this government have already do all of that work in england we have the wellbeing of women pledge which the nhs the civil service and this parliament have sign we will take no lecture from labour on woman ’s health while we have have a woman ’s health strategy for year labour run wales have no health plan for woman 
 i call the shadow minister 
 research show that in woman with menopausal symptom have leave work due to a lack of support in some case this will have be due to discrimination woman experience menopause know that this be because of their age and sex but the law do not protect they on that combine basis why not 
 the equality act already protect woman on the basis of sex age and disability it be this government who be change the experience of menopause by roll out woman ’s health hub in every integrate care board across england so that woman can access menopause support we also have our hormone replacement therapy prepayment certificate which be available for just under £ a year for woman to get all their hrt prescription over half a woman in england have buy of those certificate 
 the minister refer to labour ’s equality act which of course include protection against dual discrimination but the conservatives have refuse to enact those protection labour would put that right we would also require large business to produce menopause action plan which the government have refuse to do and we would also publish guidance for small business we would set a new investment target for woman lead start up and we would transform the right of woman at work with a new deal for work people the minister for women and equalities have suggest of course that menopause at work be a left wing issue do this minister agree 
 the shadow minister fail to mention the help to grow portal which have a menopause resource hub that enable employer to use that information to well support woman in the workplace whether with flexible working under law that this conservative government have introduce or through simple measure such as recognise that even the uniform a woman wear in the workplace can make a difference this conservative government have raise the bar on menopause health and support in the workplace and in healthcare while labour for many year could not even define what a woman actually be 
 what step the government be take to help ensure community cohesion 
 in this country we believe in religious freedom everyone should be able to express their identity faith and belief however this must be do in a way that respect the right of other community cohesion in many of our town and city have be strain in recent month follow the   october   attack in israel the boundary   of acceptable behaviour in the public sphere be be test that be why on   december   i publish new guidance for public authority remind they of their legal obligation under the public sector equality duty and specifically that they should consider how they contribute to the advancement of good relation in community as they deliver public service 
 my right hon friend will know that in romford our national country and county flag the union jack the cross of st george and the flag of essex be fly with great pride as inclusive symbol of our share identity do she agree that all public building school and organisation should be encourage to fly the appropriate flag as symbol of unity patriotism and equality rather than of division 
 i do agree with my hon friend the union jack and the cross of st george be symbol of unity not division and of course as an essex mp i be also particularly fond of our county flag the point be that national pride should be celebrate not shun that be why anyone in the uk be able to fly any of our national flag without need the consent of their local authority as per government regulation that exempt national flag 
 i thank the minister for her answer on community cohesion between different ethnicity what plan do she have to make funding available to enable community event whereby each member of a community can demonstrate their culture and heritage with all age and all group and to build relationship in a similar way to what we be do in northern ireland 
 we encourage every celebration of the diversity in ethnicity that we have in this country in particular the government want to emphasise equality under the law the fact that there be not protect group but protect characteristic and that everyone should be free from discrimination we know that in many event up and down the country include in northern ireland that be what be be celebrate and i thank the hon gentleman for highlight that in the house we encourage all local community to do just that 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the government ’s propose welfare reform on disabled people 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the government ’s propose welfare reform on disabled people 
 the department engage regularly with the cabinet office on the different option for reshape the current welfare system set out in the health and disability green paper include on the potential impact on claimant with different health condition 
 the propose reform to personal independence payment unjustly target disabled people in a cost of living crisis the multiple sclerosis society find that nearly in people with ms say that the application process have a negative effect on their physical and mental health instead of purse reform that risk worsen inequality will the minister make representation to scrap informal observation to any pip change as have already be do with the adult disability payment in scotland 
 we want to understand how good to target support for disabled people and those with health condition to provide the right kind of support for those who need it most and to ensure value for the taxpayer provide the right support to people who need it most and understand long term health condition and how people want to live independently and reach their full potential be key to that we must also ensure that disabled people feel understand and have a voice which be why i strongly urge people to be part of that consultation and have their say we want to hear from disabled people that be what they say to i they want to be hear and understand 
 in november when i raise the concern of parkinson ’s uk about change to the work capability assessment the then minister agree to meet the organisation month on there have be no meeting and the minister have reply to my follow up write question with standard answer about meet a number of organisation will she step up to the plate and meet parkinson ’s uk to hear directly its concern about the change to welfare reform for those suffering from parkinson ’s 
 i try not to give standard answer and i will not give a standard answer to that question i recently meet people who be diagnose with parkinson ’s early perhaps as young as and i be happy to meet more broadly with parkinson ’s uk i recently meet mind and as much as my diary allow and at event in the house i engage with advocate for disabled people and those with health condition i be happy to pick up that meeting because if it be not already in my diary it should be soon 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities recently conclude that the uk government have 
 fail to take all appropriate measure to address grave and systematic violation of the human right of person with disability and have fail to eliminate the root cause of inequality and discrimination 
 with those damn finding in mind will the minister confirm whether an equality impact on the propose welfare reform have be carry out and if so can we expect it to be make public 
 i will write to the hon lady on that question i can reassure she that i have meet she and my counterpart in the devolved space regard pip reform and the wide consultation to ensure that we be hear voice from everyone as i say early the uk be a signatory to the un convention on the right of   person with disability and we remain committed to ensure that the uk be of the good place to live and work as a disabled person i come from care and a family that live with disablement we must listen to disabled people stop scaremongere and ensure that they be understand that be exactly what our reform and engagement be all about 
 whether she have have recent discussion with the secretary of state for work and pensions on state pension equality 
 minister in the department for work and pensions continue to have regular discussion about state pension inequality we introduce the new state pension in which improve outcome for many woman outcomes will equalise for man and woman by the early 2040 more than a decade early than under the previous system 
 some waspi women against state pension inequality campaign woman in bedford be live in severe financial hardship have have their pension income steal in some case twice their right to compensation have be test and win give that a waspi woman die every minute do the minister agree that a compensation scheme need to be set up immediately it should not be a size fit all package but it must be simple clear and easy to operate 
 i know that this issue be very emotive for all of we with constituent who be worried about their pension age i remind they that pension credit provide a safety net for people on low income so they should look at the benefit calculator on gov.uk there will be a full debate on the ombudsman ’s report tomorrow and the government will take all view into account as we identify and implement the next step the ombudsman ’s report be complex and substantial and the investigation cover year i appreciate that all party want to see the situation resolve as quickly as possible as the secretary of state for work and pensions have say there will be no undue delay and we will be listen to everyone 
 what step she be take with the secretary of state for health and social care to help ensure that health and social care provider collect sex base datum 
 nhs england plan to make further change to report on sex and gender in national dataset once the unified information standard for protect characteristic have be approve and publish this will unify report on of the protect characteristic include gender reassignment and sex 
 i know that the secretary of state agree that vulnerable woman with learn disability and all woman should be able to access same sex care   particularly with regard to intimate physical care that be especially important in the light of the shocking report by the woman ’s rights network and jo phoenix on rape and sexual assault in hospital and care setting that be why the proper collection of datum base on sex be vital do the minister agree 
 the hon lady be absolutely right we be currently consult on the nhs constitution which will give woman not just the right to same sex accommodation in hospital but the right to ask for someone of the same sex to conduct intimate examination there be safeguard and we be look at some of the incident in trust in order to well protect patient and staff she be absolutely right to raise the issue of data collection and ensure that that be happen 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to encourage more people from black asian and ethnic minority community to start up a business 
 the government have work to advance equality of access to start up opportunity irrespective of social background or race we have a range of business support programme and government back financial support through help to grow management growth hub and the british business bank the success of our endeavour to engage and support diverse business leader can be see in the datum in of the people in england help by the business support helpline be from ethnic minority background 
 i thank the minister for that response although i find it a little difficult to hear bristol have a thriving and entrepreneurial somali community but of the thing they constantly come across be almost an expectation that they will set up business that serve just their community rather than be part of mainstream regeneration effort and the general commercial life of the city what be the equalities department do to try to ensure that those people can make that breakthrough from just be community base project 
 it be interesting that a number of people have that perception that they should stay in their lane this government do not support any sort of activity that be segregationist we believe that we must treat people equally under the law all of our access programme be available irrespective of ethnicity people should be encourage to serve the entire community not just people who look and sound like they some of the scheme that i mention in my early answer be available the hon lady should know that the start up loans company report that in her constituency start up loan be issue to ethnic minority lead start up for about £ so there be opportunity out there i be happy to write to she with more information if she need it 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 institution should be able to operate free from ideological pressure i be delighted that the equality and human rights commission have retain its accreditation as an a status national human right institution denote full compliance with the paris principle despite stonewall ’s attempt to have it strip of its status at the un as i have say before stonewall do not dictate the law in this country or indeed in the un the equality and human rights commission have retain its a status retain its independent participation right at the un human rights council and remain able to report directly to the united nations on human right issue 
 datum from the office for national statistics show that of woman be economically inactive compare with of man many woman say that access to flexible working could see they return to the pay workplace what step be the minister take alongside her cabinet colleague to ensure that all worker have access to flexibility in their work hour 
 there be a lot that my department in particular be do we have put out multiple bit of legislation that will help to entrench workplace equality whether that be around flexible working right or sexual harassment in the workplace we be do more even on the trade side where we continue to ensure that we have provision that advance gender equality in our free trade agreement because we want to break down barrier and create opportunity for female entrepreneur 
 i call andrew jones hon member hear hear a popular man 
 i would like to raise an issue with the minister that be raise with i at a recent constituency surgery what be the government do to ensure that privacy and dignity for woman be protect in toilet facility 
 i thank my hon friend for his question there be various reason why woman and man should be able to access single sex space and public toilet be no exception we be update building regulation so that toilet in non domestic building offer safety privacy and dignity for all people who use they there be often confusion between gender neutral toilet and unisex toilet we support unisex toilet but through these new building regulation we be try to get rid of toilet and bathroom where man and woman share the same space 
 during the northern ireland assembly campaign some female candidate be subject to ai generate deepfake and grossly offensive content what action be the government take to regulate the dissemination of such imagery where it could affect the otherwise freely express choice of voter at the ballot box especially as we approach a general election in the come month 
 the online safety act introduce new offence that criminalise sharing or threaten to share an intimate image without consent which include deepfake intimate image the government be work to ensure that we be ready to respond to the full range   of threat to our democratic process include through the defend democracy taskforce if deepfake be discover by user on social medium they should report they directly to the platform in the case of election they should be report directly to the electoral commission because it be already an electoral offence to make false statement of fact about the character or conduct of a candidate during an election 
 have endure an induced coma and round of chemotherapy year old leoni miller launch her new business at a wayfinderwoman event last month will my right hon friend join i in wish leoni every success and outline what support and advice be available so that other young woman see run their own business as a real prospect 
 i wish leoni every success my hon friend be right to raise this issue in march we proudly announce the launch of the invest in woman taskforce whose mission be to make the uk the good place in the world to be a female founder since the taskforce ’s launch its member have be work with the private sector to begin raise fund for female founder just like her constituent 
 both baroness cumberlege in the do no harm report and the patient safety commissioner in the hughes report recommend a redress scheme for woman harm by surgical mesh what conversation be the minister have with government colleague to make the redress scheme a reality for those woman who be still suffer 
 it be this conservative government who have commission the patient safety commissioner to do a report on what redress would look like it be important that we take those recommendation in detail we be look at that and we aim to respond to the commissioner in the come week 
 some sporting body have interpret the equality act in such a way that they believe they can not lawfully ban male who identify as girl or woman from compete in woman ’s sport do my right hon friend agree that that interpretation be not correct and that it be lawful to exclude all male from female sport to achieve safety and fairness for woman and girl 
 i agree there be so much misinformation out there and incorrect guidance that create confusion i recently have a roundtable with the secretary of state for culture media and sport and she and i agree that sport body in the uk need to tackle this area more strongly 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday may 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 resident across the eastern village of woking in byfleet west byfleet and pyrford have see a large number of propose development in recent year of particular concern be an area of beautiful field near west hall where more than constituent have write back to i in recent week express their deep concern about the lack of provision of local infrastructure and the potential effect on the local environment my resident and i will fight on but do the prime minister agree that labour ’s proposal to concrete over vast swathe of the green belt in surrey and the south east would be a complete calamity 
 my hon friend be absolutely right unlike both the liberal democrats and labour who believe in top down target that would decimate the green belt we believe in local people have a say over their local community that be why we be ensure that we make good use of brownfield land and that we conserve and enhance our precious countryside for generation to come 
 we now come to the leader of the opposition 
 on monday the prime minister treat we to his relaunch in month he vow to take on the danger that threaten the country so it be good to see the minister for common sense immediately take up that mantle by announce a vital crackdown on the gravest of threat colourful lanyard meanwhile in the real world after year of tory government the prison system be in chaos do the prime minister think that his decision to let prisoner out day early make our country more secure 
 civil service impartiality be an important principle that we be right to support perhaps the right hon and learn gentleman could ask his chief of staff about that what i do on monday be outline the serious security threat that our country face from an axis of authoritarian state russia poison people on our street china target our democracy and iranian proxy fire on british ship yet he will not back our plan to increase defence spending and we all know why especially since the deputy leader and the shadow foreign secretary vote to scrap our nuclear deterrent it be clear that you simply can not trust labour with our country ’s security 
 i appreciate that the prime minister have be busy on the frontline of the war against lanyard he must have miss that i be the to call for on defence spending the last time that happen be under the last labour government it need a credible plan not his fantasy economic 
 i be disappointed to see that version of the prime minister ’s time in office do not extend as far as answer question or give any information on those prisoner he be release early basic detail such as how many where be they and what crime have they   commit will he at least guarantee that none of the criminal who he be instruct prison to release early be consider high risk 
 there be strict eligibility criterion in place with exclusion base on public safety no would be put on the scheme if they be deem a threat to public safety the right hon and learn gentleman talk about but if he think that be important i think he just stand up and acknowledge that it be the right thing to do we have a fully fund plan to deliver an increase in defence spending he and his party have refuse to match that commitment 
 just like his £ fully fund if anyone be look for the perfect metaphor for this shambolic government we see it on monday the prime minister wake up decide his late rebrand be mr security but within hour the tory party be be investigate for accidentally publish the personal detail of hundred of people he must be the only tech bro brother in the country who can not work a debit card or send an email interruption but he have not answer my question so i will try again be any of the prisoner he be currently let out early consider to be high risk 
 the right hon and learn gentleman just show spectacularly why he be just not fit to lead this country into the future this country have a proud tradition of lead the world we lead the world when it come to the industrial revolution but if he be around he would have probably call james watt the steam bro what we be do be prepare the country for the future he talk about the prison scheme let i be crystal clear no would be put on the scheme if they be deem a threat to the public offender be subject to the tough of licensing condition and if those condition be break they be back in prison for considerably long but what be his record on this he vote against tough sentence for violent criminal he actually oppose new power for the police to tackle violent crime and vote against new law that have arrest criminal people smuggler the message be crystal clear he can not be trust to keep this country safe 
 i appreciate that all this rebranding have take all the prime minister ’s time but he may want to read the recent inspection report into lewes prison on this topic which i have ask he twice about it document on page 
 high risk prisoner be release at short notice without sufficient planning 
 page state 
 a high risk prisoner have his release date bring forward despite have a history of stalking domestic abuse and a restraining order 
 in the report ’s word 
 he be a risk to child 
 do the early release of stalker domestic abuser and those consider a risk to child sound like the work of someone who be make the country more secure 
 as i say no should be put on the scheme if they be a threat to the public let i be crystal clear it do not apply to anyone serve a life sentence anyone convict of a serious violent   offence anyone convict of terrorism or anyone convict of a sex offence crucially in contrast to the system labour put in place governor in the prison service have an absolute lock so that no be put on the scheme who should not be labour ’s scheme let out thousand upon thousand of violent offender on to our street and even terrorist thankfully we have toughen up sentencing against those criminal with new legislation but the right hon and learn gentleman vote against it 
 well i be glad to hear that those on life sentence be not be release early the prime minister may not think that release domestic abuser be a problem but labour have repeatedly call for domestic abuser to be exempt from the scheme to release prisoner early his government have shamefully ignore those call now that we have the evidence that domestic abuser be be release early the lewes report will he finally change course and back labour ’s call 
 i have be crystal clear there be an absolute governor lock on people who be put on the scheme in contrast to the last labour scheme prisoner be let out with no supervision no electronic tag in fact offender be let out—16,000 be violent lead to multiple murder commit we fix that system when it come to this question not only be we build the big prison programme in history but we be deploy rapid deployment cell on the conservative benches we understand the importance of prison unlike of his front benchers who say prison do not prevent crime it be always the same with the labour party soft on crime and soft on criminal 
 the prime minister be literally let criminal out early the only answer to the question that i have ask whether domestic abuser should be exempt from his early release scheme from anyone who be serious about security be yes 
 perhaps the most ludicrous part of the prime minister ’s speech on monday be when he say that he would not accept the idea that any of the problem people be face have be cause by year of conservative government he will not say how many prisoner the government have release early he will not say whether they be burglar abuser or stalker he will not say where they be or what support their victim be get yet he think he have the right to tell people that they can not blame his government for any of it do he not think that rather than confiscate lanyard like some jump up milk monitor he should stop issue get out of jail free card to prisoner who be consider to be a risk to child 
 another week with no idea and absolutely no plan for the country the opposition have have year to think about nothing but the future but all they can do be talk about the past 
 i be surprised that the leader of the opposition do not bring up what have happen in the week since we last meet statistic have confirm that we have have the joint fast growth rate in the g7 this year the bank of england have say that the economy have turn a   corner ey have say that our growth be impressive and the chief economist at the independent office for national statistics have say that 
 the economy be go gangbuster 
 the shadow chancellor may want to copy and paste their comment into her next speech or do she think that they be all gaslighte the british public too 
 while i understand the need to upgrade our broadband infrastructure it can not be right that a company call brsk be propose to erect telegraph pole at the squirrels estate in hayley green in my constituency the resident be opposed to these proposal which go against the guidance do the prime minister agree that brsk should abandon its proposal that there should be a review of permit development right in relation to this type of infrastructure and that he should give ofcom more power to investigate breach 
 i thank my hon friend for rightly champion the view of his constituent on this important topic network operator must follow legal obligation when deploy their network and ofcom can in fact investigate report of failure to follow those obligation i know that the minister for data and digital infrastructure my hon friend   the member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez meet representative of the sector and ofcom recently to raise concern about report of poor pole siting and ask operator to share infrastructure and i will ask she specifically to give my hon friend a more detailed update 
 i call the leader of the scottish national party 
 on monday the prime minister outline what he consider to be extremist threat to our society and in do so he actively compare north korea iran and russia with those people in scotland who believe in independence so can i ask he to rise once to the standard befit his office and apologise for those puerile and pathetic remark 
 that be not what i say but i will say to the hon gentleman that his party be indeed a threat to the integrity of the united kingdom i hate to remind he that that be literally its entire purpose when the people of scotland accept the referendum result in it be the snp that do n’t it go on create a minister for independence focus on constitutional wrangling and ignore the need of the people education standard be fall and taxis be rise it be the right hon gentleman who should finally do the right thing end the obsession with independence and put the need of the scottish people 
 let we be clear what the prime minister do be not just equate my colleague and i to dangerous despot across the world he proactively compare almost half the scottish population to a war criminal like vladimir putin and he do so as their prime minister as the man who represent they on the world stage and as the man who on these isle be task with defend   their liberty and their democracy we know that his sorry time in office be rapidly come to a conclusion but be this really how he want to be remember 
 as ever the right hon gentleman be distract from the actual record of what the snp be do in scotland this obsession with independence mean that scottish schoolchildren be be let down plummet down international league table the scottish nhs be the only place in the united kingdom where funding be actually fall in real term and taxis be go up for ordinary hard work family and small business that be what the snp be do in scotland while this uk government be deliver for they 
 will the prime minister join i in congratulate uxbridge college which have recently enter into a pioneer partnership with the massachusetts institute of technology this be groundbreake work for the further education sector and it will have great benefit for local business and local student and for the education sector and the local economy 
 i join my hon friend in congratulate uxbridge college and the west london institute of technology on their collaboration with mit this be equip student with the skill of the future that local business require and that be very much the story of this government with the big long term settlement for post-16 education in this country in year and a proud record of create over apprenticeship since provide opportunity for all while the labour party want to halve the number of apprenticeship and put a brake on people ’s aspiration 
 my party plaid cymru have secure a crucial win for our farmer as labour in wales be force to pause the sustainable farming scheme we have do our bit for farmer now it be time the prime minister do his harmful trade deal and brexit check be hit our world famous welsh lamb and beef will he therefore guarantee to welsh farmer that he will never again sign a deal that threaten their interest 
 if the right hon lady care about welsh farmer perhaps she should stop prop up the welsh labour government it be actually the work of the welsh conservatives that ensure that there be a spotlight on the labour government ’s proposal in wales which would have lead to thousand of job loss and less food security for our country and destroy rural income farmer rightly describe it as bleak damaging and shocking just like the labour party ’s approach to rural britain 
 barnet hospital ’s a&e be expand finchley memorial hospital have have its diagnostic hub boost by new equipment and there be more appointment in general practice locally than there be before the pandemic but i still have constituent who be wait too long for nhs care so can i urge the prime minister to redouble his effort to grow the nhs workforce and get wait time down 
 i be delighted to hear about the new community diagnostic centre at my right hon friend ’s local hospital we be work tirelessly to reduce the overall nhs waiting list which have come down by around since september last year that be an achievement in light of the pressure from industrial action but she be right there be more to do our productivity plan will free up clinician to spend more time with patient and to her point our long term plan for the nhs will ensure that we train more doctor and more nurse to meet the workforce requirement of the nhs for the future 
 palestinian death be not enough to move this prime minister to end arm sale to israel the killing of british aid worker be not enough to move the prime minister to end arm sale it even seem that an all out assault on rafah with all the death and destruction that would entail would not be enough for he unlike the us so just what on earth would be enough finally to move this prime minister into the same position as   the majority of the british public and end arm sale   to israel 
 i point out to the hon gentleman that unlike the us the uk government do not directly sell arm to israel and neither do the uk government offer any military lethal aid package to israel as the us do he should not conflate these issue

 as i say to the house last week i understand the strong feeling across the chamber about these matter and the desire for urgency in address they follow the ombudsman ’s multi year investigation it be imperative that we take the time to review the finding thoroughly i be not entirely sure i agree with the hon lady ’s characterisation of all of they so far broadly we be committed to make sure that pensioner have the dignity and security that they deserve include through the triple lock which be increase pension by £ this year i welcome tomorrow ’s debate on the ombudsman ’s report and we will of course take all view into account as we identify and implement next step

 as my hon friend know i care deeply about the future of our community pharmacy there be over community pharmacy across the country and they be work incredibly hard to serve their patient i be pleased that about of people live within a minute walk of a pharmacy that be why we be back they with pharmacy with £ of extra funding whereby people can now go to see their pharmacist rather than their gp to get treatment for the most common ailment such as ear infection and the like not only will that ensure that they can get treatment close to home but it will help to deliver our plan to cut waiting list and get people the care they need more quickly

 i thank the hon lady for raise the case as she know the department for education have provide extensive support and funding to all those school that have raac which in the end be less than of all school that could have be affect more generally there be the very significant amount we be invest in school rebuilding and maintenance i be sure the education secretary will have hear her concern and will write to she in due course

 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this particularly at a time of increase geopolitical risk we must protect this nation ’s food security and our most valuable agricultural land we   can achieve our solar deployment target by use brownfield site and rooftop away from our good farmland i know he look forward to the energy secretary ’s statement later today which will ensure we avoid use our good agricultural land like he i agree that we should be back british farmer to produce more food that be good for our country our economy and our food security

 when adult rape case take year on average to complete it be no wonder that of all rape survivor drop out of the process give that just of rape record last year result in a charge and few still will end in conviction it be no wonder that the victim commissioner rape crisis and other have argue that rape have be effectively decriminalise in this country be the prime minister not ashame that because of his government ’s failing victim and survivor be be put through a live hell in our criminal justice system 
 while it be right that the hon lady raise this incredibly important topic i completely disagree with her characterisation of how this government have treat it it be actually this government who previously introduce the rape review action plan which be now show significant improvement in how we treat rape end to end through the criminal justice system violence against woman and girl be now a strategic policing requirement for the time ever we have roll out operation soteria so that police force have the expertise that they need we have actually quadruple funding for victim support with more independent domestic sexual violence adviser there be new support for victim we have end the digital strip search and provide pre trial cross examination all of that have mean improvement to the process and we have see an increase in the average sentence for rape by a since labour be last in office and by the way mr speaker we do that use a power that the hon lady ’s party vote against 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on russia ’s aggression relate to ukraine and the situation in georgia 
 we be on day of putin ’s so call special military operation an operation that be suppose to last for day and he have fail in all of his objective the conflict be of course evolve and challenging russia ’s newly form northern grouping of force have attack ukraine ’s kharkiv region take control of several village by open up an additional axis of attack russia be almost certainly attempt to divert ukrainian resource away from other part of the frontline and to threaten kharkiv the large city in ukraine 
 we will not be divert from our commitment to provide ukraine with the support that it need to prevail because ukraine will prevail in april the prime minister announce our large ever and most comprehensive package of equipment from the united kingdom include equipment relate to long range strike air defence artillery reconnaissance protect mobility development of ukraine ’s navy airfield enablement and munition to support the introduction of the f-16 
 the prime minister have also announce £ of additional funding which take we to £ of military aid to ukraine this financial year we continue to work with international ally and partner to ensure coherence and to co ordinate our support to ukraine include through the international capability coalition we co lead the maritime and drone coalition we recently announce a complete package of £ for cutting edge drone that will deliver more than drone for the ukrainian armed force 
 in march we be pleased to congratulate the ukrainian pilot who complete their basic fly training in the united kingdom those trainee join more than ukrainians who have receive training in the uk since include more than recruit train since through operation interflex 
 turn to georgia we continue to observe with concern the event in tbilisi include yesterday ’s violent clash in and around the georgian parliament and the intimidation of peaceful protester the united kingdom along with our partner be commit to the right of peaceful protest and we be concerned about the introduction of the law on transparency of foreign influence the uk be a close friend of georgia and as such we call for calm and restraint on all side we hope to continue to work with georgia with which we have a deep and long stand partnership and to support the legitimate aspiration of the georgian people as they pursue a free sovereign and democratic future 
 thank you mr speaker for grant a uq on this important issue it be much appreciated i also thank the minister for his helpful response and all right hon and hon member who have stay in the chamber 
 we wake up to report of ukraine attempt to push back in the kharkiv region and then hear the russian defence ministry claim that its air force have destroy long range missile know as atacms army tactical missile system that ukraine ’s military launch at crimea overnight the medium reporting may have settle down but the situation there be as volatile as it have ever be and the ripple effect across the entire region continue secretary blinken from president biden ’s administration be visit ukraine to give it physical and military assistance and encouragement the minister will know that georgia be also push forward legislation as russia try to restore its empire of old and control all its former satellite state 
 the russian threat be clearly undermine democratic process in the entire region i understand and agree with the uk ’s clear public stance of support for ukraine and i congratulate the government and the minister on what have be do and what will be do in future but the situation demand further action i be keen to get the minister ’s response on what that further action will be will he make clear what far enhanced help we can give to facilitate the democratic process aside from our vital military aid to the region the war that begin in be on the precipice how can we ensure that the result be a victory for democracy and freedom not simply for ukraine but for georgia and for all of we globally 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for ask an extremely good and valid question that put the issue of ukraine in regional context in the context of the influence that russia have seek to exert over its former satellite state he be right that the frontline in ukraine be turbulent a full picture be yet to emerge but we can be certain of our continued resolve to ensure that our ukrainian friend prevail that be the unavoidable direction of travel the ongoing visit of secretary blinken remind we of the remarkable heft and scale of western support in which we play our part very proudly the resolute support of the friend of ukraine will help it to prevail despite turbulence and russia ’s attempt to create a new dynamic on a very turbulent frontline 
 the hon gentleman ask cogent question about georgia he be right that georgia know more than any other country about the depredation of a russian invasion follow the horrify event of we be clear that georgia have the sovereign right to pursue its own autonomous path if it seek to turn its eye to the west towards nato membership and maybe membership of the european union it be the sovereign right of georgia to forge its own destiny we will continue to co operate in earnest and sincere partnership with the georgians with whom we have a very meaningful defence relationship i have have the pleasure of visit tbilisi twice as a foreign office minister and of see the tremendous institutional work that we do with the georgians who have a fine defence tradition 
 i call the chair of the intelligence and security committee 
 do the government share my view that just as soviet failure in afghanistan lead to a considerable extent towards the downfall of the soviet empire putin ’s failure in ukraine   could have a similar effect on his future and ambition and that it be no coincidence that this renew russian attack take place before the aid that america have belatedly decide to give ukraine have have a chance to arrive 
 the answer be yes can see the extraordinary mobilisation of the russian state and society and the huge expenditure that putin be have to incur to maintain momentum in his fail military operation as confirmation of long term weakness 
 we now come to the shadow minister 
 i thank   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   for secure this urgent question it be day since putin begin the full scale illegal invasion of ukraine russia have open a renew offensive in the kharkiv region but ukrainians be continue to fight with huge courage the uk be totally unite in support of ukraine the shadow defence secretary and shadow foreign secretary be in kyiv for the last day and reaffirm that labour ’s commitment to ukraine be ironclad 
 if putin win he will not stop at ukraine that be why the government have have and will continue to have labour ’s full support for military aid to ukraine and for reinforce nato ’s ally across eastern europe every commitment of uk military aid since putin invade have have labour ’s full support and that will continue with a general election later this year there may be a change in government but there will be no change to britain ’s resolve in stand with ukraine confront russian aggression and pursue putin for his war crime 
 on georgia we be deeply concerned by the increase pressure on civil society freedom and by the intimidation of protester the propose draft law be not in line with democratic value and risk take georgia away from the euro atlantic aspiration of the georgian people what discussion have the minister have with the us the eu and other regional partner on the late development in georgia be the uk put georgia on the agenda for the g7 meeting in italy and the upcoming european political community meeting what step be he take with our ally to counter russian disinformation and hybrid activity in georgia and across the caucasus the western balkans and the rest of europe 
 what support have be give to help ukraine build up its air defence to stop air and drone strike on critical infrastructure especially in the kharkiv region how much of the money commit to the international fund for ukraine have be spend and how much be leave to be spend the uk will stand with the ukrainians for as long as it take for they to win 
 i be glad that the hon gentleman point out the remarkable courage of our ukrainian friend in their effort to counter the new axis of advance in the kharkiv region and we sincerely welcome the continued cross party support for ukraine 
 the hon gentleman express a concern which we share about the new law pass in georgia that be on the agenda of our discussion with ally it be beyond   my scope to comment on what might be on the agenda for the g7 or the epc but it be certainly an issue of concern that we discuss with trust partner and we have do so very frequently recently 
 a huge amount of institutional effort from our side be go into counter disinformation across the entire region as well as in the western balkans and central asia the former so call satellite state of russia which have a particular vulnerability to disinformation from the kremlin i will not go into detail about that effort but it be a significant piece of work and will continue to be important 
 the hon gentleman ask a good question about air defence we have gift thousand of unit of air defence to ukraine there will surely be more to come the uplift in financial support that we have announce will clearly be an issue for the ukrainians through our gift programme and air defence will feature heavily in that 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 i congratulate   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   on secure this important urgent question 
 the brutalisation of peaceful ordinary georgians and the hospitalisation of opposition leader david katsarava be utterly shameful can the minister assure we that he will protest directly to the georgian government and call in the ambassador regard the abuse of the public that we be see on our screen daily 
 on ukraine the fall of avdiivka at the start of this year be the shameful result of allied inaction on get ukraine what it need that fall on we we can not now see the same take place in kharkiv which be under assault for the reason set out already in this discussion can the minister please assure we that sufficient ammunition be reach the frontline now and update we on what we be do to procure sufficient artillery shell ukraine as ever need we to give it enough to win and not just to survive 
 we of course express our concern about the direction of travel with regard to protest in georgia i know that the foreign office have make representation to the ambassador here and will continue to keep a watching brief on that issue 
 my hon friend ask about kharkiv of course ammunition supply be a central component of our effort both politically and in term of what we be gift and source we have give over unit of ammunition however we acknowledge that we must all in the coalition of friendly western nation mobilise to a far great degree that be why we think that initiative come from the czech side and across all european and nato partner be important we must strain every sinew to ensure that the flow continue 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 those of we on the snp benches join the cross party support and i congratulate   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   on secure the urgent question 
 to follow the question from the chair of the foreign affairs committee on what more we can do for ukraine do the minister agree that now be the time for the uk to join other nato ally in support the czechia munition programme on top of what have already be provide 
 on georgia the government state that their aim be 
 to advance georgia ’s euro atlantic integration through security cooperation and support for democratic reform 
 give the dream party ’s lurch away from democratic reform how stable be that integration and security co operation do the minister agree that it be time for the people of georgia to have their say on the dream party ’s agenda 
 we have not join the czech programme because it would replicate work that we be already do but we commend its activity and see it as part of a broad solution to mobilise effort to increase the flow of munition so it be welcome 
 clearly the political future of georgia be a question for georgians themselves but we note that there be a lively debate which have of course spill out on to the street of tbilisi about the direction of travel i agree with the hon gentleman that the direction of travel whether euro atlantic or anything else should be a function of the democratic expression of the people of georgia 
 i applaud the number of personnel train under operation interflex but do the minister support my call to extend that operation to train ukrainian female defender volunteer 
 yes of course we will train whoever the ukrainians send we 
 i warn in that if we keep on feed the crocodile the danger be that we would be last on the menu that be why it be so important that we get the next step right over the next year in make sure that putin do not win in ukraine thing still perplex i why have we and our ally as a united team not dramatically ramp up the production of the artillery that ukraine actually need secondly why have we yet to seize russian state asset sit in british and european bank to repurpose they for reparation to pay for the reconstruction of ukraine 
 we be ramp up the production of artillery right across europe and in state beyond europe that be a complex effort involve the military industrial base those step be in place and i be confident that we will see an increase in supply the hon gentleman ask about state asset of course we want that to be the outcome but the route must be legal 
 we in britain relative to the size of our army have give more military equipment to ukraine than anyone we have now give the ukrainians all our heavy artillery to help they fight kharkiv can not be allow to fall but let we be honest all the kit that the ukrainians need to have win this war already from f-16s to long range missile have be sit in american storage depot for year when will we get it through to the   occupant of the white house that if he carry on dither and the russians take kharkiv not only do the ukrainians lose but he lose too literally 
 my right hon friend make a pertinent and correct point of course we lead as hard as we could in the aftermath of the invasion and we lead the way with the critical provision of system such as nlaw the next generation light anti tank weapon historian will reflect on whether the month follow the invasion be an opportunity miss to give a decisive advantage to our ukrainian friend but our focus now be on ensure that in the round and overwhelmingly the combined effect of the huge package from the united states as well as our and that of all friendly nation can ensure that the ukrainians maintain their defence and ultimately liberate their sovereign homeland 
 some time ago i ask the prime minister about our relationship with turkey we might have some issue with turkey but the fact remain that as it be geographically next door to georgia its strategic position be crucial furthermore turkey have important link with many of the player in this deeply dangerous situation what conversation be the foreign office have with ankara about resolve this situation 
 i think i can answer on behalf of my cross departmental colleague by say that there be many conversation we recognise the centrality of turkey ’s importance as a strong nato ally and a nation with tremendous military confidence it have also make a remarkable contribution to the defence of ukraine ’s sovereignty by the provision of the remarkable bayraktar weapon system 
 i welcome the fact that the minister say that the uk government want to continue work with georgia that be quite right but be he aware that jim o’brien the senior us state department official say yesterday that the relationship between the us and georgia could be at risk and review and that financial and travel restriction could be impose be it not the case that all that could be avoid if the georgian government drop the foreign agent law or at least amend it significantly 
 my right hon friend who speak with authority be right in his analysis of course we note the us view and we have express our concern we will continue to use our strong relationship with the georgians to ensure that they amend for their own interest their behaviour 
 leed sister city be kharkiv the people of leeds be gravely concerned that the invasion of kharkiv be imminent colleague have already ask about artillery shell which be in short supply but even bullet be in short supply what be the uk do to supply the ukrainian defence of kharkiv with bullet be we upscale humanitarian aid to kharkiv and utilise it for the evacuation of civilian who want to leave will the uk government supply additional visa for kharkivians who want to come to the uk the people of leeds be ready to welcome they into their home 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question i now realise leeds be the sister city of kharkiv which be interesting we be put more money than ever before into lethal aid support for ukraine an additional £ will take our support this year to £ and a lot of that will go on munition but humanitarian aid be also significant and be an important part of the picture 
 like any bully russia will advance if it feel that the west be not support ukraine the russians have see that we in the west have not be support ukraine enough because of the lack of ammunition go in for any soldier the supply of ammunition be as the minister be fully aware crucial to confidence and morale can we give the big possible push to ensure that what the americans have say be go to the frontline reach it i see this morning that they say that some ammunition have already arrive have it already arrive and what be the timetable for the rest this be completely unfair on the armed force out there 
 my right hon friend ’s analogy of russia as a bully be absolutely correct we be focus on increase ammunition supply my judgment be that the $ package from the us combine with our additional support will result in a tangible improvement in the operational situation on the frontline 
 as we know georgia alongside ukraine aspire to join nato do the minister agree therefore that it be important that georgia respect peaceful protest on ukraine with the russians close in on be within artillery range of kharkiv what military support can we deliver now to prevent russia from be able to bombard that city which would be catastrophic for the civilian population 
 i agree with my hon friend ’s analysis of georgia ’s nato aspiration that be clear the support we can give now be to continue our remarkable supply of lethal aid particularly with regard to air defence 
 what putin be do in georgia now be exactly the same thing that he try to do in ukraine year ago yet unlike the american government the british government do not seem to be think of any recalibration at all with the current georgian regime which be beat up its own citizen in the street of tbilisi why have the georgian ambassador in london not at least be summon what action rather than just word have be take to make our view completely clear to the current georgian government that their behaviour and this legislation be unacceptable 
 in truth those be question for my colleague in the foreign commonwealth and development office but our analysis be that the strong relationship we have with the georgians in the defence sector be an important mean of ensure that their direction of travel be a positive 
 there be grow concern across central and northern europe about georgia will the minister have conversation   with colleague in government to ensure that the commitment to nato of our partner across europe be increase to prepare for the undoubted expansionism that putin be currently engage in and that he will probably step up in the come month 
 the answer be yes mr speaker of course the hon gentleman will have observe as i have that the consequence of putin ’s effort to demonstrate nato ’s weakness have be exactly the opposite nato be now large and strong than it be before february we will lead the way in ensure that all member meet the investment require to be a member of that tremendous defensive alliance 
 i congratulate   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   on secure this urgent question the united kingdom have lead the world in support ukraine militarily economically diplomatically and politically and as a former minister with responsibility for sanction i see the real impact that the united kingdom could have with its partner in work together on this issue there be however a real loophole within the international strategy to cut off putin ’s finance the united nations peacekeeping force of which we be a member currently procure its military helicopter from russia so that money go back into putin ’s pocket be the minister or the government aware of that fact and now that they be will the government raise it at the g7 to urgently ensure we cut off putin ’s finance 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that point and will ensure that my colleague the minister with responsibility for sanction take it into account 
 we be unite in our determination to support ukraine as it seek to defeat putin labour welcome the creation of a new uk latvian drone capability coalition early this year and the uk ’s commitment to spend £ on drone for ukraine can the minister confirm when the drone under that initiative will be deliver to ukrainian force 
 very soon 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group on georgia i have watch the demonstration in tbilisi with no little concern although i have notice no new movement of georgia towards russia as some have be suggest whether culturally economically or militarily it would appear that the current georgian dream government be become more ready to use the apparatus of the state to suppress political dissent free speech and the medium sometimes with violence will my hon friend impress on his georgian counterpart as an ally and a friend that this be not how democratic country behave if they wish to join western institution and participate as a free democratic value country 
 my hon friend be correct georgia must live up to the standard require if it be to be sincere about its democratic aspiration and we do make that point to our friend in georgia 
 we be all rightly proud of the skill of our armed force personnel and the training that they be provide for ukrainians through operation interflex but i understand that that programme be only designate up until this summer can the minister confirm that it will continue for as long as it be need 
 wholeheartedly mr speaker our commitment to train our ukrainian ally be endure and of course we will always respond to the type and form of training that they themselves require 
 event in the united states and the understandable focus on the conflict in gaza and the unacceptable loss of life there have lead some to argue that our support for ukraine be waver can the minister seek to put a stop to that deliberate disinformation by set out that our support for ukraine be absolute that we stand in solidarity with the ukrainians in their fight against putin ’s illegal aggression and that in some respect they be battle on our behalf because as we see putin ’s aggression will not stop with ukraine give that will the minister also set out how we will ensure that the ammunition that be so desperately need get to the frontline as quickly as possible 
 i welcome the hon lady ’s question by any measure our commitment to ukraine be significant and unwavering that be recently express by the increase in our annual support from £ of lethal aid to £ and by the year defensive alliance that the prime minister sign with president zelensky on his recent visit to kyiv 
 i thank my colleague and hon friend   the member for strangford jim shannon   for secure this urgent question what help and support be we as a nation give to those country in eastern europe such as estonia that feel under threat from the potential threat of putin want to expand back into what be formerly russian territory 
 that be a very good question the support we be give be welcome those country as brother and sister country into the defensive nato alliance in our case we be very proud to have our enhance forward presence battle group in tallin and estonia any member who have visit that battle group as i have know that there be a tremendous esprit de corps generate by the tremendous joint defensive work carry out by our british soldier alongside their estonian ally

 it be right and proper that this house acknowledge the work of our armed force particularly on op banner but we should recognise that captain nairac be a different sort of officer in many way i think we would all accept that for instance he break my nose for the time while spar in the boxing ring i must admit but he also leave pint of guinness on the naafi bar at the end of the evening because i give he a good dig back that be what he be about he be in the armed force and in northern ireland because he want to make a difference for the people of northern ireland that be something that this house should respect 
 may i say that i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for inform i that he would raise this matter as he know it be not a point of order for the chair but the house will understand why he want to put that point on record and he have do so eloquently as he have do in previous year 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i thank my right hon friend   the member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning who almost every year have visit the church of st mary de lode in gloucester in order to pay tribute to and commemorate the work do by captain nairac gc whose memory be also celebrate there through a stain glass window in his honour i be very grateful to my right hon friend for continue to raise this matter year after year 
 once again that be also not a point of order but it be certainly on the record 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to provide for a power to require a person to grant access to their digital device in the course of a lawful inspection under the customs and excise management act where there be a reasonable suspicion that the device may contain child sexual abuse material to provide that refusal to grant such access constitute an offence and for connected purpose 
 i begin by outline the scale of the problem this bill seek to tackle up to individual in the united kingdom represent a sexual risk to child accord to the national strategic assessment we also know that of online offender be hand on abuser too in girl and in boy be sexually assault before the age of child sexual abuse material or csam be abundant online so much so that almost unique csam file be know to uk law enforcement and the number be grow all the time 
 the digital age have bring with it tremendous opportunity for advancement in many area communication have never be easy and the world have never be small but as the world have become small criminal network have grow large law enforcement be still have to play catch up and as a result tragically unforgivably more and more child be become victim to sexual predator 
 the uk border force be our line of defence against people travel with the intent to cause harm whatever that may be its search power have be sufficient to stop terrorist and drug smuggler but they be not sufficient to stop child abuser that be because the law govern the scope of its search power be draft in the 1970 long before the digital age a single photo take from of today ’s smartphone could easily exceed the entire capacity of even the high spec 1970s floppy disk then at the revolutionary cutting edge of computing it be an era when it be not even conceivable that sexual predator would be travel across border with potentially thousand of illegal photo and video in the palm of their hand 
 the outdated law in question be the customs and excise management act it grant the power for a border force agent to search an individual and their baggage to detect the import or export of prohibit good border force do not require reasonable ground to suspect that the individual be in possession of prohibit good to utilise this power of search in a port environment while existing power permit border force to require an individual to present their baggage include their digital device those power do not extend to require a person to open that baggage to unlock a device if they refuse to do so when ask there be nothing that border force can do 
 in previous decade csam would amount to a stack of polaroid which be often unmistakable and readily detectable now all this material be carry digitally and often behind encryption software and passcode to expand on this point there have be several example of lone individual identify as possess belonging   associate with the commission of sexual offence against child for example toy lubricant condom and child ’s underwear in these circumstance where it be reasonable to suspect that the individual may be in possession of digital csam border force can not inspect the digital device unless the individual consent each time this happen we could be let a dangerous abuser into the united kingdom undetecte as i mention in my westminster hall debate on the same subject late last year even when notify it can take week for the police to trace an individual and there have be case where a suspect have rap or more young girl before be catch 
 my bill give border force the power it need to prevent this under it an individual refuse to unlock their digital device would be subject to arrest for a new offence of obstruction if an international passenger of any nationality arrive in or depart from the uk and border force reasonably suspect the individual to be involve in child sexual abuse border force officer will ask they to unlock their digital device so that they can perform a scan to determine beyond any reasonable doubt the presence of csam as verify by the home office ’s database if the individual complie the scan will take place and if content be detect the individual will be arrest under the act if they refuse they commit an offence and their device will be seize and forensically examine by the police or the national crime agency
