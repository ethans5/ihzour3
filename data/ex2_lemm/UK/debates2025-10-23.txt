 i know that my hon friend have be a vocal campaigner for her constituent in relation to the injustice experience through the probation service in and around her constituency public protection be of course a key priority for this government and serious further offence although rare be devastating for victim and their family the ministry of justice and his majesty ’s prison and probation service take learning from serious further offence review inspectorate of probation report and internal audits to identify opportunity for improvement and the cabinet office support those departments in these endeavour

 i welcome the covenant and the minister ’s response research from the national council for voluntary organisations indicate that the charity and voluntary sector deliver £ of public service annually in my constituency hillingdon citizen advice bureau mencap and mind provide vital advice and support but in recent year their funding have be cut by the local authority what step be the cabinet office take to reform public procurement and strengthen partnership work with the voluntary sector so that such organisation can play a great role in future 
 i know that my hon friend have be a real leader in work with voluntary organisation in his constituency of uxbridge and south ruislip and indeed across the country as he know those organisation be often close to the community they serve i be proud to say that from april next year all government departments must set a year target for direct spend with voluntary community and social enterprise and they must publish their result annually that be a clear commitment to this government ’s belief that the voluntary community and social enterprise sector be vital to rebuild and renew our country 
 i welcome the minister ’s reassurance the uk share prosperity fund be about to come to an end to be replace by the local growth fund and voluntary and community organisation in northern ireland have real concern that they will be leave in limbo between end and the other starting i recognise what the minister just say about the year funding pot but what reassurance can he give those organisation in northern ireland that their funding will carry over they support some of the most vulnerable people in our community 
 my understanding be that the new funding will start in the new financial year but i will look into the specific issue the hon gentleman raise in relation to northern ireland and i will write to he to reassure he on that

 this government ’s aim be to recruit the bright and good talent into the civil service brilliant people from across the uk with the skill to deliver the priority of the british people we have already take step to improve recruitment with the ever cross government standardise recruitment process and benchmark to strengthen accountability and bring fast high quality and more inclusive recruitment fast fair inclusive that be our recruitment vision 
 the government be restrict application to the civil service fast stream summer internship programme in favour of those kid who they deem to be from working class background what do the minister have to say to the child of hard work nurse police officer and teacher who will now not get the same opportunity because of decision make by this government 
 the fast stream programme of which i be proud to be a graduate be the no graduate employee scheme in the country we be proud that we have have over applicant for just appointment we know that we have do very well in increase diversity with application from ethnic minority candidate woman and people with disability but we be fall short in application from those from low socioeconomic background i make no apology about take proactive decision to ensure that people who do not necessarily have the same social capital or relationship strength as those from other high social background can take internship the number of working class people in the civil service be time small than the broad uk workforce and we be take action on that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 last year the government promise we that they be go to slash the size of the civil service but instead the late figure show that the size of the civil service have increase by compare with last year it be not only other departments that have fail to get a grip the headcount of the minister ’s own department be up by will the minister guarantee that when the   next set of figure be publish it will show a reduction in the size of the civil service and the size of the cabinet office 
 under the last tory government boris johnson say that he would cut the number of people employ by the civil service by but that figure go up jeremy hunt say that he would cap number in the civil service but they go up the conservatives lose control of the civil service just as they lose control of our border our street and our prison but we be take action to bring those number down 
 i think that the minister be miss the fact that she be in government now and have be for well over a year but the number be go up not down as they promise the minister be correct when she say that the civil service must be able to recruit the bright and the good but surely she can see that that be not help when the most senior civil servant hand pick by the prime minister barely month ago face a barrage of medium briefing from within government will the minister and her department commission an inquiry into the breach of the code of conduct for special adviser follow the personal attack on the cabinet secretary and will she condemn the vicious medium briefing that have clearly come from within no.10

 in less than month this government have deliver defence contract that will support scottish job for year to come invest in the pride of place scheme which will see scottish town centre rejuvenate include those in north lanarkshire and commit record funding to the scottish parliament to invest in scottish public service do my right hon friend agree that that stand in stark contrast to the priority of the snp in government in holyrood which have just waste more taxpayer money on produce yet another tired paper on independence while in scot wait on nhs waiting list 
 my hon friend rightly recognise the defence dividend that labour have deliver for scotland include the recent £ frigate deal with norway as my hon friend ’s constituent will know only too well more people have wait over year for nhs   treatment in lanarkshire alone compare with the whole of england that be a remarkable stat next year voter in airdrie and shotts and across scotland will look at that record and have the chance to vote out the tired snp government who be fail to deliver on public service in scotland and choose a new direction with anas sarwar and scottish labour

 i be sorry to hear about the situation in the hon gentleman ’s constituency he know that the government take flood risk very seriously and it be a key risk in our national risk register that be why the government have increase spending on flood defence significantly in the recent budget and spending review but i absolutely recognise that there be more to do i will ensure that we look at the specific circumstance in his constituency and help he to understand when funding will come to support his constituent

 may i welcome the hon lady to her new spokesperson role we recognise the impact that brexit have have on the uk economy which be why we have enter into a new trade deal in our year in government with the european union a very key part of that be the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement for food and drink trade which my right hon friend   the member for torfaen nick thomas symonds   be work on with european counterpart at the moment once that be implement we look forward to see trade improve growth increase and price come down on the shelf in supermarket across the united kingdom

 absolutely and that have be my objective throughout ibca take a test and learn approach and this house quite rightly hold i to account at the start of that process when the number be low those number be rise exponentially at the moment that be why there be offer total over £ but the hon lady should be reassure that i be not complacent and will continue to drive progress

 how many work day have be impact by strike in the civil service since july 
 i declare that i be a member of the unite union and refer to my relevant entry in the register of members financial interests on support in general election campaign the office for national statistics estimate that working day be lose because of labour dispute in the public administration and defence sector which include the majority of the civil service between july and august that be down from the day lose between may and june 
 i be grateful for that answer albeit partial from the minister because he be quite right he rely on the office for national statistics for the compilation of these figure now even its staff have a strike mandate they be refuse to attend work even for day a week what be the government do to enforce attendance level at work when do he think the ons will find time to report on it 
 attendance level be certainly important but the hon gentleman have get some chutzpah because under the previous prime minister i note he be no long in his place although he be early in the question the uk lose more day due to strike action than france do and the hon gentleman be here try to lecture we about it we will work in partnership with trade union to avoid unnecessary disruption and not end up in the situation that the last government do 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 this be my appearance at the dispatch box as chief secretary to the prime minister in this role i have be task with modernise the state to build a system that will well deliver the public ’s priority and well communicate the change we be make across the country sadly too many political party today wish to tear down our institution and the public service we all rely on as the solution to the public ’s frustration with a legacy system that struggle to deliver change but there be an alternative this government be commit to renewal and deliver on the promise of change we will build a modern state and well public service that be there when people need they we will lead the way to a britain renew 
 with your permission mr speaker i will just answer the question from the official opposition that i could not answer in substantive question about when i be inform of the crown prosecution service decision to not proceed with the case i be inform of this decision after the prime minister i should also inform the house that i look forward to answer more question before the joint committee on the national security strategy on wednesday next week 
 transform britain ’s public service will be a mammoth task but while the white heat of artificial intelligence and digital technology offer a revolutionary opportunity to improve performance and value for money in healthcare tax service and everything in between will the government seize this opportunity to modernise our public service work with the bright and good industry across britain 
 the answer be absolutely yes all our constituent know from their experience at home whether they be try to do their banking do their shopping or book a holiday that they have the power to do it when they want to do it how they want to do it on their phone with service deliver in the way they want that be in complete contrast to a number of our public service and the public rightly expect when they be pay tax money for public service that we catch up with the private sector and deliver well public service that work in the way they want

 the hon member seem to be confuse by his list of institution the only relevant institution in this case be the crown prosecution service it be the cps that independently decide whether to bring forward these case and it be the independent decision of the crown prosecution service not to proceed might i just point out that the opposition ’s argument over the last few week have be quite bemusing they start with an accusation that there be political interference in a crown prosecution service case that be prove not to be the case so they change their argument and be now ask why do you not politically interfere because that be the way we do thing in this country

 in the absence of a plan the government appear to be centralise power and bureaucracy in the form of new quango more than have be create since this government come into office what be the minister do to drive ministerial accountability and crucially to ensure that there be sunset clause so that when quango have meet their objective they be wind up and come to an end 
 the government agree with the principle of the hon member ’s question as i say to the house early we want to reduce the layer of bureaucracy and to be able to deliver more action and few word that be why we be take action to close arm ’s length body and other institution most significantly we have announce that we will close nhs england and bring decision back into the department for health and social care for ministers to make 
 i be pleased that the minister give an update early on the work of the infected blood compensation authority but the process be still take too long may i press the minister to undertake work specifically to expedite the timescale in which compensation be expect to be pay 
 my hon friend be a powerful advocate for infected blood victim and he can rest assure that i will continue to drive progress as quickly as i possibly can that be how we have get to the stage where over £ worth of offer have be make and i will continue to drive that progress quickly 
 i   have   recently be contact by international house torquay a language school which have welcome the opportunity for german foreign student to use id card to travel as a group can the minister advise what further opportunity   there will be for other european country such as switzerland italy and spain to take advantage of a similar scheme 
 we be go even far than that because the government be look to negotiate a youth experience scheme with the european union it will of course be cap but it will give significant opportunity not just for young brits to travel work and study abroad but to welcome young europeans here 
 at my meet and greet session last week my constituent mick also raise that point about the importance of our young people have more opportunity to work and study abroad include in europe i be so pleased by the government ’s announcement of a youth mobility scheme with the eu but could i ask the minister for an update on those plan and how they will benefit my constituent in aylesbury 
 i thank my hon friend for again raise this issue any scheme would give young brit include her young constituent in aylesbury the opportunity to travel and experience other country culture as well as to work and study abroad of course the exact parameter will be subject to discussion and negotiation be under way but we certainly hope to stand up these opportunity for young brits as soon as possible 
 i welcome the paymaster general ’s remark on the acceleration of the delivery of payment in relation to infected blood it be very welcome for of my constituent who have have it i also welcome his response to the additional report by sir brian langstaff in july give that can he update the house on the lifetime of the public inquiry and any conversation he have have about end the inquiry which seem to be go on rather a long time give that the legislation be pass in may last year 
 i be very grateful to the right hon gentleman and i again pay tribute to he for his hugely important work in this area when he be the paymaster general on the public inquiry and the recent report i hope to update the house in due course subject of course to your permission mr speaker about action on the recommendation on the public inquiry remain open that be of course a matter for the chair sir brian langstaff 
 i have hear from small business locally include a butcher ’s and a lighting supplier about how brexit have impose extra barrier on small business such as theirs will the minister outline how the uk eu common understanding will improve condition for small business particularly those that import from and export to the eu 
 my hon friend be a powerful advocate for her constituent and the common understanding will of course benefit the business she mention our deal on emission energy trading food and agricultural trade will all reduce cost for business   astonishingly the conservatives and   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   want to reverse that and reimpose those cost on business 
 give that the cabinet office advise the government on establish public inquiry will the minister meet the family of the senior military and intelligence personnel who be kill when an raf chinook helicopter crash on the mull of kintyre in the family have gather compelling evidence suggest that the ministry of defence be aware that the mk chinook in which they be travel be not airworthy they be petition the government to establish an independent judge lead public inquiry will the minister meet the family or at least advise a relevant cabinet colleague so to do 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman who raise a very serious case if he be able to write to i directly about it i will certainly look at what would be the most suitable ministerial meeting 
 i recently meet estonian mp to hear about their experience of use digital id over the last decade and particularly about how people ’s ability to see who have access their datum be the cornerstone of the data privacy control at the heart of their system they talk about the efficiency gain across the public and private sector such as when someone change their name after marriage or buy a property how do the minister see modernisation of the state improve the delivery of public service in the uk 
 in our public service almost everywhere we look outdated digital and datum system trap we in the past we be laser focus on reform the state central to that be a free universal digital id that will bring the state to all citizen and improve access to public service a national digital identity system be a public good that be long overdue and this government will deliver it 
 the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster have just come to the dispatch box and say that we have do a new trade deal with the european union which i think be news to both the prime minister and brussels the only thing this government have do so far in term of eu relation be to sell out our fishing industry for the next year with that in mind will the minister actually stand up for british interest in future negotiation with brussels 
 i stand up for british interest in every negotiation with brussels i will tell the hon gentleman what be not stand up for british interest we negotiate within month of come into government the new common understanding that will be good for job bear down on bill and give we the tool to secure our border the leader of the conservative party oppose it before even read it 
 i have be think about the cost of software licensing in the public sector because north west anglia nhs   foundation trust be try to move to an electronic patient record and of the big ongoing cost of that be party payment for software other trust be in the same position as be many school pay for pupil management software will the procurement minister commit to look into whether we can instead deliver some of that in house and save significant sum 
 case of the kind my hon friend be talk about be the reason we have be consult on a public interest test on the specific case he raise if he write to i i will ensure that the parliamentary secretary cabinet office my hon friend   the member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven chris ward   provide he with a response 
 my constituent phil be in the special category mechanism for the people who be inexplicably exclude from the infected blood compensation scheme in february even though the government ’s expert group say in august last year that they should be compensate on   june the paymaster general say he would consider the compensation arrangement i may have miss it forgive i if i have but i also ask for a list of condition that might be include within that do he have an update for i please 
 i be certainly look at the issue of the special category mechanism as i undertake to do if the hon lady write to i i can look at the specific list but i be also hop with mr speaker ’s permission to update the house on this and other infected blood issue very shortly 
 resident in a housing development in my constituency be face a number of issue after yet another developer have go bust part of the share communal land have revert back to the ownership of the duchy of cornwall rather than to the resident themselves who have to purchase the land back and cover the duchy ’s legal cost the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster quite rightly have cabinet oversight but who do the duchy of cornwall answer to and what recourse do my constituent now have in this case 
 if the hon member write to i with his constituency case i will make sure that the duchy of cornwall look at it in due course 
 eastbourne be benefit from some coastal defence scheme funding the flood defence grant in aid but it leave heritage asset behind only resident and business currently qualify which be leave eastbourne ’s historic bandstand at risk of severe flooding will the minister meet i and colleague across the department for culture media and sport and the department for environment food and rural affairs to review the loophole that leave our bandstand behind 
 i recognise the problem the decision be to use the budget available to protect people ’s home and that have leave other building at comparable   risk the relevant defra minister be work with dcms on this issue i will ensure that a conversation can take place 
 on the infected blood compensation scheme in northern ireland as of   february people have start the process with offer make total some £ what assessment have be make of the time take from when an application be make to when a payment actually arrive through the door 
 the infected blood compensation authority be operationally independent but i be accountable to this house it be important that i have regular conversation and provide challenge on the kind of timescale the hon gentleman be talk about the infected blood scandal predate modern day    devolution and he can rest assure that all corner of the united kingdom be at the forefront of my mind in respect of the speed of delivery 
 the minister be early ask about the ever grow size of the civil service and the cabinet office under this government and whether we would see those number come down not go up next year instead of answer the question about the future they talk about the past let i ask the question again but from a different angle when be this government go to take ownership of the fact that they be in government now and these be their problem that they need to resolve 
 i be very happy to take ownership of the fact that we be in government and very happy to confirm that the conservatives be in opposition 
 urgent question to ask the solicitor general if she will make a statement about the role of the attorney general ’s office in the decision to drop the china spy prosecution 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise this urgent question follow the deeply disappointing collapse of the prosecution case concern individual charge under the official secrets act 
 it be a bedrock constitutional principle that prosecution in this country be free from political influence this mean that it be prosecutor not politician who decide which case to prosecute it be prosecutor not politician who decide what evidence will be use at criminal trial and it be prosecutor not politician who decide when case should be drop 
 although individual decision be make independently and protect from political influence the crown prosecution service as an organisation be superintend by the attorney general by virtue of the prosecution of offences act the detail of what that mean in practice be set out in the framework agreement between the law officers and the director of public prosecutions sign by the then attorney general under the previous government the framework make it plain that the role of the cps be to take independent decision on individual case refer to it by the police and other criminal investigation authority base on the evidence available and the public interest in pursue a prosecution which accord with the code for crown prosecutor 
 there be a limited number of offence include those under the official secrets act for which parliament have make statutory provision require the attorney general ’s consent to prosecute in individual case in do so the law officer act in a quasi judicial capacity independently of government and apply the same two- stage test as the code consent be give by my predecessor on   april follow that date no law officer intervene in the case at any stage it would have be wholly inappropriate for they to do so 
 once consent be give the law officer play no ongoing role if the prosecutor contemplate drop the case because of evidential reason they be require to inform the attorney general of the decision as soon as it have be take that be what happen in this case the dpp and senior treasury counsel have already confirm that the decision to offer no evidence in this case be make without any political influence and the cabinet secretary director of public prosecutions attorney general and chief secretary to the prime minister will all give write and oral evidence to the joint committee on the national security strategy this and next week 
 the ongoing disinformation around the collapse of this case be now distract from the most important issue that we should all be focus on which be how the government can work across party and with the uk law enforcement community to ensure that chinese espionage and interference be not successful in the uk 
 let i cut to the chase it be standard practice for the cps to inform the attorney general if a case of political significance that have require attorney general consent in the place be likely to be drop we be tell that the attorney general be inform that this case be at risk but have not formally be end in august be this correct can the solicitor general provide the exact date of that meeting 
 it would have be the attorney general ’s duty to ask why the case be at risk that do not mean seek to change the independent judgment of the cps on whether to proceed but it could and should have mean ask and ensure that more evidence be provide to the cps at its request it be abundantly clear that the cps be ask for further evidence on the question of whether china pose a current threat to national security so the attorney general and the government have a decision to make whether to provide the evidence or not even if they think that it be excessive to do so 
 the attorney general must have understand what be require we be tell that he be an eminent lawyer so what do he do the moment he know who do he inform within government and when do he inform the prime minister or his office do he take any step to ensure that the evidence be provide 
 we know that on   september   the director general of the ag ’s office attend a meeting at which the case be discuss at that point the case could still have be salvage at that meeting do the attorney general ’s office push for further evidence to be provide follow that meeting the sunday times have report that the attorney general ’s office be ask to speak to the cps can the sg confirm whether anyone from the ago speak directly or indirectly to the cps 
 the ag know that the case be go to collapse in august he know what be require to save it but unless the solicitor general can provide a compelling account today we must all conclude that the ag on behalf of the government choose not to provide it he may not have kill the case but he allow it to die there be example in the recent past of ag have the candour to come to the house and explain that the government and the prosecute authority have choose to drop case that raise the high national security question for diplomatic reason will the sg today have the candour to do exactly the same with this case 
 today we have hear from the shadow justice secretary yet more of the baseless smear that have characterise the conservative party ’s approach to a matter of such importance to this house and the whole nation he know that the attorney general will give evidence next week as soon as tuesday to the joint committee on the national security strategy 
 like i the shadow justice secretary train and practise in law so he should know the importance of consistency when put a case together yet his word today have bring only more confusion to the conservatives chaotic approach they accuse the government of political interference in this case without evidence when that be disproven they argue that we do not interfere but should have interfere in an independent prosecution so which be it their approach have serve only to distract from their own failing and frankly do a disservice to the history and heritage of their party 
 i respectfully remind the house that part of the reason we find ourselves in this situation be because the conservatives spend their year in government fight among themselves and not fix glare hole in our national security law the charge in this case be bring under the official secrets act 
 you be suppose to be a law officer answer the question 
 order mr jenrick when you get a uq you get your time and i want you to be hear in silence quite rightly because this be an important issue that affect this house but i do not need barrack from the opposition benches i want you to help i if you wish to catch my eye in the future this be not the good way to do so 
 the charge in this case be bring under the official secrets act outdated legislation draw up even before the dawn of world war as i say the attorney general the chief secretary to the prime minister the deputy national security adviser the cabinet secretary and the director of public prosecutions will all appear before the joint committee on the national security strategy next week and the government have commit to fully engage with committees across both houses as this issue be rightly scrutinise 
 along with proper parliamentary scrutiny another core tenet of our democracy be a prosecution service free of political interference that be something that we on this side of the house will always defend 
 give that the conservatives during their year of chaotic power seek to develop an even close relationship with china can i urge the government to continue labour ’s approach which be to look at opportunity to work together while not compromise our value and national interest at any time 
 i agree with my hon friend ’s position i remind the house that the test in this case apply to how china be view under the previous government not this 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 throughout these revelation ministers and the prime minister ’s spokesperson have repeatedly claim that the government have no sight of the witness statement and no input the pm himself say that at prime minister ’s question last week but the government legal service ’s own guidance require the attorney general to be consult on the most sensitive legal case involve the government in a case as high profile as this where the very integrity of parliament and our national security be at stake do the attorney general the government ’s top legal adviser really not review the witness statement before they be submit on behalf of the government if not please could the solicitor general tell we why not give the very serious national security implication will the sg commit to a statutory independent inquiry into why the case collapse and will she please    update the house as to when the government will share the full china audit with the intelligence and security committee 
 as i set out in my answer to the urgent question the previous law officer give consent to prosecute in april after that happen it be right that there be no further involvement of law officers in case in accordance with the framework that be how thing work it be right that politician do not interfere with prosecution in criminal case and that be what happen in this case once consent to prosecute be grant 
 may i just start by say that nobody in this house be dispute the independence of the prosecution or indeed the judicial officer nobody have have any dispute on that point at all the question be a different it be whether an official who be give evidence not on his behalf but on behalf of the government should have have any communication with his own government after the prosecutor say that the evidence be not sufficient 
 argument be that if the government be not supply enough evidence surely they should supply a little bit more but the argument that the government be use be that the official give evidence on the basis of the previous government ’s view between and well that be a little odd because the labour party manifesto be not write until and yet he quote it in his evidence there be an incoherence here either he be give evidence on the basis of the previous government ’s view between and in which case the labour party manifesto be irrelevant or he be reflect the view of the government post in which case the quotation of the labour party manifesto be relevant which be it 
 in term of the witness statement to start with the and by far most substantive witness statement be the make under the previous government in relation to more recent statement the conservatives starting argument be that the government in some way interfere with the evidence and now they seem to be criticise the fact that we do not interfere with the evidence it be right that the deputy national security adviser give that evidence free from any political interference as have be confirm numerous time in this house already 
 my right hon friend   the member for newark robert jenrick   be quite right throughout the whole saga as my right hon friend   the member for tonbridge tom tugendhat   make clear there have be conflict story about who do what and why it could or could not be do all in the same breath but we know the rule require that the attorney general be consult on matter that be politically sensitive it do not cut across his independence it simply mean that he or she have to be inform at the time we understand from the director of public prosecutions that the attorney general must have be tell that there be insufficient evidence to prosecute if so the attorney general ’s role in this matter independently be to say to the authority in the government you be not provide sufficient evidence this prosecution will collapse unless you do do the attorney general say   to the government you be not provide enough evidence to secure a prosecution it be over to you to do as you have be ask by the dpp 
 the attorney general will be give his evidence to the committee next week i think it be right to say that the case be drop by the cps not on public interest ground but on evidential ground when a case be drop on evidential ground the framework set out that the law officer be inform when that have happen and not that there be consultation beforehand this be a case that do not continue on evidential ground 
 give the important national security implication of this whole sorry case what assessment have the attorney general ’s office make of the impact that the decision may have on confidence in our ability to prosecute alleged foreign interference 
 this case be prosecute under legislation that be in force when the alleged offence be commit in to the law have now change it take the conservative party many year to tighten up national security legislation it pass with support from labour members and under the legislation as it stand now it be easy to bring prosecution of this nature because the enemy test no long have to be satisfied 
 the attorney general have a duty to superintend prosecution agency the government have previously define superintendence as inter alia 
 a right for the attorney general to be consult and inform about difficult sensitive and high profile case 
 of which this be clearly give that the attorney general be responsible by statute for the superintendence of the crown prosecution service and overall super- intendency of the dpp and additionally have the requirement for consent to prosecute certain category of criminal offence such as those relate to official secret what action do the attorney general take once he have be inform of the potential collapse of the china spy trial 
 as i have set out consent to prosecute in this case have to be grant by law officers and that be do under the previous government once consent be grant it be for the cps to prosecute a case rightly without political interference this case be discontinue by the cps on evidential ground as oppose to public interest ground i be sure that the hon member be aware of the part test for prosecutor when a case be discontinue on evidential ground it be not for the cps to consult with law officer in advance of that i say again that the attorney general will give write evidence this week and then oral evidence on tuesday 
 none of it make sense not the collapse trial chagos or the embassy but as my right hon friend   the member for new forest east sir julian lewis   say it all make sense if the government have prioritise a strategic relationship with communist china do it not 
 i politely remind the right hon gentleman that this case be to be try under the government ’s position in relation to china between and when his party be in government 
 the solicitor general have repeatedly say that prosecutor and not politician should decide whether to prosecute of course that be the case but that be a straw man argument the issue here be not political interference in the decision to prosecute but political interference in the evidence that be give to the cps affect its ability to prosecute we have be tell that the attorney general be inform why be he inform if not to allow he to take action to perfect the evidence why do he not 
 the prime minister and the dpp have both confirm that there be no political interference in the evidence give by the deputy national security adviser and rightly so the conservative party can not have it both way the argument be that we interfere with the evidence and now it seem to be that we do not which be it 
 the sunday times report that follow a key meeting on   september the attorney general ’s office be ask to speak to the cps do anyone from the attorney general ’s office speak directly or indirectly to the cps after that meeting 
 there be a meeting on   september   in relation to this matter which as i understand it take place on the basis that the prosecution would go ahead it be to discuss bilateral relation with china in the context of the ongoing legal case 
 the director of public prosecutions have say that the case be drop because effort over many month to get evidence that china represent a threat to national security be not forthcoming from this government when be the attorney general inform that the case be at risk and what do he do 
 in order for this case to succeed it be base on the relationship with china at the time of the offence and how china be view then i have already refer to the meeting on   september which be on the presumption that the case would continue the attorney general will set out his evidence to the joint committee on the national security strategy next week 
 i previously ask the security minister about the lack of inclusion of china on the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme what input or advice have the attorney general or the solicitor general give to the government on that give the ongoing situation will she now reconsider and push for the government to do that 
 under the law as it now stand it would be easy to bring prosecution in case such as these we be deeply disappointed that this prosecution do not go ahead but i will get back to he on the specific point that he raise 
 the solicitor general have express several time she and presumably the government ’s disappointment at the fact that this do not go to trial that disappointment would suggest that she and the government wish for an alternative outcome the simple point that i and my constituent can not get our head around they have contact i about this because they be outraged and concerned be that if the government wish for an alternative outcome why do they not exhaust every single possibility to bolster the case of the cps regardless of interference and there be no question of political interference why do they not exhaust every single opportunity to put the cps in the strong possible position to ensure a successful prosecution 
 the government be disappoint that this prosecution do not go ahead if the previous conservative government have tighten our law in relation to national security before we may not have find ourselves in this position it be absolutely right that there be no political interference with the witness evidence it be an important part of our constitution that criminal prosecution be do without political interference 
 when be the attorney general inform that the case be go to collapse 
 the attorney general will be set out his evidence to the joint committee next tuesday 
 to be perfectly honest i do not know what the point be in i ask this question because we have have week of statement and urgent question and ministers keep attack straw man and answer question that be not actually be ask it be pathetic 
 on monday the security minister come to the house and be ask several time when the home secretary know that the case be go to collapse and what representation she make to ensure that the case be as strong as possible he do not answer that several time when do the home secretary know what representation do she make and to whom do she make they surely among they be the national security adviser the prime minister and the attorney general 
 i do not speak on behalf of the home secretary but i be sure that she will be happy to address the hon member ’s point 
 i welcome the solicitor general to her new role and wish she every success and happiness in it hopefully it will not be as hard the next time round as the chinese spy prosecution case roll on and on concern on the ground be grow about the state of national security and our intelligence community do she accept the lack of confidence that have arise from the handling of this case what can be do to assure british citizen that their interest and security be the top priority for this government not trade link with china 
 i thank the hon member for those kind word this case be bring under the official secrets act there be now new legislation in place which mean it be no long necessary to prove the enemy part of the test in order to bring a successful prosecution that will make it easy to bring prosecution of this nature in future it be regretful that the previous government do not bring in this legislation soon have they do so i expect we would not have find ourselves in the situation we be in today 
 on a point of order mr speaker may i ask your advice unusually the attorney general do not sit in the house of commons when i submit write parliamentary question to the attorney general they be answer by the solicitor general but the solicitor general refuse to provide answer for the attorney general only answer for herself today understandably the attorney general could not come to the house because he be not a member of the house but the solicitor general repeatedly refuse to give answer on behalf of the attorney general she refer to the attorney general ’s write answer and to a select committee hearing which be ordinarily hold in private how do the house of commons hold the attorney general to account 
 there be a collective responsibility for the government to answer within this house the right hon member be absolutely right to ask the question but i be not responsible for the answer that the solicitor general provide this go back to the frustration under the previous administration when the foreign secretary sit in the lords my view be that it be much hard but there be a collective responsibility that question will be answer in this house i be not go to keep the debate go now 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if she will make a statement on the fishing and coastal growth fund 
 we be work closely with our fishing and seafood sector to ensure that they be vibrant profitable and sustainable and that we have a healthy and productive marine environment that be why on   may the government announce the fishing and coastal growth fund a £ investment that will support the next generation of fisher and breathe new life into our coastal community through the fund we have recognise the vital contribution that fishing and coastal community make to our economy local community and national heritage 
 design the fund with stakeholder be paramount to its success and we want to work with industry and community to get their view on how to maximise value and target investment for maximum local impact that engagement be just begin we will consider investment in new tech and equipment to modernise the fleet in training and skill to back the next generation and in promote and support the seafood sector so that it can export across the world 
 since the fund be announce a wide range of stakeholder have call on the government to learn from previous fishery fund scheme and to devolve the funding instead of the funding be at uk level that be why on   october the government in a reaffirmation of our commitment to devolution confirm that the fishing and coastal growth fund would be devolve and that devolve government would have full discretion over how to allocate funding that approach enable each devolve government to design and deliver support in response to the specific need of their fishing and coastal community that will ensure that investment be target towards regional need and national view and that it well support coastal town and village it ensure that decision be take close to the community that the devolve government serve so the sector can thrive for generation to come 
 although the government respect the devolution settlement i would like to encourage collaboration across all government to maximise the fund ’s impact as each government will have their own insight into how the funding can be use and will learn lesson over the fund ’s lifetime 
 i thank the minister for her response i would be fail in my duty to my constituent and indeed to people across scotland if i do not reflect the anger dismay and sense of betrayal that have greet this set of fund allocation on   march ahead of the much vaunted eu reset deal with the uk the prime minister tell i the following from the dispatch box 
 i recognise the huge and historic importance of the fishing industry in his constituency and other and i be determined to make the sector more secure sustainable and economically successful ”—[official report   march vol c. 
 but we be once again use as a bargaining chip when eu access to scottish water be extend for another year way beyond what the eu negotiating team have hop for 
 boris johnson use those in the fishing industry as poster boy for his reckless brexit campaign and then betray they afterwards and now this government have do exactly the same by reserve more than £ for english coastal community over the next year while hand we pocket money despite scotland represent of our fishing capacity despite it land almost of these island catch and despite more than of all specie catch have be land by scottish vessel we have be offer a mere of the fund 
 my urgent question have be co sign by colleague from across the house who represent coastal community across scotland include those in orkney and shetland the outer hebrides and wales my welsh colleague be equally dismay at the crumb they have be offer i recognise that the minister and her team may need time to get to grip with their brief but her predecessor say he intend to engage fully with devolved government and the scottish government have be ignore again i urge the minister to look at this decision there be time before next march to take a fresh look at these allocation and to recognise the crucial role that the fishing industry play in our beautiful coastal community around our massive coastline and in our island community across scotland if the minister be in any doubt about the strength of anger on this matter and about why it be so crucial i repeat the offer i make to she yesterday to come to my constituency and see for herself 
 i have be look at the history of seafood support fund the last be a uk seafood fund which be reserve by the then government nationally to be use in a strategic way there be many vocal complaint that the fund should have be devolve we have now devolve a fund in the way in which fund be always devolve use the barnett formula which give a 20%-a head uplift to devolve government for all other spending 
 i also note that the devolution settlement in the comprehensive spending review give the scottish government another £ that they can choose to spend in any way it be always open to they to support the sector which be an important industrial sector for they with some of the money devolve to they in the csr devolution settlement 
 i thank the minister for come to the dispatch box and   the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan   for raise this important issue there be a question of fairness in the geographical distribution of the fund and the minister should consider that i hope the funding will be review in due course there be another aspect to fairness too there should be fairness across the sector i want the funding to be aim at new entrant to fishing community that face big challenge to do with depopulation crew and keep themselves go for example the funding can be use to allocate and buy quota so that local authority can distribute it to new entrant as happen to a limited degree in orkney and in the western isles i also want the funding to be aim at new opportunity this   summer an lb tuna be land in my constituency from the north atlantic and it be to be sell at a famous market in tokyo 
 those be the kind of scheme place and fishing and coastal community that the fund should be aim at we should not just funnel the money to the already wealthy quota baron who dominate the industry and the airwave 
 my hon friend have make some interesting observation about creativity which may well be apply to the fund we be try to co design the way the fund will work it be there for the next year so that we can be creative and think about how we support the young generation of people who wish to go into the industry some of the suggestion that he have make be intriguing and i will certainly follow they up with he and other 
 i call the shadow minister 
 this fund be a weak apology from a labour government who this year have sell out the uk fishing industry it be a mere stick plaster a rushed at good that ignore the proportion of fish catch in different part of these isle involve the devolved administrations poorly and ignore evidence base delivery and logic this fund be labour try to buy off the uk fishing fleet due to its disastrous year deal with the eu the deal be time long than the deal labour seek it prevent britain from set annual fishing quota as other independent coastal state do fishing organisation have call the deal a horror show for fisherman will the money be front load and spend where it will have the great benefit for industry and coastal community what input will fishing organisation and representative have in ensure that the fund be spend in the right place 
 fishing be not just about the fish catch it be also about the people and marine wildlife involve can the government explain how the fund will support fisher mental health and effort to protect marine wildlife such as by end bycatch there be not enough detail for the industry to plan how will the fund be deliver how be it be target to support the fishing industry and how be the labour government support the next generation of fisherman and woman with the fund 
 this fund be an example of the labour government try to buy off the industry with a stick plaster rather than ensure that the good deal for the british fishing industry be the that they negotiate with the eu 
 the fund be about long term transformation and partnership we want to modernise the fishing sector support coastal regeneration and build resilience in the industry across the uk for that reason we will co design the fund with local community and the industry i be not able to answer the hon gentleman ’s question in detail at this precise moment because we seek to co operate with those who will be beneficiary when i be in a position to make further announcement i certainly will 
 as a coastal mp i be delighted that my constituency be select for £ of pride in place funding how will those fund benefit coastal community around the country 
 pride in place funding be a new initiative from the ministry of housing communities and local government colleague will know that it be base very much on a bottom up approach to improve place my understanding be that allocation will be give and direct by local board with community membership that be an important way of do regeneration it be not do thing to people from on high it mean try to involve and listen to those who live in those place who know what be good i hope that we will be able to apply that principle to the use of these fund over time 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal democrats of course welcome any further investment in our fishing community but coastal town must have a proper say in how the money will be spend the allocation of the funding must reflect the significance of the fishing industry across our isle the proud fisherman in my north cornwall constituency have be wrap up in so much red tape and face extra cost because of the tories botch brexit deal they now want proper management of fish stock and a new byelaw to limit large vessel inside the mile line what step be the government take to reverse that damage and provide our fisherman with great access to their large and close market how will the government use this fund to give great power and resource to coastal community to allow they to invest properly in their local area finally can the minister assure we that the fund will improve water quality to protect our fishing industry in the future 
 on the hon gentleman ’s last point clearly improve water quality be another policy area the coastal growth fund be not about improve water quality it be about build resilience help to modernise the fishing industry through high tech access to training and entry to the industry we must not mix up government support for different issue and try to shove everything into policy 
 the hon gentleman also ask about the reset for export purpose if we can do it properly the reset with the eu will enable the export of fish and catch with much less red tape than we have end up with post brexit there be big gain to be make from that likewise if we can get the free trade agreement to work properly it will increase the prospect of fishing industry export to other part of the world 
 scottish salmon be renowne around the world for its quality and taste how be the government support the promotion of the scottish salmon industry around the world 
 my hon friend be correct i believe that the free trade deal with india take away all tariff on scottish salmon so hopefully there will be a lot more of it head that way soon 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 i welcome the minister to her new position i have to say though if ever there be an illustration of the   scale of the challenge face ministers in turn around the department this be it let we not forget that this fund be create because the prime minister roll over for a further year the catastrophically bad deal that boris johnson give we for year if the minister be sincere when she say that the aim of the government be to maximise local investment then use the barnett formula to distribute the funding be ocean go madness by volume and value shetland alone account for of the fish land in this country but scotland as a whole will get only of the funding when will the funding formula be review and when will we hear exactly where the money will be spend and what it will be available for 
 the right hon gentleman will have to ask the scottish government about what they be go to do with their devolved part of the fund he might also wish to ask they whether there be any extra money available from the devolve comprehensive spending review process because they get an extra £ to spend this year 
 i warmly welcome the government ’s investment in a sustainable fishing and shellfish industry which will create job and drive growth in coastal community such as mine will the minister provide a timeline for when stakeholder such as the whitby district fishing industry training school and the whitby lobster hatchery will be formally engage in the process of develop and deliver this important fund 
 as i have say we be at an early stage in the process of see how we can do this we be committed to try to co design the fund so i be happy to talk to my hon friend about how she wish that co operation to be take forward in the fantastic area of scarborough it be near bridlington where i be bear which also have a little to do with crab 
 i call the father of the house 
 in lincolnshire we know all about fishing because grimsby use to be the world ’s great fishing port it beggar belief that we a coastal nation import twice as much fish as we export fisherman feel completely betray after year of vassalage to the european union and this late deal we be where we be we have this fund now so i want to end on a positive note by ask my favourite minister will she ensure that she use the fund to recreate fishing in area such as grimsby which now have a miniscule amount of fishing to help they to modernise get more staff and rebuild our industry 
 the father of the house know that flattery will get he everywhere obviously i hold he in equally high esteem along with my hon friend   the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn i be more than happy to work out how we can use this fund to do precisely as he suggest
