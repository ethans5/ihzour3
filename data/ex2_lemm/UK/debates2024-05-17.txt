the deputy chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no 
 the house divide ayes noes 
 question accordingly negative 
 bill not amend in the public bill committee consider 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 this be the time but i sincerely hope not the last time that i have propose legislation in this house that have not only enjoy strong cross party support throughout all stage of its passage but strong support outside this place there have not be a single objection to the bill from the police local authority the public or which be to be expect the hospitality industry in fact the industry have be ask for this small legislative change for some time now and it have ask for it because it make sense 
 i want to apologise in advance that this speech be a little dull and technical but it be important that the detail of what i be propose be make clear to the house a point i discuss at length with   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope who i be sorry be not with we in his usual friday slot today 
 love for our pub be strong across all our constituency if there be thing guarantee to unite we it be sport and royal event we tend to gather for these event in our local pub because they be the beat heart of our community as hon member will know such event do not always take place when our pub and hospitality venue be open which be why the licensing act make provision for licence extension individual license premise can apply to their local authority for a temporary event notice each application cost £ and take a minimum of work day to be approve although it often take long the provision be not design for scenario in which many venue across the country wish to extend their licensing hour at short notice and at the same time so a provision under section of the act enable license extension for 
 an occasion of exceptional international national or local significance 
 that allow the government to make a relaxation order applicable to all premise in england and wales specify the date and time of the relaxation which can not exceed day 
 such order which be make under section of the act be subject to the affirmative procedure and need approval from both houses of parliament good practice be for the home secretary to complete a public consultation and then for both houses to debate the order which can take up to month to implement as mention on reading the process have be use for the coronation of his majesty the king the birthday and platinum jubilee of her late majesty the and royal wedding the fifa world cup and the euro final in 
 last summer our whole country be immensely proud of our lioness reach the woman ’s world cup final as hon member will recall we find out only day before the match that our lionesses have make the final it be take place on a sunday in sydney and there be an hour time difference the match kick off at am with many venue unable to serve alcohol   until am or noon there be no time leave for they to apply to their local authority for a temporary event notice and because parliament be in recess there be no mechanism for the government to issue an extension our community miss out on all the pre match excitement and much need extra revenue 
 clause will allow the home secretary or ministers to make an extension order in similar situation without go through the costly overly bureaucratic time consume and restrictive process that exist now clause simply state that the bill will come into force on the day it gain royal assent and will extend to england and wales only the bill do not propose a change to the circumstance with which discretion may be exercise by the home secretary the provision in section of the licensing act which relate to the length purpose and consultation requirement of any relaxation order will remain intact 
 this be a bill to simplify the parliamentary process not to change the substance of the licensing act ’s provision use the negative procedure instead of the affirmative procedure do not remove parliamentarian voice on application as member will know the majority of statutory instrument be lay before parliament under the negative procedure and there be a process for object to they or have they annul both in this place and in the other place 
 next week the licensing act uefa european championship licensing hours order be due for debate like all previous extension order of this kind it be very likely that it will pass through both houses unoppose consider the many problem that our constituent and the country be face right now it be a waste of precious parliamentary time to debate an uncontentious order that have such cross party and public support 
 i recall spend many hour as a home office minister take through statutory instrument for exactly this kind of occasion even though nobody oppose they and everybody could see that they be very good particularly for the hospitality industry i declare an interest my brother be a pub landlord and my father be before he so i know how much such order matter i fully support the hon lady ’s bill do she agree that these event be exactly the kind of time when we need to get together in the great british pub 
 i thank the right hon member for that intervention and i hope that her family welcome the bill as well like much of our hospitality industry through covid pub be absolutely battered while this bill be small and will not apply all the time when it do apply the revenue that our local hospitality venue and pub will gain from it will make a huge difference to they 
 even with my bill the government fully intend to continue to plan ahead so that wherever possible license hour extension order can be bring forward with sufficient time for public consultation and notice as they have be for the upcoming euros licensing order next week this bill have receive such support because it be straightforward and sensible i be sure that we all   look forward to join our constituent down of our brilliant local in celebrate the next national sporting or royal event i commend the bill to the house 
 i congratulate   the hon member for south shields mrs lewell buck   on the success of her private member ’s bill and i be delighted to join colleague from across the house in speak in favour of its provision the united kingdom be a nation that like to support our national team and our choose football team for any sporting or ceremonial event whether the olympics the paralympics the football world cup the euros the ashes coronation or royal wedding i could go on when our team our sportspeople and our royalty be do well we want to support they and where well to support they and celebrate than in our local pub or sport or social club these be venue where we want to share our joy and woe often with like minded people that be why this bill to provide a blanket extension of licensing hour make sense to allow people to gather to mark an occasion of exceptional international national or local significance 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about moment of celebration in pub she represent the cities of london and westminster and i expect that she have the most pub in any single constituency while it may be unfair for she to single out just i wonder whether there be a particular sporting occasion or other occasion of joy where she have certainly enjoy that in a pub locally 
 there have actually be far too many to be able to name they as my right hon friend say there be so many amazing venue in my constituency i think that at my last count we have license premise in westminster alone and as a former licensing chair of westminster council the large licensing authority in the country i can say with some authority that we have amazing license premise here 
 as the hon member for south shields say the alternative to this bill be to go with temporary event notice which be use for individual business look to extend their hour i know from my experience as a licensing chair that those be a bureaucratic nightmare for licensing authority especially for a city centre such as westminster central manchester birmingham or wherever and the £ charge never match the cost of the administration of those temporary event notice this bill will do away with that time consume bureaucracy 
 in practice the blanket extension order go unopposed and the public be often in favour of propose licensing hour extension some of respondent to the consultation be in favour of an extension for this year ’s euros and be in favour of during the king ’s coronation 
 another important point to make be that there be a massive vital economic benefit from this bill pub and late night venue in my constituency employ more than people and turn over £ each year it be the no constituency for turnover and economic value from the hospitality industry in the uk that be   just in central london but pub and other venue play a vital role in the local economy of every part of the united kingdom the bill will support they we know the hospitality industry have have a tough time over the past year 
 while i welcome make the process to extend opening hour easier it be important to remember that such extension will see an increase in the consumption of alcohol sadly often that will result in an increase in antisocial behaviour and disturbance for resident the extension order for the euros final allow for an extra minute of serve time however for the euros the government consultation propose extend licensing hour by hour mean many pub will close at am 
 i be sure everyone in the house agree that we do not want to see a repeat of what happen during the euros when trafalgar square in my constituency be the scene of some very unruly behaviour include excess drinking and reveller climb on building and bus it be an absolute nightmare i be aware of resident concern about the current licensing application for the fanzone for this year ’s champions league final which will allow up to people to gather in trafalgar square and a further in victoria embankment gardens 
 i thank the hon member for her fulsome support for my bill i stress to she and to the house that there will be continue consultation with the police and local authority even when the regulation in the bill be in play we be simply change the parliamentary process not the process that happen outside this place i want to give she that assurance 
 i absolutely accept that point i just want to take the opportunity to ensure we do not forget that in my constituency in central london we have a massive and vital hospitality industry which employ ten of thousand of people but we also have resident live cheek by jowl with those premise many of they in social housing i visit a social housing block in mayfair last week people do not expect to see social housing in place like that but we have social housing in mayfair belgravia soho and marylebone and it be important we do not forget that 
 the uk should take pride in host internationally renowne competition such as the euros and the champions league final and make provision for those seek to celebrate they i understand why the government and the greater london authority want to have fanzone but i be also aware that local councillor business and resident in the st james ’s ward object to the licensing application for the fanzone on the basis that the venue and location be wholly unsuitable local resident be particularly sad because they feel that there have be a lack of consultation in the process 
 i note what the hon member for south shields say about the bill be about the parliamentary process which be why i support it in this day and age it be ridiculous that we have have to have the house of commons and the other place agree to extend licensing hour for an hour or whatever just for day so i appreciate and support the change in the bill however we have to remember the knock on effect of extended licensing on the police and local council 
 when the licensing hour be extend for the euros we see huge amount of waste and litter across the west end westminster city council collect tonne of waste over hour during and after the historic england versus italy final with the use of vehicle as ever i take my hat off to the cleansing service of westminster city council they deliver every time we have a major celebration or protest they clean up and people would never think anything have happen however such event put a strain on local authority spending particularly in westminster where we be not provide with extra government funding to undertake the cleansing after those special event again i know that the metropolitan police spend a lot of time and resource put in extra police officer to police these event 
 i note what the hon member for south shields say it be crucial that police and local authority be provide with the guidance and support they need during national celebration and moment of national significance when license hour be extend for my long term goal we need to make sure that resident live close to hospitality venue and those within licensed hour be consider in any extension i absolutely accept that the consultation system be not change under the bill which i welcome 
 i welcome the bill which i see as a move to simplify the process of extend licensing hour within the parliamentary process when need i look forward to see the bill complete its journey through this and the other place 
 it be a pleasure to stand in support of the bill on reading i commend and congratulate   the hon member for south shields mrs lewell buck who have navigate this important bill which though small will have a significant impact on the wellness and joy of people throughout england and wales she come into the house in a by election in and have always make a positive impact she have of course be diligent in her constituency work but i hope she will be toast in every pub the next time a licence be use in the way introduce by this change in law 
 the licensing act be important legislation the reason for that as my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken   set out be that while we want hospitality to thrive in many way for people live very near a pub or other venue those venue can have a big impact on their life that be why the process that be go through be important i do not know the rationale for decide more than year ago that it be important to make this particular legislation via the affirmative resolution procedure but it be sensible and pragmatic streamlining to switch to the negative resolution procedure 
 this simple legislative change will not make bureaucracy a thing of the past it be important that the appropriate procedure go through however we often think about how parliament need to be in touch with the challenge that people have it may not be the great challenge in the world that a pub can not open long for a particular event but when we try to explain to people that the reason such a change can not be make be that parliament be not sit because it be have a summer break there   be an element of let ’s look at that again that be why the hon member for south shields be wise to pick up and work with the government on this modest change 
 on the negative resolution procedure more broadly within parliament and in particular the other house i would say there have be an anti negative resolution revolution in the passing of secondary legislation about of our regulation be make through the negative route there will be a variety of reason as to why it be unpopular for certain aspect partly because if people object to those statutory instrument although there be quite a systematic process it be not always easy to get a particular vote on it particularly in this house thing it have do be to clog up a lot of parliamentary activity with more and more time be spend on modest piece of legislation that really do not need further consideration apart from the wisdom of discussion or debate that could be have outside of what be quite a formal parliamentary process that be why i think this matter 
 i appreciate that my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster might not want to single pub out in her constituency for what it be worth i live in her constituency when i be carry out my parliamentary duty and i go to the white swan on vauxhall bridge road to watch sport i think it be really good it have a fantastic tiktok account do not worry i be not expect a free guinness i would not abuse my position in that way i have hop to be have moment of joy this sunday with liverpool win the premier league sadly that be not go to be the case and i expect we will end up but i be go to a liverpool fan pub in london in the afternoon with some friend it be that sense of community and of come together that really matter 
 covid have have so many impact on our country not just the huge amount of investment that be put in which we be now pay for across the uk but what it do to community and the anxious generation we now have of people who interact solely on something like this phone i be use it to look at the legislation today for i what be critical be not just drown our sorrow by go to a pub but that sense of occasion i remember the joy of some of the sporting event i have be lucky enough to go to in person that sort of joy can be replicate and it need not necessarily be in a pub it can be in a community hall or at other sort of temporary event however it be vital not only for economic reason but for genuine societal reason that we make it as straightforward as possible for parliament to allow these thing to happen while we still have a moderate amount of regulation in recognise what licensing condition may apply and what concern local resident or business may have i come back to my original point this simple change mean that it do not matter whether parliament be sit be the key element of this legislation 
 i be go to be shameless and name a few more pub in my constituency i forget to do so in discuss previous bit of legislation i even serve on the hon member for south shields bill committee and do not do it i can not name they all but i have be to every single pub in my constituency that be the reason i win the beer parliamentarian of the year award over a   decade ago and still have the mug to prove it though i can assure you mr deputy speaker there be no beer in the chamber today but who know we might crack on over in the strangers bar if it be open later to toast the hon lady ’s success in get the bill through this house 
 we undoubtedly have a lot of event in europe come up but it be important to recognise our international community here in this country and people ’s desire not only to watch sport here of course but to watch sporting event with their home team in different part of the world i have well not get into too much trouble by name load of pub but 
 my right hon friend be make a very excellent speech she ask i for my favourite watering hole in my constituency i think it be only fair surely that she name pub that she go to 
 of course there be the felixstowe conservative club which be very good in that regard but i must admit that when i go to watch sport i have be to the douglas bader in martlesham heath and i love go to the anchor in woodbridge my home be in a village call westleton where i use to go to the white horse inn a lot there be just so many not all of they show football and i must do well in ensure that i get down to many more pub in felixstowe where that do seem to happen 
 however i will continue to champion and go around pub and i now have a great excuse with the hon member for south shields bill to explain why parliament be go to make life for our hospitality sector a lot easy we have a great brewery and pub chain call adnams in southwold in my constituency adnam still own a lot of pub some manage some tenant and i hope it will take full advantage of this great opportunity so without further ado i be really pleased to be here on a friday to support this legislation i be sure the lords will toast it as well and i look forward to share a glass or in the strangers bar later today 
 i be afraid the strangers bar be closed i be sorry to bring such bad news but i think the house of lords bar may be open you never know i be a former president of the all party parliamentary group on beer so i do not think we could have a more appropriate chair for this particular debate 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for south shields mrs lewell buck   for introduce this important bill and for all her commendable work on it so far i be sure that pub up and down the country will be grateful for her work on the bill if it pass 
 i also pay tribute to all member who have contribute today and at other stage particularly   the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey as well as   the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken whose constituency have some of the good pub in london of which she should be proud anyone here on a friday should take a stroll through the city of london because it be beautiful and there be some incredible gem in its tiny street tourist often just wander around look for something and they will most likely come across those wonderful pub 
 i absolutely recognise the issue that the hon member for cities of london and westminster highlight about the potential impact on resident of the measure in inner london borough as she say pub be often close to residential area however as she will know have spend time on license committee local authority and police spend a lot of time on ensure that licence come with condition in order to prevent such issue 
 i will acknowledge some of the wonderful pub in my enfield north constituency but before i do let i say that it have be a pleasure to see the bill pass through this house with cross party support as we have hear the bill amend section of the licensing act grant our hospitality sector more freedom to extend licensing hour with short notice and give the government of the day the ability to respond to the need of the industry that would allow our community to celebrate event of national significance in hospitality venue for long provide a welcome boost to business and fan 
 as we have hear when our lionesses progress in australia and new zealand to reach england ’s world cup final since there be a miss opportunity at home where progress stall pub bar and restaurant could open from am on the day of the final but could not serve customer until licensing hour be not extend despite request because parliament be in recess so it be too late business miss the opportunity to serve customer early and supporter be deny the chance to get behind their team with england and scotland set for the european championship another busy summer of sport will provide a welcome boost to our hospitality sector which have suffer so much over the past few year 
 if football be to come home again this summer we must ensure that our hospitality sector be ready to embrace it i know that the bill will not solve all the problem face the industry but it will provide the sector with the welcome boost that it be ask for from speak to those at the many pub in my enfield north constituency include the plough the wonder and the cricketer where i go every sunday with my child i know that they support the proposal in the bill 
 let we be clear our hospitality sector bring a huge boost to the uk economy in alone it generate £ in tax receipt and £ worth of business investment clearly what benefit our pub benefit local community but the impact go much far a staggering of tourist want to visit a pub when visit the uk they be a vital part of our community high street and household i know that many member present today will share that view yet we be currently deny pub bar and restaurant the full opportunity to benefit it be clearly an opportunity so for the reason set out today the bill should progress 
 the negative resolution procedure would allow an order to be debate if successfully request by any parliamentarian and the option of consultation would be retain mean that concern will be consider so relative safeguard be in place it be common sense that the bill should proceed and i be delighted to support it and my colleague my hon friend the member for south shields today 
 i start by congratulate   the hon member for south shields mrs lewell buck   on bring forward this private member ’s bill and for the charm and expertise with which she have pilot it through the house this be probably the short bill i have ever be involve with as a minister i think the long be the police crime sentencing and courts act which run to about clause and several page this bill be a model of pith and conciseness if only every bill be as simple 
 i congratulate the hon lady on marshal both side of the house behind her bill and i thank the member who have speak today i thank the shadow minister   the hon member for enfield north feryal clark for her support my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken   for talk about the pub in her constituency here in the heart of london and for bring to bear her expertise as a former chair of licensing at westminster city council and of course my right hon friend the incomparable member for suffolk coastal dr coffey who bring to bear her very extensive experience in this area that she have diligently amass over many year across the length and breadth of the kingdom there be few colleague with great or deep expertise than my right hon friend when it come to visit pub which i intend as a profound compliment 
 as we have hear this bill amend section of the licensing act which already make provision for the secretary of state to make order relax licensing hour in england and wales on occasion of exceptional international national or even local significance 
 under that definition international national and local significance tomorrow be the play off final at wembley between oxford united and bolton wanderers would that qualify under the change in the bill and since the play off be tomorrow can the minister make sure that all part of the bill have complete their passage by that time 
 my hon friend will have notice that the and final clause of the bill state that the act will come into force on the day on which it be pass but of course it have to complete its passage through the other place so unfortunately i do not think that play off final will benefit from these provision whether a play off final between such auspicious team as bolton wanderers and oxford united would qualify as an event under this bill would be for the home secretary of the day to determine in all seriousness although the parliamentary mechanism be be change from the affirmative resolution procedure to the negative resolution procedure the underlying criterion be not change i do not think we would want to usher in a wholesale change of license hour through this mechanism the threshold be quite high and it be use fairly rarely so i would like to temper expectation we do not expect the provision to be use indiscriminately although that in no way detract from the importance of the game take place at wembley obviously i wish both team the good of luck 
 these order will benefit business as we have hear allow they to stay open for long when important event be take place as my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster say it be much easy to use blanket licensing extension than to require pub to go through the onerous expensive and tedious process of apply for a temporary event notice from their local authority this approach be much well 
 to give a flavour of the kind of event that might qualify for these provision they might include thing such as his majesty the king ’s coronation last year her late majesty the queen ’s birthday and her platinum jubilee the royal wedding in and and the euros final in if anyone be wonder whether the bill will apply to future england appearance in final let i say that while that might be more in hope than expectation we should none the less legislate in hope 
 we have already hear member set out the reason why we should make this change which have command widespread support we have hear that such game can often arise at relatively short notice for example england reach the final which have be refer to when parliament be not sit it be obviously not possible to use the affirmative resolution procedure although let i be clear even with the negative resolution procedure scrutiny be possible where necessary it be possible to pray against resolution make under the negative procedure so if a member feel strongly they can obviously pray against the instrument in the normal way 
 as minister for crime and policing i be obviously aware of how important it be to consult the police regularly and make sure that they be happy that where we extend licensing hour that will not cause any undue problem with public order it be important that the home secretary of the day consult the police appropriately to make sure that risk be consider but i be sure that will not stop the power be use when appropriate as i have say the power in section of the licensing act have be use relatively sparingly and that approach be not go to change the test be an event of exceptional significance which impose quite a high bar 
 to make just final point for the avoidance of doubt this instrument apply only in england and wales because it amend the licensing act which apply only to england and wales licensing be devolve in scotland and northern ireland which i assume explain why there be no member from either scotland or northern ireland join we this morning to hear about all the pub in the constituency of the various member who have speak in which context i should commend the pub in croydon south such as the fox in coulsdon and the wattenden arm up by kenley airfield interruption of course there be a member from scotland sit right behind i who i do not notice 
 the minister be make an excellent speech i too give my wholehearte support to the bill on behalf of pub across scotland and in my constituency   it might not have a direct impact there but we recognise its importance right across the united kingdom and the important message it send so i thank the minister and remind he that i be still from scotland 
 i offer my abject and heartfelt apology for overlook my hon friend who be sit right behind i she be scotland ’s only voice in parliament today and scotland be all the well off for her presence here particularly on this side of the house where she belong and where she be very welcome and hold in high regard and great affection 
 there be many bills to get through today and i do not wish to test the patience of the house or colleague by speak for too long i fear that the most popular word in any speech i give be the word and finally so and finally i thank once again the hon member for south shields who have pilot the bill through commons and those who have speak in support of it and serve on the bill committee this straightforward and simple measure will free up valuable parliamentary time as we hear early and allow the government to respond in an agile way in what i hope be the likely event that team from the home nation make progress in various international sporting event merit an extension to the licensing hour of this nation ’s fine pub i commend the bill to the house 
 as i say on reading i get my love of the pub from my dad who know a good pint when he see and from my mam whose footstep i follow in as an excellent barmaid people who work in this industry deserve our support and our community deserve every opportunity they can get to come together for important event i give special thank to   the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken who have long champion our capital ’s pub and nightlife and to   the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey who serve on the bill committee i also wish that my local would all toast i but as she be here on reading when i list all the crack local pub in south shields she will know that that would result in a very sore head the next day 
 i have many more people to thank the minister   the hon member for castle point rebecca harris home office official the public bill office in particular anne marie griffiths and my invaluable senior researcher rebecca natton i also thank the british beer and pub association the night time industries association along with its chair and hospitality champion sacha lord and on the front bench my hon friend   the member for enfield north feryal clark finally i wish to say a big cheer to the government for support my bill and in commend it to the house i say to the minister as i say to his colleague the under secretary of state for the home department laura farris that i definitely owe he and a lot more people a drink 
 question put and agree to 
 bill accordingly read the time and pass

 i be grateful to my hon friend   the member for tewkesbury mr robertson   and to the government and the department for work and pensions i have table these amendment because as have be see with other bills to which we have give reading they concern the timing of when an act come into effect i be conscious that there be a number of situation where more work need to be do to get some of the detail and guidance and other element like that regrettably for a variety of piece of legislation wait for the secretary of state to create regulation have somewhat delay the introduction after royal assent of the effect of the act that so many people have work hard to achieve 
 i be not in any way try to detract from the regulator or from the department for work and pensions of which i be proud to be the secretary of state but i be particularly conscious about the uncertainty of the timing of a general election of course there be still procedure that can be do to some extent but those who have hold ministerial office will know some of the challenge that take place in term of process procedure and different cabinet committee put simply this be why i be grateful to my hon friend and to the government for listen to my concern the amendment would remove extra step of process that matter because i be keen to see the bill enact i be not seek in   any way to hold it up i want certainty about make it happen and i be concern about the uncertainty of timing i be careful to check that the amendment would not affect the legislative consent motion that have already pass the northern ireland assembly if there be any way that they do i have not be make aware of that i have be give the opposite assurance 
 i be keen to ensure that the united kingdom move together we have formally separate system these be transfer power they have always be power for the northern ireland executive and assembly to deal with but i know that the executive and the assembly have be keen particularly in social security matter for the united kingdom to proceed in step so that we do not give different treatment to the same thing especially when we all pay the same tax and we all tend to have the same service provider 
 after careful consideration i want to ensure that the bill become law in a timely fashion without the need for further process and that be why i will be press my amendment 
 i thank my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   for table her amendment and for discuss they with i over the last few day we have work to try to ensure that the good outcome be find she make the point that when there be a general election come albeit that that be an unusual circumstance hop that it will arise only every year it throw thing into doubt the last thing we would want be for the bill to get royal assent and then for some reason probably the election not come into force i understand where she be come from on that 
 i also thank the minister and the government for discuss these issue and come to an agreement to accept the amendment i be certainly very happy to accept they there be no need for i to drag proceeding out any far at this point i thank all concerned for their work 
 i rise just to seek some reassurance on the amendment i be not at all against they in principle when i read they on the amendment paper i could understand what   the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   be attempt to do and exactly why but it strike i that they rather run roughshod over establish procedure particularly with respect to the devolved administration by give quite a strict timetable i wonder whether the minister could reassure the house although it be not the case here the change make by bills can often be quite complex and have to be make appropriately and put a very hard stop in a bill regardless of context set rather a difficult precedent 
 although i do not object to what the right hon member for suffolk coastal be try to do i be slightly surprise by the bulldozer approach that the amendment create in this circumstance it be manageable but it might not be quite so manageable in other more complex circumstance i suppose i seek some reassurance from the minister about the precedent that the amendment will set how wide will it go be we go to start include in bills a precise timetable for when they will be put into effect with a hard stop regardless of their complexity 
 i understand that   the hon member for tewkesbury mr robertson   want his bill we all want this to be do quickly but there be some precedent be create here that would be slightly worrying if they be to extend more widely i wonder whether the minister might give we some thought and insight in that respect i want to make it clear that the opposition do not object to the bill at all but i be quite surprised by the innovative way in which the right hon member for suffolk coastal have seek to pursue her desire to get this thing do quickly 
 i thank my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   for her consider amendment and for the reason argument behind they i know that she have be engage extensively with our excellent official at the dwp whom she know extremely well 
 the hon member for wallasey dame angela eagle   ask about innovation my right hon friend be incredibly innovative and i be not surprised that that be attract attention let i also thank my hon friend   the member for tewkesbury mr robertson   for the attentive way in which he have listen to all this as for the question of precedent it be not unusual for bills to have set commencement date when we be sure that they can be commence on the date in question i hope that that reassure the hon lady 
 i think we can all agree that we want the provision in the bill to be commence with minimal delay they be important and will provide much need financial support up to month early than be currently the case for those who have receive the devastating news that they have a terminal illness my right hon friend be clearly mindful of that follow her own experience in the dwp and it be what be drive these change they build on the work that the department begin in under her formidable and inspiring leadership she will be only too well aware of the importance that the department have place on do all that it can to help people at these difficult time 
 the amendment be intend to ensure that the bill specify the point at which the provision will come into force they provide for this to be a period of month after the bill have receive royal assent put the commencement date on the face of the bill would mean that the secretary of state ’s power to make regulation commence the provision or transitional or save provision would no long be necessary and amendment and seek to remove all those provision similar amendment be make to the provision cover northern ireland and at this point it may be prudent to remind the house that the northern ireland assembly have already provide a legislative consent order for the bill as draft i hope that that reassure my right hon friend 
 when the bill be draft towards the end of last year it be unclear to the department how quickly the pension protection fund would be able to implement the change the decision to commence they via a commencement order give the department the flexibility to ensure that the fund be in a position to implement the new condition at commencement and that the correspond change to the financial assistance   scheme regulations could be make at the same time in committee the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend   the member for blackpool north and cleveleys paul maynard be very clear about commencement say 
 i can confirm today that the intention be for that to happen as soon as practicable after royal assent i see no reason for delay or obfuscation official report pensions special rules for end of life public bill committee   april c. 
 hopefully we be all agree and can all be assure that we have absolutely no intention of create any unnecessary delay in enact these vital measure which will make a massive difference to people at the most difficult time in their life and indeed to their family bring real comfort 
 at the end of committee stage on   april official from the department seek further clarification from the pension protection fund on how quickly it could implement the change its response be very positive and i want to put on record our appreciation for the work it have be undertake it have confirm that its internal team have be work towards have everything ready by the beginning of july the early date on which the bill could potentially have receive royal assent i therefore confirm to my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal that dwp official have be in touch with their counterpart in the department for communities in northern ireland who have helpfully confirm that they do not envisage any problem with commence the relevant northern ireland provision in a timely manner to retain parity across the united kingdom 
 notwithstanding the point make by the hon member for wallasey and with that in mind i see no reason why the department can not meet the new requirement that the amendment will impose and i have recommend that the government do not oppose they i thank my right hon friend for raise her concern and bring they to the house in the manner and the style that she do 
 amendment agree to

 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 i be pleased that the bill ’s passage through the house have be relatively smooth so i thank the government and indeed the opposition for their support although the bill ’s scope be narrow it will provide   financial assurance to those who have receive the devastating diagnosis of a terminal illness and who have also see the sponsor of their pension scheme become insolvent the bill will do that by amend the definition of the word terminally ill 
 when someone receive the awful news that they may have only month to live it be only right that financial problem should be the least of their worry the loss of their rightful pension payment should not mean that they must live out their remain time constrain by their financial circumstance the bill aim to address that problem directly 
 for wide context the bill focus on the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme the pension protection fund establish by the pensions act pay compensation to individual when the sponsor of their define benefit scheme usually their employer become insolvent and lack the necessary asset to pay those pension to the level that the pension protection fund ordinarily would that be for case when such insolvency take place on or after   april the financial assistance scheme apply to individual whose pension scheme be unable to meet their pension liability in full when those scheme start to wind up between   january   and   april the bill concern the compensation payment make to people diagnose with a terminal illness from those scheme 
 the pension protection fund provide a off lump sum payment to those who receive such a diagnosis while the financial assistance scheme will begin to make payment to someone at any age the issue that the bill seek to address be the definition of a terminal illness 
 the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme both use the same legal definition of terminal illness which that be that 
 a person be terminally ill at any time if at that time the person suffer from a progressive disease and the person ’s death in consequence of that disease can reasonably be expect within month 
 the same definition be use by the department for work and pensions for the purpose of calculate benefit but that be reform in the social security special rules for end of life act where the month period include in the definition of terminally ill be extend to month the change in definition for these pension scheme seem only logical that would keep the definition consistent with make social security payment 
 it be difficult to say how many people will benefit from the bill and in reality we do not really want people to benefit as that would mean that the sponsor of their pension fund have become insolvent which we do not want to see however where that be the case this legislation will benefit terminally ill people 
 the bill ’s scope be technically limit to the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme but i hope it will encourage any workplace pension that do not have provision for terminal illness where the member have a life expectancy of month or less to consider put such a scheme into place depend on the scheme ’s rule many private pension scheme can already make what be call serious ill health payment under tax law if the member have up to year to live the change will be well worth make 
 the heartbreaking job of give a terminal illness diagnosis fall to health professional modern medicine surgery palliative care and the general care provide by our incredible nhs staff make that judgment even more difficult it be therefore right to extend the definition of terminally ill from the narrow band of month to the more accommodating threshold of month that be fair not only to the ill person but to those who have to make the difficult judgment especially when those health professional know that a person ’s pension payment may rest on that 
 as we just hear the bill extend throughout the united kingdom and come into force in england scotland and wales month after royal assent and likewise in the case of northern ireland i commend it to the house 
 it be a pleasure to support my hon friend in this important change i commend he on the detail in his speech which he also display in the bill committee on which i be happy to serve the bill recognise that regulation have move on back in the government with the support of parliament make change to social security benefit to align ourselves with what be happen in the nhs plenty of people who get a terminal illness could find that their lifetime may be long than or month the bill consider particularly where people be diagnose later and to accelerate or extend potential benefit 
 the national health service consider people to be terminally ill when they estimate that they have around month leave to live that be never an easy message to give or for people to receive there seem to be very little medical accuracy in get the timeline right but that length of time have be well establish in the nhs that be why this be sensible legislation to align with how the nhs treat patient as oppose to the somewhat arbitrary month the reference to the ppf and the financial assistance scheme available will be welcome by people right across the country i be keen to see this legislation pass through the commons and the lords at great speed 
 i wish to begin also by thank   the hon member for tewkesbury mr robertson   for introduce this important bill it be a pleasure to speak on reading 
 pension offer individual peace of mind know that they have a dependable source of income after year of dedicated hard work as well as alleviate the stress of financial uncertainty in old age pension allow retiree to retain their standard of living during retirement i welcome the bill as it seek to provide the same opportunity for financial security for those with a terminal illness and thus offer a more dignified end of life experience in what i can only imagine be an unstable and devastating time for the individual and their family 
 the bill seek to extend the definition of terminal illness for the ppf and the fas to month rather than the current to allow those who be eligible to receive vital financial support i welcome the fact that the bill will bring the ppf and the fas in line with the nhs and department for work and pensions definition of terminal illness which be month indeed thank to the brilliant work of our nhs and the consistent   progress in medical science it be difficult to predict how long someone be likely to live in some case patient be able to outlive their initial prognosis that be why the bill be so important 
 it be also due to our nhs and medical advancement that more and more of we be reach pensionable age as we all know many developed nation be now face an age population as birth rate decline therefore the amount of british people access their pension at any time will steadily increase in fact pensioner represent of the population and of my constituency be and over the government have do so much to support pensioner we hear in the autumn statement that the government announce an increase in the state pension in line with the government ’s initiative the triple lock as a result the new state pension be now worth up to £ more a year and ensure that old people get the support they deserve 
 those near the end of their life deserve to have access to the same level of financial support it be thank to the compassionate government that people with terminal illness be able to get fast and easy access to certain benefit through the special benefit rule for end of life recent change mean that special rule now apply to people who have month or less to live rather than those who be eligible be able to claim universal credit employment and support allowance personal independence payment disability living allowance and attendance allowance the bill will simply align the ppf and the fas with those exist provision reflect the government ’s commitment thus far to aid those near the end of their life the government have also provide necessary cost of live support worth over £ the support include round of mean test cost of living payment disability cost of living payment and pensioner cost of living payment 
 we have all hear from our constituent the anxiety feel over the cost of living crisis with rise price that be cause by the pandemic and putin ’s weaponisation of energy due to his illegal invasion of ukraine imagine now how the situation would worsen for individual face a terminal illness the cost of heat their home travel to medical appointment and potential childcare cost as their life be turn upside down 
 marie curie the charity that do tremendous work in this area have publish an eye opening report die in poverty which reveal that on average a pensioner ’s energy bill double once they be diagnose with a terminal illness i find that incredible and very very worrying the report also highlight that people of working age who die be twice as likely to spend their final year of life in poverty compare with people of pensionable age that poignant reality demonstrate the crucial need for bills like this by enable individual in these unfortunate circumstance to access their pension early the bill address the crisis outline by charity such as marie curie and aim to restore dignity to those affect 
 i also pay tribute to amazing charity register in the cities of london and westminster that support those near the end of their life compassion in dying a national charity that provide advice and information to those at the end of life the sunseeker   london charitable trust which provide financial support to organisation dedicate to the care of terminally ill people and the bennett kleinwort charitable trust which provide care and treatment for terminally ill people the work of these charity play a crucial role in advance progress towards address the challenge face by terminally ill individual which be also the objective of the bill 
 once again i express my support for this bill i understand that the hope be that it will encourage pension provider that do not currently have provision for serious ill health payment for those with a life expectancy of month or less to consider put it in place although the bill may be narrow in scope i be confident that it be a necessity and will have a wide positive impact any of we can be diagnose with a terminal illness and it be important that there be provision in place to offer financial assistance i commend my hon friend the member for tewkesbury for bring forward this admirable bill 
 i too congratulate   the hon member for tewkesbury mr robertson   on bring this bill before the house on report and reading as we have hear the bill seek to ensure that there be financial support for terminally ill people who have see the sponsor of their pension scheme become insolvent thankfully it be a small number of people and we hope it do not get any big but that illustrate the narrowness of the bill it seek to expand eligibility for terminal illness payment from the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme from those with less than month to live to those with less than month to live bring the definition of terminally ill in line with that use for social security payment by the department for work and pensions which   the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   formerly lead 
 as the hon member for tewkesbury highlight the bill be narrow in scope and thankfully concern a fairly small number of people but its impact for that group will be significant because it will unlock access to a vital lifeline of support when they have receive a diagnosis for that reason labour support and welcome the bill receive a terminal diagnosis be devastating both for the individual themselves and for their family and loved one such a diagnosis bring with it a slew a challenge and difficult decision 
 as   the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken   mention the marie curie report on this issue make for very sobering reading it point out that in people of working age who be diagnose with a terminal illness spend the last year of their life in poverty and that in pensioner be below the poverty line at the end of their life there be different reason for all those thing but have to imagine the circumstance in which people find themselves to understand that this bill be a tiny step in the right direction for a group of people in a particular context by no mean will it solve a lot of issue relate to old age poverty and illness which the bill touch on 
 marie curie have also highlight that all too often terminal illness bring with it huge financial burden and extra cost of between £ and £ per year for a household this be the so call double burden   of income loss and the additional cost that a terminal diagnosis can often bring about it push family towards insecurity and fear about their income and force they to confront poverty at a time when they have to deal with other insecurity and fear add another layer of distress at the hard of time those with a terminal illness should not be force to spend the end of their life worried about make end meet and i be sure that all member would feel a lot happy if not so many of our pensioner find that that be what they face 
 by open up eligibility for support be it through a lump sum payment from the financial assistance scheme or payment through the pension protection fund in the narrow range of circumstance that the hon member for tewkesbury have rightly identify this bill will go some way to ease the financial burden on those who be lucky enough to have a define benefit pension entitlement but unlucky enough to have have their pension fund go bust and end up in the pension protection fund extra access to cash can allow those near the end of their life to focus on spend the time they have leave with those they love support with dignity and respect which be what i think everyone in this house want to see 
 labour welcome this change but i question why it have be leave to a private member ’s bill albeit we be very happy to support the glorious achievement of the hon member for tewkesbury in bring it forward we support the social security special rules for end of life act which amend the dwp ’s definition of terminal illness for the purpose of social security rule to less than month to live raise it from less than month it be right to make that change then but i wonder why more work be not do by the department under the right hon member for suffolk coastal to check the consistency of those rule when the act be put on to the statute book if that have be do we would have have more year of support for the terminally ill between and and many people would have be help 
 i wonder whether any other inconsistency be lurk in the dwp on the change from month to month and whether the minister might trawl through the many bit of legislation and many statutory instrument that deal with such thing to see whether any other inconsistency could be quickly put right will she commit from the dispatch box to ensure consistency across all the definition of terminal illness and because the move have be make to shift the definition from month to month undertake to make certain that there be no other inconsistency lurk so that we do not have to do this again with another private member ’s bill to make sure the definition finally land at month with no remain month definition cause inconsistency 
 every hour people die in poverty in the uk and in terminally ill people of working age spend the last year of their life in poverty the cost of living crisis have acutely affect those who be near the end of their life a terminally ill person ’s energy bill can rise by after their diagnosis with critical equipment often send bill soar for example the cost of energy to run an oxygen concentrator can be £ a month a dialysis machine can cost £ a month and a ventilator can cost £ a month very few people wish   to be in hospital when they have access to these service but all too often it appear that we be leave they with the cost of run these vital bit of machinery to keep they alive 
 it be an indictment of year of government failure and neglect of our public service that so many people be spend the end of their life in poverty struggle to make end meet and worry whether they can afford to run the equipment that be keep they alive the way our country treat those near the end of their life should be a mark of how civilised we be and i fear that we be not pass that test as well as we should 
 i finish by repeat my congratulation to the hon member for tewkesbury on his work on this bill we fully support its aim and we hope to see further work in this area 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend   the member for tewkesbury mr robertson   for bring this important legislation to the house and for the way he have successfully navigate it to this stage i thank he for his important speech and insight on why the bill matter match equally by those of my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken 
 i thank   the hon member for wallasey dame angela eagle   for her support for the bill she ask why these regulation be not include in the act unfortunately they be out of scope as that bill be alter entitlement condition for benefit i assure she my official have say no other area be in need of amend i see that get the thumb up from the opposition dispatch box on consistent definition the bill will build on previous legislation that change special rule for social security benefit this final change bring the payment make by the pension protection fund and financial assistance scheme into alignment with those change 
 i thank all member who have take part in the debate that have lead the bill to progress to this stage include the committee stage and for the cross party support it have rightly receive as have be outline the bill build on the change the government introduce to social security benefit that legislation be welcome by excellent key charity such as marie curie the motor neurone disease association and macmillan cancer support it change the special rule for a number of benefit ensure claim be rightly fast track those who be think to be in the final year of their life be able to receive vital financial support month early 
 this week be dementia action week bring the uk together to take action on dementia and promote an understanding of its impact the alzheimer ’s society and many group and charity do so much on this important issue i extend my thank to they from the dispatch box 
 by extend the definition of terminal illness from to month life expectancy for payment under both the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme the bill complete the journey the bill will mean that member be able to rightly claim compensation on the ground of terminal illness if a medical professional confirm that they have less than month to live rather than the current month 
 hon member have speak about the terrible time that people will be go through and the financial impact there be often more financial assistance than perhaps people know if they be not use to be part of the benefit arena i urge people to look at the benefit calculator at gov.uk and to work with citizens advice which run our help to claim service so that cost can be meet and understand at a difficult time 
 to assure the hon member for wallasey in my role as minister for disabled people health and work i meet with the minister for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for north swindon justin tomlinson this week to discuss cost and other matter concern the national disability strategy and the disability action plan as the hon lady say the issue be at the forefront of my mind and we be align on those concern 
 decision on terminal illness will be make by healthcare professional such as clinician and medical practitioner we thank they for that great work at such a difficult time as point out by my hon friend the member for tewkesbury as we hear during committee stage the definition will include advanced cancer dementia motor neurone disease and other neurological disease such as parkinson ’s disease 
 the change restore the original policy intent of alignment between the social security special rule and the pension protection fund and financial assistance scheme terminal illness rule just as importantly they bring both scheme in line with the tax definition of serious ill health which currently allow private pension scheme to make payment when the member have less than month to live i will briefly reiterate what i say in the early debate on the amendment and repeat what the minister for pensions say in committee it be never our intention to delay the commencement of these provision there be no practical reason for we to do so however as discuss today put a commencement date on the face of the bill will provide certainty around the change at a time when people value certainty and we will ensure that the provision can commence month after royal assent as signal 
 i do not want to detain the house any far we know that be tell you be near the end of your life can be a frightening experience not only for the   individual concern but for their family and their loved one this bill although seemingly small will have a really positive impact on those whom the provision cover at a very difficult time as with the act the bill will ensure that when someone reach the final stage of life they will not have those additional financial concern receive a payment at an early stage in their final illness will help those people to plan more effectively provide they with the opportunity to focus on their time with the people who matter to they 
 this debate give i the opportunity to thank the st peter st james hospice the hospice in the weald st catherine ’s hospice in pease pottage those local hospice that i be sure we all have and those charity mention in this debate who bring real comfort and support in all our constituency at such difficult time this bill will help people to live well to the end with their love one and with that comfort i greatly thank my hon friend the member for tewkesbury for bring the bill forward we all wish it safe and speedy passage through the other place so that it can reach the statute book and support those who need it our love one and people in our community with no undue delay 
 with the leave of the house i call laurence robertson 
 i be pleased to draw this debate to a close by thank the minister and the opposition for their support and in particular with regard to set the date for the commencement of legislation in that context i also thank my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   for her amendment i thank all hon member who have speak in this debate and particularly those who serve in the committee stage i also extend my thank to those at the department for work and pensions and the bill management team who have be so very helpful and to the staff at marie curie who be mention early and who campaign so strongly on this issue hon member will know we can not function in this place without the help of our staff so i particularly thank my staff benjamin jones and harry wallis for the work they have put in i hope by work together on this piece of legislation that we will have make a difference 
 question put and agree to 
 bill accordingly read the time and pass 
 bill as amend in the public bill committee consider 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read the time 
 it have be a long journey to get this special envoy for freedom of religion or belief bill to this point i be grateful for the cross party and public effort and acknowledge the international interest in it at the outset i particularly express my thank to the foreign secretary lord cameron of chipping norton for his personal and vocal support for the bill include in the other place 
 it be pertinent that this be a private member ’s bill because while it implement recommendation of the truro review and be therefore implement a manifesto commitment its origin be on the back benches of the commons and the lords in the inaugural report of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief recognise the challenge for attention and concern for the right to freedom of religion or belief as in article of the universal declaration of human right and describe it as an orphan right this bill will ensure that the office of the prime minister ’s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief be secure as a permanent fixture in statute and will embed the progress that the uk have make in promote the fundamental and universal human right to freedom of religion or belief around the world 
 since the all party parliamentary group produce that report it have grow in number to more than parliamentarian i believe it be the large all party group in this place that reflect the increase in awareness and support for the right of freedom of religion or belief here in the uk and i be very proud of that have work internationally in this role as the prime minister ’s special envoy for some and a half year i know that the parliamentary work on freedom of religion or belief stand out as a beacon across the world it be with great delight that i hear of my parliamentary colleague from the opposition benches say in this work there be n’t a piece of paper between we here in this house in what we believe in 
 however the increase in awareness here for this work sadly reflect the reality that across the world the right of religious minority be under severe attack freedom of religion or belief have never be more important a cause to champion for the simple reason that there have never be more people at risk not just million but hundred of million discriminate against and deny life ’s chance simply on account of what they believe 
 some may point out that have a special envoy in statute would be unprecedented but if the objection to any change be simply that it be unprecedented we would never make any progress indeed that be why we be here in this place to make legislative change what be unprecedented be that people have never be more heinously and despicably deny their wish to live out their belief they have never experience in the number   they do today more abuse emotional or material hardship incarceration or even death simply on account of what they believe i hope to give some example of that a little later in my speech 
 in the time that i have be the uk ’s prime minister ’s special envoy from late we have see such an increase in instance of concern there have not just be an increase in the number of authoritarian regime we have also see new challenge to freedom of religion or belief through ever increasingly sophisticated technology use to oppress people and the darkly sinister expansion of transnational repression 
 let i mention a few example from country around the world we have see for example the military coup in myanmar exacerbate the persecution of religious minority not least the rohingya muslims we have see the taliban takeover of afghanistan with every religious group there other than those willing to succumb to the taliban ’s way now oppress and live in fear in russia jehovah ’s witness include the elderly be now be imprison as criminal simply for be pacifist and be unwilling to serve in the army and putin be weaponise orthodox christianity in the war against ukraine with place of worship deliberately destroy and report of pastor disappear 
 we have see daily disturbance in iran for which some have pay with their life at the core of those be the cry for every iranian to be free to live in accordance with their individual belief in nigeria thousand of christians and some moderate muslims be be massacre by islamic extremist every year just on tuesday this week we commemorate the birthday of leah sharibu who be abduct by boko haram year ago and not release as be other chibok schoolgirl because she refuse to renounce her christian faith in nicaragua the catholic church be be particularly target many people have be expel include those run religious school or medical centre even mother teresa ’s nun who have be work there for over year be require with no notice at all to leave the country 
 we be all aware of the situation in china where over uyghurs and reportedly increasingly more be egregiously incarcerate in century concentration camp many have disappear forever and many be report as have die the allegation of force organ harvesting against falun gong practitioner would simply defy belief have those allegation not be persistently make by so many in tibet accord to recent un report up to child as young as be be send away to boarding school alienate from their family culture and belief the world should not stand silent about such thing 
 before my hon friend move on i would like to thank she specifically for her work as envoy as she have just show she have use her voice endlessly to shine a light on some of the dark corner of the world i know that she will want i to mention sudan where we have see systemic ethnic cleansing of non arabs perhaps more on the ground of race than religion and that she will also want i to mention the fact that religious leader can be a force for good in try to stop violence in particular in south sudan we see the pope the archbishop of canterbury and the moderator of the church of scotland work   together to call for an end to violence i would like to say a massive thank you to my hon friend for her work as envoy which show why this role be so important 
 i thank my right hon friend for her intervention and even more so for her work as chair of the all party parliamentary group on sudan and south sudan as well as for her acknowledgment of the importance of freedom of religion or belief when she be a minister in the foreign office she be absolutely right the influence that religious leader can have in bring community together and prevent the kind of atrocity i have refer to can not be overstate this year it have be my privilege to have collaborate with the archbishop of canterbury to highlight and focus on this issue include at an event at the foreign office attend by over of those engage on the issue here in the uk and internationally among they several parliamentarian i remember that my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   be there 
 the role i have give the uk an additional privilege that of hold out the importance of freedom of religion or belief across the world however the man woman and child around the world who suffer whether under the hard arm of authoritarian regime or at the ruthless whim of militant mob need not just our voice but our partnership they need not just our word but our action not just our intention but our effective help that be why the role of envoy the office that i have the privilege of hold at present need securing and resource over the long term beyond the term of any particular government or party in power of course this bill intend to do just that 
 as i say the bill fulfil the government ’s manifesto commitment to act on their word and fully implement the truro review which include a recommendation to make the special envoy role permanent with the requisite authority and resource there be only other country in the world with a similar office the us have have a permanent office promote and protect freedom of religion or belief for over year the stability of that office over time have ensure a build up of resource expertise and research capability that enable it to make a significant contribution towards combat forb abuse across the world 
 the uk may be small but if we have such an office and secure and resource it as a continuation of the office that i have the privilege of hold at present it would enable we to speak across the world with a powerful voice for good we have see the good influence that the current foreign secretary be have as he speak out across the world have represent prime ministers now i have be so encouraged by the respect in which the uk be hold as we speak out internationally we sometimes underplay that here to our detriment 
 it be note in committee that although of course the prime minister will personally appoint their special envoy the legislative description in the bill be of a minister of the crown the title of prime minister ’s special envoy provide the vital authority internationally to advocate of behalf of the uk as i have just touch on clause reflect the current purpose of the envoy and the requirement to report directly to the prime minister that direct accountability be so important   and i have find it so helpful under each of the prime ministers i have serve i thank they all for their active support for my role 
 clause 1(6 provide for the continued office of the special envoy and resource to fulfil the role i say to my hon friend across the house that we be all on the same side when it come to advocate for freedom of religion or belief in fact i do not know of a single member in this house who oppose the bill why because we recognise that it will provide an opportunity to do good real good and to change life we recognise that anyone who oppose the bill or seek to prevent its passage in any way be in effect oppose the opportunity to do good 
 i absolutely support the bill i be not a religious person i do not follow any religion but i support the bill because i believe in freedom which be so important do my hon friend agree that the bill be about not only freedom of religion but freedom of belief at the heart of the bill be freedom for people to feel what they feel whatever their religion 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the clue be in the title the prime minister ’s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief belief indicate that there be some who do not hold a religious belief but who be equally entitle to our support advocacy and protection on account of their belief whatever they be 
 i will give the house some example of the good that this office if secure permanently could continue to do about month ago my office the office of the prime minister ’s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief initiate our monthly religious prisoner of conscience scheme every month we champion and call for the release of a prisoner across the world who be incarcerate sometimes in inhumane condition simply on account of their belief we have champion a jehovah ’s witness in tajikistan buddhists in tibet montagnards in vietnam a sufi muslim in nigeria christians and human right leader in myanmar and nicaragua a pastor in cuba baha’is in iran and other this monthly programme be quickly take up by the international religious freedom or belief alliance now make up of country which the uk chair for year to that mean it be not just the uk call for the release of these prisoner but the collective voice of country around the world 
 that advocacy along with the advocacy of other internationally have result in the release of of those prisoner all of whom be face several year they include an elderly prisoner who be extremely ill and need medical attention and who i believe would have die have he not be release he have now have that treatment and be get well other prisoner be young girl in their 20 who face several year in prison simply for have change their faith they be now free and start new life safe in another country 
 just this week we hear good news about another of the prisoner of conscience we have champion this will interest my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken we champion the case of mubarak bala a humanist in nigeria who be sentence to some year in prison simply for his   belief in fact the deputy special envoy david burrowes go to nigeria and meet mubarak ’s wife last year i be pleased to say that this week we hear that his sentence have be reduce to year that be good news but we be not give up we will carry on campaign for his full release that be the good this role can do and do 
 apart from challenge autocratic regime as we do work in this sphere and stand up for those whose basic human right have be trample over simply because of their belief can make all the difference in the world to people like those i have just mention this have enable the uk to show global leadership i be proud to say that the special envoy team for freedom of religion or belief recently win an international award for government leadership on forb 
 as the bill hopefully pass its final stage here in the commons today i look forward to it go forward to the lords again i thank everyone who have be involve in its passage to date 
 i rise to speak briefly in support of the bill introduce by my hon friend   the member for congleton fiona bruce put the special envoy for freedom of religion or belief on a statutory footing be an extremely good measure that we should all support 
 i want to very briefly talk about the way i have see my hon friend the member for congleton carry out her role in my capacity as chair of the british group of the inter parliamentary union my hon friend regularly attend event that we hold here where we host parliamentarian from around the world she have the ability to connect with those parliamentarian to offer they the support they need very often those politician might be subject to persecution in their own country because of their religion despite be elect politician my hon friend really do provide great support and offer they hope that the work they be do can have a positive outcome 
 my hon friend be also able to demonstrate the uk ’s lead in this area at the inter parliamentary union parliamentary conference on interfaith dialogue which be hold last year it be so far the only such conference but i hope there will be more my hon friend be of the star speaker at that event she be able to come in and talk about the work we do here in the uk this be an event that bring together faith leader and politician from around the world there be some authoritarian regime represent to try to open up that dialogue and show that freedom of religion and belief be a very valuable matter and that we as politician need to communicate more with faith leader than we probably do 
 when i be minister for modern slavery it be the faith group that be able to offer the most support to victim of modern slavery mr deputy speaker you be of the most amiable and approachable chap i know but i suspect that many of your constituent find it easy to speak to their local priest rabbi or other religious leader than to you because of the trust that people have in the religious and faith leader they interact with therefore it be incredibly important for you to have a dialogue with your faith leader as it be for   all of we here because it be how we find out about what be go on for our constituent and how we can get support to they we can not overstate the importance of faith and its interaction with politic and how we must all be part of it 
 i thank my right hon friend for highlight the importance of interfaith dialogue i must not miss the opportunity to promote of the project be undertake by the international alliance of country we have a working group on interfaith dialogue which be launch this year and we be call for contribution of good example of such dialogue from around the world i encourage anyone in this place and anyone listen to the debate or read about it afterwards to contact our alliance they can do so through i in order to contribute 
 i be so grateful to my hon friend for raise that i know that we will all take note of it and look to promote it to our constituent 
 i will conclude by say the uk already have a lead role in this area but put the envoy on a statutory footing will reinforce that role ensure continuity and emphasise the intent of parliament to ensure that freedom of religion and belief be always observe 
 i rise to support this important bill i will be the to say that parliament often rush too quickly to create office and commissioner for this that and the other when a lot of this work should be do by ministers who should be hold to account by parliament for their activity but i be also very conscious that something that may seem quite narrow in its scope may be low down in the day to day life of a minister 
 the challenge that people of faith face around the world be so acute that create this special role permanently as parliament wish be a really important step in ensure that of people ’s most fundamental freedom freedom of religion or belief be protect it be something that the united kingdom cherish so much that the prime minister will have somebody perform that role in their name work with they and the foreign office to ensure through intervention and by convene thing like the international alliance that it be not just an afterthought it be something that parliament have decide really matter to the outcome that the post seek to achieve 
 i have the good fortune this week to visit the vatican with other members of parliament on the all party parliamentary group on the holy see we meet a variety of group as well as be part of the general audience and meet his holiness pope francis i be strike by the conversation that we have with sister who be part of the international union of superiors general those nun undertake really valuable often dangerous work right around the world not only in the traditional form of education or help with care in hospital or palliative care setting but increasingly in try to tackle thing such as modern slavery 
 i declare an interest as a trustee of the organisation arise which do exactly that we train sister around the world to identify potential victim of force labour and exploitation we give they   training on how to make sure that worker for example on tea plantation in india be properly regularise know their right and have the right documentation it be the sister who do that work and they be utterly wonderful my right hon friend give i a great opportunity to pay tribute to they and i thank she for that 
 i thank my right hon friend for that intervention i know how much this issue matter to she when she be in the home office traditionally the sister will stay in place of conflict and real difficulty despite the threat that they receive in the past a religious such as a nun or a priest would have be give some sort of protection but unfortunately that be no long the case and in fact such people be start to become target 
 i be lead to believe that of the world ’s nun be in india india be an amazing country but many of we will have be horrify by the regular and active persecution of christians in part of that country of course the uk government need their important relationship with our commonwealth friend which recently host a very successful g20 summit and be a very important part of the global economy but they also need to challenge aspect of the way in which it deal with freedom of religion and belief i believe that our minister do that successfully but it be of additional benefit to have a special envoy of the prime minister ’s who work with many country through the international alliance on raise these issue my hon friend   the member for congleton fiona bruce   mention a case that she have tackle in nigeria 
 my right hon friend be make an excellent speech may i augment what she have just say about the international alliance just this week member of its council of expert produce a report on the continue atrocity in manipur which have be go on for a year i be pleased that the foreign secretary have speak in such positive term about our expert report which be produce a year ago and i hope that member and those who be listen to the debate will look at the further report lead by the well know and prestigious former bbc reporter david campanale those atrocity in manipur require much more attention 
 my hon friend be right to make that point and a permanent role will continue to bring that focus as the bill make clear staff and accommodation will be provide when they be consider to be necessary which i think be important
