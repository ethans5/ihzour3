 do the minister agree that if iceland and monaco can be approve country under the reciprocal uk mobility scheme our close neighbour such as ireland and france should be too many school in my constituency would like a youth mobility agreement because it would be beneficial to our youth 
 i be in iceland the other day iceland be of course a member of the european economic area and we be not and we do not seek to rejoin the single market the custom union or the eu or to return to freedom of movement however the prime minister and the president of the european commission meet in brussels on   october   and agree to strengthen the relationship between the eu and the uk and put it on a more solid and stable footing the foreign secretary attend the foreign affairs council in luxembourg on   october both those meeting mark a significant moment in our reset with europe

 ukraine be face a difficult winter what step be the government take to help ensure that ukraine be in the good possible position to deal with the challenge that that will bring 
 i agree with my hon friend putin ’s shocking and barbarous attack on ukrainian energy infrastructure have increase the vulnerability of million of ukrainians before this winter that be why i have announce and sign off £ in additional support for ukraine ’s energy system we be work with partner across europe and in the g7 to support ukrainians in this area 
 do my hon friend agree that ukraine ’s rightful place be with other european democracy in the nato alliance 
 my hon friend will know that the nato secretary general be in london recently alongside president zelensky where the prime minister and the foreign secretary welcome they our ally have make it clear that ukraine ’s future be in nato and indeed in washington they confirm that ukraine be on an irreversible path to nato membership we will play   a lead role in support ukraine ’s pathway to membership 
 give that answer do the foreign commonwealth and development office consider that the report presence of the united nations secretary general at   putin ’s summit in russia will be helpful or unhelpful   to ukraine if the latter what be the minister do about it 
 while i thank the right hon gentleman for his question obviously the meeting that the united nations secretary general choose to attend be a matter for he not for the government we continue to work with a wide range of ally to support ukraine across the g7 as we have in relation to today ’s announcement and with our partner in europe 
 do the minister share my concern about worrying report of north korean troop fight for russia in ukraine what message would he give from the dispatch box to pyongyang 
 i absolutely share the right hon gentleman ’s concern the foreign secretary have be clear that we condemn in the strong term the democratic people ’s republic of korea ’s continue unlawful arm transfer and the report deployment of its troop to the russian federation to support the unlawful war of aggression in ukraine that be not only in violation of multiple united nations security council resolution but it will also prolong the suffering of the ukrainian people and threaten global security so we condemn it in absolute term 
 i call the shadow minister 
 to move we beyond the condemnation in the last week troop from north korea have arrive in russia and be train in russian fatigue base on video that we have see in addition we know that russia have procure multiple weapon from north korea to aid the murder of ukrainians putin have seize the escalation ladder so will the minister now declare north korea a combatant in the renew illegal invasion of ukraine démarche the north korean chargé and confirm what unilateral and multilateral action we will be take in response 
 i thank the shadow minister for her point we absolutely condemn what north korea be report to have be do she will have see in our response to the iranian transfer of ballistic missile to russia that we act strongly swiftly and firmly we be closely monitor what russia be provide to the dprk in return for its provision of arm and military personnel we be deeply concerned about the potential for further transfer include of ballistic missile relate technology that would obviously jeopardise peace and stability not only in ukraine but across the world and we condemn it absolutely 
 what the plan timetable be for implement the agreement with mauritius on the sovereignty of the british indian ocean territory 
 what assessment he have make of the potential security implication of the agreement with mauritius on sovereignty of the british indian ocean territory 
 the government inherit a situation where the long term secure operation of the diego garcia military base be under threat the agreement that we have reach secure the future of the base and strengthen our role in safeguard global security the agreement be subject to the finalisation of a treaty that the government intend to complete in the coming month parliament will have the opportunity to scrutinise the treaty in the usual manner follow its signature 
 since the mistaken opening of negotiation by the last government on the sovereignty of the chagos island it turn out that the british high commissioner and other appear to have be bug by the government of mauritius if the police investigation prove that to be true and we can see that mauritius their government at least be bad actor be the year lease on diego garcia even worth the paper that it be write on 
 we note the report with significant concern but the hon gentleman will understand that i be not go to comment on an ongoing police investigation as i point out yesterday the report relate to historical conversation not during the current round of negotiation we be confident that we have achieve a treaty that meet our national security objective close off a migration route and fundamentally respect the interest of the chagossian people 
 how can the minister continue to defend the ceding of the chagos island to mauritius when china be rapidly expand its influence in the indo pacific with no bind agreement against chinese military involvement in the future have the government recklessly compromise british and ally security just to appease vested interest 
 i completely reject what the hon gentleman suggest about mauritius somehow be in hock to china or the agreement somehow open up a place for china let i be clear mauritius be of only african country that have not sign up to the belt and road initiative there be absolutely no way that we or the united states would have sign off a treaty across the national security apparatus that compromise any of our security interest or those of our ally the unequivocal support from the united states the president the secretary of state the defence secretary and across the establishment make it clear that this be the right deal for our security and that of our ally

 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 october be likely to see the least aid enter gaza since the start of the conflict that be unacceptable as the foreign secretary state on   october the uk be press israel alongside our partner to allow the aid into gaza that be so clearly need in this desperate situation and to enable the un and its humanitarian partner to operate effectively 
 i recently meet representative from the west london islamic centre in my constituency of ealing southall who tell i that they be deeply concerned about the plight of severely injure child in gaza who need urgent medical help will the minister outline what work she be do to ensure that those child have access to the very good medical attention 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this important issue and to her constituent and the very many people across the uk who be determined to do what they can we have see that with the uk public ’s response to the disasters emergency committee appeal match by the government up to £ she ask specifically about young child who have be catch up and injure the extent of disease and injury be significant and deeply concern we have provide significant support include through uk med for its field hospital in gaza last week my hon friend the minister of state announce £ for the egyptian health ministry to support medically evacuate palestinians from gaza 
 many resident from swindon north have contact i express their concern about gaza what step be the minister take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this matter we see people up and down the country who be very concerned about the humanitarian situation in gaza clearly we now have extreme level of food insecurity we be very concerned about the situation in northern gaza in particular the foreign secretary the prime minister and all of we in the ministerial team have be very clear to all actor in the region and other that there must be access to the aid that be so desperately need in all of gaza 
 since the devastating hamas attack on israel more than a year ago an estimate palestinians have die include many civilian and many more family have be repeatedly displace will the minister   assure i and my constituent that the government be use the full diplomatic force at their disposal to secure an immediate ceasefire in gaza and to allow the free flow of humanitarian aid 
 yes i can a resolution to this conflict have be a priority since day of the new government we be call for an immediate ceasefire the release of all hostage still cruelly detain by hamas and much more aid to enter gaza the death and destruction in gaza be intolerable and we have make that clear at every possible moment 
 i declare an interest as a former board member of the disasters emergency committee i be delighted to see the british public ’s generous response to its appeal i know that its member agency be do everything in their power to get aid to those who need it but of those agency islamic relief tell i yesterday about the situation in jabalia where people be be starve bomb and shoot on sight what conversation have the minister have with israeli counterpart to end the indiscriminate attack on people in gaza and let in the lifesave aid that the british public be so generously support 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question again i express our gratitude to the dec for its work in ensure that there have be that emergency appeal for the middle east i should have mention early that that be cover not just gaza but lebanon and the broad middle east where there be also that urgent humanitarian need i can reassure she that on issue of access to aid the uk government have be crystal clear on the need for the maintenance of international humanitarian law across the region which of course include israel as well as the foreign secretary underline at the end of last week 
 will the minister reassure i that september ’s export licence ban with israel cover item that we reasonably believe could be use to breach international law in gaza will she far reassure i that the remain export licence with israel largely do not cover the israel defence forces or military equipment 
 i wish to be very clear as i think there be some confusion on this important point follow the   september   suspension there be currently no extant uk export licence i repeat no extant export licence for item to israel that we assess might be use to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law there be only exception which be for f-35 component and the foreign secretary have explain that to the house my hon friend be right to say that most licence for export to israel be not for the idf and i be pleased to be able to put that on the record for the house 
 the footage of child catch up in the fighting in gaza be horrendous and so be the footage of those who be still hold hostage what be the minister do to ensure the protection of aid worker in gaza and lebanon and secondly give that she have just tell we that our effort to get more aid in be not work what be she next idea where will we go from here because clearly it be not work 
 we have indeed see some extremely disturbing scene of course it be important that we ensure that there be verify information in the fog of such a horrendous war we have all see those scene and be disturb by they the uk government be determined to do all that we can to ensure that aid be access by those who need it we be use every opportunity to do so which involve work with un agency in detail i have have many meeting with they the hon gentleman will know that we have resume support for the united nations relief and works agency we have be in close contact with it the world food programme and all other work on this and we have also be work bilaterally with all our partner in the region there be a number of different country work with we to try to ensure that there be access to aid which be desperately need 
 i thank my right hon friend for all that she have do so far on this issue my constituent include damon and annie be extremely concerned that every day thing be only get bad the un say that all essential supply for survival be run out give the abject condition in north gaza the fact that humanitarian access be nearly non existent be unconscionable a year on from the start of the conflict we be still debate restriction on the flow of aid by israeli authority what more can my right hon friend do to ensure that people who be die from hunger thirst and lack of medical care receive the attention they need 
 i can only underline the fact that the new uk government be do all that we can to get aid in as quickly as possible support trust partner on the ground to deliver life save humanitarian aid as have be mention we have agree to match up to £ of public donation to the disasters emergency committee ’s middle east humanitarian appeal that will provide life save aid include medical supply shelter and clean water to people in need on top of the support that we have release to unrwa that aid need to get to the people who desperately need it and i refer to my response to an early question on that point we be use every avenue to advance that cause 
 the image come out of northern gaza have horrify many as have the news of yet more indiscriminate bombing and many people have reach into humanity ’s dark period for historical comparison i do not know which of those be appropriate but i do know that on each of those occasion we tell ourselves that this time be different yet it never be do the ministerial team realise that what they do now be what they would have do then if they do do they believe that the conversation that they be have be enough and if they do not when will they act positively to bring about a ceasefire 
 i be grateful to the right hon member for his question but he must recognise that from the day of the new government come into position we have seek to do all we can to advance the cause of a ceasefire on the issue of international humanitarian law which he rightly and clearly state as an imperative we have be consistently clear as a new government that israel must comply with international   humanitarian law it must allow unfettered aid access our message be clear israel could and must do more to ensure that aid reach civilian in gaza we have uphold our legal requirement around that as he will have see in relation to decision take around arm export licence 
 last month the minister of state tell the house that 
 we could not be clear intentionally direct attack at civilian object be a war crime those attack threaten civilian access to power heating and water supply impact the safety and livelihood of million of ukrainians official report   september vol c. 
 she be right so why be it that the government can call out putin ’s war crime the moment they happen but they seem utterly incapable of do that when the perpetrator be netanyahu and the victim be palestinians 
 i regret the tone of the hon member ’s question surely he can recognise that the new government prioritise do all that we can to secure the require ceasefire the government have repeatedly convey not just message but action time and again to make sure we play our part and that have be recognise internationally the change we have make around unrwa our commitment to the international criminal court and international court of justice ensure we hold to our legal requirement around arm export that be a government that be commit to international humanitarian law 
 intercept communication demonstrate that hamas be struggle to find room in their warehouse for the aid that be arrive what action will the minister take to ensure that unrwa actually get that aid to the people who need it and we accept they need it desperately when hamas be prevent it from reach the palestinian population 
 the government be clear that unrwa play a vital role in save life in gaza provide much need food and basic service and support stability in the west bank and wide region wherever there be allegation or report that there may have be unacceptable activity such as that cover in the colonna report we have state clearly to unrwa that they must be investigate it do do that with the colonna report and the uk government have support the implementation of the finding of that report we continue to discuss that in detail with unrwa so that it can operate in the manner that it be mandate to do by international law 
 while i appreciate the comment about aid do the minister condemn the ethnic cleansing and annexation of northern gaza under the general ’s plan with aid not be allow in if so what action be be take to demonstrate the uk ’s strong objection 
 the uk government be extremely concerned by the situation in northern gaza this morning i be discuss it with humanitarian as i have be do just about every day we really see a   deterioration in people ’s circumstance there in term of health and access to aid as i say at the beginning of the question the fact that this month will likely see the low amount of aid since the start of the conflict be unacceptable we be deeply concerned that we have now see many people who have be displace not just once twice or time but up to time we will continue to argue for the need for humanitarian access to gaza 
 far to the answer the minister give a few moment ago unrwa supply be find in the hamas leader yahya sinwar ’s underground hideout as my hon friend   the member for harrow east bob blackman   say hamas terrorist be struggle to find warehouse space to store all the misappropriate aid when will the government review their commitment to fund unrwa and actually take action to stop the misappropriation of that aid 
 i refer the hon member to my previous response on that the uk government take any such allegation very seriously we have ensure that those be take up with unrwa and with the colonna report we see a thorough investigation into the allegation some of which be prove unrwa have be take action in order to deal with they it be really important that neutrality be hold to and we as the uk have play our part by ensure that unrwa have the funding require to implement those recommendation 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 follow the removal of the international terrorist yahya sinwar and the possibility of an amnesty for those who now release the remain hostage what pressure be the government bring to bear on hamas to urge they to lay down their arm and release the hostage both of which be necessary for full unfettered access for humanitarian relief in gaza 
 i be grateful to the right hon member for raise this incredibly important issue the suffering especially of the family and friend of the hostage be indescribable the foreign secretary and the prime minister have meet with they particularly those who have uk link and have repeatedly ensure that the release of hostage must be prioritise they have articulate that message time and time again and will continue to do so until the hostage be able to return home as they must be able to do 
 co existence be inescapable and a state solution be day inevitable as both israelis and palestinians be here to stay just as the intifada usher in the historic breakthrough at oslo so too britain with its deep regional connection un responsibility and brilliant diplomatic service have a key role in lift people ’s eye to a very different future what discussion be the government have on this issue build on the significant effort start under the last government 
 we do not always agree across the dispatch box but i strongly agree with the right hon member ’s characterisation of the need for a state    solution ultimately that be the only way of deliver the peace and security that the people of israel and palestine deserve make sure that we play our part in exercise leadership towards that state solution be a long term commitment of this government but of course as he would expect we need to show what that can deliver a huge amount of work be ongoing around reconstruction and i have discuss that issue in detail with the world bank for example it have be conduct a survey of the need that will have to be meet make sure that work be fully co ordinated so that we can achieve that secure future for those who be in gaza at the moment 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the attack see 
 more than residential block raze to the ground some reach the hospital some remain under the rubble 
 that be the account of dr eid sabbah of kamal adwan hospital in northern gaza which he give to the bbc yesterday i have note the minister ’s qualified response early but as the un special envoy for the peace process warn that 
 nowhere be safe in gaza 
 do she agree that the uk should now cease all arm export to israel 
 with all due respect the hon member my county colleague i urge he to look again at what i state which stipulate very clearly the legal ground for that decision about arm export i be clear that the restriction that have be place on arm due to that legal regime which the uk government be determined to fulfil be because the other licence be not go to be use in the manner that some would suggest we be very clear about the need to fulfil our international responsibility in that regard the hon member also talk about the role of healthcare worker within gaza and we pay tribute to all those who have be deliver healthcare many be british citizen the british government have support uk med and we pay tribute to they 
 what step his department be take to counter iranian support for terrorism

 iran ’s malign activity and support for its proxy be destabilise the middle east do the minister agree that this must end and will he say a little more about what step he be take 
 i do agree in all of our effort in the region we be clear that hamas and the other iranian proxy that be do so much to destabilise the region must stop we be work with our ally to that effect include by review new measure that we can take 
 for year the foreign secretary and the labour party have promise to proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps the chief sponsor of global terrorism be the government go to take action to tackle terrorism and extremism in the uk or be they go to break yet another promise 
 as i understand the question from the former home secretary she be say that when she be home secretary she do not proscribe the irgc but she think we should have do so within day i say to my hon friend that we will take the necessary step in the uk to prevent the irgc from take action on these street but as she know well we do not comment on whether an organisation be under consideration for proscription in the normal way

 i thank the minister for that response legal immigration be very important and people should have that opportunity if they have be persecute or there be human right issue but    economic migrant have to be stop in their country france also have a very clear part to play and we sometimes feel that it have not do so as strongly as it should have do have the minister have an opportunity to speak to her french counterpart to ensure that france play its part in stop the economic migrant come across the channel 
 i be grateful to the hon member for his important question this new government have be determine to strengthen our relationship with all of our partner include france on these question my right hon friend the home secretary have view this as a priority from day and she have be determine to ensure that we have both the right legal framework and the right logistical measure as i have say we of course need to tackle the reason why people can not have a livelihood in their own country and we be do a huge amount in the foreign commonwealth and development office to ensure we deliver on that

 obviously decision in america be for the american people but the special relationship endure regardless of the administration or who be in the white house and it be deep and enduring as the right hon gentleman know well from his important former role we absolutely need to co operate with our eu partner on support for ukraine and that be why today it be so fantastic to hear the news that we have agree as promise with the g7 and with our european and indeed our american partner the extraordinary revenue acceleration scheme that will deliver new money to ukraine now

 my constituency be also home to a new and grow population of hongkongers who although they be now in a free country live in fear of the repression that   the hon member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean   describe that be not least because of the report presence until recently of a secret police station in glasgow run by the chinese communist party will the minister join i in send a clear signal to the chinese state hand off hong kong scots

 what diplomatic step he be take to help secure a ceasefire in lebanon 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help secure a ceasefire in lebanon 
 the uk be the g7 country to call for an immediate ceasefire between lebanese hezbollah and israel when we do so on   september a political solution consistent with resolution be the only way to restore security and stability for the people live on both side of the blue line we continue to press for that with vigour and urgency with our international counterpart the foreign secretary do so last week and so do i. we will continue to do so this week and every day 
 we be appal by the increase in violence after israel ’s ground invasion of lebanon as somebody who use to work in beirut when the country welcome a syrian refugee it be upsetting to see people on the move again after so much violence i thank the foreign secretary for his diplomatic effort so far do the minister agree that there be no military solution to the conflict in lebanon will he outline again in more detail what diplomatic effort he be make to ensure that we have a ceasefire so that lebanese and israeli civilian can return to their home 
 we agree very much only a political solution will enable lebanese civilian to return to their home and israeli civilian to return to the north of israel clearly hezbollah have be conduct terrible attack on northern israel for a long time from   october which be a terrible day to choose to start we be work with all our ally on a plan base around resolution we talk regularly with all the key player in the region and in particular with amos hochstein the us envoy work on a proposal to achieve the effect of we will continue to do so 
 the report attack on united nations interim force in lebanon basis by the israel defence forces show disregard for resolution and the exist diplomatic framework for peace last week ’s joint statement by foreign ministers and our ally condemn all the threat to unifil ’s security be welcome so can the    foreign minister tell the house what discussion he have have with israeli political leader to supplement that action be they productive 
 i thank my hon friend for her important question we be absolutely clear that attack by the idf on unifil basis must stop and they must stop immediately we have call on israel to that effect we have call on all party to uphold their obligation in ensure the safety and security of unifil personnel i be sure that many in this house will be look each day at the report from unifil on the situation there as i have say in answer to previous question only a political solution consistent with un security council resolution can restore stability and security we continue to raise these matter with the israelis at every level and i will continue to do so this week 
 unifil and un security council resolution plainly have not prevent the construction of tunnel and forward attack position by iranian proxy south of the litani river what discussion will the foreign secretary be have with the united nations to ensure that something be put in place to replace to strengthen the role of unifil and prevent aggressive action by hezbollah and its fellow traveller 
 the thing we have to do be get hezbollah back north of the litani river consistent with we should not move away from until we have make progress under it i recognise the force of what the right hon gentleman say about the concern about hezbollah ’s presence close to the israeli border in breach of un security council resolution i condemn the attack include the missile strike that have be happen since   october and all the other violence that lebanese hezbollah have be responsible for it be proscribe under uk law and we hold no truck with it but the way to get hezbollah away from the border   be and that be what we have to stick to

 any editorial decision on bbc content will be make by the bbc alone that be right and proper all i can say be that wherever i be in the world it be clear quite how powerful the bbc be a soft power perhaps but a very important reflection of our value as a country and of deep connection between the people of britain and other nation we be determined to ensure that that remain the case

 the foreign secretary have set out our view on the israeli application of international humanitarian law at great length in relation to the decision to suspend arm licence we keep those issue under regular review and will update the house if there be a change in our assessment 
 as we have hear again today in the chamber war crime in gaza continue make it clear that the time for empty promise and hollow word be over do the minister agree that the international community must finally fulfil its responsibility and take real action start with immediate sanction on the hard right extreme ministers in the netanyahu government 
 i hope member recognise that the word that we have be speak at this dispatch box have not be hollow since come into government we have restore funding to unrwa we have also take step in the international criminal court and the international court of justice and in relation to the arm suspension that i refer to a moment ago as for the far right settler to whom i think my hon friend be refer we introduce sanction last thursday my right hon friend the prime minister make it clear during prime minister ’s question that we continue to review these issue and we will return to the house 
 the outgoing president of the united states have indicate that he have be tell where and when the israeli government will respond to the iranian terror threat have our government be inform 
 i think that you mr speaker and other members will understand that it be not appropriate to comment on that in the house

 the humanitarian crisis in sudan be the bad in the world million of people face food insecurity and disturbingly it have now be verify that there be famine in the zamzam refugee camp we in the uk will continue to do all that we can for instance in our role as a penholder we will work with partner to raise the profile of this situation and make it clear to the war party that they must allow access to aid 
 with your permission mr speaker i will make a statement on ukraine i apologise for the delay in get you and opposition front bencher a copy of my statement the responsibility be entirely mine 
 i have just return from day of intense defence diplomacy at the nato defence ministers meeting in brussels where we welcome president zelensky and then at the g7 defence ministers meeting in naples where we have important update from the battlefield agree that this be a critical point in the conflict and stress the need to step up and speed up support for ukraine the g7 joint declaration strongly condemn putin ’s illegal invasion and reinforce our unwavering support for ukraine it also rightly state that 
 russia ’s aggression against ukraine be pose a threat to international security the purpose and principle of the un charter and the rule base international order 
 that be what be at stake for we all if president putin prevail in ukraine he will not stop there if big nation redraw international boundary by force the sovereignty and security of all nation be undermine that be why the uk ’s military economic industrial and diplomatic support alongside that of our ally be so important 
 i have return to the uk know that nato and the g7 be unite for ukraine just as the uk be unite for ukraine our job now be to turn the talk into action which be exactly what the government be do today the chancellor and i be announce that the uk will provide an additional £ to ukraine this be new money which will be deliver under the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan to ukraine scheme it be part of the $ loan package from g7 country to support ukraine ’s military budget and reconstruction need loan that will be repay use the profit generate from immobilised russian sovereign asset profit on frozen russian money will support ukraine ’s fight against putin turn the proceed of putin ’s corrupt regime against it and put they in the hand of ukrainians 
 i want to be clear today ’s new money be in addition to the £ a year of military support that this government have commit to ukraine each year for as long as it take the money be in addition to that in the £ defence industrial support treaty that i sign with defence minister umerov in july that be money that ukraine will use to procure military equipment from british company boost british job and british industry today ’s new money be also in addition to the extra artillery air defence ammunition and missile that we have announce and deliver in the month of this new government ukraine be a order priority for i as defence secretary and for this government we will continue to step up support to lead and to stand with ukraine for as long as it take 
 it be day since putin launch his full scale illegal invasion and ukraine ’s civilian and military alike have be fight with great courage there have be important battlefield development in recent week when i last update the house ukrainian force be month into their remarkable offensive in kursk month on they continue to hold russian territory   ukraine ’s strategic surprise have put putin under pressure force the diversion of some russian troop and equipment despite the increase in brutal russian counter attack and aerial bombardment they have so far fail to dislodge the ukrainian incursion 
 it be not just in kursk that ukraine be fight back ukrainian force have launch long range attack into russian territory and on military target that be directly support putin ’s illegal invasion in september ukraine use long range drone to attack ammunition storage facility strike that successfully destroy thousand of tonne of ammunition and both the defensive thrust into kursk and the strategic defensive strike into russia have have an impact on the battlefield russia ’s advance towards pokrovsk in the east putin ’s main line of effort have be slow 
 russian loss continue to rise since the start of the conflict russia be likely to have suffer casualty in september the average casualty rate of russians on the battlefield in ukraine each day be a record high and a half time the rate this time last year as for equipment russia have now lose tank and armoured vehicle and vessel in the black sea fleet have be destroy or damage 
 despite the incredible resilience of the ukrainians they remain under great pressure from russian force across multiple front russian troop continue to advance and to attack ukrainian infrastructure target the important port of odesa and strike energy infrastructure as we head into winter ukraine ’s energy generation capacity have be reduce by up to third of pre war level russian industry remain on a war footing russian artillery be outfire ukraine by at least to and russia be recruit an additional troop this year defence will account for 32%—one of the total government budget in russia next year 
 in a concern new development it be now highly likely that the transfer of hundred of combat troop from north korea to russia have begin for north korean soldier to support russia ’s war of aggression on european soil be as shocking as it be desperate north korea already send significant munition and arm to russia in direct violation of multiple un resolution the develop military co operation between russia and the democratic people ’s republic of korea have serious security implication for europe and the indo pacific it represent a wide grow alliance of aggression that nato and the g7 nation must confront 
 despite this dangerous development ukraine remain determined to fight on its frontline in the east and in the territory in kursk and president zelensky will continue to seek support for his victory plan we want the plan to succeed and we stand ready to work closely with the ukrainians and ally to help it to do so as we approach day of this war the conflict be at a critical moment which be why the uk continue to step up its support for ukraine ukrainians be fight to regain their sovereign territory and to protect peace democracy and security for the rest of we in europe 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement i offer my condolence and those of opposition members    to the family and friend of corporal christopher gill who we understand tragically lose his life during a training exercise recently we understand that he serve his country for year include in afghanistan and more recently volunteer to train ukrainian soldier in the uk 
 have visit salisbury plain last may to see operation interflex i know that we should be grateful to all our service personnel include corporal gill who have play such a huge role in train the ukrainian armed force so that they can continue to fight and defend their homeland that fight go on and we continue to offer all support to the government for that as well as stand by the government people and armed force of ukraine 
 we therefore warmly welcome the g7 joint declaration and funding announcement but we share the government ’s concern in relation to north korea i have lose count of the many time that vladimir putin have accuse we and our ally of so call escalatory action in our support for ukraine but today we be consider the very real threat of north korean combat troop be send to support russia ’s illegal invasion let we be in   no doubt any potential agreement between putin and kim jong un to have north korean boot on the ground in ukraine at all let alone in the number that have be report would be a major escalatory ratchet by putin himself 
 after all as the secretary of state confirm russia have already procure munition and ballistic missile from north korea the transfer of those weapon in the place be not only completely unacceptable but a blatant violation of the un sanction that russia itself vote for the transfer of north korean weapon and now the threat of combat troop show weakness and desperation not strength on putin ’s part as the secretary of state say above all this raise the question of what putin be offer north korea in return but we should not be deter and must respond 
 we take decisive countermeasure to help constrain the transfer of weapon between north korea and russia the conservative government impose sanction on the arm for oil trade between russia and north korea include asset freeze travel ban and transport sanction the new government in turn must now respond to this late threat of combat troop can i press the secretary of state to look at how the uk should respond in the round yes we need to look at the diplomatic tool we can use to disrupt co operation between north korea and russia but we also need to urgently look again both at our military aid to ukraine and at the freedom we offer it to use the munition that we supply particularly long range missile 
 give the need to continue provide further capability to ukraine we welcome yesterday ’s announcement that the uk will contribute £ to the g7 extraordinary revenue acceleration loan scheme for ukraine the conservative government be a vocal advocate for mobilise frozen russian asset to support ukraine we strongly welcome the additional funding when will the money be make available to ukraine and over what term the soon those fund be mobilise the well when exactly will ukraine receive the funding 
 finally we have speak many time of the reality that we be face not just russian aggression but a broad authoritarian axis that ultimately threaten the uk we have see that explicitly with iran and the red sea and now we see it come ever close to home with the prospect of north korean troop deploy in a european theatre of war surely that strengthen even far the argument that the government need to deliver on their suppose cast iron guarantee to spend on defence as the secretary of state fail to answer i at defence oral can i once again press he to confirm that he be fight hard with the treasury to deliver a clear pathway to in the budget at the end of this month 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his comment about corporal gill i will pass they on to his widow and make sure that his family be aware of they and of the sentiment of the whole house the hon gentleman be right about the enormous contribution that corporal gill make include to the interflex training programme which i be proud to be able to commit to extend throughout the chancellor and i visit the programme together on sunday we meet colonel boardman the commander of operation interflex and the officer and soldier of scot together with instructor from kosovo australia and sweden illustrate the way the uk be lead a multinational effort to support ukrainian soldier 
 the hon gentleman be right and i suspect that   there be unanimity in the house on concern about the development in russia and the grow alliance with north korea and that it be unite in its determination to take the action require to respond and unite in recognise that we must do so alongside nato and other g7 ally 
 the hon gentleman ask about the new loan fund available for ukraine through the proceed of the interest on frozen russian asset we expect those to be available and in ukraine ’s hand from early in the new year which will put the uk ahead of many other nation participate in the scheme 
 on the hon gentleman ’s final question we remain totally committed to spend on defence we must do this to meet the threat that this country face the prime minister confirm the commitment to set out a clear path to in our week in government at the nato summit in washington i gently say again to the hon gentleman that the last time this country spend on defence be in under a labour government and that that level be never match in any of the conservative year since 
 i call the chair of the select committee on defence 
 i welcome the announcement today of the uk ’s increase support for funding for ukraine as part of the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan scheme the secretary of state speak about what be at stake for we all but can he say more about what discussion he have with his counterpart at the nato defence ministers meet about the need for they to substantially increase their support far to our prime minister ’s recent meeting with the us president what update be there on the use of storm shadow missile by ukraine 
 i welcome the new chair of the select committee who i believe now have a committee to chair i look forward to an invitation to give evidence and to discuss these issue with the committee soon 
 at the nato defence ministers meeting there be unanimity among the nation that the important commitment that nato nation make in washington particularly to the $ of extra support for ukraine must be deliver there be a recognition too that pledge make must be pledge deliver of the ukrainians strike concern be that just a of the equipment and support pledge have so far be deliver so there be a determination to step up not just what we can provide but how quickly we can provide it that be something that as a new government we do from day 
 on storm shadow only putin benefit from a discussion about this there be no single weapon that have turn the tide of any war whether it be artillery ammunition armoured vehicle or missile the uk provide support to ukraine to pursue its un right to defend its territory and its people 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement liberal democrats welcome the new measure announce today to use the profit of frozen asset for ukraine that £ will be of immense value to our ukrainian ally as they seek to repel putin ’s illegal invasion not least follow the alarming news that north korean troop be currently be train in russia to fight in ukraine but we must go far fast russia must not and can not succeed 
 some £ in frozen asset remain lock up in our country we urge the government as we have do for year to seize those asset and repurpose they for ukraine right away will the secretary of state commit to do so be he have conversation with our democratic partner to that effect with the us election fast approach it be deeply worry that our commitment to our ukrainian ally be uncertain a trump presidency could have a devastating effect on the security of europe and of ukraine so we urge the government to seize these asset now so that we can support ukraine come what may 
 we must lead with europe on this the eu country between they have close to € worth of frozen asset will the secretary of state consider convene an urgent summit with european counterpart to begin that process do he agree that if the us can not europe must 
 in fairness to the conservatives when they be in government and to the hon lady ’s party before the election we be all unite in the effort to get the interest draw down from the frozen russian asset put into ukrainian hand the uk government before the last election and since have be lead   this work 
 these be practical step that we can take now whatever declaratory position the hon lady want to adopt about seize russian asset this be valuable additional funding that from the new year will be in the hand of the ukrainian government to spend on in the uk ’s   case the military aid that they need that come in addition to all the other increase that we have put in place since the election i hope that despite the hon lady ’s call for go very much far she will recognise how significant this move be and recognise that the uk be among the of the nation to move on this i hope she will give this house her full support when we introduce the primary legislation that will seek the parliamentary spending authority to provide this financial assistance in pursuance of a bilateral agreement that we will strike with ukraine over how to do it 
 when this government say that our support for ukraine be absolute we mean it my right hon friend refer to the recently sign defence export treaty between the uk and ukraine which will support ukraine ’s defence industrial base while help to replenish our own stockpile as far as he be able will he update the house on the treaty ’s progress 
 i be proud to sign that treaty which mean that ukraine can draw down the export credit cover and contract with uk company it be also a framework that like some other framework the uk have put in place other nation and their company can use to deal with the difficulty that many face in contracting with ukraine the ukrainians will use it for contracting and procure munition and ammunition it will allow we to step up not just the provision but the production of essential military aid to ukraine 
 i welcome the statement but the bbc report that the money will be pay not in go but in tranche over time we have the budget next week will the secretary of state assure we that give that the money be what accountant would call an exceptional item it will in no way be include in the overall defence budget next week or attempt to bolster or bump that up there be rumour of cut so will the right hon gentleman assure we that the money be a off that will be treat completely differently in the red book 
 i can give the right hon gentleman that assurance the money be a off it be additional and separate and it will be account for and set out separately in the treasury documentation its significance be that it be a loan to ukraine that ukraine will not have to pay back because it will be service by the interest on the frozen russians asset he ask whether the sum will be pay all in go it will be make available soon in the new year and the ukrainians will be able to draw it down as they need it for the purpose that they determine 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s comment about north korea and the grow alliance of aggression that need to be confront i hope that we will have a strong response to that i also welcome the extra £ my right hon friend make the important point of many that the ukrainians be be outgunne to in artillery by the russians although the additional support be vital how quickly can we ensure that we get extra munition artillery and missile from the alliance and the g7 to ukraine 
 we can get that into the hand of ukrainians as soon as it be available for that purpose i announce the new contract to produce short range air defence missile the lmms lightweight multirole missile in the uk the initial contract be for and they will be in the hand of ukrainians from the beginning of next year we hope to step that up during the course of where other nation be ready to make available the weaponry that ukrainians need the establish arrangement for get it into the hand of ukrainians be in place it be a question not of how but of how quickly 
 the delicious irony of the interest on kremlin kleptocrat ill get gain be use to fund the resistance against russian aggression will not be lose on member across the house i welcome what the defence secretary have say in its entirety he will know well than any of we the crucial importance of the nato alliance machinery in assist ukrainian resistance give that recent former american president and current french president have both make disobliging remark about the nato alliance in the fairly recent past will the secretary of state reassure we that at least president macron be now fully on board with the alliance and france ’s important contribution to it 
 i will indeed at no point during the day of nato defence ministers talk be there any indication of the sort of view that the right hon gentleman suggest that some in america may hold or that president macron might have previously express indeed in the good bilateral meeting that i have with the french minister for the armed forces sébastien lecornu it be clear that the french commitment to support ukraine be as strong as the uk ’s i be glad to say that the determination of the french to work more closely with we on security and defence be equally strong 
 i welcome the statement and the announcement of further funding to ensure that we sustain the pace with which we be provide aid to ukraine and that we energise our own logistical enterprise what action be my right hon friend take to boost uk defence industrial production to support the ukrainian armed force and defence supply chain throughout the uk 
 my hon friend know this territory as well as anybody else in the house he will know that over the day the uk government have change fundamentally the way in which we go about procure what be require british industry have respond magnificently to that it have be able to respond more quickly innovate more rapidly and devise what it can produce to meet the need that ukraine say it have on the frontline the uk government ’s task be to be the middle man to ensure that that can happen at great volume and speed we will continue to do that 
 do the government think that ukraine be win or lose 
 i be not sure whether the hon gentleman be listen to my statement but i make it clear that this be a critical period in the conflict ukraine be under   huge pressure especially on the eastern front but it be fight conduct a counter offensive and put putin under pressure the only conclusion that the nation draw from the discussion in brussels confirm by the g7 nation in naples be that now be the moment when ukraine ’s ally must step up our support put ukraine in the strong possible position to withstand the russian onslaught and put pressure on putin a military economic and diplomatic response 
 i welcome the statement which be good news for ukraine do my right hon friend agree that ukraine be the frontier of war with the kremlin that international support be now more critical than ever and that we must be absolutely clear that defence of the uk begin in ukraine 
 my hon friend be right her very word be speak by several defence ministers in brussels defence of the uk and of europe start in ukraine ukraine be fight for the same value and for the rest of we in europe 
 in sharp contrast to the presence of the united nations secretary general at putin ’s summit in russia which send out all the wrong signal this statement be hugely welcome so i thank the secretary of state far to the question that the chairman of the defence committee ask be it not now time that not only storm shadow but all the matériel supply to ukraine by the western alliance should be use by ukraine in the manner that it see fit 
 we provide ukraine with the weaponry and support to defend its country freedom and people there be a consistency in that and there be no bar to ukraine strike russian military target so long as that be consistent with international humanitarian law and part of the proper defence of the country i speak about the long range drone and the successful attack they have be make defensive attack but nevertheless on military target in russia it be for the ukrainians to determine how good to defend their country and we will support they in whatever way we can 
 i warmly welcome the £ of aid announce today it be great news for those fighting for democracy in europe and a day of low morale in the kremlin it be fantastic the ukrainians might well use some of the money to continue to innovate at pace every few week they create new cutting edge and adaptive technology to use in the fight against putin will we learn from our friend in ukraine and ensure that we as a country invest in our own small and medium sized defence enterprise so that we can have the same output in the future 
 while there have be no change in the basis on which we provide military aid to ukraine there be a change in the approach we take not just to provide aid but to produce some of the military equipment and ammunition our challenge now be to take the lesson of what we have demonstrate can be do to support ukraine to equip our own force well to fight in the future 
 i thank the secretary of state for his statement its content and for advance sight of it the additional funding for ukraine be very welcome but it be what matériel they turn the funding into that will have the effect on the battlefield that we wish to see with the shell production of european partner still well short of a unit per year will the secretary of state indicate how uk shell production have grow either in numeric or percentage term if he can not share that with the house will he give we an assurance that it be increase 
 i can absolutely assure the hon member that it be increase i have already speak about the production of short range air defence missile the lmms which be increase to meet what the ukrainians need the ukrainians be clear that air defence system and long range drone be the thing that matter most to their defence and to their ability to put russia properly under pressure 
 i warmly welcome today ’s announcement of an additional £ in financial support for ukraine generate by frozen russian asset will my right hon friend say a little more about the concern development of north korean soldier support russia ’s war of aggression on european soil and how that underline the importance of we use every tool in our box to support ukraine ’s effort 
 i regret to say to my hon friend that i be not in a position to give the house any more detail about that suffice it to say we be watch and monitor this extremely closely we and the house have detect a grow co operation between north korea and russia and between iran and russia at least over the past month it be a sign not of strength but weakness on putin ’s part but it introduce a dangerous new development both for ukraine and for wide european security 
 i welcome the defence secretary ’s recognition of president zelensky ’s victory plan and his support for that but he will know that part of that plan be the use of long range missile i get his point about long range uk drone be use only for military target in russia and within the norm of international rule of law but i detect perhaps from his answer to question on long range missile that he be edge towards a position where he might publicly declare that ukraine can have the freedom to hit military target in russia use long range missile that will change the war and have an impact 
 we have step up the support we provide to ukraine but there have be no change in the basis on which we provide that support to ukraine 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement and his clear personal commitment it be very expensive for putin to fight this war but he be get a lot of money from the sale of oil there be real concern that british firm or firm with british connection be facilitate and enable the illegal oil trade what more can be do in co operation with the foreign secretary to ensure that sanction be more effective against the russian oil trade 
 my hon friend be right it be not just that we can confirm today that we be make the additional loan money available to the ukrainians it be also important to remember that the sanction themselves be responsible for freeze at least $ that russia would otherwise be able to use to feed its war machine the uk government and other have take step on the shadow fleet the shipping in the grey zone try to avoid sanction but wherever we have the evidence require to act and sanction we will do that and we will continue to do that 
 not only be a full battalion of north korean soldier set to be deploy to assist russia in ukraine but putin be benefit from component and weapon provide by the iranians and the chinese this all represent an unprecedented conflation of threat to global security i echo the question ask by hon friend the shadow defence secretary the commitment to invest of gdp be right but when will that be back up with action 
 the right hon lady be right we totally condemn north korea ’s involvement and support for russia from arm transfer to any further development as i say in my statement that be in breach of multiple un resolution and we continue to watch the situation 
 will the secretary of state join i in pay tribute to the uk armed force who be provide vital support to our ukrainian ally and to the ukrainian armed force who be fight valiantly against putin ’s unlawful invasion of ukraine 
 i will indeed i have have the privilege of visit interflex training course time now i think i visit the ever course at salisbury plain it be deeply move to see the level of commitment of british force to the task of train the ukrainians and to spend time with those ukrainian recruit they be lorry driver bank clerk pr executive of all age who have volunteer to fight for their country and their freedom they be train by british force now with those from other country alongside they who be equip they to be able to fight for their country know that they will soon return to the frontline in their own nation be deeply sobering 
 i very much welcome this £ but have the defence secretary have the opportunity to study the national audit office report publish last month into the impact of our operation in ukraine particularly operation interflex on the availability of the defence estate for the training of unit of the british army while that be acceptable in the short term in the long term it probably be not what impact assessment have he carry out and what proposal do he have to make available the defence estate we need to train british soldier 
 nothing will shake our commitment to continue the interflex training programme we be determined and we will continue that throughout many of the partner country that have be alongside we this year have already commit to do that again   next year the right hon member ask i about interflex the defence estate and the training of ukrainian soldier that will continue on the national audit office report i have indeed read that report it be a welcome change from the normal run of national audit office report into the ministry of defence that we have be use to in recent year it praise a good deal of what have be do by the ministry of defence in support of ukraine and it be very welcome 
 i thank the secretary of state for his very welcome statement he mention the importance of the ukrainian force effort in the black sea against the russian black sea fleet and how important that be to the ukrainian economy could he go a little far and describe how this funding for ukraine will help to ensure that security and perhaps go even far in the black sea 
 the principle behind this funding be that we put it in the hand of the ukrainians the ukrainians be in the good position and must be in the position to decide how good to use it we have say that they can use it entirely on military support if they choose to do so the support that they choose to procure with it will be a matter for they in discussion with we 
 be the defence secretary able to share with we any conversation that the foreign secretary have while in china about china ’s engagement in this situation and particularly its willingness to bring to bear the influence that it undoubtedly have on both russia and north korea 
 happily i can indeed the foreign secretary be in china on and   october he meet his counterpart the foreign minister and talk about the area on which our country may disagree include on russia ’s illegal invasion of ukraine he also raise the uk ’s concern over china ’s supply of equipment to russia and to russia ’s military industrial complex 
 i too very much welcome today ’s statement from my right hon friend the secretary of state it provide evidence not just of warm word but of real practical support for our ally in its desperate hour of need but this country can not do this on its own can he update the house on any discussion that he or his ministerial colleague have have with our friend in the rest of the g7 on combat putin through economic measure 
 i can indeed do so i come away from the g7 meeting in naples and from the meeting of nato defence ministers in brussels reinforce in my view that there be a determination not just to stand with ukraine now but to do so for as long as it take i will send my hon friend a copy of the communiqué from both meeting i think he will be encourage as i be by the degree of unanimity and determination not to allow putin to believe that if he hold out the west will give up 
 i welcome the announcement of the acceleration loan scheme i also welcome the timing the british government be   not simply wait to see the outcome of the us presidential election as some other government be do will the defence secretary repeat the assurance he give in the house last week that regardless of us policy military aid to ukraine from european nato nation will not decrease next year
