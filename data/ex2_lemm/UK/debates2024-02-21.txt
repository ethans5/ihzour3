accord to euro med human rights monitor israeli have kill seriously injure or maim well over people in gaza since   october the vast majority of they civilian and woman and child more than child have lose limb and many have have to undergo amputation without anaesthetic whole family and generation have be wipe out and just this week the united nations human rights office say it believe that israeli soldier have engage in arbitrary detention extrajudicial killing and sexual violence include the rape and execution of woman and girl and intentionally and publicly humiliate and degrade other israel itself have post video of its humiliation of civilian man 
 israel do not even pause for breath in its slaughter in gaza when the international court of justice put it on trial for genocide and order it to protect palestinian life yet our government continue to enable and assist the israeli military the uk government must explain why they have issue at least arm licence to israel in the last day british make bomb and weapon kill civilian in gaza the un world health organisation and other have be warn for week that famine   and disease in gaza be start to kill more civilian than bomb and bullet the health system in gaza have be bomb into collapse famine be now in gaza and of the world ’s hungry people be in that tiny enclave israel be use starvation as a weapon of war palestinians be force to eat grass just to survive palestinians in gaza be force to grind animal feed into flour just to survive cut off funding for unrwa the united nations aid organisation for palestine be a death sentence only a fraction of the bare minimum for survival be be allow through in aid israel be bomb rafah where it drive almost the whole population for their suppose safety israel say that it plan a full invasion which would trigger a catastrophe that would dwarf the horror we have see so far 
 the uk government be under an obligation under international law to do everything in their power to stop genocide yet they have not take a meaningful step to do so and they will not even call for an immediate ceasefire to end the devastation we must call for an immediate ceasefire and it be ludicrous that we be engage in collective punishment collective punishment be a war crime forceable transfer and slaughter be war crime we therefore need the motion that the snp have put forward today which call for an end to these war crime and an immediate ceasefire i support it

 what step her department be take to improve rural connectivity 
 what step her department be take to improve rural connectivity 
 what step her department be take to improve rural connectivity 
 what step her department be take to improve rural connectivity 
 we have make huge progress in connect the countryside in only of premise have gigabit capable broadband now it be and the uk be build gigabit network fast than any country in the eu this month we launch another project gigabit contract to connect another rural home the shared rural network be tackle mobile notspot and we have satellite trial for the very hard to reach 
 i be grateful to the minister for all the work that her department be do but my constituent in inkberrow have contact i because they be really concerned that the infrastructure for their much need broadband be be put in use pole in the street rather than underground as they be promise we must upgrade our infrastructure but we must not damage our beautiful countryside in the process so what can she do to support my constituent in inkberrow to ensure that this much need infrastructure be bury underground 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this point and i agree that we want to build underground where possible it be important that she be advocate on behalf of her constituent because we have have issue relate to pole we encourage sharing but that be not always happen it seem to be an issue in particular pocket of the country and we be talk to ofcom about this to see what more we can do 
 it be brilliant to hear about all of this progress what assessment have the minister make of the value for money cap in connect the hard to reach household and business of which i have many in my very rural incredibly beautiful but sparsely populated constituency 
 my hon friend ’s constituency have very low gigabit connectivity partly because its geography make connection very expensive that be why we launch of our very contract in cumbria some premise be go to be connect across copeland and we be try to stretch the contract as far as it will go for premise that will not be reach we will look at other technology so that we can get to they as quickly as possible 
 i work closely with philip burrows denbighshire ’s excellent digital officer he tell i that openreach can still impose significant excess charge to connect property that be declare enable for fibre in those instance people be unable to claim via the gigabit voucher scheme will my hon friend outline what step she be take to address this matter 
 i thank my hon friend for raise the experience of mr burrows who sound like a very experienced officer i would like to hear a bit more detail because it sound like the property he cite have access to a fibre connection and would not be eligible for a voucher i would like to know a bit more about the excess charge so that we can deal with any problem 
 rossett outside wrexham have little to no connectivity despite the ofcom checker predict that it have a good signal this significantly limit resident life ofcom acknowledge that it be a prediction but building digital uk say that because the government rely on this prediction there be little chance of rossett receive any benefit from the share rural network programme what would the minister advise my resident to do 
 my hon friend highlight the challenge i have have in answer this question the mobile connectivity figure i have for her constituency be extremely high this highlight the issue we have with ofcom ’s reporting map which be simply not good enough we have consistently raise this with ofcom and we hope to make progress 
 there have be significant improvement in rural broadband connectivity in northern ireland as a result of our agreement with the previous government will the minister take step to ensure that small business in rural area across the country can far develop themselves by maximise this advantage 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight the fantastic connectivity in northern ireland in fact i think it have some of the very good connectivity in the entire country i will look into any spot that be still not cover and i will happily get back to he 
 i thank the minister for that answer will she outline how rural business can ensure that they have superfast broadband to secure their viability in an increasingly online market 
 i thank the hon gentleman but his business no long want superfast they want gigabit speed and thankfully northern ireland have tremendous gigabit speed if there be any issue particularly with access for small business i be happy to look into they 
 devon county council be spend its broadband clawback money on anything but broadband that £ be intend for improve broadband in rural area include in village such as northleigh resident have encounter numerous pledge on pole but they still do not have full fibre do the minister think the clawback funding for broadband should have be ringfence by devon county council 
 these issue have be highlight many time by conservative members from devon we think we have work through some of those challenge the clawback challenge that the hon gentleman highlight have not previously be raise with i and i will happily look into it for he 
 some people live in rural g notspot rural area be time more likely to have broadband speed bad than those at base camp at everest in poor home have no internet to the home at all and cardiac arrest   phone and medical monitor still rely on analogue telephony interruption why be this government such an abject failure 
 order the house could not hear sir chris bryant—[interruption i will have no suggestion that that be deliberate people may need to speak but can they do so in a quiet voice and allow sir chris to re ask his question 
 let we just stick with the punchline shall we why be this government such an abject failure 
 i know that the hon gentleman love to stick the boot in but he have choose the wrong subject here in there be gigabit coverage whereas the figure now be this be a massive infrastructure project and it be of the big success that we have so he have choose the wrong thing to be snipey about 
 what step her department be take to support research and development in medical technology 
 the uk have an exceptional record of innovation in medical technology there could not be a more exciting time for the sector we be extend the length and quality of human life and solve rare disease with the help of the medical research council ’s £ grant this year 
 the north east have a fantastic life science sector with people work in it and a unique combination of medical and technology asset network and academic expertise however with business investment at record low what be the government do to ensure that our brilliant research and development be transfer into real manufacture job 
 as the hon lady will know the government be invest in medical manufacturing i would be happy to meet she or business in her constituency to make sure that they can access those fund however it be only the good stewardship of our economy that have allow we to continue to invest record amount in research and innovation in the uk 
 what step she be take to ensure that regulator have adequate capacity and co ordination to implement the ai regulatory principle 
 ensure that regulator have the right skill and capability to regulate in their domain be fundamental to the effective delivery of our approach on artificial intelligence regulation to support that we have establish a central co ordination function which will provide regulator with guidance on implement the regulatory principle and help they   to identify emerge risk and challenge the £ funding we have announce to jump start regulator capacity and capability will form a crucial element of this work 
 ai in the uk still lack sufficient regulation despite the pace of change and the risk pose the government state that they expect to introduce 
 a statutory duty on regulator require they to have due regard 
 to the high level principle outline in the ai white paper so will the secretary of state confirm if and when she will legislate for that and what factor will inform her decision 
 the risk of ai be still emerge so the priority of this government be keep pace with those risk to keep the public safe that be why we have an agile sector specific approach utilise our world lead regulator whereas the opposition keep call for legislation on an area they do not understand 
 do the secretary of state agree that important thing about the bletchley conference be that it enable international co operation on interoperability and a common approach do she also agree that that will enable regulator to co operate internationally 
 i absolutely agree with what my right hon and learn friend say and i call it the bletchley effect we have see action take in other nation across the world since our world lead ever ai global summit on safety 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i call the secretary of state

 high salary requirement and visa charge for skilled worker plus impossibly restrictive family visa rule will put the uk out of reach for many early career researcher and scientist what be the secretary of state do to stand up against these crazy home office policy which will make her own department ’s goal for recruit researcher and technician virtually impossible to achieve 
 the uk have fantastic pull power with world lead facility out of the top university and a range of route for people to come here include the very successful global talent visa 
 recently after some storm resident in hanbury and other rural part of my constituency be without broadband for week the problem be fix only when i the local mp get involve what can the minister do to make sure that these provider restore service much more quickly week be a completely unacceptable delay 
 i be sorry to hear of the problem that my hon friend ’s constituent experience telecommunication company be under certain obligation to ofcom to keep network up and run we be test those resilience measure thankfully gigabit broadband be a much more resilient network which have withstand flood in york recently for example but we hope to be able to have a much more resilient network in future 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government ’s ai white paper say that all jurisdiction will need mandatory reporting of frontier ai the united states have already do it the eu have already do it why be the secretary of state wait for a labour government to keep this country safe 
 i will not take any lecture from the opposition when it come to ai we have a plan that be work we be lead the world when it come to ai safety i have speak about the bletchley effect we have the world ’s ever institute do pre deployment testing 
 parent want their child to be safe many parent be deeply concerned about what child be see on their phone do the secretary of state agree that seller of mobile phone should be do much more to verify the age of the user if the phone be be buy for a child the seller should provide the parent with access to and advice on parental control so that parent can help to keep their child safe 
 i absolutely agree with my right hon friend ’s passion when it come to online safety we be lead the world with our comprehensive online   safety act this be a matter on which we both agree and i be more than happy to discuss it far with she

 there be a lot of ongoing work include my conversation with g7 partner i know that the secretary of state be meet with international partner i would welcome a meeting and an update from my hon friend on his conversation at the un and what work be be do there 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday   february 
 the whole house will join i in send our deep condolence to the family of alexei navalny he die for a cause to which he dedicate his whole life freedom to return home know that putin have already try to have he kill be of the most courageous act of our time together with our ally we be consider all option to hold russia and putin to account and this morning we sanction those run the prison where alexei navalny ’s body still lie 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 i know that my right hon friend will share the horror feel by this house the old people ’s assembly in the world at the acid attack against a woman and child on the street of london do he share my anger that we would still have be unable to deport the perpetrator have he be find because of the so call european court of human rights when will we stop bend the knee to this so call european court a travesty of a court 
 this be a horrific attack and my thought be with the victim and their family obviously i can not comment on a live investigation but speak more broadly clearly i do not think that it be right for dangerous foreign criminal to be able to stay in our country that be why our nationality and borders act make it clear that anyone who be convict of a crime and get a sentence of month or more will not be grant asylum in the united kingdom that be the common sense position which i believe be support by the majority of the british public but that the labour party vote against time and time again 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i start by welcome my hon friend the new members for kingswood damien egan and for wellingborough gen kitchen i know that they will both be powerful advocate for their constituent 
 on a more sombre note i join with the prime minister i be glad to hear what he just have to say because i be sure that the whole house will join i in share our disgust at the death of alexei navalny who as the prime minister say die because of his effort to expose the corruption of the putin regime it be a reminder that putin have steal not just the wealth but the future and democracy of the russian people 
 would the prime minister be prepare personally to repeat the allegation make by his business secretary that the former chair of the post office be lie when he say that he be tell to go slow on compensation for postmaster and limp to the next election 
 as the business secretary say on monday she ask henry staunton to step down after serious concern be raise she set out the reason for this and the full background in the house early this week but importantly we have take unprecedented step to ensure that victim of the horizon scandal receive compensation as swiftly as possible and in full make sure that victim receive justice and compensation remain our no priority and we will shortly bring forward legislation to address this matter 
 i be not sure that take we very much far forward so let i press on on monday the business secretary also confirm categorically i will quote this in fairness to the prime minister 
 that the post office be at no point tell to delay compensation payment by either an official or a minister from any government department and that at no point be it suggest that a delay would be of benefit to the treasury”.—[official report   february vol c. 
 that be on monday a note release by the former post office chair this morning appear to directly contradict that i appreciate—[interruption this really matter to the people who have be at the heart of this i appreciate that the business secretary have put the prime minister in a tricky position but will he commit to investigate this matter properly include whether that categorical statement be correct and why rather than take those accusation seriously she accuse a whistleblower of lie 
 it be worth bear in mind that as the business secretary say on monday she ask henry staunton to step down after serious concern be raise however this be on a matter of substance of the great miscarriage of justice in our nation ’s history because people who be work hard serve their community have their life and reputation destroy that be why we be work hard to ensure that they get justice and compensation why we establish sir wyn williams ’s inquiry why we have already pay out over £ of compensation to almost victim and why we will introduce new legislation shortly to exonerate they we will ensure that we do what be need that the truth come to light that we right the wrong of the past and crucially that victim get the justice that they deserve 
 i do hope that the prime minister will instigate that investigation into what be say on monday because of the feature of this miscarriage be that where concern have be raise they have be push to side 
 this week we also learn that a investigation into whether post office branch account could be alter be suddenly stop before it be complete have that investigation reveal that they could be alter which we now know to be the case the livelihood of those wrongly prosecute could have be save what do government ministers know about it at the time 
 the leader of the opposition have pick particular date but it be worth bear in mind that this scandal—[interruption hang on this scandal have unfold over decade and it be follow a landmark high court case that the previous government establish a statutory inquiry lead by sir wyn williams which be uncover exactly what go wrong it be right that that inquiry be allow to do its work also follow the high court case the government establish an independent advisory board and not but different compensation scheme as of now over third of people have receive full and final offer what we be focus on be ensure that victim get the justice and compensation that they deserve 
 this information about have come to light just this week which be precisely why i be ask about it consider that the prime minister ’s foreign secretary be run the government in and of the prime minister ’s current cabinet office ministers be the post office minister have he think to ask either of they what they know in 
 no mr speaker—[interruption we do the right thing which be to set up an independent statutory inquiry that be the right way to resolve this issue it be the right way to get victim the truth and the answer that they demand this government be get on with get they the compensation that they rightly deserve 
 as we all know the horizon scandal leave people isolate their livelihood lose their life ruin some die without ever get the justice that they deserve fear of delay or of cover up be cause they anguish yesterday chris head once accuse by the post office of owe more than £ say this 
 there be a lack of transparency we need to see the correspondence between the post office the department and ukgi because all of this time everything get shroud in secrecy”—[interruption 
 these be his word have some respect please these be victim 
 i appreciate that the inquiry be ongoing but as the prime minister know as do i and the whole house that do not provide a reason why he can not draw a line under this give postmaster such as chris the peace of mind that they need and release all the correspondence that he want to see will he now do so 
 as i say this be of the great miscarriage of justice in our country ’s history i do not think it be that the leader of the opposition ever raise with i during these exchange over the past year but we be work hard to get victim not just the answer but the compensation that they deserve we now have a statutory inquiry lead by sir wyn williams who have the power to get access to all the documentation that he require and to speak to everybody that he need to that be the right and proper way to get the truth that the victim deserve but in the meantime we be not waste a moment to get victim the compensation they deserve the legislation will be before the house shortly 
 in recent decade there have be numerous scandal that have leave public faith in our institution shake and rebuild that confidence will require those affect to see that politician be be honest with they and to believe it just like the postmaster victim of the infected blood scandal have be subject to unimaginable trauma during their search for justice so can the prime minister put their mind at ease and tell the house what undertaking he have give to ensure that the government be not limp to the election on payment that those victim be owe by the british state 
 when it come to the infected blood scandal as i have say before i be acutely aware of the strength of feeling on this issue and the suffering of all those who be impact by that dreadful scandal i give evidence to the inquiry myself last year and as i say then i recognise that thousand have suffer for decade 
 as the leader of the opposition know there be an independent inquiry as this be an incredibly complex issue as he well know the minister for the cabinet office update parliament with the late government position just before the christmas recess he announce that the cabinet office be appoint an expert group of clinical legal and social care expert so that it have the relevant expertise to make informed decision respond to the inquiry ’s recommendation on compensation when they come he also confirm that the department of health and social care will implement a fully bespoke psychological service for people infect and affect we have also commit to provide an update to parliament on next step through an oral statement within sit day of the publication of the final report but i will end where i begin this be a deeply awful scandal and we will do what we need to do to make it right 
 there be a plan for at least single young man who have come here illegally soon to be house just mile from the centre of lincoln at raf scampton in the constituency of my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh)—if home office ministers have their way on top of the huge and rise cost and the recent advice from civil servant to home office ministers to can the plan what reassurance can the prime minister and his home secretary give that scampton will not replicate the scandalous incident that occur in cambridge in when libyan trainee be house at raf bassingbourn 
 my hon friend be right to raise the concern of his constituent i assure he that we want asylum accommodation to have as little impact as possible on the local community i understand that the home office have put a number of measure in place include a specialist security provider work on site and cctv and it be work with the local police as well however i know my hon friend agree with i that the only way to stop this problem fully and ensure that local community be not see the housing of illegal migrant whether that be on large site or in hotel be to have a plan to stop the boat that be what this party and this government do and it be labour that be block we at every step of the way 
 i call the snp leader 
 i begin by echo the sentiment of the prime minister and the leader of the opposition in relation to the heroic bravery of alexei navalny we must all continue to be unite in our opposition to vladimir putin 
 as it stand some of the building in gaza be either damage or destroy much of the farmland be in ruin some people be dead be injure and be currently shelter in rafah await an imminent israeli onslaught surely the prime minister must accept that that do not amount to self defence 
 i share the concern of many member about the high rate of civilian casualty and indeed the grow humanitarian crisis in gaza that be why we have call consistently for an immediate humanitarian pause which would allow for the safe release of hostage and more aid go into gaza so that we create the sustainable condition for a long term and endure ceasefire that be what our diplomatic effort be focus on and that be what i impress upon the israeli prime minister last week when i speak to he 
 tonight this house will have the opportunity to join the majority of the international community and say that enough be enough that the killing in gaza must stop and that the hostage must be release and the good way to do that be to send a clear and united message that we back an immediate ceasefire surely all of we irrespective of our political allegiance can agree on that very issue 
 of course we want to see the fighting in gaza end as soon as possible and never again allow hamas to carry out the appalling terrorist attack that israel be subject to the hon member   talk about the un resolution but just call for an immediate full ceasefire now which collapse back into fighting within day or week be not in anyone ’s interest we must work towards a permanent ceasefire and that be why the right approach be the approach that we have set out and the united states have set out in its resolution which be for an immediate humanitarian pause to get hostage out and aid in so that we then can create the condition for a sustainable ceasefire in the meantime we be do everything we can to increase the amount of humanitarian aid that we bring into gaza something i discuss with the king of jordan last week and we will have more update in the come day of more airdrop into gaza but also just in the last couple of day that have manage to deliver family tent into gaza which be provide much need shelter for very vulnerable people 
 key to the much need regeneration of aylesbury be new link road to cut congestion money from the cancel part of hs2 be mean to be pay towards they that be only right give the destruction be cause by the construction of the part of this unwanted railway but the cash have not arrive yet can my right hon friend assure my constituent they will get the road they need so they can spend less time sit in traffic jam and more time grow the local economy 
 as my hon friend know last autumn we announce the government ’s vision to redirect £ of saving from hs2 to invest in hundred of transport project across the country include possible increase funding for project that i know my hon friend have campaign on tirelessly the south east aylesbury link road and the aylesbury eastern link road i know he have meet the relevant minister on a number of occasion to discuss these proposal and i can tell he that the detail of how these funding uplift will be allocate will be decide very shortly 
 over north sea oil and gas job be at risk from an incoming labour administration and neither labour the tories or the snp have lift a finger to save grangemouth oil refinery from closure with the passing of last night ’s offshore petroleum licensing bill the uk government give not but finger to scotland ’s energy ambition within the uk can the prime minister explain in today ’s money the uk have receive over £ in tax receipt from north sea oil and gas so why can not the uk government find £ to secure grangemouth ’s future and profitability beyond 
 as i have previously tell the house the future of grangemouth be a commercial decision for its owner the site will remain operate as a refinery until at least may the uk and the scottish governments be work together to make sure that there be sufficient assurance in place for the support of employee but when it come to back scottish energy it be this government who just this week have ensure that we can support british north sea oil and gas safeguard job and increase our energy security it be the snp and the labour party that oppose that but we will always back our fantastic north sea economy 
 do the prime minister agree with i and welsh farmer such as gareth wyn jones that our farmer and food security be vital and that the agricultural budget should be ringfence unlike the welsh labour government prop up by plaid who be determined to force our farmer out of business with their approach to nitrate vulnerable zone tb and their new sustainable farming scheme which use the welsh government ’s own analysis be forecast to result in job loss and a £ hit to the welsh economy 
 my hon friend be an excellent campaigner on behalf of her local farming community and i know she have be work hard with gareth wyn jones to raise its voice especially where there be so much concern conservative members be support farmer with more money to grow more british food in contrast with the plan she highlight which would decimate farming community in wales and be the opposite of what be need while we will always back our rural community across the uk labour would take they back to square

 nobody want to see the fighting in gaza go on for a moment long than be necessary and nobody want to see innocent civilian suffer that be why we be do absolutely everything we can to bring about an immediate humanitarian pause allow for the safe release of hostage which the hon gentleman fail to mention i believe and also get more aid into gaza to create the condition for a genuinely sustainable ceasefire that be the position share by our ally that be what our diplomatic effort be focus on and that be what our motion tonight will reflect

 i have not see the detail of those comment and this issue more generally the government have a strong track record of support those with disability it be important that child with special educational need receive the right support in   the right place at the right time we have see funding for sen increase by over this parliament to more than £ most recently the department for education and the department of health and social care be pilot a new project to improve access to specialty support in mainstream primary school because we want to make sure that these child get all the support and opportunity they deserve

 i be happy to look into the issue that the hon lady raise what would be damaging to the north east and the tyne be her party ’s plan to stick with their completely ridiculous decarbonisation target with absolutely no plan to pay for it which just mean high taxis for everyone in her constituency and the country 
 britain ’s food security compromise by cheap foreign import now face a parallel threat all kind of industrialisation of the countryside from large solar plant to interconnector and substation and now huge pylon cover mile of countryside these will blot the landscape and use up valuable grow land fill the fenland big sky know that the prime minister ’s bow burn with gold like my own will he ensure that he join my fight for our green and pleasant land and so make sure that food security and energy security be not competitor 
 my right hon friend raise an excellent point about our food security the government have take step which he have support to protect prime agricultural land from large scale solar development which i know will be warmly welcome our announcement this week at the national farmers union conference also demonstrate our support to increase our country ’s food security back farmer with more funding and enhance their productivity to produce great british food as he know all of that include our green and pleasant land would be put at risk by the labour party which not only do not want to back our farmer but want to impose top down planning target which would concrete over the countryside that he and i both love 
 in december the cabinet minister for women and equalities tell the house that she have engage extensively with lgbt organisation since her appointment month ago a freedom of information answer publish this week reveal that in fact the minister have not meet a single lgbt organisation but have meet fringe group that actively campaign against transgender right what be the problem that the prime minister and a section of his party have with trans people and that his minister have with the truth 
 as i have always say the government have a proud track record of support those in the lgbt community and we will continue to do so i have also always say that those who be question their gender and identity should be treat with the utmost dignity compassion and sensitivity as they consider those question but alongside that it be completely reasonable to highlight the importance of biological sex when it come to those question nobody should be stigmatise or demonise for point out that fact 
 the education committee have hear compelling evidence to support the strengthening of guidance to keep mobile phone out of classroom and break time but over the course of our screen time inquiry we continue to hear deeply disturbing evidence about the risk to young people from too much exposure to social medium too early may i urge the prime minister to seek the swift possible implementation of the online safety act and to consider whether it be time to review the age of digital consent 
 i thank my hon friend for his work on this issue he know that we do have a plan when it come to education and protect child online the secretary of state be make sure that we can implement the online safety act as quickly as possible with ofcom but we have also publish new guidance ban mobile phone in school to minimise disruption and improve behaviour and educational attainment in the classroom crucially we be go beyond that because what our child see online be of the utmost importance to we and we want to make sure that we protect their safety and their mental health 
 when important matter of life and death be vote on in this house do the prime minister think mps should vote accord to their party whip or accord to their conscience 
 this afternoon the house will have an opportunity to consider its approach to the situation in israel and gaza our position be crystal clear we have call and will always call for an immediate humanitarian pause which would allow the safe release of hostage and more aid to go into gaza to create the condition for a genuinely sustainable ceasefire but just call for an immediate full ceasefire now which would collapse back into fighting in day or week would not be in anyone ’s interest we be commit not just to an immediate humanitarian pause but to find a last resolution to this conflict that deliver on the promise of a state solution and ensure that israelis and palestinians can live in the future with dignity and security 
 it seem that with the exception of the british transport police all other police force will treat non contact sex crime as they would perhaps the theft of a bike petty retail crime or antisocial behaviour will the prime minister facilitate a meeting between i colleague and the home secretary to give priority to these act of crime to ensure that woman and young girl get the protection they deserve 
 of course we want woman and girl to get the protection that they deserve and i be pleased that our violence against woman and girl strategy be show result improve the safety on our street and increase sentence for rapist i will make sure that my hon friend get the meeting that he need with the home secretary or relevant police ministers to discuss his concern 
 i hear the prime minister ’s response to the leader of the opposition just like the business secretary ’s claim that delay on compensation be wild baseless allegation his answer be unbelievable the response from the government benches to the quote from my constituent chris head be completely disrespectful the reality be that we would not have any action without the itv serialisation of the sub postmaster scandal government members can shout all they like but we all know that be the case the prime minister have promise a new law to swiftly exonerate and compensate victim today he say shortly so will he commit today to ensure that it be bring forward before the next general election 
 yes the legislation will be bring before the house very very soon 
 after network rail ’s so call signal improvement work there have be traffic chaos and delay at level crossing across egham in fact datum analyse by my team show that in the year to september there be a increase in wait of more than minute from when the barrier go down do my right hon friend agree that this be unacceptable and that network rail need to sort it out 
 i be sorry to hear about the delay face by my hon friend ’s constituent which i know will be disruptive to their life it be important that we have proper connectivity in our local area and   i will ensure that he get the relevant meeting he need to put pressure on network rail to improve the service it be provide

 i express my condolence to danny and ava ’s family and the family of all the young people whose life have be so tragically cut short by knife crime we have plan in place to cut knife crime and they be work we have confiscate over weapon we have cut violent crime in half since and more dangerous criminal be go to jail for long we be bring forward legislation to increase sentence for knife crime and to ban zombie knife and i very much hope that the hon lady and her party will support those proposal when they be put before the house 
 after year of campaigning it be great news that there will be a direct bus link between of my big town in rother valley dinnington and maltby however there be still a lack of bus transport to our local hospital do the prime minister agree that the south yorkshire mayor should use some of his resource to back my plan for transport for the rother valley to ensure that every single village and town have a direct bus link to our local hospital 
 we know how vital bus service be to community right across the country indeed bus be our most popular form of public transportation which be why we have use some of the saving from hs2 to invest in bus service we have cap bus fare at £ right across the country and we have provide my hon friend ’s local authority with million of pound of more funding specifically to support local bus service i join he in call on the mayor to ensure that there be direct bus route to hospital in my hon friend ’s constituency and to make sure that people can see their love one at a distressing time 
 at the weekend the people of south wales march in support of the steel industry follow the government ’s grubby deal with tata which be now place thousand of job at risk in port talbot and beyond the prime minister be fail to protect our steel industry because he fail to   make protect job at the plant a red line he now have a choice work with the union tata and the workforce to protect the industry and the job with investment or walk away and do what tory always do abandon the south wales community yet again which be it prime minister 
 this government have work hard to secure a long term sustainable future for welsh steelmaking and to grow the legacy of that important industry that be why during the pandemic we step in to support celsa which as the hon gentleman know safeguard more than job and ensure that the plant be sustainable it be why we agree of the large ever cash grant of half a pound for tata steel to safeguard at least job that would otherwise have be lose the hon gentleman might want to ask why the welsh labour government do not put in a penny to support that deal 
 the watford area continue to be the proud home of the national lottery which employ more than people will my right hon friend the prime minister and the whole cabinet join i in celebrate the successful handover from camelot to allwyn on   february and also the £ raise by national lottery player which so far have fund project in i be sure every constituency 
 i join my hon friend in his congratulation and thank everyone involve with the national lottery we be all see in our constituency the incredible benefit from the investment that they be make and he be absolutely right to ensure that they receive the praise they deserve today in parliament 
 the prime minister have be at it again in a previous answer he boast about transfer investment from the north of england to the south when he come to manchester in the autumn to insult the people of the north of england and cancel hs2 proudly cancel it be he aware then that because the train have to split without the hs2 line and do not tilt he would be slow down service and reduce capacity do he not know that or do he not care 
 let i say a couple of thing our plan to continue with phase mean that we can handle triple the capacity that be currently be use on the line secondly every penny of the £ from the northern bit of hs2 will stay in the north be invest in service that people use such as local bus and will be deliver quick thirdly the hon gentleman be critical of the decision but i have still not quite figure out labour ’s position on this do they support the redeployment of £ of hs2 saving in transport across the rest of the country or do they not as ever we do not know what they stand for they can not say what they would do and they would just take britain back to square

 on the business and trade committee we trust but verify madam deputy speaker you will be as surprised as i be to hear the following relay in a letter from the canadian high commissioner 
 as far as i be aware since the u.k. announce its pause on january there have be neither negotiation nor technical discussion with respect to any of the outstanding issue 
 canada be a nato ally a commonwealth partner and of our big export market how do we get to the bottom of whether these trade talk be go on in the secretary of state ’s mind or happen in real life 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order and for give notice of it as he know i be not responsible for the accuracy of ministers statement in the house but i be sure again that those on the treasury bench will have hear his remark as chair of the select committee he will have further opportunity to pursue the matter directly with the secretary of state i be pretty sure that be what he intend to do 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker large number of our constituent have come to lobby parliament today because the issue of gaza be so close to their heart only a limited number be be allow into westminster hall even though there be quite a sizeable amount of space so many constituent be be force   to stand out in the rain would it be possible to see what could be do to accommodate more in westminster hall as they come in and filter on the green card system 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order this be obviously a matter that the house authority will be deal with but i will ensure that his comment be feed back to see if anything far can be do i be sure that he will appreciate that large number of people try to gain entrance can inevitably cause some delay and i be sure we be all sorry about that as i say i will feed back his comment 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker later today we will be vote on very sensitive matter that affect the whole house at the start of that debate mr speaker will no doubt announce which amendment if any he will allow to be put to the house when he be elect mr speaker give a solemn promise that he would publish the advice he get from the clerk of the house when he make controversial decision i do not know what he will decide or what his recommendation will be but could you prevail on mr speaker when he come back to the chair to release the advice he be give by the clerk on whatever decision he come to on the amendment to the snp motion we be debate this afternoon 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point of order i be sure that his comment will have be hear and that mr speaker will make his decision in due course with all the comment the hon gentleman have raise about publication i think we will leave it at that 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker i wonder if you could give i some advice my office write to the home secretary more than week ago and we have still not receive a response from he about an issue raise by a constituent it be become increasingly clear that minister be either wilfully refuse to respond to member of parliament or simply rather worryingly just treat member of parliament with sheer contempt what do we do to force ministers to do their duty and respond appropriately to member of this house 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point of order this issue have be raise with the leader of the house at business question and i know she take it very seriously the hon gentleman might like to raise it again on thursday at business question but i have confidence that those on the treasury bench have hear his comment have write they down and will feed they back 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker you will know that yesterday in the house there be an urgent question on border security later on that afternoon it become public that the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration have be sack by the home secretary it be claim that the home secretary lose confidence in the independent chief inspector it be clear from the urgent question yesterday that of   the issue the chief inspector be most exercise by be the report he have lodge with the home office since april which have not be publish the agreement with the chief inspector be that report he submit to the home office should be publish within week clearly a number of those report be well overdue have you madam deputy speaker have any indication from ministers about whether they be plan to come to the house to make a statement about mr david neal and the fact that he be sack yesterday afternoon more importantly what have happen to the report the independent chief inspector have lodge since april last year many of which be on important issue 
 far to that madam deputy speaker there be an issue about the government introduce legislation which this house be very concerned about on the rwanda policy and asylum seeker be move to rwanda to have their claim process with the lack of anyone now in the role of the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration that will mean there be no independent oversight or scrutiny at a time when a major policy decision will be implement by the government the home affairs committee be particularly concern by any delay we see in the times a report that it will be to month before an new independent chief inspector of borders and immigration be appoint can you advise on the good way forward 
 i thank the right hon lady for her point of order she raise a number of point i have not receive any notification that a statement be forthcoming she do refer to an urgent question yesterday i know the right hon lady regularly attend business question and this may be something she might like to press the leader of the house on those on the treasury bench have hear what she have have to say and will feed it back i be sure that in her role as chair of the home affairs committee she may have other mean to pursue the issue she have raise in particular in respect of report that she may be able to ask for but she will possibly know more than i about that 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker a year ago tomorrow i raise with the prime minister a really   important point about the payment of a fine to the eu of £ follow that question to he i write to the prime minister ask for an explanation a year on i have not have a reply i would have think it would be in the interest of all in this house to understand how it be that a payment of £ be pay as a fine for late payment to the eu it be in our interest to understand what happen so be there any recourse i can take to understand what happen 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point of order again i do not have responsibility for answer give it may well be that he could pursue the matter through further question to the table office again those on the treasury bench will have hear what he have have to say and i very much hope that they will feed back this rather long list of message to the government 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker—[interruption

 thank you very much madam deputy speaker on the treasury committee we have be consider the work of uk government investments across a range of issue we have now get to a situation where quite complex decision which appear to have be refer to at board meeting of the post office be obtuse to we i wonder give that the disagreement between ministers and representative from ukgi who be on the board of the post office be very obtuse and hard to unravel whether you have any advice on how we can bring these important issue to the floor of the house 
 the hon lady be a senior member of the treasury committee again we have note what she have say and it will be feed back but she might like to pursue the issue either through the treasury committee or even perhaps by talk to the chair of the business and trade committee   the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne who i know be look at this at the moment 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to make provision about licence authorise the driving of motor vehicle of certain class and for connected purpose 
 the principal purpose of the bill be to reform regulation 5(2 of the motor vehicles driving licences regulations these be eu rule that be put into uk law and reduce the number of vehicle that could be drive after pass a general motoring licence test so call grandfather right be maintain for people like i who have pass their driving test prior to to continue to be able to drive certain category of vehicle include minibus and medium sized good vehicle which fall under the category d1 and c1 in particular i be seek reform to our driving licence so that the c1 and d1 category be automatically give to everybody who have pass a driving test for a car in the same way that happen for those of we who pass our test before 
 this opportunity a brexit bonus to reform drive licence regulation that be put in place thank to our membership of the eu be motivate by my intention to support rural community and secondly unlock economic growth opportunity i recently raise this issue in the house in a debate on   january   and give notice then of my intention to seek to change the law other hon member voice their support for a change focus in particular on community transport and the d1 category i do not seek to repeat everything i say in that debate but since then the community transport association and other have contact i to voice their full support for a change in the law 
 this whole issue come to my attention when i visit halesworth area community transport in my constituency and be tell about its challenge in get more driver to drive a van or minibus for that non for profit organisation as it then be people have to pay between £ and £ to do a course and pass a test to acquire a d1 licence due to the regulation the problem be reinforce when i visit the voluntary help centre in southwold where i be tell a similar story when i go to see the then transport minister i be tell that they be eu regulation and that there be absolutely no way we could change they for as long as we be part of the eu 
 the community transport association have give i further example include bexhill community bus which state 
 we be a small community bus operator and we rely on person with d1 on their licence we be face a future when cat b driver lose the automatic right to drive a mini bus and would face the expense of train all new volunteer driver 
 change life together an organisation in cheshire that support a change in the law say 
 this be very much need and we be recruit from a small pool of people every year and it be cause real problem across our area 
 this issue be particularly challenge for community transport association that help people with disability in their daily life that be recognise in the government ’s national disability strategy and there be a commitment from the department for transport to help tackle shortage in community transport driver it be clear that there be a real need for reform in order to make it easy to acquire a d1 licence to support community transport venture and our rural community and to avoid lose such service or turn they into exclusively pay service 
 i turn to the benefit of reform c1 licence which be for medium sized good vehicle not heavy good vehicle these be the kind of vehicle use to do a lot of local delivery job but the licence also apply to horse box and vehicle such as ambulance open up this category perhaps with some condition such as a minimum age of or have hold a drive licence for or more year would provide an instant economic boost without a cost to the government and help productivity in the supply chain 
 in recent year we have experience a shortage of hgv driver due to a number of factor particularly during covid of the reason why there have be a shortage be that hgv driver start switch to job use medium sized vehicle for which they be automatically qualified by hold an hgv licence the department introduce some sensible temporary measure to help address the shortage as an aside the cost of acquire a c1 licence be typically between £ and £ which be similar to the d1 licence apprenticeship course be available for hgv drive qualification allow business to use their apprenticeship levy funding but there be not for secure a c1 drive licence i have be inform that previous attempt to secure have be reject as it be not consider that a month course and practical experience be need to gain the qualification 
 within government i try to persuade the department for transport to look at this opportunity and i be delighted when it issue a call for evidence in august as the then minister my hon friend   the member for lincoln karl mccartney write in its foreword 
 the licensing improvement 
 those regard hgv driver to which i refer early 
 be achievable partly due to the fact that we have leave the european union and have the freedom to change our legislation to improve our testing and licensing regime the call for evidence include seek evidence on the economic benefit of widen the recruitment pool for medium sized good vehicle and minibus driver which may attract more people to the industry and support economic growth by far strengthen our supply chain 
 there be exceptionally strong support for the change to both c1 and d1 licence and i particularly commend the submission make by the community transport association on d1 licence business also give very strong support to the c1 change cite significant economic advantage the reason give include that it would be much more efficient to run a single trip in a tonne van than to be restrict to multiple trip as it would require few journey to transport the good in essence it would mean few vehicle on the road and few trip that be good news for the economy and for the environment in the same summary though it be pretty clear that the department do not want to make any change which disappoint i but as be   self evident i have not give up as i think these simple change would both bring economic growth and be hugely beneficial for rural community 
 i be aware that the east of england ambulance service be hinder in get new driver to drive ambulance due to the delay in c1 assessment despite their already undertake advanced driver training the blue and two as it be know for emergency vehicle i be pleased to say that that have be rectify but there be a barrier far while i be in the mood for sensible reform through this bill we should consider the economic benefit of extend the lifetime of drive licence which due to eu law be currently year for a car and year for several other vehicle include horse box that feel unnecessarily burdensome and a change would benefit not only in the cost of processing but in the cost to driver across the country 
 i know that the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend   the member for hexham guy opperman   be listen hard to these proposal for reform and i welcome the discussion we have have i suggest to the government that such reform would be exceptionally popular with community transport association across the country and with business large and small 
 i understand the issue around safety drive test have become considerably more difficult since i pass my test but i think there be a way to address some of the concern raise by certain campaign group i be aware that the government sign up to the vienna convention in although these regulation be already in place and indeed we have apply various reservation to the convention so as not to disrupt our common sense practice in this country for instance we do not have to wait for the green light to cross the road at a pedestrian crossing when no traffic be come in either direction which as we know be a criminal offence in other country in europe 
 i believe that this be a real opportunity to adopt some sensible approach that as i say would be welcome across the house the bill would be a brexit bonus increase community transport and remove an unnecessary costly barrier for business recognise the strengthening of the drive test in the past year we should have the confidence to back british driver with british rule i would like to work with the government during the passage of the bill to a reading and i commend it to the house 
 before i call sir chris bryant may i gently remind he that he have to give a speech in opposition to the bill i take it that the hon gentleman wish to speak in opposition 
 mr deputy speaker i be very grateful for your remind i that i have to speak in opposition to the legislation but give that the government themselves oppose the bill as the right hon member have just point out i presume that the government will be oppose it as well this afternoon 
 while i commend the right hon lady for her diligence as a back bencher in introduce a series of minute rule bills over the last year for instance last year she introduce the schools gender and parental rights bill which fall at the hurdle because it do not get a   reading with people vote no and vote aye we have the same right to oppose her bill today if we think that it be not appropriate relevant or necessary she refer to the fact that she consider this to be—[interruption 
 order other members may not wish to hear the hon gentleman but i do and i need to know whether he be in order if hon member want to have private conversation it would be helpful if they could either have they outside or keep quiet 
 i be grateful mr deputy speaker 
 my main objection to the bill be that the right hon lady seek to make this a brexit bonus as she refer to it i disagree with that very concept because i believe that regulatory convergence rather than regulatory divergence be more useful both so that british driver know where they stand in this country and other country in europe and so that european driver be able to drive in the uk of course there be other area where there might be brexit bonus because we might trade with other country elsewhere in the world but when it come to drive licence specifically the only other country that we be likely to deal with be those within the european union 
 i believe i think the government do too because so far the department for transport have refuse to budge in the direction that the right hon lady suggest that this be an inappropriate bill that would do harm rather than good it would not lead to great safety but actually imperil safety in the uk 
 we sign up to the vienna convention in exemption be allow under the vienna convention in a previous speech on this matter the right hon lady point out that of the exemption that we have introduce relate to when you can cross the road in the uk when a traffic light seem to suggest that you can not under the vienna convention we would not normally be able to do that but we have be able to amend it so there be an argument which the right hon lady have not make that this legislation be not necessary to achieve the end that she be try to achieve 
 the right hon lady also refer to the fee of between £ and £ she make the legitimate point that some charity would like to be able to use minibus which when they be fully load go over the tonne limit and that the £ to £ fee be a significant that can impede they in do the work that we all want they to do however that matter be in the power of government without any need for legislation 
 a further point be that the government have consult on this measure as the right hon lady say but have decide not to proceed it would be useful if the government be able to tell we why they have not choose to proceed my suspicion be that it be because they believe that this measure would not be safe 
 the right hon lady say that she want to extend the length of time for which a licence be provide that would clearly be in direct contravention of the vienna convention presently it be set at year and i personally think that that be the safe way to ensure that every driver on the road in this country have a valid driving licence that be up to date and have the correct address on it and that the person be properly insure i be sure   many of we have come across case in our constituency in which people have be financially disadvantaged because the crash they be involve in be with somebody who do not have a proper driving licence perhaps because it be out of date and they be not properly insure the right hon lady ’s measure would drive a coach and horse through that if you will forgive the pun mr deputy speaker 
 another issue be that in recent year we have have a significant problem with get enough hgv driver in the uk i believe that this measure would make that substantially more difficult add cost to business up and down the country it would make it more difficult because many of the present hgv driver on british road be not british they be of other nationality if we have a separate set of regulation for the uk completely separate from the rest of the european union it would make it more difficult for business to do their work and create an additional layer of regulatory burden which be a cost to business 
 my final point be that there be private member bill list on the order paper that will be call for reading on   february   march   march   or   march all of which be before the final date for call a general election on   may i do not think that a single of they will enter the statute book there be actually in the name of member call christopher and i feel rather leave out that not of they come from myself the serious point be that we keep put more bills on to the order paper but not put they on to the statute book because we still have a system for minute rule bills and private member bills that be completely and utterly bust the procedure committee have say time and again that we be bring the whole process into disrepute and that be why we should not be add yet another minute rule bill to the order paper when we have no intention of put it on the statute book i therefore urge all hon member to vote against the measure today 
 question put standing order no 
 the house proceed to a division 
 will the serjeant at arm investigate the delay in the no lobby 
 the house have divide ayes noes 
 question accordingly negative 
 we now come to the scottish national party motion on gaza i understand that the motion on the order paper will not be move today 
 this be a highly sensitive subject on which feeling be run high in the house in the nation and throughout the world i think it be important on this occasion that the house be able to consider the wide possible range of option i have therefore decide to select the amendment both in the name of the prime minister and in the name of the leader of the opposition 
 because the operation of   standing order no   would prevent another amendment from be move after the government have move their amendment i will exceptionally call the opposition front bench spokesperson to move their amendment at the beginning of the debate once the snp spokesperson have move their motion at the end of the debate the house will have an opportunity to take a decision on the official opposition amendment if that be agree to there will be a final question on the main motion as amend 
 if the official opposition amendment be not agree to i will call the minister to move the government amendment formally that will engage the—[interruption order i be go to finish that will engage the provision of   standing order no so the next vote will be on the original word in the snp motion if that be not agree to the house will have the opportunity to vote on the government amendment proceed in this way will allow a vote to take place potentially on the proposal from each of the main party 
 i can inform the house—[interruption just let i finish i can inform the house that there be a precedent for an official opposition spokesperson be call in the debate and move an amendment before—[interruption order do somebody want to leave i be determined to finish i can inform the house that there be a precedent for an official opposition spokesperson be call in the debate and move an amendment before a minister have be call to speak in the debate in that circumstance however no government amendment have be table 
 i should also inform the house that the clerk of the house will be place in the library a letter to i about today ’s proceeding i have ask for that letter to be make available in the vote office as soon as possible 
 finally i should tell the house that in my opinion the operation of   standing order no which govern the way amendment to opposition day motion be deal with reflect an outdated approach—[interruption order member will be go and not be vote 
 bring back bercow 
 that be the to leave then 
 bring back bercow 
 if you want to do it 
 finally i should tell the house that in my opinion the operation of   standing order no which govern the way amendment to opposition day motion be deal with reflect an outdated approach that restrict the option that can be put to the house it be my intention to ask the procedure committee to consider its operation 
 i now call brendan o’hara to move the motion 
 on a point of order mr speaker i appreciate what you have outline but i seek your advice because obviously i have take advice from the clerks this be the snp ’s opposition day and the purpose of an opposition day be for our party to have the ability to put forward our business we have already have a significant delay to the moving of this motion which have significant interest to the extent that we have drop our motion now we appear to be do thing completely in a way that they have never be do before may i ask for your advice what be the point of an opposition day if it be go to be do like this applause 
 let i just say that i think you will want to vote at some point and clapping be not go to assist it 
 rise 
 a point of order have be raise by the snp chief whip as i say i have make a judgment on a precedent it have be do before i have view it in that way and that be my ruling i be go to stand by the ruling and i be not take any more point of order i call brendan o’hara 
 on a point of order mr speaker 
 i be not take any more point of order mr linden i call brendan o’hara 
 i beg to move 
 that this house call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza and israel note with shock and distress that the death toll have now rise beyond the vast majority of whom be woman and child further note that there be currently palestinians shelter in rafah of whom be child also note that they have nowhere else to go condemn any military assault on what be now the large refugee camp in the world further call for the immediate release of all hostage take by hamas and an end to the collective punishment of the palestinian people and recognise that the only way to stop the slaughter of innocent civilian be to press for a ceasefire now 
 our motion call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza from all combatant i wish to put on record once again our unequivocal condemnation of the hamas attack of   october and to repeat our call both for the immediate release of all the hostage and for see those involve in those atrocity call to account for their action the war in gaza be of the great define moment of our time yet until today this house have not be give the opportunity to debate both the unfold human catastrophe and the wide implication for regional and global stability nor have    we have the opportunity to debate the urgent and press need for an immediate ceasefire as an essential step in find a lasting and just peace
