i thank my hon friend for his speech and for highlight the gap that exist in local government i be sure he will recognise that as the local government association and the national housing federation have say only of local authority have the capacity at the moment in fact it could be far less do he agree that that be a real concern 
 i refer hon member to my entry in the register of interest 
 at his prime minister ’s question time in july last year i ask the prime minister to reassure my constituent that they would have a meaningful say over the new development in the green belt in their area he say that the government will work with communities”—but this bill could not be far from that promise we be see housing target go through the roof in rural area as green belt protection be remove in my local council of east herts and broxbourne the target be go up by more than and within broxbourne district specifically they be almost double the loss of protection for unrestricted sprawl around the village i represent be extremely worrying for my constituent who live in those village of brickenden hertford heath great amwell stanstead abbotts and st margarets as their unique character and historical charm could be lose forever 
 at the same time target be go down in london where there be the infrastructure to cope the plan do not add up there be something in this bill on which i can agree with the government the explanatory note state that limited infrastructure delivery be a real cost on the life of work people i completely agree it be far too common for new housing to be build without the increase in public service capacity to match 
 the comptroller of his majesty ’s household report to the house that the address of   march pray that his majesty will re appoint dame elan closs stephens as an electoral commissioner with effect from   march   for the period end on   march be present to his majesty who be graciously pleased to comply with the request 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to improve housing for military personnel and their family 
 what step he be take to improve the quality of accommodation for service family 
 on behalf of the house i would like to mark the passing of group captain john paddy hemingway the last survive battle of britain pilot of those strikingly few brave young man who turn the tide of the war and keep our nation safe from nazi invasion 
 the fire sale of military family home by conservative ministers in be probably the bad privatisation ever the government be pay £ a day to rent back the home and then pay all the repair cost with no power to plan or to do the major upgrade need we buy back force home in january we start the defence housing review in february and we aim to publish our housing plan in the summer 
 i thank my right hon friend for that response the man and woman of our armed force perform the ultimate public service they and their family make considerable sacrifice to keep all of we in the uk safe and secure do he agree that the least we owe our servicemen and woman be decent housing that they can proudly call home 
 my hon friend be right the sacrifice that those who serve in uniform make to keep we all safe be exceptional the least that their family deserve be a decent home it be after all the heart of all our life the step we have take with the buy back of the annington home be a decisive break with the past and we will now put in place the necessary plan to upgrade force family home for the future 
 the ministry of defence own more than house in the former arborfield garrison in my constituency only a handful of they be occupy by service family the remainder be let privately but increasingly they be be leave vacant which with the estate not be maintain be affect the life of constituent i be tell that no decision can be take on the future of the site until a housing strategy be complete can the mod make an early decision on the arborfield housing to stop the neglect and return much need affordable housing to the market 
 if the hon gentleman write to i with the specific i will certainly look into that he set out for the house the character of some of the neglect and decline that we have see in our force housing for so long and the bind that previous government have be in without the power or control to make the upgrade and plan for wholesale renewal for the future that be what our housing review will start to fix we can not fix these deep seat long run problem overnight but we be determined to do well than we have do in the past 
 can the secretary of state reassure force family in north durham that the labour government be end the previous conservative government ’s fail approach of paper over the crack and be instead take action to deliver new high quality family home for our service personnel over the year to come 
 i can indeed my hon friend and i stand on a manifesto on which we be elect as a government that commit to end the scandal of force family home the buy back that we have put in place be the start of deliver on that promise for armed force family and deliver as we be do on a number of front for defence 
 the litany of complaint i receive from service family in accommodation in gosport include damp black mould unsafe electrical wiring and waste water flow into home constituent write to i that 
 the overall condition of our flat be unfit for purpose unhygienic and quite frankly a threat to our safety 
 this have be go on for decade under successive government and our service people and their family quite simply deserve well what i want to know from the secretary of state on behalf of my constituent be when we will begin to see tangible difference pinnacle and vivo be not fit for purpose when will we see they replace with an organisation that can do those repair and do they properly i invite he to visit gosport to see some of that appalling service family accommodation for himself 
 the hon lady be right it be shameful her government have year to fix the problem we be now do that job we have a policy in place that mean that no should be let a home with apparent damp and mould problem there be a special dedicated report line for those problem and if they be severe service family should be offer alternative accommodation the defence housing review which be now under way and will report in the summer will set out plan for a long term overhaul of these deep seat problem which be overdue and have be neglect 
 what step he be take to ensure that uk military aid be adequate to meet ukraine ’s capability requirement 
 as a new government we step up and speed up the delivery of uk military aid to ukraine this year the uk will provide £ in military support the high ever sum we be fully behind president trump ’s pledge to bring a last peace to ukraine and we want to see success in today ’s talk but we will not jeopardise the peace by forget about the war 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for his answer over the weekend president trump ’s special envoy dismiss the prime minister ’s plan for an international force to support the ceasefire in ukraine call it 
 a posture and a pose 
 whatever the wisdom of those remark do the secretary of state see a future in which uk force could deploy on peacekeeping operation in ukraine without a us security guarantee 
 as the chief of the defence staff say over the weekend no should doubt that the work that the uk be lead with france to pull together a coalition of nation willing to step in and help ensure last peace in any negotiate settlement in ukraine be critical and substantial the uk be determine and will lead that effort 
 this year the uk be provide ukraine with more financial aid through military support than at any time since putin ’s illegal invasion do the secretary of state agree that it be crucial to wide european security and to our own security here in the uk that we continue to support ukraine and ramp up the pressure on putin 
 i do indeed put the ukrainians in the strong possible position as they choose to go into discussion be part of the responsibility and commitment of this government we plan very closely with ukraine the support we provide and our plan to support ukraine have be develop with the ukrainians and reflect what they need most drone air defence and ammunition that be why this month the prime minister announce a £ deal to supply more than lightweight multi role missile for air defence that be build in the uk both back the ukrainians in their fight and boost british job and business 
 in this age when the plot of the manchurian candidate appear more like a documentary on us politic than a work of fiction have the government receive any indication that their effort militarily to support ukraine would be actively oppose or block by the trump administration 
 the prime minister have make it clear that in the context of a negotiate peace the security arrangement or guarantee in ukraine will need us support i have make the same point strongly in my discussion with secretary hegseth as defence secretary my job now be to put ukraine in the strong possible position by continue level of uk military aid encourage other nation to do more and develop alongside the french plan for multinational support to maintain the long term security of any peace in ukraine 
 rochdale ’s ukrainian community be fervently proud of what the prime minister have do in recent week and not just on the diplomatic front but with the record support for ukraine militarily do the secretary of state agree that it be important to call out the russian lie and propaganda that have be propagate of late include the lie that somehow ukraine be not a real country but a fake country and to call out the lie that britain ’s security do not also depend on ukraine ’s security 
 my hon friend be right the line of defence for the uk and for europe be in ukraine the ukrainians share our value and be fight with huge courage military and civilian alike it be our job to stand with they during that fight to safeguard their future and their ability to make their own decision as a country if and when they go into the negotiation we will stand with they then and we will stand with they after a negotiate peace which we all hope president trump be capable of securing 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i associate the opposition with the secretary of state ’s remark about paddy hemingway the last of the few to whom we owe so much 
 on the potential peacekeeping force for ukraine we have hear from the secretary of state that it be jointly british and french in fact in every of his answer he stress the amount of work we be do with france be it therefore not extraordinary that at the very same time france should be work to undermine our defence industry by have we exclude from a £ european defence fund which will include other non eu state 
 the hon gentleman be clearly a glass half empty type of guy the european union when it produce its defence and security white paper last week set in place specific arrangement for any nation such as the uk that strike a defence and security partnership with the european union that be exactly what we go to the country with promise to undertake that as a uk government any country with a partnership in place then potentially have access to those sort of programme and that sort of funding and that be what we will try to negotiate for this country and our industry 
 i can assure the secretary of state that i be full bifta behind our armed force and the uk defence industry be not the point that we provide our nuclear deterrent unconditionally to european nato country our army be in estonia defend europe ’s eastern flank and we have do more than any other european nation to support ukraine will the secretary of state and the prime minister stand up to president macron and stress to he that this be the bad possible time to prioritise fishing right over europe ’s collective security 
 i just ask the hon gentleman to drop that brexit rhetoric we be lead effort with the french government and the french military to meet the challenge of the us and the requirement of ukraine to have a coalition of country willing to stand with ukraine in the context of a negotiate peace to help they secure endure stability and deterrence to prevent russia re invade that sovereign country 
 what step he be take to ensure that veteran receive adequate support after leave the armed force 
 what step he be take to ensure that veteran receive adequate support after leave the armed force 
 i have always say that we train people to join the military and to be in the military but we do not necessarily train they to be a civilian after they leave that be why this government have take swift action to support veteran upon leave last month i launch operation ascend which will help veteran thrive into post service career our hugely successful career transition partnership have now see of all veteran leave straight into employment since october we have extend national insurance contribution relief from april for employer who recruit veteran on top of that this government have award £ in veteran housing grant i be a firm believer that over the past year we do not take enough responsibility for support our veteran and plan that we will unveil in the future will take a step in the right direction to improve that 
 i recently visit the heyford and bicester veteran group in my constituency which be set up by ian ridley to support fellow veteran throughout the region this fantastic initiative bring together a range of service from charity the nhs and local authority to support veteran however when speak to ian i be amazed to discover that the group receive no funding from the mod and that veteran in our region be not signpost to its service when they leave the armed force i therefore invite the minister to visit the group with i and see the work that it do so that we can discuss how to make it more routine for service such as those that it offer to be make available to our fantastic veteran 
 i thank all the people most of whom be probably volunteer who be support veteran in the hon member ’s constituency day ago i visit another tri service veteran hub that be deliver i think exactly the same type of service we often find that while there be a great deal support out there it be difficult for veteran to navigate the process of find the right place and we be work on plan to help they with that 
 harrogate be a proud armed force town and the location of the army foundation college and menwith hill and catterick be nearby north yorkshire as a whole play an important part for our armed force veteran in my constituency have tell i that they often move back there after posting throughout their career but they then have problem access housing through the local authority what conversation be the minister have with local government colleague to ensure that local authority have a well understanding of how to listen to what veteran say about the adaptation they need 
 as the hon member know very well access to social and affordable housing be a severe problem across the country we work with many council explain to they the covenant as a whole and the need for veteran to be fast track op fortitude be a prime example there have be referral and veteran have be put into housing in a relatively short time i would like to connect the hon member with that operation to ensure that we can point any veteran who need such support in the right direction 
 i visit richard a veteran in his home provide by the derventio housing trust the trust base in derby offer home for people without they include those who have serve in our armed force volunteer from derventio recently renovate a house in the city specifically for veteran do the minister agree that such support be vital and will he tell we what the government be do to help with the provision of housing care and support for our veteran in need 
 i congratulate the individual in that trust on support the veteran in my hon friend ’s constituency i have visit many different part of the uk and observe the phenomenal volunteer support that veteran often have to rely on we want to establish a structure that will focus that support and also direct veteran to the help that they need more quickly and effectively and we will unveil our plan in due course 
 will the minister meet i and other member of the all party parliamentary group for the armed force to discuss roll out the good practice of some fire authority to give those who have serve our country automatic interview for relevant role in the public sector it be a brilliant idea that would really benefit my constituent and i think that all those who have go above and beyond to serve our country should be serve by all of we upon their return 
 that be a great initiative service beyond service be something that we should be promote and i will take that as good practice have a look at it and see   whether we can roll it out across the nation so that when people leave the military they can secure at least a interview for a role in the fire service the police the nhs or any other public service 
 i call the shadow minister 
 veteran who serve in northern ireland will no doubt welcome the veterans minister ’s decision suggest by the shadow defence secretary that the mod should judicially review the recent coroner ’s verdict regard the shooting of several ira terrorist at clonoe well do i say but why not go far to protect veteran and drop the plan to revoke large part of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act which would only serve to facilitate yet more inquest of this type 
 the right hon member make an important point have visit northern ireland just week ago i share the concern of many veteran who have serve in northern ireland particularly concern about the misinterpretation of the challenging context in which many of these inquest and inquiry be take place i remind member on both side of the house that not so long ago in the 70 80 and 90 there be major explosion in every major city in the united kingdom and assassination across the uk killings be a regular event in northern ireland and we send our service personnel there to protect peace save life and indeed prevent a civil war 
 the minister mention both side of the house revoke the legacy act would encourage a system of tier justice for our army veteran and another for alleged ira terrorist include those give so call letter of comfort by the blair regime with many of those veteran have serve in proud regiment that traditionally recruit from red wall northern constituency why should a labour government assist gerry adams to sue the british taxpayer how be that support those who serve their country valiantly on operation banner 
 let we be absolutely clear the right hon gentleman be look at an individual who serve his country on operation banner so i understand the issue for all our veteran and i have be work very hard with the northern ireland office to make sure that veteran welfare and legal service be provide so that anyone involve in any of the investigation get the support they require and that we can minimise the impact on what be quite a unique group of elderly veteran 
 what step he be take to strengthen the uk ’s defence against threat to undersea   infrastructure 
 what step he be take to strengthen the uk ’s defence against threat to undersea   infrastructure 
 we be committed to maintain and enhance the security and resilience of critical undersea infrastructure just as the defence secretary call out the activity of the russian spy ship yantar hover over our undersea cable let those who threaten the uk or our ally be in no doubt that we will defend our undersea infrastructure this be area that the strategic defence review be look at in order to enhance our homeland security 
 in january i ask the defence secretary which single minister be responsible for the security of offshore infrastructure we know that russia and china target interconnector and undersea cable we know that russia place listen device on our wind turbine to monitor submarine and we know that china control the tech in the turbine that the energy secretary want to buy the defence secretary could not answer i in january and neither do the prime minister when i ask he early this month when be we go to find out who be actually in charge 
 there be no doubt in my mind that the prime minister be responsible for the security of this nation and he delegate different area to different department that be a completely normal way of deal with our national security let we be absolutely clear within defence we take this seriously and we work with colleague across department to make sure that we be not only secure our infrastructure from a defence perspective but use our trade route to make sure that we be protect and buy the right technology and use our planning system to make sure that where there be development it do not impinge on our national security 
 the minister will be well aware that of internet traffic be carry on undersea cable clearly the russians and other enemy would seek to disrupt that so will the minister look at utilise autonomous minesweeper that could be deploy to protect our undersea cable in particular will he commit to look at introduce they in the black sea if there be a truce between russia and ukraine so that those cable be protect as well that be part of the nato infrastructure 
 the hon gentleman be right that subsea fibre optic cable carry about of our datum many people believe it be satellite but it be cable as a country we be invest in new technology and i expect that as we get far towards the time when the defence review be publish he will see the ambition we have as a government to invest more in autonomous system not only to support undersea cable protection but to deal with the threat of russian submarine and other capability and other threat to our nation we will ensure that we invest in our defence capability and in support those people who serve as well 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 with escalate threat to our critical infrastructure i be concern by report over the weekend that our armed force chief be apparently be gag over the upcoming strategic defence review which have be describe by some as limp i be fully aware that recognise the danger   the government have announce the large increase in defence spending since the end of the world war but at this critical time we certainly should not be sideline our service chief or penny pinch on our nation ’s defence would the minister like to take this opportunity to reassure the nation that our strategic defence review when publish will be bold ambitious and anything but limp 
 absolutely we live in incredibly difficult time which be why this government be meet the moment with increase defence spending and the big reform of our defence in year we be invest in new technology and invest in the people who keep our country safe from the most senior general and admiral down to private and sailor we be give all our armed force a renew determination to make sure they understand how we defend our country in its good interest but also that the nation back they in defend our country there be further announcement to come but let we all be in no doubt but that the whole house back our armed force and that we look forward to the further investment in defence that be come 
 i welcome the uk ’s leadership on this issue the propose aquind interconnector raise serious concern about the security of uk undersea infrastructure particularly give the significant political donation make by its owner to various conservative politician far to the question ask by my hon friend   the member for slough mr dhesi will the minister confirm that protect domestic security will be a central focus of the sdr 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question i recently meet a cross party delegation include the labour mps for portsmouth my hon friend the members for portsmouth north amanda martin and for portsmouth south stephen morgan)—and the conservative mp for fareham   the right hon and learn member for fareham and waterlooville suella braverman to talk about the aquind interconnector it be part of a planning decision be take by the department for energy security and net so it be difficult for i to comment on but let i be absolutely clear that we take defend our underwater infrastructure very seriously and we will continue to make decision that support its defence 
 what step he be take to protect female member of the armed force from sexual   harassment 
 over the last year i have have the absolute privilege of work with amazing servicewoman across the armed force and also with woman in the police the nhs and of course our intelligence service there be no place for unacceptable behaviour in defence absolutely no place at all and the woman who choose to serve deserve well 
 this government be take action just last week i announce the launch of the long call for tri service complaint unit which will sit outside the chain of command the single service will therefore not be   able to nor be perceive to be able to mark their own homework i be work across government in particular with the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for pontypridd alex davies jones and the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips on set up a defence violence against woman and girl taskforce just week ago i meet the women ’s network and i have also sit on the raising our standards panel of those from across trade and other organisation the purpose of which be to really criticise we and pull forward any lesson learn from broad society 
 i thank the minister for his response and for the work he have do the armed force continuous attitude survey report that of female personnel have experience sexual harassment in service during the prior month and many woman have say they would not report an incident due to fear of the consequence the recently announce tri service scheme be welcome but what step be he take to make it genuinely independent to ensure woman ’s confidence in the scheme and their safety while serve in the armed force 
 there be principal element the tri service complaint system sit outside the chain of command and when certain issue hit a threshold they will be take away from the single service so the system will be completely independent the be the violence against woman and girl taskforce that we have create which will work directly to i it will be a small team at my level but it will have tentacle right down into the single service it will provide a safe space for woman to go to if they want to raise an issue or a complaint which can then be transfer into the complaint system or indeed in parallel all the way up to i so that i can take action directly 
 i thank the minister and i welcome the measure announce last week my constituent in monmouthshire and people across wales would be interested to hear more from the minister about the new violence against woman and girl taskforce and the regional and national champion how will they ensure that everyone who serve in the armed force can do so in safety 
 i refer my hon friend to my answer to the last question the violence against woman and girl taskforce be take good practice from the rest of government and ensure that it be replicate in defence but it be actually go step far and put a structure in place as i always say i be very young when i join the marines and i be catch up in this hierarchical situation where do you go to make a complaint you do not actually have anywhere to go to make a complaint the taskforce will provide a safe space so that if people want to pop out of the chain of command to highlight a concern it can be elevate quickly and deal with rapidly 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i welcome the creation of the violence against woman and girl taskforce which be an important step towards enable complaint to be hear and address outside the chain   of command and i thank my hon friend   the member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke   for raise this important issue like the taskforce the government have commit to a new veteran strategy focus specifically on the experience of woman who have leave the service will the minister outline the timescale for the development and implementation of that strategy give how vital it be that woman come and serve in the armed force and that they feel safe and secure in do so 
 as part of our future veteran strategy a woman veteran annexe will provide specific guidance on female want to leave the armed force it be also important to mention that we be not just set up the violence against woman and girl taskforce we have the sexual harassment survey go out the tri service complaint system the review of our tolerance policy by a kc to move to action an international culture and behaviour conference to learn good lesson from our international partner and the modernisation of our military appraisal system to ensure that people who get involve in unacceptable behaviour be track through the system so they can be hold to account 
 what discussion he have have with his nato counterpart on increase defence industrial capacity across the alliance 
 the defence secretary raise this issue at the meeting of all nato defence ministers in february and have hold a number of discussion with nato ally since include with the us secretary of defence and in meeting with joint expeditionary force and e5 ally european ally be step up within nato and the uk be lead effort to increase defence spending and expand defence industrial capacity 
 i concur with my hon friend   the member for south suffolk james cartlidge   that it be deeply disappointing that france have block european union country from allow safe security action for europe fund to be use for the procurement of british weapon with that in mind what have the minister do to ensure that action be be take to guarantee a multilateral nato wide procurement strategy with the uk at its centre 
 i have meet a number of my equivalent bilaterally but it be important to say that we welcome the rearm initiative and that it be in all our interest for safe to allow member state to partner with the uk we will continue to emphasise the need for eu defence financing and wide defence industrial initiative to include country like the uk as my right hon friend the secretary of state say in answer to an early question we want to conclude a uk eu defence and security pact that will give we access to that scheme 
 i thank the minister for her response last week the defence committee meet the chief of the general staff who highlight the challenge of support our troop in estonia i highlight the rail baltica project which receive significant funding from the eu ’s connecting europe facility and nato and which   link my constituency via high speed right through to the baltics use british steel will the minister meet i to discuss support the expansion of hs1 capacity as it be the type of opportunity that would support growth within our defence industrial capacity improve our deterrence and increase our commitment to our european ally while bring high quality job to east london 
 i thank my hon friend for his question as i hope hon member from around the house be start to realise if i be ask for a meeting my general answer be yes i be very happy to meet he 
 what step he be take to increase recruitment to the armed force 
 we inherit a broken recruitment system from the conservatives we promise to take step to fix it and we be the large pay increase in year for those who serve a pay increase for recruit the scrapping of over outdated medical practice the creation of a new direct entry cyber pathway a conditional offer within day of apply a training start date within day and the announcement of a new tri service recruitment scheme to attract the very good to our armed force 
 i thank the minister for his response my constituency have a proud military history give the need to expand our armed force how can we help a new generation of young people in dartford to access highly skilled and rewarding career across all the armed force 
 not only be a career in our armed force good for a young person it also offer training opportunity with each of our single service appear in the top apprentice employer the very good in our country a career in the defence industry be also good for our young people the ability to move between regular reserve and industry more frequently and more easily not only secure the national defence of our country and provide more opportunity for our young people but mean that defence can be an even well and big engine for growth those be the proposal we will be come forward with in due course 
 in recent year for every servicemen recruit have leave that be completely unsustainable what be the minister do to ensure that we retain more troop with not only the package within our armed force but competitive package in the private sector 
 the hon gentleman be entirely right about the terrible state of armed force retention that we inherit we have see armed force morale drop from in to just last july we need to invest more in our armed force which be why we have introduce the big pay rise in year and why we be bring defence housing back under public control so that it can be invest in it be also why we be   create the armed forces commissioner who will provide an independent champion for service welfare matter for those who serve we do need to invest more which be why my ministerial colleague and i have create an armed force recruitment and retention board within the mod to focus effort on improve service life for all those who serve and their family 
 what step he be take to support defence personnel affect by domestic abuse 
 as i mention early we be move forward with our woman and girl taskforce to drive progress on the government ’s commitment to halve violence against woman and girl in a decade last year we launch the ministry of defence ’s domestic abuse action plan and train more than service police in specialist domestic abuse and coercive control training and now everybody in the military every man and woman across the armed force go through unacceptable sexual behaviour training 
 accord to king ’s college london in of our armed force personnel be a survivor of domestic abuse but because there be no specific offence of domestic abuse in the law the ministry of justice have confirm that it can not comprehensively identify perpetrator and can not therefore comprehensively rehabilitate they and keep victim and survivor safe will the minister join i and colleague across the house in campaign for a specific offence of domestic abuse in the law so that we can well protect our armed force personnel from domestic abuse 
 it be completely clear to i that any sort of domestic abuse in any way shape or form in the armed force be completely unacceptable if we can help to address and track some of that through the armed force it will make it far easy to deal with and ensure rehabilitation i will take this conversation on after these question 
 if he will make an assessment of the potential impact of the pause in offensive cyber operation against russia by the us on security in europe 
 uk defence network face a range of state threat from malign actor in the national cyber security centre receive report of cyber attack of which be nationally significant with severe in nature the government continue to improve resilience and response option to those threat 
 as part of the armed force parliamentary scheme together with colleague i recently visit the brigade and learn more about the amazing work the man and woman of the brigade be do to tackle russian disinformation in eastern europe and elsewhere the trip come just a few day after the   united states president announce his decision to cease american offensive cyber operation against russia over disinformation altogether which have lead to grow concern that willing country do not have the capacity or ability to tackle that particular threat will the minister tell we what assessment have be make of the capability that we have in the united kingdom to tackle that threat and do he agree that it place great pressure on the brigade and other agency 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question the brigade do a superb job of tackle disinformation especially by malign actor we need to expand our provision and range of capability which be precisely why we have create a new direct entry cyber pathway to recruit people directly into our cyber force to support our national resilience in both defensive and offensive operation the hon gentleman will understand that i can not talk about ongoing operation but i can say that we be invest more in this area to keep ourselves and our ally safe 
 with gchq the uk ’s cyber operation be genuinely world leading what assurance can the minister give the house that we will continue to support ukraine with our cyber security 
 we have make it very clear that we will continue support ukraine not only to put it in the good possible position on the battlefield and in any negotiation to come but to secure its critical national infrastructure we will continue work with ukraine ’s defence and civilian sector which be incredibly impressive in this area to make sure that it have the technology training and access to support to keep its country safe 
 if he will make it his policy to negotiate a defence and security agreement with the eu 
 when the british public elect we as the new government we say that labour will seek an ambitious new uk eu security pact to strengthen co operation on the threat that we face and will rebuild relationship with key european ally with nato as the cornerstone of our security in europe that be exactly what we be do 
 i thank the secretary of state for his response give president trump ’s increase unpredictability and shift policy can the secretary of state share how the government be strengthen defence procurement agreement with european partner to enhance our capability and reduce our reliance on the united states 
 when i speak last week with high representative kallas and commissioner kubilius that be exactly what i discuss close defence collaboration that will see a strong european effort with the uk and the eu but within the nato framework which be the cornerstone for all of we to keep ourselves safe 
 my constituent have steadfastly support the people of ukraine since russia ’s illegal invasion can the secretary of state   confirm that collective support for ukraine will be a major focus of his discussion with eu counterpart and that under this government the uk will always lead the way in step up support for ukraine 
 indeed i can my hon friend make an important point this period be critical for ukraine and for european security i hope that he see a uk government who be step up to provide strong support for ukraine co ordinating ally to do more step up on european security and above all step up on defence spending 
 i call liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we support the government ’s commitment to strengthen defence tie with our european partner but they need to go far and fast to ensure that the uk do not get leave behind have the defence secretary speak with his counterpart in the eu about the value of the new stand alone uk eu defence pact which will enable the uk to well influence decision around new finance programme such as a rearmament bank to support defence investment across europe 
 yes last week i meet with high representative kallas and speak with commissioner kubilius and that be exactly the subject of our conversation 
 what discussion he have have with his european counterpart on the joint expeditionary force 
 the uk be fully commit to the joint expeditionary force i discuss the jef on my visit to denmark latvia finland lithuania and the netherlands last month i meet regularly with the jef partner defence attachés include last week 
 i thank the minister for his answer clearly we have a particularly good relationship with the country that make up the joint expeditionary force the minister and i have complete the armed force parliamentary scheme and be both plunge into the snowdrift in norway at bardufoss some of the kit that the norwegians have be particularly impressive as i be sure the minister would agree could i press he on what work we can do with the country in the joint expeditionary force on procurement design and perhaps development of equipment 
 just to clarify for the house they be different snowdrift at different time otherwise there could be story the more procurement we can do with our ally the well not only in how interoperable the equipment will be but in its interchangeability with p-8s f-35s and potentially type frigate be share by common nation in the high north there be a huge opportunity to work together more closely create more job and more effective deterrent against russian aggression 
 what step his department be take to help prepare cadet for potential career in the armed force 
 i have visit multiple cadet unit all over the country and have be truly astounded at the social mobility that the cadet provide for a whole range of young people we have over cadet at the moment support by volunteer we be do everything we can to look to expand those programme over time and ensure that the opportunity be available for everybody from every walk of life 
 in my new role as the chair of the british shooting sports council i take a keen interest in cadet target rifle shoot the minister will be aware that the ministry of defence be propose to withdraw from service the cadet target rifle from and the rifle just year later aside from depriving cadet from the opportunity to learn the highly disciplined and valuable skill of firearm safety and use the proposal call into question the future of target rifle shoot in the uk will the minister meet i and representative of the shooting and target rifle community to discuss opportunity to reverse this decision 
 i will happily come and talk through that in due course i have be in the military for year and have spend a lot of time shooting and i can see its benefit 
 what step he be take to ensure small and medium enterprise be able to participate in defence procurement contract 
 sme can help we make defence an engine for growth in all our nation and region i want far more involvement from sme in our procurement provide agility innovation and resilience as we seek to ramp up our industrial production that be why the prime minister recently launch a new defence sme support hub and commit we to publish a new target for mod spend with sme 
 last week as part of the armed force parliamentary scheme i have the privilege of visit his majesty ’s royal naval base in portsmouth to meet personnel and see equipment use by our armed force that be make by accuracy international and sig sauer an sme firearm manufacturer in my constituency accuracy international employ more than local people what be the minister do to ensure that company such as accuracy international and sig sauer be give a fair shot in defence procurement and can continue to provide job in my city 
 a fair shot i commend my hon friend on her pun accuracy international have make a great contribution to uk defence and export i have be talk to defence firm many of which be sme   during the defence industrial strategy consultation i hope that the change that we will make to speed up procurement and provide more access to opportunity will transform their chance of do business with we while make defence an engine for growth across all our nation and region 
 we be shortly to appoint a national armament director with a salary of more than £ a year i hope that that colossal salary come with the mandate to be able to tear up the book on defence procurement as we rearm the nation will the minister reassure i that when we get the national armament director back to the defence committee in a year ’s time they will not say well we try to change thing but they would not let i 
 i assure the hon gentleman that we be tear up the way in which procurement work before the national armament director move into his place it be of the big job in government which need the right salary to attract the right person i be clear that we will do thing differently the national armament director will be hold accountable for ensure that we do so 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 a lot have happen since the last defence oral question week ago the prime minister announce the large sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war hit of gdp by and in the next parliament i chair the ukraine defence contact group of nearly country the european defence minister to do so which secure an extra € of military support for ukraine with france the uk be lead plan to put together a coalition of the willing to secure a peace deal in ukraine nation join a planning meeting last week at the permanent joint headquarters and there be further meeting there this week as we accelerate that planning this be a government step up on european security on ukraine on defence spending and in all area this be uk leadership in action 
 the government ’s commitment to use defence procurement to strengthen our industrial sector be welcome will the secretary of state please outline how the government be support local manufacturer across the uk and ensure that defence contract contribute to long term industrial growth and job creation in particular how be they encourage and support company such as pargat housewares in my constituency which be a private ethnic minority own business and of the uk ’s large producer of pot pan and bakeware use advanced and extremely energy efficient technique 
 my hon friend be right that sme be often the driver of productivity and innovation we recently announce that we will be set target for an increase share of defence contract to go to sme alongside the formation of a new defence innovation office 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 if our force go to ukraine it will be as part of a peacekeeping mission but as the veterans minister remind we early operation banner be also describe as peacekeeping yet decade later those who serve be be hound in our court our soldier in iraq be subject to hundred of vexatious claim if our force go to ukraine will the secretary of state consider a derogation from the european convention on human right so as to maximise our protection against possible lawfare 
 if we go into ukraine we will be go into a negotiate peace not a shoot war our aim be to secure border to ensure safe sky and to ensure safe sea be the hon gentleman say that he will not support a uk mission and uk troop without that derogation 
 of course not the secretary of state know perfectly well that the labour government derogate from the echr after and a country in europe have derogate from the echr since that country be ukraine and that be because there be a war on surely he recognise that even if it be a peacekeeping force there will still be threat and russian national have be particularly adept at lawfare in our own court surely he will at least consider give the maximum protection to our armed force from vexatious claim by derogate from the echr if there be a deployment 
 our armed force will always have our full support just to be clear to the hon gentleman we alongside france be put together a coalition of the willing respond to the challenge from the us for europe to step up on ukraine we be respond to the requirement from ukraine for security arrangement that will give it the conviction and confidence that any negotiate peace will last that be a worthy mission and it be that the uk be lead i hope that it have the support of both side of the house 
 our troop must be able to trust the body armour that they wear to keep they safe will the minister for the armed forces update the house on how withdraw crack enhanced combat body armour be go and on when everyone in our force can expect to know that their body armour be safe 
 i fully agree with my hon friend and on something as fundamental as body armour we back our troop i order immediate action to replace ecba on the frontline fly new body armour to unit worldwide rapid testing of plate be under way our people should know that their safety matter to the government and we will act to keep they safe 
 last week it be announce that the snp government be send more shipbuilding contract abroad calmac ferry that could be construct on the clyde will instead be build in poland will the minister share how many warship the united kingdom government be currently build in scotland 
 as the hon gentleman will probably know type 31 be be build at rosyth and type 26 be be build at govan we have get a programme for at govan and so far at rosyth that be the current number 
 as you know all too well mr speaker lancashire have a proud defence manufacturing pedigree at the cutting edge of our british sovereign capability you think manufacture and you think lancashire will the minister for defence procurement continue to champion lancashire ’s defence job will she commit i understand that this be cheeky to replace tranche typhoon aircraft with new modern lancashire make typhoons 
 i commend my hon friend for ask that question he will know that the strategic defence review be consider our current mix of and generation aircraft he will also know that in addition to the typhoon of the f-35s as well as of the typhoons be make in lancashire so there be work aplenty in lancashire no matter which aeroplane be buy 
 my   constituent sam serve in afghanistan and suffer from ptsd although he be entitle to compensation his condition have leave he struggle with the form and year on he have be tell that he can have only £ when he be entitle to thousand can the minister explain what step be be take to ensure that those who give so much serve our country be help to access the financial assistance they be entitle to and not block by bureaucracy 
 that be a really valid question we pay out more than £ a year in compensation through the armed force compensation scheme and the war pension scheme if the hon member want to write to i on that specific case i can have a look into it i also refer she to op courage which be link to mental health and have have referral to date 
 do the minister agree that expand our military expenditure create a golden opportunity to deal with the shortage of people go into science technology and engineering job and that as we expand the military budget we should make sure that the defence industry expand the number of apprenticeship and build a robust skill and training base so that young people can benefit from those job 
 i very much agree with my hon friend of course there be skill shortage across much of manufacturing not only in defence so there be certainly go to be an issue i can tell he that the apprentice i have meet in the defence industry tend to smile the whole time they be get extremely good training for lifelong excellent job so i be absolutely certain that we can get that across to young people and ensure that defence get its fair share of the skilled people that we need 
 with the uk freeze out of the eu rearmament scheme while defence contractor and security firm in albania   norway and south korea stand to benefit what estimate have the secretary of state make of the potential loss of economic activity in the uk as a result 
 the strong argument for say that there need to be uk collaboration and co operation with the eu and across europe be that some of our good capability from the typhoon and the meteor to storm shadow have be develop through multinational effort include the uk it be that sort of collaboration that we want to secure for the future and the eu white paper give we a basis for start to negotiate that 
 we be incredibly proud of our veteran in peterborough will the minister join i in recognise the work of councillor jason mcnally our armed force champion and his predecessor councillor john fox and tell we what more the government can do to help they to support more people sign up to the armed force covenant 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight amazing individual who i imagine be put a huge number of hour into support the veteran community and the armed force community the covenant will come into law in and when it do we need to ensure that those armed force champion understand what it provide at local level and can harness its benefit for the whole of the armed force 
 the hawk aircraft most famous in the scarlet livery of the red arrows be at the end of its service life can minister explain what step they be take to ensure that we replace it with a british build sovereign capability 
 the hon gentleman be right to say that hawk be due to be out of service in the early 2030s we be take step to consider what the alternative might be and we of will course consider any uk option that exist i can not tell he what the answer to that be yet but it be under active consideration 
 those who bravely serve in our force should never lose their say in our country ’s future so i welcome the government ’s swift action to introduce the ability to use the veteran id card as voter id may i ask the minister what plan there be to ensure that veteran around the country be aware of this important change 
 the veteran id card be a fantastic initiative that have now be roll out for most veteran we have thousand of application a week and will continue to endeavour to ensure that they get deliver in the most timely and effective manner anybody who be interested in veteran welfare issue or the service available should go to the gov.uk website and type in veteran support and there will be a plethora of different avenue for they to unlock 
 mid norfolk be a proud rural and military constituency with many employee work at raf marham and swanton morley barrack which be home to the queen ’s dragoon guards and many cadet and veteran a few   year ago we manage to secure the extension of swanton morley barrack which have be schedule for closure do the welcome defence surge mean that its closure slat for might be review 
 i can not give the hon gentleman an answer right now but i be certainly happy to look into it and meet he if he want a meeting or write to he

 president macron have block british firm from the new eu defence fund what be the secretary of state ’s view on this act of solidarity 
 that be just not accurate there be a new proposal for a strategy from the european union and it have opportunity for country such as the uk to participate our discussion demonstrate the importance of the uk be able to collaborate industrially and as a government to meet the threat we face 
 do the secretary of state agree that when we discuss procurement and british make weapon we also need to consider our responsibility and legal duty in relation to the issuing of arm licence do he agree that now be the time to talk about end all arm sale to israel 
 we keep all our arm export constantly under review we have make decision on a limited number of export in relation to israel that position of keep thing under review continue but we have no plan at this stage to make any change 
 staff sergeant peter cluff die in february with an in service designation to that death his widow kirsty and his child meredith and heather be in the benefit of the armed force pension scheme and remain so however the scheme make a miscalculation and have send debt collector to they to try to recover a fairly small sum i ask about the matter month ago and have not have a response from the department will the secretary of state or of his ministers meet i to discuss this unedifye advert for the ministry of defence 
 that be a truly harrowing story i will absolutely take that on and we will meet straight after this and get it solve 
 the recent report a dark shadow shine a light on the link between sexual assault and suicidal ideation in the military community i be therefore pleased to see the announcement from the mod last week about the removal of sexual harassment investigation from the chain of command something for which campaigner and survivor have campaign for such a long time they be also keen to have reassurance however will the minister confirm that this be not a continuation of the previous government ’s fail effort but a step change in make the process truly independent 
 this absolutely be a step change a tri service complaint system remove from the single service have be call for for a long time we have take decisive action to do that and it will move thing in the right direction combine that with the violence against woman and girl taskforce and we be double tap to ensure that we have the good support for woman and indeed anyone else in the armed force 
 concern have be grow over china ’s aggression in the indo pacific region give the strategic importance of the taiwan strait to global security what have be the department ’s response to those rise tension 
 we be certainly of the view that any difficulty in the taiwan strait should be resolve diplomatically without the use of force or coercion the united kingdom will deploy our carrier strike group to the indo pacific later this year as a projection of our responsibility to the region and to make it clear that difficulty be well resolve diplomatically 
 on friday i be pleased to join colleague from across the house to hear the royal marines band service in concert as part of the mountbatten festival of music may i invite the government to reaffirm their commitment to the royal marines band service it make a huge contribution to defence diplomacy and combat operation 
 that be a great question the royal marine band service be the good band service in our armed force and it be absolutely safe under our watch it provide a fantastic influence opportunity as well as essential military service outside the musical profession 
 the defence secretary should know that the whole house support the government ’s action to preserve peace in ukraine but that be not the point that the shadow secretary of state be make he be ask whether the ministry of defence recognise that it have a duty of care towards soldier who fight for their country and then face decade of lawfare and the misuse of the european convention on human right will the ministry do something to protect those soldier 
 i say to the right hon gentleman that we be totally committed to our duty of care and to stand by our force we also recognise that the previous government put in place legislation the overseas operations service personnel and veterans act to deal with any concern in this place 
 drug resistant infection have be rise in ukraine and remain a challenge in treat wound soldier and get they back to the frontline such infection have also spread outside ukraine and into europe in the context of conflict what step be the minister and the department take to ensure that antimicrobial resistance be appropriately consider in the national security strategy

 with permission mr speaker i wish to make a statement regard the power outage cause by a substation fire that impact on heathrow airport operation on   friday march 
 i begin by acknowledge the disruption to everyone affect by this incident many home school and business temporarily lose power some family have have to evacuate their home and many thousand have have their travel plan impact i thank the firefighter and emergency responder who work in difficult condition to put the fire out as well as heathrow the national grid and all the other public service involve for work so hard to get power back on and people back travel again this be an unprecedented event and we must learn any and all lesson we can to ensure that it do not recur 
 let i begin by set out what we currently know about the cause of the incident a large fire break out at north hyde substation at pm on   thursday march and be bring under control the follow day due to the impact heathrow airport announce at am on friday that it would close until midnight that day power be restore to domestic customer in a matter of hour after the operator of the local distribution network scottish and southern electricity networks redistribute power through other part of the network 
 by comparison heathrow be of the country ’s big consumer of electricity and require as much power as a small city what we know be that there be an unprecedented outage and that it be not the result of a single point of failure on the electricity transmission or distribution system the feed from north hyde substation be of supply point to heathrow and the fire cause exceptional damage that take the whole substation out of service the other supply point continue supply to heathrow airport throughout the incident 
 heathrow ’s view be that that supply be insufficient to ensure the safe and secure ongoing operation of all system across the whole airport it proceed to reconfigure its internal electricity network to enable the resumption of full operation utilise the other external supply point that require hundred of system to be safely power down and then safely power up with extensive testing the airport have a range of back up generator and uninterruptible power supply include diesel generator to provide power to essential system to enable they safely to land plane those back up system ensure that safety and security system and protocol be maintain at all time but they be never design to support full operation of the whole airport 
 by on friday afternoon heathrow begin restart system to ensure that they be safely operate by pm the airport be confident that all system be safely operate across the whole network and announce that some flight would be able to restart that day the flight from about pm be so call position flight which be to get aircraft and crew to the right place to resume normal operation the follow day that be follow by flight divert to uk and non uk airport to allow passenger to be repatriate and a small number of outbound long haul flight since saturday   heathrow have be fully operational with more than passenger able to fly to and from the airport on saturday due to knock on impact of the event there continue to be some delay and cancellation over the weekend 
 overall the impact of heathrow ’s closure lead to over flight and more than passenger have their flight cancel or divert on friday and a further cancel on saturday the government be acutely aware of the need to ensure that passenger be well look after and their consumer right protect this be why uk law ensure that airline must provide passenger with a refund within day or passenger must be reroute to their destination under the same condition we be closely monitor to ensure that passenger be properly support to support the recovery my department temporarily lift restriction on overnight flight to ease congestion heathrow and airline also add extra capacity into the system to help affected passenger we allow rail ticket to be use flexibly to help passenger who be not able to use their original ticket 
 regard the cause of the fire the metropolitan police confirm that the fire be not believe to be suspicious however due to the location of the substation and the impact that this incident have have on critical national infrastructure the met ’s counter terrorism command be lead our inquiry into this matter this be due to the specialist resource and capability within that command which can assist in progress the investigation at pace to help minimise disruption and identify the cause it would not be appropriate to comment far while these investigation continue but we will of course update the house once it be appropriate to do so 
 although it be positive that electricity supply be restore quickly there will be learning to ensure that we avoid such incident reoccurre that be why on saturday my right hon friend the secretary of state for energy security and net work with ofgem commission the independent national energy system operator to urgently investigate the incident the review will also seek to understand any wide lesson to be learn for energy resilience for critical national infrastructure neso have be ask to report back to the department for energy security and net with initial finding within week 
 in addition heathrow have ask ruth kelly a former secretary of state for transport and an independent member of heathrow ’s board to undertake a review of its internal resilience the kelly review will analyse the robustness and execution of heathrow ’s crisis management plan the airport ’s response and how it recover the operation 
 colleague across the house will appreciate that we do not yet know everything there be to know about the incident but i will try to answer question from hon member in as much detail as possible base on the late information i have at my disposal 
 i commend the statement to the house 
 i thank the secretary of state for her statement and for advance sight of it i join she in extend my gratitude to the firefighter   who respond so swiftly to the incident i extend my sympathy to everybody affect by the disruption and place on record my thank to all those at heathrow who work diligently to ensure that the airport come back on line over the weekend 
 the loss of power in the heathrow area cause significant disruption for thousand of traveller and countless business heathrow be of the world ’s busy airport and europe ’s busy air hub it be schedule to handle flight carry up to passenger on friday however as we know the fire at a nearby electrical substation force plane to be divert to other airport with many long haul flight return to their point of departure the financial cost of the shutdown to the airline industry be expect to total ten of million of pound and there be significant question mark over the airport ’s possible vulnerability to further disruption in the future 
 before we discuss the specific of the incident i ask the secretary of state to confirm that she will remain engaged with heathrow the airline and other key stakeholder throughout this period to minimise the impact on passenger and the economy 
 i note that the secretary of state for energy security and net whom i be pleased to see in his place have instruct neso to investigate the incident urgently it be crucial that neso ’s investigation deliver a clear and objective assessment of the incident ’s circumstance and the uk ’s broad energy resilience i ask the government to keep the house inform as that investigation develop 
 i also note that the secretary of state for transport will closely monitor heathrow ’s internal investigation into the incident she be right to do so although i trust that she will share any conclusion draw from the report with the house may i ask that she provide specific assurance today that she will indeed do so 
 let i focus on the detail of the incident which evidently raise significant concern about the resilience of heathrow airport and critical infrastructure in general on heathrow ’s resilience important question arise about why the airport be dependent on a single electrical substation which prove so vulnerable to such an incident i understand from medium report and from the secretary of state ’s statement that although additional substation be capable of power the airport do so would require reconfigure the power supply structure for all terminal do the secretary of state believe that that set up be appropriate for the country ’s large airport additionally what assessment have she make of the power supply resilience of other major uk airport 
 with regard to the resilience of our critical national infrastructure the episode underline the urgent need to ensure that our critical infrastructure be safeguard against both accidental incident and deliberate act of sabotage by malign actor hon member will recall that when president putin launch his illegal invasion of ukraine global energy market face immense disruption which pose the most significant threat to european energy security since the 1970 despite that upheaval britain ’s energy price remain broadly stable but only because the government of the day take   decisive action to protect business and household from price spike as far as possible that come at a significant financial cost 
 the event at heathrow remind we that true energy security depend not only on price stability but on the physical safety of our energy infrastructure give the crucial role of airport in our economy we must remain vigilant in the light of that what discussion have the secretary of state have with the secretary of state for energy security and net about ensure that the energy supply to major airport remain secure what be the timeline for the kelly review and will its finding be make publicly available will the secretary of state engage with colleague across government departments to assess and mitigate the risk pose by malicious actor who will undoubtedly have take note of this weekend ’s event finally what specific step will she take to strengthen the resilience of our critical national infrastructure 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for the tone of his comment i assure he and other member of this house that i will do everything i can to keep they update and i will continue the engagement i have have with heathrow since the incident become know to i i speak to the chief executive of heathrow on friday morning and again today if my official can do anything to assist those on the opposition front bench in understand this very serious issue i be willing to facilitate any such meeting that the hon gentleman wish to have 
 on the internal investigation that the london heathrow board have commission ruth kelly to do as the hon gentleman know i have ask to see a copy of that report assume that i have the permission of heathrow to share it more broadly i be happy to share its content with he and the house on his question about whether i be content with and confident about the set up for airport power supply i be not go to become an armchair electrical engineer i want to see the report that have be commission by the airport and the report that my right hon friend the secretary of state for energy have commission from neso we be also conduct a resilience review of critical national infrastructure via the cabinet office and i assure the hon gentleman that we will look at any and all the issue that this incident raise in those review i speak with my right hon friend the secretary of state for energy on friday evening and i assure the hon gentleman that i will continue to engage across government on any of the issue that this incident raise 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 i thank the transport secretary for her statement i also thank the fire service and the airport and airline staff who do so much over the weekend to address and support the situation and ensure that it do not get any bad we will have a committee session next week with the chief exec of heathrow airport and other we also look forward to ask the secretary of state more question when she come to we after the easter recess by which time i hope that she and i will be well genne up on electrical engineering 
 there have be talk this weekend about the single point of failure in this case that be about not just a particular electricity substation but what happen when our busy airport close all our airport critical national infrastructure have an impact when they be at risk i be tell that the next airport national policy statement like the last will cover only heathrow be it not time that we have a national airport strategy to include what happen when any of our airport be take out of action 
 i be grateful to my hon friend the chair of the transport committee for her remark the airport national policy statement be a site specific document but i will reflect on her suggestion of a wide airport strategy i be sure that we will discuss it far when i be in front of her committee in a couple of week time 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement i echo her word and those of other in express my gratitude to the firefighter and other emergency worker who fight the fire and to the airport airline and other staff for all their hard work in the face of this catastrophic system failure 
 what have happen be clearly a rare occurrence but it raise a number of significant question about the security and management of our critical national infrastructure while i be pleased to hear that no foul play be currently suspect the event have reveal vulnerability in our national security that may be exploit in future by terrorist and hostile state actor it be consequently vital that lesson be learn to ensure that an incident like this do not happen again and i welcome the announcement of a full investigation 
 it be deeply concern that the failure of a single piece of infrastructure have take down the entire airport heathrow be connect to substation and while be impact the be run and have enough capacity think to be around mw to power the whole of heathrow which require a little more than mw it be evident that heathrow ’s power set up could not be swiftly reconfigure to allow the substation to be use we need to understand why that be and whether it could be remedie in future while heathrow claim that it be normal for airport not to have sufficient back up capacity to power all of their need other industry that require even more power than heathrow such as datum centre take more robust step to ensure they have sufficient back up system to counter such failure should our key international transport hub not have the same safeguard 
 we must also not forget those whose journey be disrupt it be estimate that over passenger have be impact by the event however under current regulation most of those passenger will not be eligible for compensation as such i have question for the secretary of state what impact if any will this incident have on the government ’s plan for expansion at heathrow can the national grid infrastructure cope with a runway or will the airport become more prone to failure secondly do the secretary of state believe that uk airport should be take step to   increase their back up capacity in order to ensure that an incident like this do not happen again thirdly do she believe that the current regulation around passenger compensation be sufficient 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question the question of heathrow expansion and this very rare unprecedented event be entirely separate issue he will be aware that the government have invite heathrow to bring forward proposal for a runway and we will review the airport national policy statement after that 
 with regard to back up capacity at airport i be tell that the back up power system at heathrow operate as they should have do during this incident they do not fail i do not want to come to knee jerk conclusion as a result of this unprecedented incident but we will be look very closely at the review i mention in my statement i have also work with the civil aviation authority to ensure that passenger who have be affect by this disruption be aware of their right 
 heathrow be in my constituency as be the substation that catch fire so i join other members in thank the firefighter who work so hard to get this incident under control so quickly and at some risk i also thank the police and the council officer who help to evacuate of my constituent from their home i be there on the day and meet some of the resident and i will be write to they all so that we can pick up lesson from what they experience on that day and build those lesson in 
 now that this site have gain such a high profile there be concern about its security for the future i would welcome some more detailed information come out of the inquiry about how we will secure the site for the future not just from accident but from potential attack 
 my right hon friend raise a fair point i will ensure that we provide that information to he once we have review the different report that be go to be publish over the next couple of month 
 the secretary of state mention consumer right not only be heathrow customer delay and disrupt but they be rip off with huge hike for alternative flight car hire and hotel be it not time that the government bring forward robust anti price gouging legislation in fairness to the secretary of state and labour front benchers i also ask the previous government who do absolutely on this issue as well laughter it be true and i think we see the result of that in many other way on behalf of the british consumer and international consumer many of whom have be rip off through no fault of their own as a result of this incident be it not time that for new legislation should we not also carry out a wide review of the monopoly hold by the operator of hotel at heathrow and the lack of competition among airline come into heathrow 
 i can categorically say that it would not be right for anyone or any business to capitalise on this disruption whether airline or hotel i would expect organisation to be do everything they can to support traveller who have be disrupt by this incident 
 the secretary of state ’s statement underline why it be important to avoid speculation in the immediate aftermath of a critical incident such as this can she reassure the house that if any systematic risk be identify that potentially affect other major airport there will be a co ordinated response if any such issue be identify at regional and local airport will member of this house in proximity to those airport be keep inform 
 i be happy to give my hon friend that assurance 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer of course this be not the time there have be a problem with heathrow back in august uk air traffic control problem cause chaos in july faulty software cause chaos again we be always hop that heathrow be get well after the incident in the early hour of last friday morning passenger i be of they by the way find themselves stick somewhere in a queue that include many of my constituent and they have trouble get home too they have be contact i over the weekend to tell i their story 
 the incident pose question about whether the current operator be capable of run a runway if this fire cause a complete shutdown report indicate that complete closure be not require confidence in travel and in heathrow be at an all time low among my constituent and other have the secretary of state make heathrow official aware of the need to ensure that contingency plan be not simply note on paper but action to take during a crisis what have be their response to allay fear cause by the turmoil of last weekend 
 i do not think anyone underestimate the distress and disruption that this incident cause have speak directly with heathrow ’s chief executive on a number of occasion i know that he be fully aware of that this be an unprecedented event of significant magnitude day in day out heathrow successfully provide service to hundred of thousand of passenger and business while it be right that we do everything we can to interrogate the cause of this incident and learn any lesson i believe that heathrow airport can continue to be a trust partner for government in the long term 
 the power outage which have such a significant effect on heathrow and its immediate surrounding have raise real concern about resilience and back up in our energy system for major infrastructure project and site the government have plan for a significant expansion of our clean energy electricity network so can the secretary of state say to what extent the government will build into their clean power plan the great resilience and back up that this worrying example at heathrow have emphasise be so badly need 
 i can confidently say that as we transition to clean power resilience will remain key in the delivery of our power network i do not think that anything change as a result of our determination to move to clean power but i be happy to continue discussion with colleague in the department for energy security and net to make sure that that be the case 
 i call the father of the house 
 follow that last question can the secretary of state give we an absolute assurance that nothing in our drive towards green energy and net will ever affect the sustainability and safety of our vital transport system 
 i can give the right hon gentleman that assurance i be aware that some other member of this house not present in the chamber today be busy peddle some myth on friday morning about this issue it be clear to i that heathrow ’s back up power supply consist of both diesel and electricity generator no matter what some other member might be say those system do work i can give the right hon gentleman the assurance that he seek 
 fire at electricity substation be not unheard of and it seem that there may have be a considerable lack of preparedness at heathrow when the secretary of state receive her review will she look into what preparedness there be and what scenario those at heathrow have envisage for deal with possible outage of this kind and get their operation up and run again as quickly as possible 
 i think that the kelly review will be look at that my hon friend make a fair point about preparedness as well as resilience which i will be discuss with those at heathrow in the future 
 the level of disruption cause by the fire and the subsequent closure of heathrow airport have highlight the importance of reliable aviation connectivity to our daily life as well as the fragility of much of our uk infrastructure the national infrastructure commission publish report in and call for the government to implement standard and framework for resilience in key sector such as telecom water transport and energy do the secretary of state agree that this incident show how important such standard would be and will those in the appropriate department pick up the report which i be sure find their way on to their desk over the weekend and start to implement their recommendation 
 i think they be already do that because the review of resilience that be announce by the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster last july be look at the subject in the context of our critical national infrastructure 
 i rarely disagree with my right hon friend but i be not sure that this major incident can be entirely divorce from heathrow ’s plan for a runway it be precisely because it be up against densely populate community that the effect be so devastating with ten of thousand of people lose power hundred be evacuate and part of the m4 be close will my right hon friend assure i that as part of any consideration of a expansion of heathrow which would presumably make problem such as this bad she will at least look into the risk and the resilience that would be consequence of such an expansion 
 i doubt that it necessarily follow that an expand heathrow that accommodate twice as many flight as it do currently would make an incident such as the that we see on friday any more likely this be an unprecedented fire of a significant scale however i can assure my hon friend that before make any decision about the expansion of heathrow we will ensure that any proposal that may be forthcoming comply with all our legislative requirement 
 the secretary of state mention that many family be evacuate from their property safety be clearly of paramount importance but only a few day ago natpower uk inform i that it want to build an enormous electrical substation in my constituency once neso have report on this matter will the secretary of state please help to organise a meeting with the relevant energy minister so that we can discuss its finding and link they with any proposal for a new substation in my constituency 
 a tenuous link 
 the relevant energy minister my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks who be sit next to i be nod which suggest to i that he would be happy to have such a meeting 
 i thank the secretary of state for her statement and for the way in which she have approach this very serious issue heathrow be clearly a vital piece of national infrastructure it be also central to the economy of west london and the thames valley and play an important part in the attraction of inward investment to our region as the secretary of state work with the author of the review will she also liaise with the local business community and local authority in the thames valley and ensure that they be keep fully abreast of the work that be carry out in the review 
 my hon friend have make a fair point and i be happy to give he that undertaking 
 i again urge the secretary of state not to divorce the question of expansion from what have happen here surely what this incident cripple europe ’s busy airport show we be that we need a well heathrow not a big heathrow we need to focus on the infrastructure in and around heathrow to improve resilience security and the passenger experience while a runway may not increase the likelihood of such an incident the impact of such an incident will be all the great if she continue to put all our aviation egg in basket 
 let i assure the hon lady that i be not put all the country ’s aviation egg in basket at the moment we do not have proposal before we for a runway at heathrow we will look at those proposal carefully when they be submit and ensure that any decision about either the airport national policy statement or any subsequent development consent order be take in line with our environmental obligation on thing such as carbon air pollution and noise consideration of the resilience of the infrastructure will be part of that 
 a national embarrassment a laugh stock globally shocking with meme do the round those be just some of the word that could be use to describe this weekend ’s event at heathrow while right hon member on our defence committee and the joint committee on the national security strategy be busy discuss hybrid and cyber threat from our adversary our nation ’s big port be take down by a single substation fire do my right hon friend the transport secretary agree that while my slough constituent and people across the country be not bother with the blame game that be now under way this event should be a wake up call regard the resilience of our national infrastructure and there should be no repeat 
 this be an unprecedented event and heathrow stand up its resilience plan swiftly within hour of the fire start plane be once again land at the airport for an airport the size of heathrow that be no mean feat it be right both that an internal review of the airport crisis management and resilience plan take place and that the government have commission the review that will be conduct by neso
