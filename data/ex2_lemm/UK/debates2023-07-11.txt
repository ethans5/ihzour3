it be characteristically astute of my hon friend to in on the tie in which be an important part of the long term workforce plan around third of dentist do not go into nhs work after training so have a tie in be more pertinent there than it might be elsewhere in the nhs workforce i look forward to the select committee ’s report but with some of the reform already in place we be boost the number of patient treat there be a more dental treatment in than in the previous year we be also make nhs dentistry more attractive with some of the change to the previous contract but we recognise that there be more to do which be why we will shortly set out our dental recovery plan 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what progress his department have make on improve access to nhs dentist in north shropshire constituency 
 last year we announce a number of reform to the nhs dental system make the nhs more attractive and help patient to access care treatment and dental care deliver in england go up by a between and 
 in north shropshire the number of adult see by a dentist between and fall by more than from to and the number of child see by a dentist in that time have fall by just about from to constituent report not be able to access a dentist and be be turn away from their nhs dentist as they seek to take on only private work can the secretary of state reassure i that he be take step to ensure that dentist in rural area will continue to provide nhs service because this healthcare problem will continue into the future 
 we recognise that we need to do more that be why we be make nhs dentistry more attractive by create more band of unit of dental activity have a minimum uda value and increase to the amount of activity that dentist can do indeed shropshire telford and wrekin nhs trust for example be above the national average in the month until june we be put reform in place to build more capacity 
 what step his department be take to reduce waiting time for nhs treatment 
 what recent progress he have make on reduce the number of patient wait more than month for elective care 
 the elective recovery plan set out clear step to eliminate long wait and that be support by £ of revenue funding and £ in capital over year 
 the waiting list for elective care have rise to more than people include constituent who be unable to work while wait month for an orthopaedic assessment and another who have be wait year for a prostate operation both have have to seek emergency care while they wait for an agonisingly long time be it not true that the long the conservatives stay in power the long patient will wait 
 on the last bit of the question the average wait in wales be week as of april and in england they be week which be the exact opposite of the point the hon lady raise we be take action we be boost diagnostic capacity community diagnostic centre be now open we be increase treatment capacity through our surgical hub programme we be give patient choice which be not available in wales under the labour administration we be give they more choice we be also make well use of the independent sector which some on the labour front bench support but other do not 
 of my constituent have now be wait month for a hysterectomy while another wait year to receive a much need hip replacement that be way over the week standard set out by the nhs constitution can the secretary of state tell the house what be be do to get wait time down to that week mark 
 we recognise the challenge from the pandemic and that be why we be boost capacity particularly through our community diagnostic centre the additional capacity have already deliver more than extra test and scan we be roll that programme out with the target of and be already in place 
 what step he be take to implement section of the health and care act 
 in accordance with section of the health and care act the secretary of state ’s mandate to nhs england for this year set out ambitious objective to improve outcome for cancer patient include the specific aim of improve year and year survival of all cancer 
 many on the conservative benches be pleased that section be finally be implement but we would urge the government to ensure when consult on the nhs mandate that the focus be on outcome such as the year survival rate to encourage early diagnosis and be not water down in favour of soft objective such as patient experience survey because patient may not be aware of how badly the nhs compare on international survival rate as recent research from the king ’s fund have show 
 i congratulate my hon friend on his commitment to ensure that we be focus on cancer outcome and on his successful campaign for that to be include in the nhs mandate which it have be as i just mention the good way to improve outcome for cancer be by catch cancer early that be reason why we have a range of metric include process metric which measure early diagnosis and therefore help we to achieve our ambition on outcome other metric such as patient experience be important as well 
 i agree with   the hon member for basildon and billericay mr baron of the problem be the time it take from the gp ’s referral to the consultant at the hospital and the treatment then start there be still concern about delay in that what be the minister do to speed up the process from not just the gp ’s referral to the consultant but from the consultant to treatment start 
 the hon member be right that the duration be very important reason why we be focus so much on increase early diagnosis be because we know that the soon we diagnose people the more likely they be to have a successful outcome from cancer treatment we be see improvement in cancer survival for instance in third of people would survive for year after a cancer diagnosis now the figure be quarter the nhs be work very hard on far improve cancer diagnosis and we have reduce the number of people wait more than day since the pandemic by over a 
 what step he be take to increase awareness of a cervical screening and b ovarian cancer 
 we be catch more cancer early than ever before and work to raise awareness of cancer sign and symptom screen programme and investment in early diagnosis be all play their part we fund community event to raise awareness of ovarian cancer and nhs england be work to increase cervical screening take up by provide more convenient appointment include at weekend and evening 
 i thank the minister for that answer but target ovarian cancer have find that of woman in the uk wrongly believe that their smear test will detect ovarian cancer there be currently no viable screening process for ovarian cancer however message remain unclear when woman be go for their smear test what step be be take to ensure that information provide at such screening be clear 
 on the hand cervical screening be incredibly important and very effective at save life from cervical cancer we estimate that it save around life per year there be no evidence to support a screening programme for ovarian cancer and i will take away the hon lady ’s question about whether there should be communication about that when people go for a cervical smear 
 what step he be take to tackle vaping by young people 
 the hon gentleman raise a point of concern across the house that we recognise that be why we have already take action through £ to crack down on those selling vape illegally to child close the loophole that allow free sample to be offer to child and our call for evidence so that we can examine what further measure we can take particularly on the concern about disposable vape which be prevalent among child 
 that be helpful but labour propose a new clause to the health and care bill that would have give the government the primary power need to stop the use of sweet name such as gummy bear and skittles bright colour and cartoon character on packaging and labelling of e cigarette the minister will agree that such promotion aim directly at young people be highly unacceptable and take we back to the bad day of cigarette advertising if the government be so committed to act in this space why do they vote down that new clause 
 as i say we have already take action we take measure in april and the prime minister announce further measure in may we be keen to follow the evidence that be why we have have a call for evidence the ministerial team be look extremely closely at this and we will take further action to clamp down on something that we all recognise be a risk to child which be why we be act on it 
 vape be smoking cessation product they be not confectionery to be sell to child or a way of replace generation hook on nicotine with another will my right hon friend update the house on the progress that the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency have make on license e cigarette and other inhaled nicotine contain product as medicine which would put out a strong message that vaping be a dangerous pastime 
 as a former health minister my hon friend be well aware of the risk pose by vape as the chief medical officer have say 
 if you smoke vaping be much safe if you do n’t smoke do n’t vape 
 that be why we be toughen up the regime we be also work with industry as part of our call for evidence but we be clear on the need to go far that be exactly what we will do 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 youngster who try e cigarette be at much great risk of both nicotine addiction and later go on to use tobacco itself so what consideration have this government give to ban disposable vape completely as a way of protect our young people 
 again i agree that disposable vape be a particular concern in our view the growth in youth vaping be largely due to the growth in the use of disposable vape that be why we have particularly focus on that issue in our call for evidence and that be what we be consider 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of guidance issue by district valuer services on the availability of city centre gp premise 
 while it be a very long stand system we keep the approach to funding for gp premise under review we have take action in the primary care recovery plan to improve access to section fund so that new home always come with the gp infrastructure that be need 
 the secretary of state and his ministers will know that i raise this issue in the chamber on   june   this year integrated care board gps and now the medical property sector be all tell i that the treasury rule be out of date and be a massive block to secure much need primary care premise in the right place particularly in city centre such as st albans when i have ask the department via write parliamentary question for its assessment of how much of a problem this issue be the department have tell i that it just do not know could the minister please tell we when he will be speak to colleague in the treasury to resolve this issue so that we can make sure that gp premise be secure where people need they most 
 we talk all the time i be conscious that there be more full time patient face staff in the hon lady ’s constituency than there be in which of course put pressure on premise the capital allocation for her local icb between and be £ so the money be there but i be happy to continue the conversation about how we get the premise in the place where we need they 
 what recent progress he have make on increase the range of service in pharmacy 
 we have already be grow the range of nhs service available in pharmacy we have set up the community pharmacist consultation service the discharge medicine service the new medicine service the blood pressure check service smoking cessation service and the contraception service we be now invest £ to go far through the new pharmacy scheme for common condition 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer but do he agree that the service offer by pharmacy can be make more efficient for example prescription item be subject to split and snip per year that be where to get the right number of pill a   pack have to be manually open up for a couple of pill to be snip out then repackage and relabelle before be reissue the spare pill be often throw away can that system not be well 
 my hon friend be completely correct that be why at the end of last month we lay a statutory instrument before the house to fix the system so that pharmacist can spend more time use their skill to provide high end clinical service and less time snip blister pack 
 give the national shortage of gps do the minister recognise that there be a potential danger in ask pharmacist to take on the duty of gps duty that they be not necessarily qualified to undertake especially give the already large workload undertake by pharmacist 
 we absolutely recognise the need for patient safety which be why there will be clear patient group direction and clear pathway about what pharmacist do they be not take on the role of gps but be provide additional service that will make thing more convenient for all of our constituent 
 i warmly welcome the government ’s commitment to invest £ to enable pharmacist to provide for far more common condition i have already visit of my own local surgery the shakespeare road medical practice and see at hand how pharmacist be already work in gp surgery to try to reduce waiting time surely more surgery should be do the same involve pharmacist with enhance role in order to cut waiting time in a manner that be safe 
 my right hon friend be completely correct that £ of course come on top of the £ that we have already put in we have grow the pharmacy workforce hugely there be more pharmacist now than in and we be also enable those people with their high end skill to do more by reform regulation that be not just the blister pack issue we be enable they to do convenient thing such as hand out bag medicine even if the pharmacist be not present 
 will the minister undertake to liaise closely with local community pharmacy representative group to ensure that the excellent work they have be do can be maximise particularly give that the nhs be under severe pressure at the moment 
 absolutely and i always try to learn lesson from right across the uk in fact some of the idea for reform have come from listen to local partner for example our reform to enable modern way of working hub and speak dispense and empower pharmacy technician have come from talk to those local partner 
 i call the shadow minister 
 people across the country rely on local accessible pharmacy but whether it be high street closure or supply problem lead to the absurd situation where woman be phone or visit   multiple pharmacy for a prescribed dose of hormone replacement therapy and other drug the government be again let people down they have repeatedly announce plan to expand the role of community pharmacy but have fail to update legislation that could possibly help they keep collapse the business in this place so we have time to sort it why will they not do so 
 i have give a flavour of the different reform we be make to give the wide picture there be more pharmacy in england than there be in there be more pharmacist in england than there be in and we be put in £ to provide a bunch of service that be not there when labour be in office we be very happy to take lesson from the pharmacy sector but not from the labour party 
 what step he be take to help improve the effectiveness of brain cancer treatment 
 we be work closely with research partner and although i be pleased to say that more research be be fund we want to see more research in brain cancer treatment we continue to encourage more researcher to become involved in what remain a challenge scientific area with a relatively small research community but i be confident that the government ’s continued commitment to funding will help we make progress towards effective treatment 
 i thank the minister for that answer and i be sure and i know he will take this very seriously i have have constituent in the last year come to see i who have suffer serious brain tumour and they have have a very similar pathway which be basically that after a certain point there be little the nhs can do for they in particular there be a shortage of neuro oncologist and have spend their life saving on private treatment even though that be difficult to find be there any hope in the nhs workforce plan that there will be more oncology training and more support for neuro oncology because the survival rate for this cancer be still woefully low 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and i be sorry to hear of the experience of her constituent there certainly be hope within the long term workforce plan as she rightly allude to we be reliant on researcher to submit high quality research proposal and that require clinician specialise in this area it be something i take very seriously and i would be very happy to work with she on it 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 my father the late alan bristow die of a brain tumour in april he be and that be incredibly sad but when a child die of a brain tumour it be unbelievably wicked brain tumour be still the big killer of young people what can the minister do to   ensure that appropriate funding be be put into research into brain tumour especially for young people and when will the government respond to the o’shaughnessy review into clinical trial in the uk which would help the brain tumour community 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and i be sorry to hear of his own personal experience he be absolutely right that in relation to child i be very keen to find a way forward the government be commit to find high quality brain cancer research and we expect to spend more as new research progress the £ of funding announce will remain available and if we can spend more on the good quality science we will do so we work really closely with lord o’shaughnessy on his review we have accept his recommendation and we have put in £ to support it 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the minister be aware i know of the outstanding campaigning work that my hon friend   the member for mitcham and morden siobhain mcdonagh   be do not least because of the experience of her sister our late great friend margaret mcdonagh with glioblastoma over decade now we have see no improvement in outcome no drug trial of any seriousness and no mandatory training of oncologist i have learn through experience that when the mcdonaghs come knock it be good to say yes and if anyone say no they will be hit by this unstoppable steamroller with that cautionary note in mind might the minister be prepared to meet i my hon friend and relevant stakeholder across the department nhs england and the national institute for health and care excellence to see what more can be do there be challenge i know but what more can be do to make sure that for family such as my hon friend ’s and margaret ’s and for thousand of other each year glioblastomas be not simply a death sentence 
 i thank the hon member for that question and join he in pay tribute to   the hon member for mitcham and morden siobhain mcdonagh especially after the tragic loss of her sister for all the work that she have do in campaigning on this issue i have spend significant time on the issue and i have meet she   the hon member for leicester west liz kendall campaigner charity and other hon member from across the house funding for research be available and have speak with the secretary of state i know that he be as keen as i be to work with colleague from across the house there be issue that transcend party politic and this be certainly of they i would be very happy to meet the shadow secretary of state the national institute for health and care research nhs england the tessa jowell brain cancer mission and clinical specialist to find a way forward 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of treatment for complex mental health illness in west yorkshire 
 nhs west yorkshire integrate care board have increase their investment in mental health service in line with their overall allocation increase they have spend more than £ in the past financial year on their mental health service 
 i thank the minister for that answer my constituent joanne allotey have custody of her young granddaughter who have complex mental health problem but local mental health service in leeds be still chronically underfunde after year of conservative government cut will the minister join i in commend roundhay high school for the support that it have give the family this be the same school that the former prime minister claim let down child and commit today to deliver truly effective child ’s education health and care plan 
 i absolutely pay tribute to the school in the hon gentleman ’s constituency i also point out that red kite view be a new unit specifically for young people in his constituency that bed mental health unit open last year and aim to eliminate out of area placement for young child with mental ill health i be sure that he would welcome that investment in his constituency 
 the joint committee on the draft mental health bill report back in january this year of the most important recommendation we make be about how people during a period of wellness could set out how they wish to be treat during a period of illness the government have yet to respond to the joint committee but can we have a mental health bill in the forthcoming king ’s speech please 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that issue there be many recommendation during pre legislative scrutiny we be work through those and we hope to be able to respond fully shortly after the summer recess 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as my hon friend   the member for leeds north east fabian hamilton   highlight all too often child be stick on long waiting list for treatment in west yorkshire child be currently stick wait for mental health treatment and more than people have have their mental health referral close without access treatment do the minister find that acceptable if the answer be no what will her government do about it this picture be not unique to west yorkshire but replicate across england this government be let patient down when be the minister go to act to tackle the crisis in mental health service 
 i thank the shadow minister for her question to highlight another initiative in west yorkshire the night owls overnight west yorkshire living advice service helpline have be set up for child and young people it be open between pm and be day a week for young people to access in addition to the helpline that be available i be sure that the shadow minister will also welcome the fact that we have more    than mental health support team in school in england cover child so that they can access mental health support directly at school 
 what step he be take to help tackle health inequality 
 we be tackle the root cause of health inequality we have double the duty on cigarette and bring in a minimum excise tax on the cheap cigarette that have help to drive down smoking rate from to a record low of we be go far help a smoker with our scheme to get people to stop smoke and start vape we have provide £ to start roll out new weight loss drug and in the major condition strategy we will talk far about how we will tackle health inequality 
 people in the north east die young than people in the rest of england and spend more year in ill health increase nhs waiting time leave they on medication for long the north east have the high level of people live in poverty leave many of my constituent unable to afford prescription charge some have tell i that they be take paracetamol instead of prescribed medication worsen health inequality will the minister commit to scrap these unfair prescription charge 
 out of prescription be not pay for but free at the point of delivery on the various important point that the hon lady make tackle health inequality be hugely important to we that be why we be create extra community diagnostic centre which be target at area of the high deprivation it be why we be roll out target lung health check in area of the most deprivation it be also why we be provide cost of live support worth about £ for the average household in this country it be of the most generous scheme anywhere in europe exactly to tackle those cost of living pressure and health inequality 
 my hon friend will be aware that health inequality can also be geographical within the south east with borough such as bexley have historically receive less funding than other part of london do he therefore agree that further investment in the fantastic queen mary ’s hospital sidcup would address that issue and improve health outcome for people in south east london 
 my hon friend be assiduous in make the case for his constituency minister of course will meet he to discuss this matter i know he be closely follow the progress of the cdc bid which we have be talk about those diagnostic centre be do fantastic work to get early diagnosis and save more life particularly in area of deprivation 
 i call the shadow minister 
 from this complacent minister ’s reply already would think that health inequality in england be improve not widen last year people include child be hospitalise for malnutrition in the   united kingdom that be the high number since comparable record begin why be so many people in britain go hungry under the tories 
 we need to have care in discuss these subject eat disorder be a sensitive subject and the statistic the hon gentleman be quote be a mix of different thing i have already talk about the £ of cost of live support that this government be provide to the average uk household with more targeted help for more vulnerable household it be something we be seize of and be work on 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 million of people with disability or serious medical condition rely on specialist equipment such as ventilator or home dialysis which personally cost they more money to run while give considerable saving to nhs hospital will the minister urge cabinet colleague in the department for work and pensions to help to tackle health inequality by ensure that those people receive a fair and timely reimbursement for those additional cost which be essential to run the equipment to help keep they alive 
 absolutely we be conscious of the additional need of people who have equipment like that by the end of june the government have cover nearly half of a typical household ’s energy bill through the support scheme we put in place but we be always look at what more we can do to help vulnerable household 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of primary care service closure on public health 
 each integrate care board be require to ensure access to gp service for all overall more people be be see in general practice than ever before about more than before the pandemic but where some practice close the local icb have to ensure that patient be transfer smoothly to other practice 
 park view medical centre in west derby of the most deprived area of my city be face imminent closure and there have be a lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process when deal with the icb to get the decision reverse in the minister ’s reply to my letter he say it be essential that if a gp surgery close it do not lead to a reduction in the quality of care for patient in the locality park view patient have be clear that dispersal to other surgery would be catastrophic especially when all gps be already face huge pressure will the minister urgently intervene to halt the closure due to the legal insufficiency of the consultation process and meet i and patient 
 i have look carefully at that case on which the hon gentleman have be campaign the incumbent provider choose not to bid for the future contract for park view medical centre and nhs cheshire and merseyside decide that the good thing be to help patient to transfer to neighbouring practice patient   will only be transfer to practice rat as good and there be other practice rat as good within a mile radius of park view since there have be an increase in the number of patient face staff of about in the constituency that mean there be more people in his gp surgery we be work hard to ensure high quality gp service in his constituency 
 health be devolve to labour in cardiff ynys môn be represent by member of the senedd yet health represent a of my postbag particularly relate to access to primary care in holyhead do the minister agree that family in holyhead be not get the healthcare they need and deserve 
 yes it be true i be afraid people be about twice as likely to be wait for treatment in the welsh nhs wait be also long in wales with people wait more than year for treatment even though those have be eliminate in england england spend more on general practice than scotland or wales despite the fact that wales have more funding and england have also grow spending on general practice fast than either scotland or wales we be highly focused on get good primary care service in england there be always lesson that we can learn from each other but there be definitely lesson that welsh labour can learn from the english nhs 
 what step his department be take to create a vaccine development and evaluation centre 
 the vaccine development and evaluation centre back by £ for state of the art facility at the porton down site have be operational since early last year it support the autumn vaccine roll out and the spring vaccine roll out early this year 
 in november dame kate bingham rightly call the decision to withdraw support for the valneva whole virus vaccine inexplicable because a broad portfolio of vaccine be important as we move forward against future variant the british society for immunology state that there be an urgent need for and generation covid vaccine include universal mucosal vaccine with long last protective immunity with grow public concern and mount clinical and scientific evidence of vaccine injury from mrna why be the uk not seek to harness the power of all technology instead of establish an inexplicable exclusive relationship with moderna 
 i confirm to the hon gentleman that in the recent spring campaign we deploy approve vaccine pfizer biontech moderna novavax and sanofi gsk as part of our roll out we be use a range of vaccine to protect we from the pandemic 
 whether his department have make an assessment with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of the availability of housing on young people ’s mental health 
 we be work with a number of government departments include the department for work and pensions and the department for levelling up housing and communities to tackle the effect of housing insecurity on young people ’s mental health 
 the mental health of young people be be impact by the fact that net migration be far too high and we be not build nearly enough house the government need to take action on that but young people worry that with an age population the health service will not be able to provide for they in future may i commend to the minister the excellent paper publish by the former labour prime minister tony blair which suggest thing such as co payment and personalised app would it not be ironic if a former labour prime minister be more radical on reform of the nhs than a conservative government 
 actually under this government last year the number of time buyer pass the mark which be the high number in year i will not take any lecture from a former labour prime minister because when labour be in government it saddle the nhs with a £ fail it system that never see the light of day an £ fail private finance initiative contract that nhs trust be still pay for and a gp contract that enable opt out at weekend and evening which patient still suffer from 
 today mark the year anniversary of the death of tom pirie who tragically take his own life just day after be assess as at low risk of do so by his counsellor over the last few year i have be work with tom ’s father philip on his campaign to improve suicide risk assessment procedure particularly in view of the upcoming year suicide prevention strategy review will the minister join i in pay tribute to tom ’s life and philip ’s excellent work in his memory by provide we with an update as to when we can expect the review to be publish 
 i absolutely pay tribute to tom and to his father i reassure he that we have many campaigner only last week we receive the baton of hope at no from those campaign to reduce the number of suicide in this country we be work on the suicide prevention plan and hope to be able to publish it very soon 
 what step he be take to tackle shortage in hormone replacement therapy 
 we continue to engage regularly with our supplier to prevent and mitigate supply issue in the short term we have over hrt product the vast majority be available we have that have serious shortage protocol attach to they but we be hop to improve supply on those very soon 
 although shortage of utrogestan be ongoing there be no alternative progesterone product recommend on the serious shortage protocol take oestrogen without progesterone can be dangerous provera be a synthetic progesterone alternative to utrogestan but it be not include on the hrt prepayment certificate will the minister commit to place provera on the list of product cover by the prepayment certificate as a priority and issue a public health warning highlight the risk of take oestrogen without progesterone 
 we be in the process of issue another bulletin to both gps and pharmacist on the serious shortage protocol and to make clear the alternative available that be a clinical decision i will certainly look at the issue of provera because medicine have to tick off a number of criterion to be eligible for the prepayment certificate i will certainly look into that particular drug on the hon lady ’s behalf 
 what step he be take to increase the social care workforce 
 social care depend on the skill and compassion of our care workforce that be why we be invest £ in reform care as a career with a new care qualification specialist training course for experienced care worker and a new career structure to support progression alongside increase funding for social care our national recruitment campaign and the care worker visa 
 we need many many more domiciliary care worker how will we get they 
 my right hon friend be right we have some good news skill for care datum show that home care job vacancy be fall something i hear when i speak to home care provider look ahead to next winter i want every local authority to have enough home care on hand that be why i emphasise the importance of home care when we distribute £ of discharge funding to local council and nhs organisation in april we be ask all local authority to plan ahead and book enough home care in advance for this come winter 
 be this not the very day to thank our care worker up and down the country so many family depend on those people who toil away day by day visit house often not be pay in between their visit could we look closely at recruitment and the agency involve let we get real pay for care worker up now 
 i think that every day be a good day to thank our care worker for their skill compassion and hard work we give social care a record funding settlement of up to £ in the autumn statement which be be use to help local authority increase the fee that they pay to care provider in turn enable care provider to pay their workforce well that be go hand in hand with extra funding to support discharge into social care this winter and our reform for the care workforce 
 what step he be take to ensure that people in care setting be permit family visit 
 i know how important it be for people in care home hospital and hospice to see their family and friend the majority of health and care provider follow national guidance i do not want anyone to worry about not be able to visit a love which be why in june we launch a consultation to change the law on visit 
 as the minister know last month i introduce my minute rule bill the care supporters bill to make sure that we recognise in law the value of the care of a love will her consultation differentiate between a care supporter and a visitor currently the care quality commission do not investigate individual case will it have the power to do that in future 
 i commend the hon member for his campaign on this issue he have be a powerful advocate and draw on his own experience as do i. he be probably ask i to pre empt the outcome of the consultation i encourage he and other concerned about this matter to put their view into that consultation and we will respond once it be close 
 what recent progress he have make in negotiation with the world health organisation on propose amendment to the international health regulations 
 the uk continue to negotiate on amendment alongside other member state of the world health organisation we want to ensure that the international health regulations be effective in prevent and respond to potential health threat leave the uk well prepare for future health emergency we anticipate negotiation to continue until the world health assembly in may next year 
 will the minister assure i that the propose change to the international health regulations be negotiate will not give new rule make power such as those table by bangladesh to the who director general to make binding direction on matter include border closure quarantining and vaccine passport even the who ’ own expert review committee have raise concern over such significant increase in power 
 as my right hon friend will know the uk have a strong commitment and duty to implement international law but on this matter we have be absolutely clear i can certainly assure she that we will not sign up to any ihr amendment or any other instrument that would compromise the uk ’s ability to make domestic decision on national measure concern public health 
 can the minister confirm whether the house will get a vote on the amendment to the international health regulations or will we not 
 should the uk government wish to accept an ihr amendment change to domestic law to reflect propose obligation may indeed be require the government would therefore prepare draft legislation and bring it before parliament in the usual way let i repeat that in all circumstance the sovereignty of the uk parliament would remain unchanged and the uk would retain control of any future decision around national public health measure 
 if he will publish the result of the consultation on give power to coroner to investigate stillbirth 
 the consultation on give power to coroner to investigate stillbirth receive response include from bereaved parent charity the chief coroner clinician and a range of other organisation 
 mr speaker you be very familiar with the problem over the implementation of my civil partnerships marriages and death registration etc act which pass this house in february section remain incomplete the consultation be complete in june mr speaker you be aware that i make attempt to get a meeting with the minister and a justice minister eventually i get it in march after the leader of the house intervene month on i have hear nothing and the consultation remain unpublished what will it take to get this legislation which everyone want and which be pass unanimously into law 
 i thank my hon friend for his work in this space and i apologise for the delay in publish the consultation i meet he along with a justice minister and i assure he that we hope to publish it very soon 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 last week on behalf of the government i sign a landmark partnership agreement with the pharmaceutical giant biontech it aim to deliver personalise mrna cancer immunotherapy include vaccine to uk patient by this work will harness the groundbreake mrna technology that biontech use in its world cancer vaccine cancer vaccine work by stimulate patient immune system to recognise and eliminate cancer cell prevent their spread trial for biontech ’s colorectal cancer vaccine be under way at multiple site across the uk to accelerate trial far biontech be partner with nhs england ’s new cancer vaccine launch pad a platform that make it easy for both early and late stage cancer patient to join vaccine trial in the come year hundred of patient identify by the launch pad will join trial for biontech ’s personalise cancer therapy broaden the treatment option available to cancer patient i hope the whole house will welcome the opportunity the deal offer future patient 
 the announcement that a new hospital between winchester and basingstoke be go ahead be much welcome by my constituent who will use it as well as by those from other constituency it will provide a centre of excellence with well medical outcome will my right hon friend meet local mp so we can update he on why the hospital need to be build as soon as possible 
 i be always very happy for my hon friend and other colleague to meet i or lord markham who lead the capital programme it be an important scheme we be deliver it through the standardised hospital approach use modern method of construction we be keen to progress early support work on site work closely with colleague 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last week the health secretary say that he be willing to offer doctor a high pay rise last night the chancellor slap he down say that any increase offer will have to be pay for by cut how can the health secretary negotiate an end to the nhs strike when he can not even negotiate with his own chancellor 
 we have be clear throughout that government decision on the pay review body recommendation be take on a cross government basis the agreement that we reach with the large group of nhs staff those on agenda for change have demonstrate that we be willing to work constructively with trade union colleague but the demand from junior doctor for a increase be not affordable indeed the hon gentleman himself have say that he do not support it 
 but the bad strike in the history of the nhs be still to come the impact of the junior doctor strike and the consultant strike will be devastating for patient the secretary of state have fail to stop these strike for month he have lose the confidence of nurse radiologist junior doctor and consultant and he can not even successfully negotiate with his chancellor so what be his plan to stop these strike go ahead 
 the hon gentleman ’s message be not even consistent with what he say at the weekend in the medium that he be not in a position to offer more money to the nhs and that the shadow chancellor have make that clear in a vain attempt to demonstrate some sort of fiscal responsibility the hon gentleman have be clear that he do not support the demand from doctor in training we be demonstrate that we be work constructively with group such as the agenda for change group the large staff group make up of over staff with which we have reach a deal we have also be respond constructively to the british medical association ’s principal demand for consultant which be for change to pension taxation we be willing to engage constructively with trade union colleague but the demand be not affordable he need to decide on his position which be it his position at the weekend that the opposition be not offer more money or his position today which seem to be that they will 
 i have campaign for more health service for my constituent since i be elect and of those who respond to my recent health service survey feel that we do not have enough doctor for the number of people in the constituency will my hon friend meet i to discuss how to sort this out and get my constituent the health service that they deserve 
 we be conscious that more be go on in general practice than ever before there be more appointment than before the pandemic as well as extra clinician and nearly more doctor but we be conscious of the pressure that put on the estate locally i would be very happy to meet and have further conversation with my hon friend 
 i be sure that the secretary of state share my concern that school nurse report increase rate of child present with health issue result from poor nutrition in scotland the snp government have roll out universal free school meal for all pupil in primary year to and special school and the expansion of the programme continue what discussion have the secretary of state have with cabinet colleague about follow scotland ’s lead and expand free school meal provision in england to improve child ’s health and wellbeing 
 of course we have regular discussion not just with cabinet colleague but with our counterpart across the uk i have a meeting just yesterday with health ministers include my counterpart in scotland on the share challenge on the issue that the hon lady raise as the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend   the member for harborough neil o’brien   say a moment ago we be provide significant support for household over £ in support but we also have measure that target school include holiday support measure and wide health and wellbeing measure such as our significant investment in school sport 
 the minister be fully aware of bupa ’s decision to close its dental clinic in york at holgate park i put on record my thank to he for work with i to find a solution for those constituent affect by the decision what be be do to reassess out of date dental contract so that we can ensure that increase demand be meet and that my constituent get the access to dental care that they deserve 
 we be take action which be why the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend the member for harborough meet my hon friend recently in his area of humber and north yorkshire there have be an increase in the number of child see by nhs dentist over the previous month so the picture be improve but we recognise that there be more to do that be why we have make a number of reform to the dental contract and why we will announce further plan shortly 
 a recent freedom of information request by the labour party reveal that mental health patient be leave wait more than hour for treatment in a&e last year last week of my constituent spend day in a&e wait for a bed on a psychiatric ward when will the government bring an end to this shameful situation 
 we be take significant action on mental health which be why we be invest £ more compare with year ago we have target measure as part of our urgent and emergency care recovery plan include mental health ambulance we be put in additional capacity such as crisis cafés to support emergency department we be also make mental health support available through for the time which will allow we to get to issue early before people be admit to hospital 
 i be delighted when the government award stockton a new £ diagnostic hub but my local labour council which be a partner in deliver the project appear happy to accept month of delay in complete it do my hon friend agree that labour ’s delay could cost life will he work with i to ensure that all partner understand the urgency of the project 
 that be hugely frustrating because i know how hard my hon friend campaign for the stockton community diagnostic centre and that he recognise the urgency of increase diagnostic capacity locally delivery plan have to be agree at a local level so i urge stockton council to work with he to meet the ambitious timeline and get stockton cdc open as soon as possible 
 a recent report by the trussell trust warn that people face hunger be more likely to be affect by spiral debt and a decline in their physical and mental health the same report show that in people in the uk face hunger in the last year due to a lack of money will the minister make representation to his colleague at the department for work and pensions about increase support for low income household thereby improve public health outcome for all 
 it be to protect public health that we have provide cost of live support worth £ on average per household and that be why we have be pay about half of people ’s average electricity and other energy bill however we always look at further thing we can do to drive improvement in public health 
 what step be the department take to prevent chronic kidney disease give that the recent report publish by kidney research uk predict a significant rise in case of kidney failure in year time 
 in the last year the national institute for health and care research have invest more than £ in kidney disease research nhs england be follow a    national approach to reduce healthcare inequality with a specific focus on some of the risk factor for kidney disease such as chronic respiratory disease as diabetes be the most common cause of kidney disease it will be a focus of our major condition strategy 
 in people who visit low vision clinic have be diagnose with clinical depression it be vital that blind and partially sight people have access to psychological therapy throughout their sight loss journey to address the impact however national institute for health and care excellence guidance do not include psychological support in the eye care pathway will the secretary of state commit to review the nice guidance to ensure that psychological therapy be integrate into the eye care pathway 
 the hon lady raise an important issue i would be keen to take it away and look at it to see how we can work together to pick it up 
 many of my constituent be still struggle to get nhs dental appointment so what be happen right now this week this month to increase the availability of nhs dental appointment for they 
 i know how intensely my hon friend be campaign on this issue the amount of nhs dentistry be deliver have go up by a over the last year partly as a result of the reform we be already roll out he will have see in the workforce plan that we be go to increase training place for dentist by so that we have the nhs dentist we need however that be not all we will do and our forthcoming dental plan will take further step 
 we have know for a while that our life expectancy be short than it be in however we be now see impact on child in the uk who be about cm short at compare for example with the child of our neighbour in holland what be the secretary of state do on this issue and will he support the all party parliamentary group on health in all policy in assess the impact on health and health inequality 
 of course we be take action to improve public health and that include child ’s nutrition that be why we be spend £ on healthy food scheme such as the school fruit and vegetable scheme the nursery milk scheme and healthy start it be also why we be invest £ a year in school sport and the pe premium and a furth £ through the youth investment fund we will continue to take action on this key issue 
 i be delighted that a new diagnostic centre be shortly to be build at our terrific woking community hospital very close to woke town centre do the minister agree that provide state of the art diagnostic care right in the heart of the community can cut nhs waiting list reduce carbon emission and most importantly help to optimise health outcome for patient 
 not only do i agree but i have be with my hon friend to see this scheme at hand he have champion the scheme vociferously and help to secure that investment for his constituent i look forward to work with he to ensure it be deliver as quickly as possible 
 plan to remove overnight primary care clinician from westmorland general hospital night a week be a massive risk to our community and mean that overnight people will be reliant on barrow or penrith for an out of hour doctor will the secretary of state instruct the icb to intervene to protect people in south lakeland from this massive reduction in the quality and accessibility of service 
 some of we remember when the lib dems be for great localism of the thing we be look at be how to empower commissioner on a place base basis to make decision on where good to place service we need to move more service into the community upstream to address the frail elderly before they get to hospital and to have more community service i be happy to look at the specific issue the hon gentleman raise but i would have think the lib dems would support the general trend of empower integrate commissioning system to make place base decision 
 several important pharmacy in my constituency include the in hawkhurst have be experience pressure with long queue of customer sometimes go outside the door it be say that access to train pharmacist be prove very challenging will the secretary of state comment on the situation and say what step he might be able to take to alleviate the pressure 
 there be a number of measure in the primary care recovery plan from how we well use the skill mix within pharmacy to how we deregulate some of the task that take up pharmacist time such as the requirement for a pharmacist to be present after drug have already be prepare or to clip out tablet because they do not match the number prescribe by a gp there be a number of area in which we can well use the skill mix and there be area where we can take load off pharmacist we be also fund additional service through pharmacy to support the pharmacy model 
 the number of death increase by in december particularly around influenza and pneumonia up by 26.2%—so york ’s public health team want to know what the government be go to do about winter planning and when 
 we set out comprehensive plan for winter preparation in the urgent and emergency recovery plan similar to what i say a moment ago this include make much well use of community scheme particularly those target at the frail elderly and make well use of technology through scheme such as virtual ward it have also put additional bed capacity into hospital with more than £ of funding for more permanent bed to help alleviate the pressure on bed occupancy and get flow through hospital which be so important to address the pressure on ambulance 
 i call the chairman of the health and social care committee 
 back to nhs dentistry i be afraid later this week the select committee will publish its report on nhs dentistry service spoiler alert it will be uncomfortable reading for some will the secretary of state tell we when and how he plan to bring forward plan for the tie in of newly qualified dentist could that go hand in hand with a return to the nhs campaign for dentist who have already leave that part of the service 
 it be characteristically astute of my hon friend to in on the tie in which be an important part of the long term workforce plan around third of dentist do not go into nhs work after training so have a tie in be more pertinent there than it might be elsewhere in the nhs workforce.[official report   july vol c. 8mc i look forward to the select committee ’s report but with some of the reform already in place we be boost the number of patient treat there be a more dental treatment in than in the previous year we be also make nhs dentistry more attractive with some of the change to the previous contract but we recognise that there be more to do which be why we will shortly set out our dental recovery plan 
 i have receive a wave of concern from clinician on the safety of use physician associate follow my adjournment debate last week in which i raise the death of emily chesterton the year old daughter of my constituent marion and brendan emily die of a pulmonary embolism after be see twice by the same physician associate at her gp practice the physician associate fail to refer she to a doctor or to a hospital emergency unit for test which the coroner conclude could have prevent her death 
 yesterday on good morning britain the secretary of state boast of increase the number of people work in primary care presumably include the workforce plan proposal to triple the use of physician associate will he look urgently at the detail of emily chesterton ’s case and ask himself whether lesson can be learn to avoid other preventable death 
 have respond to the hon lady ’s adjournment debate last thursday i hear the call she have make i know that she have also write to the secretary of state and i will ensure that she get a full response with answer to all the question she raise 
 my good friend the mental health minister the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend   the member for lewes maria caulfield will know that i have be busy beaver away together with the uk government ’s mental health ambassador dr alex george on the early support mental health hub project it will relieve pressure on child and adolescent mental health service and save undue distress and money the pilot scheme be ready to go might i suggest that the share outcomes fund could be the mean to press on with the pilot 
 dr alex george do a lot of fantastic work i be due to meet he shortly in the come day and i look forward to that discussion my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of get more mental health support into the community which be exactly what our additional funding be focus on deliver 
 community pharmacist in my constituency be report challenge on medicine supply what more be the minister go to do to get a grip of this situation 
 we have a long stand team in the department focus on medical supply which be a continual issue as a matter of routine business there be often challenge in that area if the hon gentleman have specific issue he wish to raise we would be happy to look at they but we have a dedicated team in the department that focus on that exact point 
 as my right hon friend know i have be campaign for £ of capital funding the majority of it for southend university hospital ever since i be elect i be grateful that he have recently confirm that the funding be secure a new business plan be be submit include £ of enable funding will he look upon that favourably and swiftly 
 as my hon friend know i have already meet she to discuss this scheme and the impediment be the business plan that come forward from the local   trust further work be be do on that she be right to highlight our capital investment more widely this government have commit to invest in the big ever hospital building programme with more than £ that be in addition to our long term workforce plan the time the nhs have do this in which we be make a furth £ of investment 
 be the minister aware that the nhs north east and north cumbria mental health and wellbee hub be due to close this september with mental health care in crisis in county durham that be an insult to the health and social care staff who desperately rely on those service will the minister reverse that decision 
 there be issue here be how much investment we be prioritise towards mental health the other be how local commissioner choose to prioritise service within those community and whether we try to run all of those decision from the centre in whitehall or embrace the integrate care system and allow they to make commissioning decision the bottom line be that we be spend much more on mental health with an increase of £ compare with the position year ago that be allow we to replace dormitory bed and provide mental health ambulance new mental health hospital project such as crisis cafés to support accident and emergency and £ to help those with mental health challenge get back into work which be of the good prevention measure we can take for people who be suffer with their mental health 
 with permission mr speaker i will update the house on the government ’s late effort to make the uk the most open innovative and competitive financial centre in the world 
 we know how important financial and related professional service be to this country they employ more than people and generate more than £ in tax revenue third of those job lie outside the south east and london as we lay the foundation for long term growth it be vital that these sector continue to succeed 
 last night at mansion house the chancellor make clear some of the policy that this government will pursue build on last year ’s edinburgh reform the full package of policy be publish this morning and i be pleased to share some of they with the house at this opportunity they fall under theme through a series of measure improve outcome for long term saver and increase investment in high growth company by reform the uk ’s pension market secondly incentivise company to start and stay in the uk by strengthen our position as a listing destination and thirdly reform and simplify   our financial service rulebook to ensure that we   have the most growth friendly market possible without compromise our commitment to high quality regulation 
 i begin with our pension market which be the large in europe and worth more than £ the market be mean to provide safe retirement income for later life in many case it do a very good job of that but it can do so much more i pay huge tribute to the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend   the member for sevenoaks laura trott for her crucial work on this 
 in lay out our plan the chancellor have set golden rule that in everything we do we will seek to secure the good possible outcome for pension saver with their need and foremost secondly that we will always prioritise a strong and diversified gilt market as we seek to deliver evolutionary change in our pension market and thirdly that the decision we take must always strengthen the uk ’s competitive position as a lead financial centre 
 today however uk institutional investor invest less in uk high growth company than their international counterpart while many define benefit fund be in surplus their return be low than some international peer and some may still be underfunde at the same time on their current trajectory some define contribution scheme may not provide the return that their pension fund holder expect 
 critically dc scheme also invest less than in unlisted equity australian scheme for example invest around to bridge that gap the chancellor join the lord mayor and chief executive of many of our large dc scheme to sign the mansion house compact its signatory who represent around third of the entire market be commit to the objective of allocate at least of their default fund to unlisted equity by unlock up to £ of investment in high growth company by that time help company to grow while improve rate of return for investor 
 to far boost return we will facilitate a programme of dc consolidation as the department for work and pensions pensions regulator and financial conduct authority response to the value for money framework consultation make clear investment decision should be make base on long term return and not simply on cost pension scheme that be not achieve the good outcome for their member will face be wind up by the pensions regulator and we will set out a road map to encourage new collective dc fund 
 to help scheme access a wide range of investment opportunity we have launch the lifts long term investment for technology and science competition which enable they to invest quickly and effectively in unlisted high growth company bid have already start to come in for up to £ of government support and we be consider they closely we will also explore the case for government to play a great role in establish investment vehicle build on the skill and expertise of the british business bank ’s commercial arm 
 meanwhile on define benefit scheme we recognise that the regulatory landscape be too fragmented and believe that there be scope for consolidation we have launch a call for evidence on the role of the pension protection fund and the part that define benefit scheme play in productive investment 
 take together our pension announcement will have a real and significant impact for an average earner who start save at the age of these measure could increase the size of their pension pot by over their career that be more than £ a year in retirement that be a real upgrade to the power and the outcome of our pension scheme 
 we already have the large stock market in europe and in we attract the most ipos initial public offering outside the us but we want the world ’s fast grow company to grow here and to list here we have now publish our near final draft legislation on prospectus reform which will create a more effective regime than its eu predecessor give company more flexibility to raise even large sum from investor more quickly we welcome rachel kent ’s excellent investment research review which be publish this morning and the government be accept all the recommendation make to we 
 as we continue to free ourselves from outdated retain eu law we have abolish protectionist rule such as the share trading obligation and double volume cap so that uk business can access the good and most liquid market anywhere in the world 
 finally we be ensure that our financial service sector have the regulatory freedom to innovate at a speed that match our modern world to that end the house recently pass the financial services and markets act which require our regulator to facilitate growth and international competitiveness alongside their other objective with it we have publish today legislation to repeal almost piece of retain eu law for financial service that be irrelevant to our market such as payment account regulation and long term investment fund and we say farewell to the unloved package retail and insurance base investment product this be not divergence for divergence ’s sake but sensible reform work with the sector 
 this be a significant body of work this government ’s vision for the uk be of long term growth fuel by strong british finance provide return for saver funding for business and investment for our economy that be what we be focus on and that be what these reform deliver 
 i thank the minister for an advance copy of his statement however after year of a low growth low investment economy these promise be too little too late on this government ’s watch far too many high growth firm particularly in the tech sector have be buy by foreign competitor or have choose to list in the us in order to scale up and grow 
 arm holding a uk tech success story be now set to float in new york rather than in london the chancellor have be completely silent on this when alarm bell be ring the ministers shrug their shoulder capital hold in pension fund be vital for the growth of our most innovative company in the us approximately of venture capital funding come from pension fund while in the uk the figure be below that be just not good enough this government ’s failure to mobilise pension money into productive asset come at a cost british pension saver have not be get the return that they should expect it seem that a person be more likely to own a share in uk infrastructure today if they be a canadian teacher rather than a british citizen 
 time and again the conservative party have promise action to unlock the patient capital that british firm need to thrive and grow but have fail to deliver there would surely be great confidence give to saver grow firm and financial service if the government have provide more detail yesterday on how to turn this around the chancellor ’s compact for dc pension fund lack any plan to ensure that this will increase investment in uk asset rather than simply go overseas what guarantee can the government provide that british high growth firm will be able to access the capital they need to thrive and create good job in every part of the uk with no clear roadmap how will that be achieve 
 i turn to what the chancellor say last night about want to make london a listing destination it be as though his party have not be in government for year now i remind the chancellor that he be sit around the cabinet table for the good part of a decade during that time labour have be call for action on list for month and the government have refuse to listen in the quarter of this year there be just london listing raise only £ the bad quarter for ipos in london since that be pitiful 
 i acknowledge and indeed welcome the fact that in some area the government be rather belatedly start to follow labour ’s lead but what have take they so long where be the urgency the ambition and the drive can the minister explain why there be nothing at all in the chancellor ’s speech on green finance that complacency put our status as a net financial centre at risk 
 labour be committed to ensure that the city retain its competitiveness outside the eu whether through create a positive environment for fintech or reform of solvency ii and do so without compromise on stability yet the government have promise solvency ii reform time in recent year with nothing to show for it 
 we and the country will not take any lesson on financial stability from a government that set fire to the economy last autumn with their mini budget that result in a tory mortgage bombshell with family face £ per month in high mortgage cost when remortgage through no fault of their own the truth be that the chancellor ’s mansion house speech be not a big bang at all it be a small splutter there be none of the detail require to build confidence no responsibility take for the last year of economic failure and no strategy to end the doom loop of tory economic failure 
 the labour party have a plan to unlock the full potential of the private sector to get the british economy grow again in the national interest through our active partnership with the city reform to the british business bank and a modern industrial strategy we will grow the economy and help britain to become the good place to start and grow a business this tired tory government be out of time it be time for they to step aside so that we can have a government who will favour the national british interest—[interruption there be no point conservative member laugh the truth be that we need a labour government to provide the energy the idea and the leadership that our country and our constituent desperately need 
 it be always a pleasure to listen to the hon lady in general what i learn be that the opposition have no plan it be all critique and no counter proposal she talk about this be too little too late but this government be move at pace in what the sector acknowledge as of the fast rate of implementation of financial service reform for a generation take advantage of our brexit freedom and the regain control of our rulebook which she and her party seek to oppose again and again 
 the hon lady talk about the lack of growth but under labour i be tell that the percentage of the workforce with a private pension decline by she also talk about patient capital which should not be a point of disagreement between we this government have do an enormous amount to support british patient capital with £ of investment and we have recently increase the length of the british patient capital scheme for a further period 
 the hon lady also talk about capital go overseas but that be nothing to the degree to which capital would be flood overseas be her party ever to return to power accelerate we to the point where once again the chief secretary to the treasury be write note to remind we there be no money leave i potentially discern a point of difference between we which perhaps in due course she will clarify in the approach to the compact it be not the position of this government to mandate where people ’s pension should be invest indeed the last time a labour chancellor decide what be good for our pension scheme it do not end well 
 finally the hon lady talk about green finance this government be do a copious amount on green finance only yesterday my right hon friend the secretary of state for energy security and net meet some of the world leader in green finance and early this year we publish an ambitious green finance strategy continue the uk ’s progression to be of the world ’s net align financial centre 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 i should probably note in this context that i be a trustee of the parliamentary contributory pension fund 
 i warmly welcome the work that the economic secretary and the pension minister have do in this important area and strongly endorse what the economic secretary say about its meaning that future pensioner will be able to retire with high pension income however he will know that i have put another piece of urgent work in his inbox about help the of our constituent who be unable to afford access to financial advice and have to rely on bog standard generic guidance can he update the house on how his review of the advice guidance boundary be go and how he will help the majority of people who save in define contribution scheme to get access to some sort of personalised coaching or guidance 
 it be always a pleasure to respond to my hon friend and to the work of her tremendous treasury committee which rag across this broad financial sector she be right to raise the question of access to financial advice i be afraid the world of financial service regulation be fraught with unintended consequence and unintended consequence of financial regulation and a grow compensation culture be to move financial advice beyond the financial ability of so many people who would benefit from receive it that be call the advice gap i and my official continue to work on that and i look forward to share proposal with the house and with my hon friend and her committee in the autumn 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i thank the economic secretary for his statement i agree with he on regulation where he say that regulator would be require to facilitate growth and competitiveness alongside their other objective however as he know unless the central bank be oblige to do the same we might end up in the rather odd and undesirable position of regulator and the central bank take contradictory action i want to ask mainly about pension reform under the mansion house compact potentially of the dc fund be to go towards unlisted equity there be huge potential in that for growth for innovation for job for global competitiveness and for scale up to compete but that come with a commensurate risk which be presumably up to of the value of the dc fund should the value of that unlisted equity be wipe out 
 while i hope the scheme succeed what liability would fall on the pension protection fund should it fail what liability might there be on the taxpayer if the scheme work and the value of the fund increase   what guarantee be there that the pension holder will receive the entire value of that increase and it will not be gobble up by unnecessary and excessive fee 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his support for growth and competitiveness we have talk regularly about the need for regulator to improve their performance and deliver well outcome for those whom they regulate he talk about the and i emphasise that ultimately it be a voluntary pact it be for the individual trustee to make those decision and the government continue to have in place a strong programme of regulation however i hope he respect the fact that there be risk in inaction as well the risk that our pension beneficiary do not receive the pension that they deserve or the sort of performance from their pension that other international long term saver benefit from he raise the issue of define contribution and the liability for the taxpayer of course that do not attach to define contribution scheme which be why it be so important that they continue to benefit from the high quality regulation i and my colleague the pension minister remain very committed to that and will continue to work with tpr and the fca to ensure that that remain the case 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests like my hon friend   the member for west worcestershire harriett baldwin i warmly welcome the work that my hon friend on the front bench have do the mansion house compact be a huge step forward but do my hon friend the minister agree that get the kent investment review reform right particularly on unbundling will also help we to have high quality research enable well decision and more investment into high quality firm 
 my hon friend who know so much about this topic and have engage so lucidly on it be absolutely right about the importance of investment research it provide access to market make our uk stock exchange an attractive international venue narrow spread and drive fair valuation for investor and company seek investment this be example of where we inherit a european fact pattern that be not quite right for the uk i look forward to pensioner investor saver and company benefit from our research review 
 i call the chair of the work and pensions committee 
 define benefit pension fund have long be under pressure to invest in government gilt rather than the productive economy so i welcome the change of direction that the minister have announce he have indicate how much extra pension fund investment will go into high growth company in future will he indicate what share of that he expect to go into uk high growth firm rather than overseas he have indicate i think a replacement for the current charge cap on pension fund with a wide value for money assessment but can he indicate when we be likely to see the detail on what exactly he and the under secretary of state for work and pensions   the hon member for sevenoaks laura trott have in mind for that 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his contribution on how we can deliver the good pension for long term saver there be no estimate for the share of the uk we be mobilise an additional £ of asset over time that be evolution not revolution we would expect and it be the job of this government to present that investment capital with a wave of attractive option across some of the fast grow sector as the prime minister and chancellor have lay out and to remove friction and obstacle as people seek to invest in the uk create a conducive environment for that investment but fall short of mandate it in the knowledge that the allocation to international investment for some of our actively manage scheme already exceed that of other comparable company on the charge cap we be this morning publish a consultation on the new value for money framework clearly we want to continue ensure that pensioner benefit from fair charge but also that that do not come at the expense of the underlying performance that they receive 
 i welcome this set of measure particularly the ending of the package retail and insurance base investment product regime and the introduction of the mansion house compact on which some of we have lobby the government i will share key concern with the minister on fintech and early stage business we have a problem in this country because the pension fund industry have divest itself of uk equity to the detriment of the london stock exchange and ultimately of financial service generally it trouble i that that be not focus on early stage start up in the uk unlike many other domestic pension fund which do support their own more generally a big piece of the jigsaw be miss in my view pension fund have generally divest themselves of uk equity to such a great extent some estimate suggest a reduction since that we need to see more encouragement by government to get the pension fund to use their wealth by put it into uk equity for the betterment of the uk economy after all they do benefit from tax break 
 i thank my hon friend for his as ever apposite point that encouragement be exactly what the proposal be all about work voluntarily with the sector and encourage it to lean in i want people to see as a potential floor not a ceiling many will seek to go much far forward the broad objective of the government be to provide good access to capital at every stage of a government ’s life whether it be our support for the seed enterprise investment scheme the enterprise investment scheme or the venture capital trust the expansion of the pool of individual investor who be able to invest directly in the stock market and some of the opportunity that he talk about all the way through to ensure that our listed and private capital market work extremely well that be the objective of the reform 
 i call the chair of the public accounts committee 
 i draw the house ’s attention to the fact that i be a trustee of the parliamentary contributory   pension fund forgive i if i be a little sceptical about government involvement in pension fund we have see how the annual and lifetime allowance announce at the dispatch box by a former chancellor have play out it be also this government who take we through mccloud in the public sector the minister say that the average earner who start save at could increase the size of their pension pot by over their career can he give the house example of the assumption behind that figure and will he publish the modelling behind it 
 the government actuary ’s department be the source of those figure which we publish this morning i draw the hon lady ’s attention to that fact clearly there be a number of assumption within that i do not think it be right to be sceptical these be reform that have be form with wide consultation include from across the house i hope that we can form a grow consensus so that the industry receive a signal from this place that it be ultimately time to stop talk and to get on with investing that be the outcome that we seek 
 i welcome the statement particularly the aim to unlock asset in the local government pension scheme through an acceleration of pool with the aim of double exist investment in private equity to which could unlock £ by do the economic secretary agree that the reform be a welcome step to improve our growth prospect and boost investment 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend the local government pension scheme be a huge opportunity for this country in many case it be already very progressive it be invest in local opportunity and allocate its capital to the sort of private growth asset that we wish to seek with £ under management an increase rate of progress towards asset pooling which as the government have make clear should attract at least £ will provide the scale to invest well on behalf of beneficiary that be a great opportunity for we all 
 the number of company list on the london stock exchange have plummet to such an extent that the market value of apple be now great than the entire ftse recently cambridge base chip giant arm decide to list in new york rather than in london do the minister think that the mansion house compact will reverse the trend of british base company decide to list elsewhere 
 yes 
 this be an excellent package but way to ensure that investment flow to productive enterprise be to prevent it from be crowd out by grow government debt be n’t it
