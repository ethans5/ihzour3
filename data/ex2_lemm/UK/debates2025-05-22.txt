 what step her department be take to support the provision of grassroots sport facility in cannock chase constituency 
 the government know the value of grassroots sport facility to community and the role that they play in get people active sport england invest over £ of lottery and government funding each year in the community that need it most 
 i very much welcome the minister ’s response through the park tennis project cannock chase have benefit from £ of investment from the government and the lta tennis foundation to revive tennis court in of our park but the notorious british weather remain a barrier to participation and many in my town and village lack access to covered tennis and padel facility with the park tennis project come to an end will the minister consider fund the development of more cover court to allow my constituent to enjoy tennis whatever the weather 
 this government want to ensure that everyone from all walk of life can get active in any way that work for they come rain or shine i therefore welcome the lawn tennis association ’s strategic ambition to grow tennis and padel by make it accessible welcoming enjoyable and inspiring but all future decision on sport facility will be consider in the spending review 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the support of   the hon member for cannock chase josh newbury   for our investment in his constituency while we be in government in all seriousness however i would like to put on record our condolence to the family of the israeli embassy staff kill overnight in washington 
 grassroots facility be key to our community and our sport club across the country which be why we conservative invest more than £ in the next generation of athlete however in just month this labour government have cut the £ multi sport grassroots facility programme scrap the £ lionesses fund and cancel £ of open school facility grant equally worryingly they be now try to remove sport england ’s statutory role in protect sport pitch and play field across the country be it not clear that only the conservatives will save our sport pitch from this say thing and do another labour government 
 i simply do not recognise the shadow minister ’s comment and i will not take any lesson from the conservatives on facility give that they oversee a decade of council cut that leave many of our sport and leisure facility in desperate need of renovation

 the programme of cultural co operation which the secretary of state sign early this month create significant opportunity for the uk ’s cultural sector to reach a market of over people in india we expect this agreement to create skilled job and opportunity for young people from southall to kolkata over the next year 
 the liberty cinema in my constituency of ealing southall now the himalaya palace shopping centre be the cinema in the country to regularly show bollywood film and southall have form the backdrop of many a bollywood movie since then so i welcome this agreement to increase co operation between the uk and indian film industry for the benefit of both economy what more can the government and the minister do to encourage cultural partnership so that the next generation of the british indian diaspora in southall can continue to enjoy their vibrant heritage 
 there could not be a well constituency mp than my hon friend to highlight this subject and to show this symbolic uniting of indian and british culture i think british bhangra originally come out of ealing southall and so many anglo indian writer have be quintessential in determine the future of the british language and will be part of our literary future i be absolutely delighted that we have this cultural agreement and we be determined to work with our indian colleague on progress all the idea that my hon friend and other have come up with 
 i call the chair of the culture media and sport committee 
 whether it be bollywood hollywood or borehamwood i be sure the minister will agree that our british cultural and creative industry be our global economic superpower while the secretary of state be awol today rumour abound that the whole department for culture media and sport be for the chop the minister must see that this send a terrible message to those sector about how little their government value the power of those industry will he take this opportunity to put that rumour to bed and if he can not will he take this chance to put on record that it be a horrible idea 
 if we be to get rid of the department of the bad consequence would be our have to get rid of the select committee as well and for that matter all those on the opposition front bench oh hang on maybe it be a good idea 
 no let we be serious the secretary of state be not absent without leave she be do the very important job of build our relationship with japan secondly i be not go to put this rumour to bed i be go to bury it i be absolutely certain that in a year ’s time we will be able to sing in the word of stephen sondheim from the musical follies i ’m still here

 hartlepool be home to a number of thrive tennis club include hartlepool lawn tennis club found in it be of the old active tennis club in the world despite that history we do not have access to cover tennis court which mean that poor weather common in hartlepool often disrupt participation particularly for those with a disability or a long term health condition early this week top british tennis player call on the uk government to invest in a new national network of cover tennis court and i want for hartlepool will the minister consider their request so that every community can take part in tennis come rain or shine 
 my hon friend be a passionate advocate for his constituency and it be great to see the passion of the lead player i wish they all success in their upcoming event and i be personally very excited to see the return of woman ’s tennis to queen’s the queen ’s club championship after year all future decision on facility will of course be consider in the spending review but i be very happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that far 
 together with the lta the previous conservative government invest £ in park tennis courts—2,500 of they all over the country include in and around hartlepool that be to the benefit of local community so why be this government not continue that investment

 what progress her department have make on remove barrier for uk artist seek to tour in the eu 
 i be absolutely delighted that the prime minister ’s eu uk deal include a direct reference to the importance of tour artist and cultural exchange i have already be in touch with my eu counterpart commissioner and i intend to take the matter forward as soon as i can 
 i be grateful to the minister for that response but it be over year since i raise this matter in an urgent question in the house of commons in that time nearly half of uk musician say that they have lose work in europe and precious income as they confront all the brexit barrier visa issue and cabotage restriction the labour manifesto vow to resolve this and we be all grateful for the warm word in the reset document but real action be require when can we see our wonderful uk artist back in the concert hall and arena of europe travel freely and without any restriction 
 that be absolutely our aim and intention and the hon gentleman know that i be as commit to that as he be obviously the uk eu deal be very good but we want to make sure that we pursue all the individual issue that be raise that have not yet be resolve and this be of they as i say i have already make contact with commissioner micallef and i intend to chase this down as fast as i can i know the hon gentleman do not like be happy but if i might just quote hamlet to he 
 our doubt be traitor 
 and make we lose the good which oft we might win 
 by fear to attempt 
 i think we ’ve get the return of sir john hayes 
 i thank the minister for his encouraging remark about the progress of the uk eu deal do he agree that the change that we be make will support the vitality of london ’s west end and provide a strong foundation for tackle the issue of carnet in our future negotiation with the eu so that we can continue this great work 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the west end of london be very important to not just our film industry but our tourism cultural exchange with other country in europe be a really important part of the deal that we have strike and we want to build on that the more we can do so over the come month the well mr speaker i do not know if you talk to your counterpart anywhere else in europe but if you could raise the matter with they as well that would be very helpful 
 marvellous we ’ll talk to carolyn harris now no i do apologise i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 thank you mr speaker i be pleased to not be forget today interruption if we be abolish perhaps we will all be forget there have be previous positive statement on tour performer but there be no concrete good   news in the uk eu deal tour performer be reliant on this department to fight their corner as be the rest of the creative industry not least on artificial intelligence and copyright which we be talk about later today the minister say he be bury the rumour about the abolition of dcms so why do so many people here think it will happen and why be it be brief to the press so often 
 the question i be ask myself be why on earth be the hon gentleman perpetuate daft rumour honestly the department be not go to be abolish it would be absolute madness this department touch the life of nearly everybody in the country every single day of the week whether through sport football rugby cricket tennis broadcasting or our wonderful creative industry so many different aspect of what we do touch everybody ’s life i can not see any way in which the department will be abolish 
 the hon gentleman ’s question be about eu touring if he talk to all the liberal lean government in europe i talk to all the socialist lean government in europe and the tories speak to well their colleague in europe for that matter reform could speak to some of the barmpot in europe then we might manage to secure eu touring

 my hon friend be absolutely right it be great that the theme park be come the shadow secretary of state say that it be all down to he but he do not get it across the line the whole point of a deal be that it be not a deal until you actually get it across the line which we do my hon friend be also right that we do not just need to develop massive theme park we also need small venue such as the he refer to where i think george ezra have perform and where coldplay have perform twice in the past that be reason i be really glad that we have now manage to get over the line a levy on arena ticket to help fund small music venue across the whole of the uk

 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister will know that our creative sector include our artist writer publisher and the fashion industry to name a few be all fight for their professional life as artificial intelligence company use their intellectual property for ai model why will the government not put an end to the ai copyright issue and back the amendment from the lords which have such overwhelming support 
 for a start we will have that debate this afternoon i be determined that through this whole process we will get to a place where creator of every different kind whether in music word or image will be able very easily to protect their copyright and gain remuneration i also want to get to a place where ai company will pay for the work that they look at and use to create their system i note that the conservatives be all over the shop on this issue they have a have a free vote a vote on side and a vote on the other side and we will see whether even their front benchers vote this afternoon 
 recently i have be contact by constituent with concern that break into the art and creative industry and stay in those industry be incredibly difficult for those from low income background or those live outside major city and medium hub as the minister know have visit monmouthshire many time we have no city only small town what action be the government take to create more opportunity for talented people to enter and stay in the art industry regardless of their background 
 my hon friend make a good point of the thing that worry i about the creative industry in the uk be that often the only people who conceive of they as a possible career be those whose parent work in they i do not want the creative industry to be hereditary i want everybody to have a chance whatever their background that be partly about   make sure we champion the creative industry which be our economic future we must embrace they and ensure that everybody get a decent chance in life 
 apart from the sensational ice cream i be sure the minister will join i in congratulate skegness on be award the prestigious blue flag for the quality of its beach i be concerned that not enough people can enjoy that however because of the lack of direct public transport from london national express have not restore its coach service since the pandemic and there be no direct train from london to skegness will he work with i and the department for transport to try to improve direct transport link 
 that be a bit transporty for i the good ice cream in britain be produce in the rhondda by subzero and i be happy to have a contest with the hon member any day of the week on that front if he want secondly i suggest gently to he that of the reason the beach in the uk improve be that we join the european union before our membership of the european union all our beach be filthy and cover in tar 
 and obviously frederick ’s ice cream in chorley 
 early this week i attend the launch of the independent venue community which be a charity aim to bring community activity into night time music venue when they be usually closed do the minister agree that such innovative thinking be beneficial to health and wellbeing the art sector more generally and town centre renewal what support can the department offer to see such scheme roll out nationwide 
 all i really want to say be yes because i agree with everything my hon friend say since you like brevity mr speaker and brevity be the soul of wit i be just go to say yes 
 of the good experience i have as a minister in dcms several year ago be visit place around the country i extend an offer to the minister to come to salisbury to see the work of wiltshire creative salisbury international art festival be start this weekend and we would welcome his insight on how collaboration to maximise investment in cultural growth in south wiltshire can be facilitate

 cannock chase be home to many fantastic dance school such as the crystal academy in hednesford which have be crown dance school of the year dance can empower people from all background but a of school be not teach it despite its be on the national curriculum a varied high quality sport offer   should not be only for a privileged few what step be the government take to ensure that all school can inspire their student through dance 
 i think my hon friend ask what step i be take to promote dance well it take to tango and we be work with the department for education to try to ensure that creative education be a really important part of everything we do in all our school the fact that few kid be now study creative subject be a problem and we need to rectify it 
 i hear the minister mention this in pass but would he not concede that the voluntary grassroots music levy be not make the progress we have all hop for the music venue trust have reveal that almost of arena and stadium show do not have any levy at all we need that income to rejuvenate grassroot venue the minister know that surely it be now time to think of a formal levy and even legislation if require 
 i have say that we will make the levy statutory if we need to do so but we be make progress i have want we to have make substantial progress by the quarter of this year the levy have already be apply to half a ticket and i want to get to much big number by the end of the year the culture media and sport committee do a really good job in come up with the idea and we be determined to push it forward if the hon member could be less grumpy that would help if he could ring everybody he know in the industry and persuade they to sign up to the levy that would be great 
 as this labour government deliver a national youth strategy and open a network of young futures hub what assurance will the minister give that the department will learn from the good practice of charity such as the thirst youth café and futurehope in my constituency will she join i to meet they and find out more about how they deliver for young people in hertford and stortford 
 the government value youth service and we know the vital role they can play in young people ’s life i have have a number of cross government meeting on this issue in the last few week we continue to work on our national youth strategy and if my diary allow i will be delighted to visit 
 i will enter the great parliamentary ice cream competition and say that cheshire of course do the good ice cream 
 give the huge rich in the premier league should there not be a great expectation that more money flow down into grassroots football and non league club such as knutsford fc and witton albion in my constituency which work unbelievably hard just to stay afloat i say that especially as so many premier league footballer live just up the road from the club 
 the hon lady make an important point it be not for government to decide that but i know from my own experience that grassroots club    play a huge role in community the premier league contribute a lot it be up to the premier league to decide how much money it put down the pyramid 
 the issue of copyright and creative be big in the news because of artificial intelligence but it have also be a long run issue and it be good that the spotlight be on it will the minister look into a levy on it equipment so that people who provide their creative material on that receive some effective royalty as happen under the book lending scheme this be an early idea but if he start talk about it now in government we might get some success 
 i be happy to look at anything but we be reluctant to start put levy on thing that close down the british business my hon friend make a good point about try to make sure that people have an opportunity to make a career and a living out of the creative industry it strike i that with more than of people work freelance in the industry that be of the thing we definitely have to look at and i know that my hon friend have a large sector in her constituency 
 somerset be home to some iconic film location such as glastonbury tor which feature in the kid who would be king montacute house which feature in wolf hall and sense and sensibility and wells where hot fuzz be film what step be the minister take to ensure that the film industry in the uk thrive and continue to use our iconic location

 there have be rapid expansion of new home in my constituency however the development of sport facility in area such as ashby de la zouch be not keep pace and in hugglescote we see a fight to save the rec how will the minister ensure that when new home be create we protect and develop new sport facility in park for local people 
 this government be commit to grassroots sport that be why we have invest over £ this year however i will reflect my hon friend ’s comment in discussion with the relevant department 
 billinghay swimming pool in my constituency be a much cherish local facility which have sadly fall into disrepair and be unable to open for the community this year a very good local group be try to raise fund to restore it what can the minister do to help 
 local authority suffer huge cut under the previous government and that be why many swimming pool have fall into disrepair i will   look into the issue for the hon lady i also understand that there be a westminster hall debate on a similar subject the week back after recess 
 the band i play in never quite get to a european tour—[interruption artist tell i how much they and their team have suffer in the disastrous post brexit landscape for tour artist we have the good band and artist in the world and they bring huge joy to we here they want to share the love abroad and in so do bring a lot of money to the uk economy will my hon friend assure i that he be act with haste as shakespeare say 
 all the world ’s a stage 
 and all the man and woman merely player 
 they have their exit and their entrance 
 let we open more door for they 
 and 
 man in his time play many part 
 clearly my hon friend be of those people we be determined to sort this out i know that there be many of we who fear that we lose many thing when brexit happen however there be other wise word from shakespeare as queen margaret in henry vi say 
 wise man ne’er sit and wail their loss but cheerily seek how to redress their harm 
 the amazing dancer at eastbourne ’s shin stars dance academy have qualify for the dance world cup in spain this july it will cost thousand of pound to get they there though so they have launch a crowdfunding campaign will the minister back their campaign to get to the world cup and congratulate they for their achievement 
 yes and if the hon member send i a link i will contribute myself

 i reiterate that it be really important that member include my hon friend continue to raise this issue and hold the church to account the church   be undertake detailed work to look towards seek to go with a fully independent model in the meantime the church be get on with set up the external scrutiny body which be likely to be on a statutory basis in order to give it depth and may require legislation as i have say on many occasion in church commissioners question it be so important that the church seek to restore and rebuild trust and that begin with ensure that we have a credible model for safeguard 
 i thank the church estates commissioner for her response the church should always be a place for those who seek help assistance support and comfort whenever thing have happen that be completely against the teaching of the bible for those who carry out these heinous crime there must be no excuse and no apology they must go to court to face the allegation that be make against they and then when the crime be prove they must be send to jail the church ’s foundation be god and the teaching of the bible those who carry out those crime deserve absolutely no help within the church whatsoever

 what assessment the church have make of the potential merit of implement an independent safeguarding process 
 at the general synod in february i call for a fully independent model for safeguard synod do not adopt that approach but do commit to undertake some detailed work that would ensure it   could work towards that sort of model as i say early in my response it be vital that the church seek to begin to restore and rebuild trust and confidence in it 
 i thank the hon lady for that answer horribly and tragically of my constituent be a victim of abuse in the church of england we must never forget that there be victim and survivor involve here and they be dismay when early this year the church of england ’s govern body reject a fully independent safeguarding model to deal with abuse case the church should not fall behind other organisation on safeguard the hon lady have give i her answer already but can she reassure i that she will continue to push for a fully independent body as that must be our goal 
 absolutely i be at that meeting of synod and it be disappointing that my preferred model of full independence be not adopt we owe it to those like the hon lady ’s constituent who be a victim and be now a survivor to ensure that the church work at pace towards a fully independent model for safeguard

 whether the commission be take step to comply with the supreme court judgment in the case of for women scotland   the scottish ministers of april

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for education if she will make a statement on whether the government will be accept the school teacher review body ’s pay recommendation for 
 may i start by thank our teacher school leader and school staff for all they be do right now to ensure a successful exam season for student and indeed for all their hard work throughout the year 
 rather than scaremongere with fantasy statistic the government be get on and deliver we be already see positive sign that our plan for change be work teacher recruitment be up with more people in training than last year teacher retention be up with thousand more teacher forecast to stay in the profession over the next year this labour government be get on and deliver unlike the opposition who last year sit on the strb report hide from their responsibility and leave it to labour to sort out this afternoon we will announce the teacher pay award which will be the early announcement for a decade 
 we understand the importance of give school certainty give they time to plan their budget and ensure that they can recruit and retain the expert teacher our child need the secretary of state ’s write ministerial statement will be come out this afternoon—[interruption it will show once again that this labour government 
 order i have grant the urgent question so please will member on the opposition front bench wait for the minister to finish her answer i do not want you ms trott and mr o’brien to be a bad example of this school class 
 the write ministerial statement be lay before the house and will be come out this afternoon show once again that this labour government be get on and deliver on our plan for change 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 mr speaker this be absolutely outrageous it be astonishing that we have have to summon the government to the house today but the minister can not even tell we what pay rise teacher will get and whether it be go to be fund that do not allow we to scrutinise the matter in this house 
 the government say that they would tax private school to fund more teacher but the reality be that state school have not get any of that money instead we have have break promise on compensate school for the job tax confirmation from the department for education itself that there will be a shortfall in teacher pay funding which we be not allow to discuss here today in this urgent question and uncertainty as to what the actual pay rise for teacher will be that be a disgrace and it be the opposite of what people who vote for labour expect 
 all that be in the final week when headteacher up and down the country have to decide whether to make teacher redundant in time for september in fact sadly many school will already have make the difficult decision to let good teacher go these be job loss on the minister ’s watch due to her inability to provide school with the clarity that they need do not just take my word for it dan moynihan from the harris federation say that it propose to make to teacher redundant jon coles the chief executive of united learning which run state sector academy say that the trust have be leave with £ a year of unfunded cost he say 
 it ’ no good treasury wave their hand and say efficiency’—that would be job loss sector wide that would extrapolate to ruinous harm in the well function public service ten of thousand of redundancy 
 simon pink the finance director at the elliot foundation which have primary say 
 this be the tough budget in a generation 
 secondary school headteacher have already have to cut teaching assistant post and a teacher role due to rise national insurance and anticipate wage rise 
 what be the pay rise that the government recommend for teacher the prime minister ’s spokesman say on   april 
 there ’ll be no additional funding for pay 
 yesterday the government start to u turn on the winter fuel allowance will the minister now fully u turn and fund the national insurance rise and agree to fully fund the pay increase whatever they be 
 neither i nor any minister in this government will take lesson from conservative members who after long year in power have still not restore real term spending in our school to the level that they inherit the brass neck of the opposition be quite extraordinary conservative members would also do well to remember the difficult decision that this government have have to take because of the utter mess that they leave behind the right hon lady be in the treasury create the mess she know very well what happen 
 recruiting retain and support expert teacher be central to our vision for deliver high and rise standard in our school despite the challenging financial context and year of miss recruitment target under the previous government this administration be prioritise education and ensure that every child have access to a high quality teacher we be work at pace to ensure excellence for every child that be why we remain committed to our manifesto pledge for teacher and to ensure that it respond to the demand in secondary school special school and further education 
 we know that high quality teaching be the in school factor that have the big positive impact on a child ’s outcome break down barrier to opportunity for every child so recruit and retain high quality teacher be clearly absolutely central to our vision for deliver high and rise standard that be why despite the challenge financial context and year of miss recruitment target we be get on and deliver on our plan for change the right hon lady will have to wait like everybody else for the statement that she know be come this afternoon 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 teacher pay be absolutely vital for the status of the profession for the quality of life of teacher and for recruitment and retention of the vital skilled and qualified staff who be the backbone of our education system it be really important that the government ’s response this afternoon begin the work of restore teacher pay after the last year when we see by any objective measure a shocking erosion in teacher pay under the previous government that have affect recruitment and retention and have a devastating impact on teacher morale those on the conservative benches should take note of that because we would all benefit from a little more humility in the context of the legacy that they leave behind 
 can i press the minister on the extent to which the pay award will be fund we know that there be already extensive pressure on school budget and school be very anxious about that matter also will this afternoon ’s statement include support staff pay and will it begin the process of restore that pay we know how vital our teaching assistant and other support staff in our school be 
 i thank my hon friend for her thoughtful contribution i find it somewhat disconcert that she be be barrack by conservative members when she perform a really important function for this house and be very assiduous in hold the government to account rightly so as that be her role she be right to reflect on the degradation of teacher pay over the past year indeed the thing this government do be get last year ’s strb recommendation out of the drawer and process it a recommendation that the last government hide and frankly run away from 
 we implement the pay award we absolutely recognise that pay be a really important part of ensure we have the high quality teacher that we need the start salary for teacher be now at least £ outside of london and at least £ in inner london we be make progress we be see the green shoot of more teacher join the profession and stay in it and we will continue to support that trajectory in any way we can my hon friend have also rightly highlight the vital work of support staff in school the government ’s approach in that regard will be confirm in this afternoon ’s write ministerial statement as will all the detail that my hon friend so keenly anticipate 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 each and every week i hear from teacher and school leader in my constituency and across the country in my time in this place never have their outlook be as gloomy as it be right now after year of underfunding and neglect from the conservatives school now face a double blow of underfunded national insurance increase and unfunded teacher pay rise if the report be to be believe together these represent massive cut to school budget frankly school expect well from labour 
 school governor in my constituency recently tell i that they be all set deficit budget which describe as beyond imagine that be why teacher be so desperately worried parent be too because   ultimately it be our child who will suffer and the most vulnerable at that the government ’s claim that school can find the money through efficiency simply do not stack up budget be already cut to the bone with school rely on parent to buy they the basic such as glue stick through amazon wish list they be already cut back subject cancel trip and cut back on teaching assistant mean that child with special educational need and disability will suffer the most and now they be plan redundancy budget decision for next year be already be make we need urgent clarity about whether the pay rise will be fund so will the minister tell school across the country where exactly they be expect to find this money 
 there be an awful lot of imagining in the hon lady ’s question and understandably so less understandable though in relation to some of her comment the statement be due today and the hon lady will have to await it as will all member of this house and those who be keenly look at their school budget to ensure they can provide the good education possible i know that be what school be rightly focus on do and we be focus on support they to do that 
 i gently remind opposition members that this be the early strb announcement in a decade because we recognise how important budgeting be for school and how important it be that they have this information in a timely way that be not respect under the previous government we want to provider this information in good time and give notice as early as possible so that school can plan the excellent outcome for child that i know they be strive for we will also support they to use their funding as efficiently as possible the department have work on a whole suite of productivity initiative as well as support for school to manage energy cost and banking cost and to minimise any expenditure that be not on the frontline support child that be what we will continue to do 
 i reiterate what the chair of the select committee my hon friend   the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes say teaching assistant be the glue that keep our classroom together and they should be pay adequately i be pleased to hear the minister state that retention be up with more teacher in training as a former teacher i understand that workload be often cite as a reason that we do not retain teacher marking lesson planning admin and data entry all keep teacher away from spend time with their student can the minister update we on what work her department be do with respect to artificial intelligence and its roll out in our classroom to reduce teacher workload and get they in front of student 
 i welcome the constructive nature of my hon friend ’s question because regardless of any announcement this afternoon we know that school be work hard to deliver for child as a government we need to work our hard and we be to support they to do so that mean a whole range of productivity measure to support teacher with their workload to support school with their cost and to ensure we grab the opportunity of technological development so that   any teacher ’s time be maximise with child in the classroom help they with their learning and be support with technology to maximise child ’s outcome we will continue to work we be very much look forward and unfortunately those on the opposition benches seem constantly to be look back 
 for the government to come here today fulling know their pay rise intention but refuse to say so until this afternoon to avoid scrutiny be disrespectful to this house to every member to every constituent and to every teacher if i may say so it be somewhat cowardly school across my constituency find themselves short of money to cover national insurance bill school in my constituency that have approach i be £ short between they do the minister know how many school be short of money to pay their national insurance bill 
 on the hon lady ’s initial comment let i say that there be process and procedure in this house that we respect we respect this house and we will continue to do so there be a process by which this statement and these announcement will be make she will have to wait alongside everybody for the process that we adhere to in this house to be administer 
 in response to the hon lady ’s question as she should know our funding system be not design so that every school and college receive funding that necessarily fully match their precise spending as that include nic cost vary from institution to institution because of the decision that each school make on staffing we be provide school and high need setting with more than £ in to support they with their increase national insurance cost that be in addition to the £ increase to core school funding announce at the autumn budget in that mean that the core school budget which include the core revenue funding for school and high need setting will total more than £ in we will continue to support school to spend that money in the most effective and productive way possible to maximise outcome for child which be our priority 
 i spend most of the last government ’s time in office scrutinise public spending and grow weary of promise of pay or other government decision not be match with budget for school hospital and so on when thing like change to national insurance and pay increase be make i hope that this government will be very honest about the impact on school budget and not have headline that be not balance with funding i therefore hope the minister be make good argument in the spending review could she make sure that she really lean into the issue of fall roll in london ’s school any hop for pay rise which be much deserve by teacher will be a double whammy for school in london because roll be fall and their income be therefore much low that will have an extra impact on staffing decision 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and for the work that she have do in this house over many year in scrutinise government budget and hold government to account we have   the high respect for school for school leader and for the teacher and support staff who work in school we recognise the challenge face across the public sector to make sure that every penny of public money be spend in the most efficient way possible and maximise the public benefit we be work incredibly hard in the department as i know we be across government to get maximum output for public money frankly the public sector be neglect by the previous government over year we be pick up the piece of that and we will continue to work hard to do so 
 i do have some sympathy for the minister for whom i have a great deal of respect but surely she must feel embarrassed to come before this house know all the answer to these question and not give they simply because no will not let she in my constituency school be already face a double whammy from an increase in cost from the national insurance rise which be not fully fund and the pressure on place if the teacher pay settlement be not fund in full surely she will admit that it amount to a cut whenever this happen when we be in government the thing labour members would say be be you match it with funding if we be not they would scream blue murder that it amount to a cut will she just admit that if it be not fund it be a cut to school 
 the right hon gentleman be rather get ahead of himself he be in the last government and we be leave with an appalling inheritance we be take tough decision to fix the foundation and to bring back stability because education be a priority for this government that be why we be rebuild the crumble school that the conservatives leave interruption fiction crumble school i suggest opposition members speak to the school that be deal with the consequence we be roll out free breakfast club open up school base nursery and yes provide £ to give every child the good start in life through the high quality early year and family service that the previous government promise but provide no money to deliver while those on the conservative benches continue to try to work out what they think we be get on with deliver real positive change in our country 
 as the minister say we inherit a recruitment and retention crisis in the teaching industry datum from the national association of head teachers show that in teacher leave within year and that around in headteacher no long continue as a head within year that be the situation we have inherit not create what be the minister do to turn the tide on the recruitment and retention crisis 
 we do inherit a dire situation child be not be teach by the expert teacher they should have be teach by and teacher be stretch to the limit that be why the thing we do be to reset the relationship between the government and school which for year have resemble some sort of combat 
 we want to work with school we recognise how hard they be work to deliver for child and we want to work with they to support they in any way   we can that mean have high quality teacher and good quality teacher training it mean support every teacher to be train to meet the need of child with special educational need and disability it mean maximise every pound so that it can get to the frontline to the child by reduce other cost in school we will continue to work with school to do that so that we can ensure that every child have the expert teacher they deserve and will not be let down any more as they have be for the last year 
 i think we would all agree that education be the good investment that any government can make it raise people out of poverty improve social mobility and improve health outcome sadly it be not a priority for the last government and i welcome the change in tone from the new government although i think it will take more than breakfast club to fix the problem 
 the devon branch of the national association of head teachers have say we ’re on our knee primary school be consolidate class because they be have to cut spending and secondary school in my patch will have to pay £ extra for every percentage point rise in pay that be not fund if the pay award be not fully fund can the minister explain exactly where school be suppose to find this extra money 
 the hon lady be understandably so give the calling of this urgent question despite a statement be due imminently get ahead of herself and we be do an awful lot more than breakfast club i have list just some of what we be do but we be work incredibly hard across the board 
 school will work very hard to make sure that their budget maximise the outcome for child and we will continue to support they to do that that mean have a department that step up it do not stand back and criticise it step up it mean support the buying that school do and make sure they be get the good value for money in all the purchasing they do it mean support they with their maintenance and management it mean support they with energy cost we know that expenditure on energy be a big cost for school and the department can provide support with good contract that get much well value for money it be similar with banking and with teacher vacancy school can save a significant amount of money use the product available from the department for education which we be continue to provide and they can use the tool available to see how they be do and also what other school be do well we will continue to support school to maximise 
 order this be like have a statement the answer be get long and long but i have to get through this urgent question as we have a lot of other business it be important that question be answer quickly but also that the rest of the question be ask we will now have a good example of a brief question from laurence turner 
 thank you mr speaker there have clearly be some learn loss among the conservatives because they be late in   submit evidence for year in a row cause chaos in school budget they announce the outcome of the school teachers review body process through write statement to this house and shamefully they scrap the school support staff negotiate body do the minister agree that the protestation from the opposition will come across to teacher as false and hypocritical because they be 
 i think my hon friend have put it very well 
 of the thing i think we should be proud of in england be the success of english school over the last to year frankly the difference in outcome in england from those in labour run wales or snp run scotland have be very striking demonstrate that while for sure there be brilliant teacher across the united kingdom the different system in england have enable its school to flourish 
 while i welcome the fact that the minister be bring the statement out early and i appreciate the work the government have do on it i be afraid that i do share the frustration of my right hon friend   the member for sevenoaks laura trott   and my hon friend   the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson who be no long in her place the minister must appreciate that frustration give that she be sit on the opposition benches only a few month ago as no doubt she will be again in only a few year time 
 the reality be that it be very difficult to represent those who send we here if we be not give information i be send a letter by simon beamish who run the leigh academies trust and he tell i that school in my area of west kent be already go to have redundancy or be go to make choice base on the unfunded pledge that have be give will the minister make a commitment that the next pledge will be fund 
 that be a very long question 
 it be a very long statement that manage almost entirely to look backwards while fantasise about the future the right hon member will receive the information as will everybody else when the statement be publish at the announce time this afternoon 
 i declare an interest as i be a primary school governor right up until the election and i be the chair of the all party parliamentary group for school learning and assessment it be quite shocking to hear opposition member protestation about school funding give the absolutely dire state in which they leave school funding after year of conservative government when i speak to school leader in my constituency they tell i about their real and lasting struggle to balance their budget i understand that the minister can not speak today about the outcome of the review until the statement but can she give we information more broadly about conversation she have have as part of the spending review so that we can get the funding we need to invest in school and turn around the dire situation we inherit 
 i would like to take this opportunity to put on record my thank to school governor my hon friend mention that he be a governor up until   the election we really be grateful to school governor for everything they do on a voluntary basis to support school to be as good as they can be as a government we will always work with they and school to support improve outcome for child 
 the department will do everything it can within the incredibly tight fiscal constraint we inherit as a government we be committed to our public service which we know will transform the life of child and everybody in this country we will continue to do that 
 the minister in her response to my hon friend   the member for twickenham munira wilson refer to imagining but i do not think it be an imagining to suggest that the secretary of state in her response to the strb say that some efficiency saving would have to be find in school to meet the additional cost early this week i have a roundtable with headteacher from my constituency and beyond the minister also talk just now about fantasise about the future be she really tell i that those headteacher be fantasise about the future when they tell i that they be already have to make cut to staffing number for next september headteacher tell i that just or more thing need to go wrong and that they be on the brink of collapse be the minister say that they be fantasise about the future 
 no we recognise how important it be for school to plan their budget and we know that they be keenly await the announcement this afternoon that be why we have make the announcement as quickly as possible and much quick than at any point over the past year we will continue to work with school to help they deliver for the child in their care we know that that be their priority and it be our priority too 
 for year i see my profession treat like dirt by the conservative party undervalued underpaid and undermine at every single turn do the minister agree that not only should we be pay our teacher fairly but we should be treat they with respect and that the only decent teacher recruitment the conservative party do be to recruit former teacher to the labour benches 
 my hon friend rightly remark on his service as a teacher it be incredibly value the message we want to send to the school system be about the extent to which we value the teacher and the headteacher who support their school to thrive and the extent to which we support the support staff who be the beat heart of school in every community we will continue to do so 
 the school in my constituency tell i that any efficiency they could possibly make have already be make therefore the result of what the minister be announce the national insurance increase that be underfunde and this welcome but unfunded increase in teacher pay can only be that teacher number be cut as the father of a primary school teacher who work really hard and be absolutely committed that impact on i personally and it will impact on every child and every parent in my   constituency be that not the reality and should the government not be up front and admit that this will mean that teacher will lose their job 
 the right hon gentleman will have to wait for the statement this afternoon for the detail of what the government be propose he really should have more awareness of the situation that teacher and school and indeed our entire public sector have face over the past year we be work hard to clean up that mess and we will continue to do so 
 i declare that i be also a school governor i have spend many month in my constituency meeting teacher governor and stakeholder within the community so i welcome the government ’s announcement of additional teacher can the minister tell we how the government be turn the tide in the teacher recruitment and retention crisis which reach unprecedented level over the past decade 
 this be a key priority for we we want to ensure that we have the teaching workforce that child deserve but that teacher deserve too they deserve to have a full fleet of teacher teach the specialist subject that they love be commit to and be train to teach we know that key to unlock the outcome for child be have good qualified teacher in every classroom which be what we be legislate to achieve it be also key for child with additional learning need or disability that we ensure that every teacher be a teacher for special educational need and disability so that more child can be educate in their local school with their peer and get the outcome they deserve 
 i be a school governor for year and serve as a finance governor so i know these issue well i want to draw the minister ’s attention to the plight of small rural primary school there be many such school in my constituency and they be really up against it with the cost that they face in the school that i serve of the budget be spend on staffing so a significant unfunded increase in staffing cost whether through national insurance or salary contribution have a huge impact will the minister meet i to discuss sparsity funding and the equalisation of per capita funding so that primary school in small rural area be not so serially disadvantaged 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his thoughtful question and for his year of service as a governor i can not reiterate enough how much we value the work that governor do in school and we need more people to step up and take the rewarding opportunity to support school in that capacity he rightly raise the challenge which we know differ across school and that be why school funding be not uniform across school it vary accord to circumstance we be look at the funding formula to ensure that it do allocate resource where it be most need and where it can give the great outcome and the great benefit 
 rather than the synthetic outrage from the former chief secretary to the treasury   the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott who serve in a government that bring   cut to school i really welcome that the government be serious about address the regression teacher face in their pay as well as the fact that support staff be push on to the minimum wage i trust that in the statement there will be sufficiency in the funding for school but will the minister also get a grip of escalate chief executive pay which be double mean they have figure salary it be really important that they be not take more out of the fund that should be invest in child ’s education 
 my hon friend speak with great insight i know she care passionately about maximise outcome for child i know that every school leader indeed those at any level within a school but particularly those at the senior level will want to ensure that in any decision they make on pay they be prioritise outcome for child 
 school in my constituency tell i they be struggle serious pressure be be put on their staffing budget by the national insurance contribution increase and that be exacerbate by the appallingly slow approval rate of special educational need inclusion funding and education health and care plan by the now lib dem run cambridgeshire county council what be the minister do to address that extra strain on staffing cost and to ensure that school be properly resource for the right level of staff in order to allow teacher to give all child the good education rather than force efficiency saving on they that will make the job even hard and possibly even ultimately put child at risk 
 the hon gentleman raise an important matter and do so thoughtfully and constructively although there be synthetic outrage from some member on the conservative benches we recognise that school be grapple with the challenge of ensure that they achieve the great outcome from their budget that be a challenge that they rise to year on year and a challenge that we will continue to set because we will not shy away from ensure that every penny of public money that be spend deliver on the frontline for child and teacher we need to ensure that we have the right teaching capacity in school and that teacher be train to support child with special educational need we be determined to ensure that more child be educate with their peer but we recognise that school need support to deliver that and we be work on reform at pace we be also get on with deliver a whole range of intervention to support school in make progress
