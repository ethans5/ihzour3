 as ever my hon friend the chair of the justice committee give a consider response and he be absolutely right there need to be a recognition of the scale of the problem and thing be require investment and reform when hon member read the report they will see that sir brian be very clear that we need investment this government be already begin to make that investment through the additional crown court sit day that we have lay on this year run the system at system max additional funding for legal aid lawyer and criminal legal aid and £ to keep the sector go on both the defence and the prosecutorial side we be make that investment but critically as sir brian make absolutely clear that alone will not be enough we need to consider once in a generation structural reform that will run a sustainable proportionate system that will allow we to deliver swifter justice for victim investment and reform that be what we will be get on with and that be what we will report on in the autumn 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on the potential impact of the spending review on scottish public service 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on the potential impact of the spending review on scottish public service 
 i be sure member across the house will have see the wonderful news this morning and join i in congratulate ferguson marine on win a substantial ministry of defence shipbuilding contract through bae systems that be great news for the workforce who will play a key role in keep our country and its people safe shipbuilding on the clyde be thrive thank to the uk government ’s record investment in defence support job this be a real defence dividend for scotland this be investment that the snp seek to block but labour will build 
 this be the last scottish oral question before summer recess so can i thank you mr speaker your team and all the house staff for all your work over the last year this be a historic spending review for scotland that end austerity along with last year ’s budget it deliver an extra £ as a uk labour government dividend to scotland that be more money for our nhs police housing and school scot will not accept continued snp failure on scottish public service and will rightly ask the snp where have all the money go 
 this uk labour government be deliver the large budgetary settlement in the history of devolution with an extra £ to invest in scottish public service yet the snp scottish government continue to squander opportunity after opportunity and waste the public ’s money will he join i in urge the snp scottish government to get a grip and invest in project that matter to our community such as the east calder medical centre which have not materialise after snp dither and delay 
 i absolutely join my hon friend in that call and i pay tribute to his tenacious campaigning to see east calder ’s new medical centre deliver i be gp place short in my own constituency and the snp need to take that seriously the spending review generate £ in health relate barnett consequential for scotland my hon friend be right to stand up for his community in east calder and i ask the snp where have all the money go 
 i have previously praise in this chamber the effort of the fire and rescue service in respond to more than major incident in cumbernauld both my constituent and i be therefore concerned that the propose cut to cumbernauld fire station will undermine its ability to respond to incident and put life at risk will the secretary of state make representation to the scottish government to invest in fire service in of scotland ’s large town 
 my hon friend quite rightly speak out against the cut to cumbernauld fire station which sadly be just example of the snp ’s dangerous mismanagement of scotland ’s fire service as the fire brigades union in scotland tell i just last month there be reason why the snp government should choose to invest in local service include in cumbernauld but after year of failure and neglect my hon friend ’s constituent will rightly not hold out much hope across scotland we need a new direction next may with anas sarwar as the minister 
 do the secretary of state share my view that whatever the snp scottish government ’s budget they have cynically and systematically deprive funding from area that do not support independence leave council such as dumfries and galloway and scottish borders and their health board struggle to provide basic service 
 i would extend that and say that the whole of scotland vote against independence in it seem to i that the snp government ’s strategy be to starve all scotland ’s public service of the vital funding that they require 
 the spending review come off the back of last year ’s autumn budget which hit business in my constituency in north east scotland very hard whether it be family business and farm with the change to agricultural property relief and business property relief or the extension of and increase in the energy profit levy hit investment in our vital oil and gas sector what conversation be the secretary of state have actively with the treasury to ensure that north east scotland do not have to pay the price for this government ’s decision again next year 
 i have have a minimum of conversation with the treasury with regard to funding in scotland this be the large settlement ever in the history of the scottish parliament this government ’s decision in the october budget and the spending review have give we the high growth in the g7 the high business confidence in a decade record inward investment   major trade deal and the condition for interest rate cut all help business right across scotland everything that the hon lady and her party vote against 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 like the secretary of state i welcome the great news for ferguson marine this morning as he know scottish liberal democrats secure funding for key project across scotland in last year ’s scottish budget negotiation include the eye pavilion in edinburgh which be so important for my constituent and his we welcome the additional funding as part of the spending review to help project such as that but almost decade of snp mismanagement have leave our health service in dire need of investment and improvement do he agree that the snp should invest this funding wisely in gps dentist and care so that our constituent can see the same focus on innovation in health that be announce by the uk government last week 
 the hon lady make a good point about the eye pavilion in edinburgh which be a symptom of the whole of the scottish government ’s strategy for our nhs service the snp promise a new eye pavilion in its manifesto in and and it be yet to deliver it i bet we see the same process and the same promise in its manifesto in may next year in scot be stick on a waiting list the nhs app be year behind other part of the uk and we have the bad cancer waiting time on record i be sure the hon lady and million of other scot know that the snp have fail their nhs if the snp have any idea how to fix it it would have do it by now 
 during the spending review period the scottish government will have to continue to mitigate some of the cruell westminster policy they have to do that under the tories and it continue under labour not least with the child cap can the secretary of state tell we whether there be any plan to scrap it 
 the hon gentleman and his colleague vote against the budget they vote against all the measure to raise revenue in the budget and they vote against the actual spending of it from the that this labour government take power just over a year ago there be £ extra go into the scottish budget the scottish government need to be spend it well and i be sure the scottish public will look dimly on a scottish government who can not spend it and improve our public service 
 i be not sure the secretary of state quite catch the question there we vote against the child cap if there be cash to go around and uk departments be get big spending increase than the scottish government why will he not prioritise child poverty the child poverty action group describe get rid of the child cap as the most cost effective way to cut child poverty it be describe by the pensions minister as immoral the cabinet office ’s recent report tackle child poverty state 
 there be a lot we can learn from action already be take in scotland wales and northern ireland 
 will the secretary of state make scrap the child poverty cap a priority or will he insist on fail tory policy 
 go by the vote last week the hon gentleman want to keep the fail broken welfare system that the tories put in what we have do as a government be a pay rise for scot day right for sick leave and parental leave and £ off energy bill for more than half a scottish household and we have ban exploitative hour contract there be child in scotland every single night go to bed without a home that be a dreadful record for the scottish government 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the future of artificial intelligence in scotland 
 artificial intelligence will drive incredible change in our country it will turbocharge growth and boost living standard scotland as we know well have be the uk ’s home of ai since and it will become the home of the most powerful supercomputer in the uk with this labour government invest £ in its development at the university of edinburgh ’s advanced computing facility in midlothian we be currently assess application for ai growth zone from across the uk include several from scotland which be at the cutting edge of compute power globally 
 it be refreshing to have a uk government so commit to invest in and develop ai in comparison with john swinney and the scottish government who be stick in an analogue age unable even to provide patient and staff with a function nhs app do the minister agree that the town of airdrie and shotts and the former industrial heartland of north lanarkshire be incredibly well place to serve as an ai growth zone and capture the government ’s clear ambition 
 much like my hon friend who be a truly passionate advocate for his community i be proud to represent of scotland ’s industrial heartland he be right to highlight the role that they can play in scotland ’s ai future as for his comment regard the minister my right hon friend the health secretary be particularly astute in his assessment i be afraid that the minister be from the age of taggart when what be upon we be the age of dept q 
 the transmission line from skye to fort augustus have be approve due to a technicality the people along the route will be deprive of £ will the minister take this up with ofgem 
 i be lead to believe that the hon member have already pick this matter up with the secretary of state who will be take it forward but i would be delighted to talk to the hon member about it 
 what recent discussion he have have with representative of the broadcasting sector in scotland 
 the secretary of state and i be commit to support a flourish broadcasting sector in scotland and regularly meet its representative i know that my hon friend the member for na h eileanan an iar be part of a recent engagement that the scotland office be delighted to co host with mg alba where he speak passionately about the importance of gaelic broadcasting and we share his commitment to it 
 we islander have always be international ambassador and i be delighted that some of the lewis chess piece be go to france a little bit of gaelic scotland in president macron ’s pocket gaelic broadcasting also have a global reach viewer watch an t eilean mg alba ’s detective series gaelic be a big part of brand scotland request more money for broadcasting be a straightforward ask but may i ask ministers to think more imaginatively about growth deal can we see a scotland wide growth deal for gaelic for cultural heritage item such as the lewis chess piece and for childcare so that we can grow the social infrastructure of scotland as well as its physical infrastructure 
 that be an interesting point my hon friend have be advance this case and he be right the whole objective of the growth deal be to enable people to live well in the place that they love as he know the uk government have deliver a historic spending review for scotland which include ambitious plan for local growth to become the foundation of national renewal the scotland office will continue to engage with he and with other member on both side of the house and with scottish local government to ensure that local growth investment support the change that labour promise and the change that our community want to see 
 there have be a number of co production by bbc northern ireland and bbc scotland do the minister agree that we should develop and promote co production throughout the nation and region of the united kingdom so that we can see excellence and good practice everywhere in the uk 
 i do agree that we should be co operate as far as possible step have already be take to preserve the future of home grow content and talent through initiative such as the uk government ’s independent film tax credit and high end tax relief provide a real opportunity for the industry to grow but i should certainly like to talk to the hon gentleman about how the industry in scotland and northern ireland could co operate more effectively 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the industrial strategy on scotland 
 the industrial strategy be transformational for scotland a year ago the government inherit an industrial crisis after year of no plan and a complete lack of interest on the part of the snp and the conservatives when it come to scottish industry however i congratulate the snp on its job creation programme it have create ten of thousand of job in china turkey and poland rather than stand up for scotland it have be ship scottish job overseas 
 scotland have a proud industrial past and labour ’s industrial strategy will work to ensure that we have a bright industrial future we in the scotland office will be do all that we can to exploit these opportunity 
 the industrial strategy identify defence as a key industry it be a big employer in glasgow and could create many good job for my constituent however the snp have ban the scottish national investment bank and scottish enterprise from invest in defence company do my right hon friend agree that this show that the snp government be weak when it come to defend scotland and be deny glaswegians many good job 
 you will be unsurprise mr speaker to hear i say that i agree with my hon friend i be astonish to learn that the snp be block investment in a national specialist welding centre on the bank of the clyde put its own student politic before job opportunity for working class young people and that it be do so at a time when in be not in education employment or training put politic before people be just not good enough but where the snp stand down labour will step up and fund that centre we will invest in defence and create a defence dividend that will mean job and opportunity for everyone in scotland 
 with the exception of the london vortex that suck in wealth capital and talent from across these island it be scotland that top the league for foreign direct investment it be aberdeen glasgow and edinburgh that be among the top city in the uk for fdi as they have be for of the year in which the snp have be in power what have the scottish secretary ever do to get foreign direct investment into scotland 
 the hon gentleman need to calm down a little bit of the key opportunity for investment in scotland be the opportunity to invest in the renewable energy sector so that we can realise our plan for clean energy by much of that will be capitalise by the national wealth fund and gb energy both of which the hon gentleman and his party vote against 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last   sunday july mark year since the piper alpha disaster an incident that claim the life of man and affect many more particularly in and around the north east of scotland we remember they their family and friend and indeed all those who continue to do the dangerous work offshore in our oil   and gas industry ensure that the light stay on in this country will the right hon gentleman please tell the house when the industrial strategy will replace the ten of thousand of job that be set to be lose in the north sea on his watch 
 i join the hon gentleman in pay respect on the anniversary of the piper alpha disaster it have leave an indelible scar on scotland and we will never forget the life that be lose but we will also never forget that it be the catalyst for make sure that the north sea be the safe place to do oil and gas anywhere in the world the uk be world lead 
 i can answer the hon gentleman ’s question by say that he and his party have oppose all the initiative that this government have put forward in order to get to clean power by i gently say to he that when he find out who the former energy minister be in the previous government he be go to be very disappointed 
 we be very proud of our record on support the oil and gas industry talk about the government have their head in the sand job will be lose in the north sea every week on the secretary of state ’s watch that be a grangemouth sized event every week the only strategy that this government have be a deindustrialisation strategy there be an industry with a skilled workforce that be ready and willing to generate energy revenue and job in scotland so come on secretary of state let we have a real industrialisation strategy remove the energy profit levy overturn the ban on licence and let we return to a policy of maximum economic recovery from the north sea 
 the energy profit levy be bring in by the former energy minister in the previous government who just so happen to be sit across from i at the dispatch box today we have the north sea transition consultation which have close that set out the pathway to a just transition in the north sea which will protect job and we want to get to clean power by those be the job and the career of the future but that transition have to take those job with it 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on support scottish agriculture 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on support scottish agriculture 
 scotland cultivate the very good produce in the world and we be absolutely committed to support scotland ’s agricultural sector and indeed all those who live and work in our rural community i be very pleased that the scottish government ’s minister for agriculture and connectivity join i for a food and farming roundtable that i host in edinburgh in april we hear directly from the sector about how scotland ’s government can well collaborate and continue to support those who put food on our table 
 like farmer in my constituency of chester south and eddisbury farmer in scotland feel let down by this government ’s disregard for agriculture and the countryside we have see labour look the other way as the scottish government have deliver real term cut to the agriculture budget the scottish conservatives have set out a clear multi year plan to give farmer the certainty they need will the secretary of state urge the minister to back that plan which have strong support from the farming community and help reverse the damage do to scottish agriculture and our food security 
 the scottish government have be give a record settlement in the devolution era and it be for the devolve government to allocate their funding in devolved area as they see fit they be accountable to their own legislature and indeed the scottish public that be a key principle of devolution and this labour government will respect it 
 we conservatives be vilify when we point out that the vindictive change to farming relief be go to damage job in rural scotland the scotland office conduct its own roundtable with agriculture figure will the minister share the result of that with the house the scottish government and crucially whoever the deputy prime minister decide will be the next chancellor of the exchequer 
 i would be delighted to report back to the house and scotland ’s rural community include my own in midlothian about the outcome of the farming roundtable we hear directly from stakeholder that they want support and crucially for the government to work together which be exactly why we have the scottish government around the table 
 do the minister agree that scottish agriculture salmon and distillery like lochlea in my constituency will benefit from our trade deal can she work out why the snp fail to support they 
 those trade deal be some of the proud achievement of this labour government and they will disproportionately benefit scotland as i have already say it be home to some of the fine produce on the face of the earth and we be delighted to be promote it as part of the scotland office ’s brand scotland effort 
 do my hon friend agree that the chancellor ’s excellent spending review for scotland which set out record funding for the scottish government mean that snp ministers be ideally place to offer the agricultural sector in scotland a multi year funding settlement and that that be exactly what they should now do 
 i agree with my hon friend that the scottish government have be bless with a record settlement in the devolution era the difficulty for those of we on the labour benches who have champion that settlement be that we be all too well aware i be afraid that the scottish government be absolutely addicted to waste money that be why the only way for scotland to take a new direction be to replace the fail scottish government with a labour in may 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 this weekend i be at the fettercairn show in my constituency and i note that the secretary of state be at the royal highland show in edinburgh week ago with new research show that more than job be expect to be lose as a direct result of labour ’s family farm tax what message do the secretary of state and the minister have for the farmer they meet at the royal highland show about the government ’s plan to kill family farm in scotland judge by the comment make to i this weekend the fear anger and disgust at how this government have treat the agricultural sector and rural scotland very much remain 
 our message to the farming community include the national farmers union of scotland i meet its representative regularly and indeed speak at its annual conference be that there have to be fairness in the government ’s approach to the public finance the late figure from show that of the value of agricultural property relief go to just of claimant which be neither fair nor sustainable 
 what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of the supreme court judgment in the case of for women scotland the scottish ministers of april on woman in scotland 
 the ruling bring clarity and confidence for woman and service provider such as hospital refuge and sport club single sex space be protect by law under labour ’s equality act and will always be protect by this government alongside the right of the trans community as be state by the supreme court 
 joe griffin the permanent secretary to the scottish government be ask when appear in front of the holyrood finance and public administration committee about action take in relation to the supreme court judgment when push he say 
 specific action i can not give you that right now 
 do the uk government believe that the scottish government be fail to uphold the law 
 the application of the supreme court ruling to service in scotland be of course a matter for the scottish government and it be for the scottish government to ensure they fully comply with the law as it stand 
 the supreme court judgment provide very welcome legal clarity on the matter of biological sex but the scottish government have meet clarity with chaos do the secretary of state agree with i that the snp government have make an absolute mess of this in much the same way they have make a mess of pass on the big settlement in the history of devolution to scottish nhs education and housing service be it not time they get a grip 
 i think the f word could be use about whatever the scottish government have do and that be failure when it come to the election in may the scottish public will have to decide whether they require a decade of the snp scottish government or a change with anas sarwar as minister 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the spending review on economic growth in scotland 
 under this government it be the work people of scotland who will feel the benefit of economic growth we have give the large settlement in the history of the scottish government—£14 extra the stability in the economy have enable interest rate cut mean cheap mortgage for home owner fuel duty be frozen mean scots motorist pay less at the pump the minimum wage be up mean a pay rise for of the lowest pay scots—[interruption that deserve a large cheer because it be for the lowest pay scot also the warm home discount have be extend to half a scot 
 the job tax have decimate business confidence and have see unemployment rise and now along with the budget blow to scotch whisky the attack on family farm and the undermining of the oil and gas industry the scottish hospitality group have slat the spending review say it 
 do absolutely nothing to support the hospitality sector 
 will the secretary of state work with the chancellor to undo the damage her budget and her spending review have inflict on family farm scotch whisky the oil and gas industry hospitality entertainment and business confidence in scotland 
 the hon gentleman should go and speak to scottish business and apologise for vote against the budget and against the £ extra that will go to scotland as part of the spending review as a result of the decision take by this government we have the high growth in the g7 the high business confidence in a decade record inward investment major trade deal and interest rate cut all help business right across the country 
 it be fantastic news that ferguson marine have secure a contract with bae systems to help far enhance the uk ’s maritime capability make use of its skilled workforce do my right hon friend agree that that be in sharp contrast to the student union politic play on defence by the snp government do he agree that the benefit of the spending review can not be fully assess until the snp be remove from power in 
 yet again i agree with my hon friend i pay special tribute to both she and my hon friend   the member for inverclyde and renfrewshire west martin mccluskey who have do so much to make sure we   can get work into ferguson marine again it will not be lose on the house or indeed the scottish public that the defence industry be support job in scotland and straight into ferguson marine where the scottish government walk past on the other side we will invest 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday july 
 on monday we mark the anniversary of the despicable terrorist attack on the painful memory of that dark day be deeply ingrained people be murder and many more be injure we thank our emergency service who run towards danger with true bravery and send our deep condolence to the victim the survivor and bereaved and all those forever affect by that appalling day 
 may i also extend our deep condolence to the family and friend of lord tebbit we remember his profound courage in the face of terrorism and a fierce devotion to his wife margaret may he rest in peace 
 we also mark the anniversary of the genocide at srebrenica we remember those lose and redouble our effort to fight hatred and intolerance wherever it exist 
 i be delighted to welcome president macron to the united kingdom our relationship have never be strong and we be focus on tough new tactic to tackle illegal migration on major economic investment to create job and on lead our ally to support ukraine 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 may i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark 
 at a recent coffee morning resident in southampton itchen tell i how much they still miss the bitterne nhs walk in centre which be shut down a decade ago under the conservatives may i begin by welcome this government ’s year plan and its commitment to neighbourhood health service do the prime minister agree that as we put this plan for change into action for my local resident bitterne be an excellent location for the new neighbourhood health centre 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for make the case for his constituent i know the health secretary will give it every consideration the year plan will establish neighbourhood health centre in every community and will make a massive difference start in the place where the need be great and life expectancy be at its low i be proud that we promise extra nhs appointment in the year of a labour government and we have now deliver we should not forget that the record investment in the budget which make that possible be oppose by all the opposition party 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i echo the prime minister ’s sentiment about the horrific terrorist attack of   july i be pleased to be at the commemoration service on monday in particular our thought be with the family of those who lose their life those who have to go on without their love one 
 i would like to pay tribute to lord tebbit who die yesterday at the age of he be a man of iron integrity and conviction who by his effort help to save our country from the chaos of the 1970 we all owe he so much 
 in its manifesto last year labour promise not to increase income tax not to increase national insurance and not to increase vat do the prime minister still stand by his promise 
 yes 
 it be rare—[interruption it be rare that the prime minister be able to give a clear answer but i be glad that he have do so now he also promise in fact he boast that he have solve the doctor strike only a prime minister who be so weak would give doctor a pay rise only for we now to see they vote to strike again he fold in every negotiation and claim it be a triumph interruption yes he do we see more promise at the budget the chancellor promise that she would lift the freeze on income tax and national insurance threshold because in her word they hurt work people be that still government policy 
 no prime minister or chancellor be go to write a budget in advance we be absolutely fix on our fiscal rule we remain committed to they we remain committed to our manifesto commitment i realise that stick to fiscal rule and manifesto commitment be a bit unfamiliar to the conservatives it be because of the decision the chancellor and this government have take that we can update the house £ of inward investment into this country since we take office business confidence at a year high long than the leader of the opposition have be in parliament deloitte this week say that the uk be now the good place to invest create job what a contrast to the mess we inherit from the conservative party 
 there be no clear answer there the whole house will have hear the prime minister fail to rule out freeze tax threshold he could say yes to the question he could promise but could not this time what do this mean he be talk about record investment and more job we know that people be lose their job unemployment have go up every single month of labour ’s year in office what do the issue of tax threshold mean it mean that under labour million of our poor pensioner face be drag into income tax for the time ever do the prime minister think it be right that struggle pensioner should face a retirement tax 
 for a prime minister or a chancellor to say we be not go to write a budget in advance be not a labour thing or a tory thing every single prime minister and chancellor say that they will not do that   we will stick to our manifesto commitment we will stick to our fiscal rule this be a language the conservatives do not understand and that be what get we into the problem in the place the leader of the opposition come here every week to talk the country down but that record investment—£120 will mean good well pay job across the country this investment be from foreign investor who can choose whether to invest in this country they be choose to invest in this country now because they have confidence in what this government be do 
 investor be flee the country the prime minister say he will stick to his manifesto promise but labour promise not to put a tax on work people and then we get the job tax and all we have see be job disappear before the election the prime minister promise 
 not a penny more on your council tax 
 the institute for fiscal studies say that council tax bill will now rise at their fast rate in year will the prime minister admit that under he council tax be set to soar 
 no of course it be not it soar under the last government here she go again the leader of the opposition be back on familiar territory she come here every week complain about the national insurance rise and when she be ask whether she would have the courage to reverse it what be her answer hon member no no and i will tell you for why mr speaker she be too embarrassed to say that she do not want the investment that we have put in that investment go into the nhs the conservatives want that investment but they can not say how they would pay for it that be what get we into the problem in the place 
 the prime minister still do not understand so i be go to make it very simple for he this be a mess of his own making he should not be ask how we would clean it up the fact be this government raise national insurance through the job tax and that be why they have to put up council tax the truth be that his catastrophic budget have create a domino effect that he can not now control we on the conservative benches know that you can not tax your way to growth but now he be flirting—[interruption labour member be all mutter but i remember that budget they be laugh and cheer they have no idea of the mess that they be create they should go and explain to their constituent why unemployment be go up 
 what be more worrying be that now the prime minister be flirt with neil kinnock ’s demand for a wealth tax let we be honest about what that mean it would be a tax on all our constituent saving on their house and on their pension it would be a tax on aspiration will the prime minister rule this out 
 the right hon lady say that we should not be ask they for advice on the economy she be absolutely right about that we will not be ask for their advice what we do in the budget be stabilise the economy through the measure take by the chancellor what have that lead to interest rate cut for mortgage holder that be hugely important compare   and contrast that with what happen under the liz truss mini budget we have the fast growth in the g7 in the quarter of this year wage be up more in the month of a labour government than in the year under the tories so no we do not need lesson from they 
 the prime minister say that he have stabilise the economy have he speak to any farmer recently it be time for he to take responsibility for the mess that he be make he have be in office for a year and all we see be he congratulate himself on what a fantastic job he have do interruption nobody out there believe it not even labour member what a weak cheer he be congratulate himself but we can compare record he talk about the fast grow economy we leave he the fast grow economy of the g7 we cut the deficit in every year until the pandemic and we get inflation down to on his watch taxis be up unemployment be up inflation be up and this weak prime minister have be force into a series of chaotic u turn yesterday the office for budget responsibility say that our economy be be erode under labour doctor strike tax bombshell the wealthy leave in drove be it not the truth that under he he be drag we back to the 1970 
 we be responsible for extra appointment in the nhs we be responsible for a year plan on the future of the nhs after the conservatives break it we be also responsible for free school meal be roll out in a way that have never be do by anybody breakfast club be roll out family hub be roll out transport across the country and migration come down we take responsibility and we be proud of that 
 the eden project in cornwall be a proven success story inject million into the local economy in lancashire eden project morecambe will soon be under construction and be set to create hundred of job it be about time that we have the instalment with memo portland or eden portland as many like to call it that will be a world class attraction celebrate the jurassic coast and transform the economy in south dorset will the prime minister back this exciting project and work with i and all relevant minister to secure funding to deliver it and ideally can we use the new growth mission fund 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight that exciting proposal he be a fantastic advocate for portland and south dorset eden portland be a hugely exciting project i can not confirm funding allocation yet but our £ growth mission fund should support transformative project that give local leader real investment to deliver real change he make a compelling case in relation to the fund 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 may i associate myself and my party with the prime minister ’s comment about the horrifying terrorist bombing of here in london our thought be with the victim their family and our emergency service 
 may i also join in send condolence to the family of lord tebbit he be a man of service in the raf in politic and as a carer for his wife margaret he will be greatly miss 
 after year of conservative neglect the special educational need system be in desperate need of repair but with parent understandably worried we already hear labour mps plan another rebellion so may i make this offer to the prime minister if he genuinely want to fix the problem and not strip away the right of child and parent in some cost cut exercise we have vote to help will the prime minister look at the test for send reform that we have publish today and work with we to make it happen 
 it be tell that when the right hon gentleman ask about the broken send system the tory back benchers laugh that be how seriously they take their responsibility it be an absolute shame as the right hon gentleman know every week in this house members raise the issue with i i think it have be raise with i more time than anything else everyone know that the send system be break guess who break it along with everything else the system do not work for parent and it let down child so we need to reform and change it it be not about save money we have already invest an additional £ in send it be about create a new system that truly support every child we be develop proposal and we want to work with parent and teacher to get this right i would expect the right hon gentleman to welcome that 
 i thank the prime minister for his reply we want to work across the house to fix the mess that the tories leave but we do not want another welfare style mess this time we have to fix the system properly for parent and child 
 the conservative government badly undermine the security of our border by rip up the return agreement that allow we to send migrant back to europe i hope that the prime minister can secure a new return agreement with france that act as a real deterrent and stop the boat the conservatives also send hundred of million of pound to france and get nothing in return do the prime minister agree that any new funding to the french government must be conditional on they agree a return deal and do their bit to stop the boat 
 we be work closely with the french on this issue we will only provide funding that deliver on our priority we be work together closely and we share information to a much great extent than be the case before we have a new specialist intelligence unit at dunkirk and we be the government to persuade the french to review their law and tactic on the north coast in order to take more effective action i will be discuss this at meeting with president macron today and tomorrow 
 in the light of recent event will the prime minister update the house on the work of the covid corruption commissioner do he agree with my constituent in rugby bulkington and the surround village that there should be no place in public life for people who exploit the pandemic and defraud the taxpayer to line their own pocket 
 my hon friend make a powerful point and i hope it be hear by those on the conservative benches it be an absolute scandal that fail personal protective equipment contract be hand out by the conservatives cost taxpayer £ we be focus on get our money back i can confirm that the commissioner be now investigate fraud involve bounce back and business support loan and we will continue to go after the fraudster grifter and con artist no matter who they be or where we find they 
 the main reason—[interruption 
 order some of you want to get in later if this take forever you will not get in 
 the main reason why that this country wisely vote for brexit back in include million of labour supporter be that we want to take back control of our border so that we alone decide who come and settle in our country do the prime minister understand that this demand be even great today than it be back in and that we demand the country demands—[interruption do the prime minister understand that the country demand that he say to the french president that we will not accept undocumented male come across the english channel and that he be not dictate to by an increasingly arrogant anti brexit french president 
 we be fix the mess that we inherit and we be work with other country to ensure that we take the measure necessary to stop people cross the channel they be serious answer to serious problem for year the hon member ’s proposal the tail wag the tory dog have be to break everything and claim that it be how you fix thing and to stick finger up at our neighbour and then expect they to work with we he vote against the border bill which give more power to our law enforcement to deal with security at our border the reason for that be that he have no interest in fix the problem he want to milk it and exploit it that be the truth about he and his party 
 from   homelessness to child poverty so many of the challenge i see people face in exeter can be trace back to early year so i welcome the government rebuild on the legacy of sure start which be so cruelly dismantle by the conservative party will the prime minister set out what difference that will make to family service in exeter 
 i be grateful to my hon friend we have discuss this before he be a brilliant champion for exeter every child should have support to realise their potential the conservative party tear up sure start and take it out of our community an act of vandalism that abandon family and deepen inequality we be deliver best start family hub across the country that be in addition to free childcare be roll out and expand free school meal that be the change that a labour government make 
 grow number of people be join the call for a wealth tax on the super rich include former labour leader lord kinnock today a former minister of wales have do so and so it transpire do the chancellor when she be in opposition will the prime minister stand by his promise that those with the broad shoulder will carry the large burden will he clarify that that mean the ultra wealthy not disabled people the poor and child with special educational need 
 i be really not go to take advice from a party that put forward £ of unfunded commitment at the last election that be the sort of thing that get we into the problem in the place we can not just tax our way to growth we need to ensure that we put in place the necessary measure we be put in place plan reform to drive growth the hon member vote against that and the opposition vote against that 
 i be proud that the labour government be ban fire and rehire i be proud that we be address the abusive use of hour contract and improve protection at work particularly against unfair dismissal reform and its tory friend vote against labour ’s workplace protection   i do not know why tory member be heckle when they be in government they promise to deal with fire and rehire but despite the scandal at p&o they do absolutely nothing about it do my right hon and learn friend agree that it be only this labour government who will ensure that people have fairness at work 
 i be proud that we will give worker half of all worker strong right at work we be ensure sick pay for up to of the low pay tackle sexual harassment and provide bereavement leave for family who experience pregnancy loss before week compare that to the leader of the opposition who think that maternity pay be excessive and the leader of reform who want work people to pay tax so that there can be tax break for millionaire and billionaire both of they vote against reform and well protection of worker at every turn they always have and they always will they offer nothing for work people 
 with permission mr speaker before i ask my question may i tell the house that there be a number of veteran of northern ireland in the public gallery give what the prime minister say about i would like to publicly thank they for their courage in defend our country and our democracy against the scourge of terrorism 
 the prime minister know that every time a paramilitary be kill in northern ireland by a british soldier it trigger a thorough investigation no bullet go unscrutinised our soldier be hold to the high standard of law the ira be not they torture shoot man in the back force family to watch their menfolk be murder and kill woman and child with   bomb yet we be willing to prosecute our own man who be force to make life and death decision in split second 
 if the government get the legacy legislation wrong at least innocent retire veteran will be expose to legal persecution for crime they do not commit i have raise this matter time since february i ask again on monday when we debate this matter in westminster hall will the government protect our veteran or will they sacrifice they to politically motivate lawyer who be try to rewrite history with a pack of lie 
 may i join the right hon gentleman in thank the veteran here today and all veteran he know that this be a serious issue and the end of his question do not really reflect that seriousness the scheme set up by the conservative party be find to be unlawful in the court and he know it it be not support by community it would have mean as he know immunity from prosecution for those who commit the most appalling terrorist crime and that be why it do not have support in the community or from any political party in northern ireland that be among the reason it be find to be unlawful 
 we have to tread carefully and we have to get this right i will work with the right hon gentleman on that but we do not get there by cheapen the debate interruption this be not about political point scoring i have work in northern ireland i have speak to many of the people affect and i know that we must get this right i want to do so and i want the house to do that together if we possibly can because it matter but we have to do this in a serious way and address the issue of the past in a way that have the support of victim and survivor that be a key test for i because without their support it be very hard to come up with something that will have the confidence of everybody in northern ireland that be why we have to work in this way 
 in advance of the new legislation the secretary of state for northern ireland continue to engage with veteran and their community to ensure that legacy mechanism be fair lawful and proportionate i will continue to work with the right hon gentleman and other in the house because the most important thing be not score point but get it right 
 last week i publish a report that reveal the terrible legacy that the conservative party leave the nhs locally kid in basingstoke wait day follow a referral for access to mental health service that be time the national average i welcome the publication of the year plan last week it be lead by the prime minister will be deliver by a labour health secretary and be make possible by a labour chancellor what more can the government do to close the gap in mental health service locally and ensure that every kid in basingstoke have access to the very good mental health service 
 the conservative party fail to give child the support they need the year plan that we have put forward will rewire our nhs and transform mental health service with dedicated mental health a&e department give support specialist mental health professional in every school   and college benefit young people this year alone and an extra mental health staff to tackle long wait that be only possible because of the decision that we take to invest in our nhs decision that the conservatives oppose 
 i will add to the many call that the prime minister have already hear about the broken send system i meet headteacher and send co ordinator in my constituency of chichester last week they all tell i the same thing the send system be break it be adversarial parent be at break point there be not enough space in specialist school and the education health and care plan process be long harrowing and often degrade i know that the government be explore their option but will the prime minister take on board the liberal democrats call to introduce a national body for send so that we can end the postcode lottery and fix the problem for good 
 i thank the hon lady for raise this issue i know it be of concern to she and to many people across the house the system we have be break it do not serve anyone well we have to reform it and i set out in an early answer the step that we be take we will share those with the house and i hope that we can get the great support possible for the reform that i think everybody here know have to happen 
 i be delighted at the spending review commitment of £ for welsh rail a new station at magor and undy will take car off the congested m4 offer green journey and open door for local resident without a vehicle to get job it be also great value for money due to the track and infrastructure that be already in place do the prime minister agree that magor and undy be an excellent candidate to be the burns station to be build so that it can start serve local people 
 it be so good to see a strong labour mp stand up for wales and her constituency she make her case i can not confirm the plan yet but we will consider recommendation from the burns commission which include a proposal for a new station in her constituency i be delighted that just this week we set out our major road and rail scheme across the country include the a66 the newark bypass and the midland rail hub create ten of thousand of job new home and well journey for million of traveller 
 in the past few week i have speak to people from my rural north devon constituency who have be force to remove their own tooth with plier or with amateur surgical kit buy online because they be unable to find an nhs dentist what would the prime minister say to those people and when will the government banish this dentistry crisis to the history book where it belong 
 it be another shameful legacy of the conservative party that in adult struggle with nhs care and that tooth decay be the most common reason for hospital admission for child age to   that happen on their watch we be fix this and i can set out what we be do we be roll out urgent and emergency appointment reform the dental contract and recruit more dentist and newly qualified dentist who will practice in the nhs for a minimum period all of that be make possible only by the investment we put in in the budget which the conservative all oppose 
 tax evasion money laundering illicit good and illegal working all undermine our high street include freeman street in my constituency they undermine local business confidence and challenge community cohesion that be the reality around the country because of the explosion of vape shop fake barber harry potter shop and american candy store will the prime minister commit to work with his cabinet to bring in a national strategy to tackle the scourge of the high street and restore high street confidence 
 my hon friend be right to highlight this issue in march we see a major crackdown against criminal use high street business to launder money at almost property which involve secure freeze order over bank account total more than £ and arrest individual there be much more to come and i thank she for highlight this really important issue

 we be fix the problem that they—[interruption the conservatives say they would take control of the border and they lose it we be work hard with our ally we want to bring forward more power for law enforcement on our border through our border bill to give they the power they need to take on the job and deal with the problem and what do the conservatives do they vote against it a confected argument 
 tomorrow evening see the annual national police bravery award of the officer nominate this year be of those who be on the scene of the tragedy in my southport constituency last summer will the prime minister join i in pay tribute to sergeant gregory gillespie constable luke holden and pcso timothy parry who be with we in the gallery today for their immense bravery in the face of evil do he agree that just as our brave officer will always protect and defend we when we need they to this government will always support our brave officer in return

 i thank the hon member for raise this particular case which see a grave miscarriage of justice the statutory test for compensation have be raise in the house before and i have undertake to look at it i know he be work with the minister responsible on the particular case he raise 
 i thank the prime minister for lead from the front in promote the importance of his role as a father and keep time for family life i be delighted that in the past week the government have launch a review into parental leave and start to rebuild the legacy of sure start by launch our best start family hub both of those will make a huge difference to my constituent in ribble valley can he commit to the parental leave review create some truly ambitious outcome so that we can make the uk not only a world lead place to live and do business but the good place in the world to live a rewarding family life 
 the full review of parental leave and pay be a landmark moment the current system be simply out of date and too complicated in dad do not take paternity leave often because they can not afford to do so that be a great loss to they and their child i want parent to be able to give their child the good care and i want to make the system work well for employer 
 follow a week of internal conflict the prime minister will be well prepared if he want to join i this weekend at the tewkesbury medieval festival which include europe ’s large re enactment or perhaps next weekend he will don his leather jacket and turn it up to at the tewkesbury live music festival host by hospitality venue across the town regardless of that will he join i in thank the volunteer and the hospitality venue that make tewkesbury the unsung nucleus of gloucestershire ’s culture 
 what an invitation i be grateful for the invite to join the medieval festival but if i want to see a load of people stick in the past and fight each other i would probably go to the next meeting of the shadow cabinet i will consider it thank you 
 that complete prime minister ’s question 
 on a point of order mr speaker during pmq my hon friend   the member for clacton nigel farage   ask what i think be quite a reasonable question i know what the question be go to be but during pmq i could not hear a single word like other member in the chamber i be sure because   the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed who be behind i and other never shut up all the way through it we in reform uk do not subscribe to that sort of dog whistle politic will you please advise we mr speaker of how to stop this behaviour in the future 
 i think mr farage be capable of deal with his own battle as we have see on many occasion i would say that this be about the respect and tolerance that we should show each other what we do in here be reflect outside so please let we show common sense and respect for each other 
 on a point of order mr speaker at prime minister ’s question the prime minister claim in response to my question that the green party have make unfunded spending commitment in our general election manifesto he also say that to i at last week ’s prime minister ’s question that be clearly untrue our manifesto be fully cost include through proposal for the wealth tax that i be call for will you outline mr speaker how i might correct the record should i send a copy of our manifesto to the prime minister 
 i will not continue the debate from prime minister ’s question which i have end the hon gentleman have correct the record with what he have state which be now on the record 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if she will make a statement on her plan to restrict trial by jury through the creation of a crown court bench division and related sentencing change 
 this government inherit a justice system in crisis with record and rise backlog in our criminal court leave victim in limbo as they wait to see justice do for that reason the lord chancellor commission sir brian leveson to undertake a once in a generation review of the criminal court we be grateful to sir brian for all his work his report confirm that the system we inherit be break and that if we do nothing it will collapse we welcome the ambitious recommendation that he have put forward and agree that a crisis of this scale require bold action we must consider any measure that will put our court on a more stable and sustainable footing victim and the public deserve swift justice and a court system that they can have confidence in 
 we will carefully consider sir brian ’s recommendation on jury trial along with everything else before provide a formal response to parliament in the autumn jury trial be and will remain a cornerstone of british justice and will remain in place for the most serious case however justice delay be justice deny the system be not design for a scenario where ten of thousand of victim wait year for justice the lord chancellor and this government be commit to turn the tide on the crown court backlog by the end of this parliament and create a sustainable justice system fit for the century 
 all of we agree that justice delay be justice deny that be why it be so important to get control of the court backlog no pretend that this be straightforward but the government have make the crisis bad the backlog be at a record high and accelerate with case be add every month sir brian leveson ’s review rightly acknowledge that we must increase the number of court sitting day we thank he for his work and welcome many of his recommendation 
 however it can not be right to give another sentencing discount to those convict of crime such as burglary and stalking that could see criminal serve as little as a of their sentence when combine with the gauke review—20 of a sentence serve be that justice for victim out of court settlement for drug dealer and thief mean that they will not even get a criminal record it make a mockery of the justice system 
 just as concern be the proposal to scrap jury trial in many case the report admit that this will have only a limited effect on the backlog it will save just £ million—0.2 of the department ’s budget as the report state there be no limit to the case for which jury trial could be scrap this be a slippery slope towards abolish jury trial altogether 
 jury trial have be a central part of our constitution for century in magna carta and indeed before it they be a gift that we have give to the world to throw    they away so casually show a total disregard for our constitution and for such limited benefit it seem that too many on the government benches want to scrap jury trial regardless of the backlog because they do not trust the british public ’s instinct on justice they say that judge know well we say that the public know well it do not have to be this way the government must take up the lady chief justice ’s offer of more sitting day will the minister rule out yet another sentencing cut for criminal will she rule out let drug dealer and thief avoid even a criminal record do she accept that scrap jury trial be a disgraceful and unnecessary rejection of of our country ’s proud and most ancient liberty 
 what i do not hear in any of that be an apology it be extraordinary to hear that the shadow justice secretary have suddenly discover a sense of urgency but where be that sense of urgency in the past year the so call party of law of order allow thing to happen it take our prison system to the brink of collapse that let down the public and it let down victim soft on crime and soft on law and order secondly it allow the backlog in our crown court to run out of control to record high 
 for year the conservatives do absolutely nothing so let i explain the contrast with a party and a government who be grip the crisis and who be tough on law and order we commission of their own sir david gauke to give we his sentencing review we commission of our most revere judge sir brian leveson who today have set out his recommendation we will not provide our policy response today because that demand and require seriousness not what we hear from the shadow justice secretary but serious careful analysis and we will provide our formal response to the house in the autumn 
 but we be not delay we be not wait we be invest in the system to take up the challenge from the right hon gentleman about what the lady chief justice say we have already do what the previous government fail to do with an additional crown court sit day and a record level of sit day a year up from what the so call party of law and order give we we also understand that we need proper system capacity as we hear from the lord chancellor yesterday this be not simply about add more crown court sitting day as sir brian leveson tell we have the right hon gentleman bother to read the report we can not simply sit our way out of this crisis 
 we have to build system capacity more judge more prosecutor more defence lawyer and more court usher of course we need to invest in the system which be what the government be do with a promise of £ into our court additional to what the conservative party provide we be stay laser focus on our mission which be to provide swifter justice for victim and restore public confidence in a justice system that be leave to rack and ruin by the conservative party 
 the right hon gentleman have jump the gun we have be very clear that we be go to consider sir brian ’s careful and detailed report and we be go to listen to those who represent victim and to the barrister and judge who do such an exceptional job we will do what it take for the victim who if she   report a rape or serious crime be tell that she will have to wait until or in some case for her day in court that be unacceptable and that be why we will do whatever it take with the seriousness that the previous government simply fail to have 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 what sir brian ’s comprehensive report demonstrate be the terrible state that our once envy criminal justice system be leave in by the shadow lord chancellor and his colleague do my hon and learn friend agree with sir brian that dig ourselves out of the hole in which they leave we will require more investment great efficiency and structural change be that the debt that we owe to victim of crime in particular to ensure that they get justice it be up to this government to put right the wrong that have be do over the past year 
 as ever my hon friend the chair of the justice committee give a consider response and he be absolutely right there need to be a recognition of the scale of the problem and thing be require investment and reform when hon member read the report they will see that sir brian be very clear that we need investment this government be already begin to make that investment through the additional crown court sit day that we have lay on this year run the system at system max additional funding for legal aid lawyer and criminal legal aid and £ to keep the sector go on both the defence and the prosecutorial side we be make that investment but critically as sir brian make absolutely clear that alone will not be enough.[official report   september vol c. 2wc correction we need to consider once in a generation structural reform that will run a sustainable proportionate system that will allow we to deliver swifter justice for victim investment and reform that be what we will be get on with and that be what we will report on in the autumn 
 the minister will know the high regard in which i hold she with that in mind do she in her own heart believe that intermediate court will fix the criminal court backlog or do she agree with the legal profession that that risk be a costly distraction from invest in the exist system do she agree with i that chip away jury trial in the name of speed risk undermine the cornerstone of british justice 
 as i say in my opening response jury trial will remain a cornerstone for british justice for the most serious case but as sir brian levenson evidence in his careful report juryless trial can be swifter trial to put that into context of criminal trial in this country be currently hear without a jury that be how our criminal justice system currently function of course it be right that we listen to those who participate in the system whether they be prosecute or defend those in the system but it be also right that we listen to the voice who have welcome today ’s report the head of the met police former lord chancellors a former lord chief justice and the victim commissioner their voice matter too just as sir brian have do we need to consider a package of measure capable of alleviate the acute crisis in which we find ourselves 
 do my hon and learn friend agree that trial by jury be and will always remain a fundamental concept of our british justice system but we also need to ensure that we restore victim faith in the system and do what we can to ensure justice be not deny by justice be delay 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the shadow secretary of state for justice quote magna carta but the state ’s obligation be to ensure a fair trial and essential to a fair trial be timely justice in circumstance where some victim of crime be wait or year for their day in court that be not fair in fact that be result in many victim pull out of trial render court time waste and retraumatise those victim what the shadow secretary of state for justice have not read be the entirety of magna carta i quote 
 to no will we delay right or justice 
 the right to a timely trial be embed in magna carta and we need to get back to deliver it 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in his urgent question the shadow secretary of state for justice say that the public know good for once i agree with he which be why the public throw out the last conservative government after they crash our criminal justice system 
 yesterday i make the case for safeguard the guarantor of our justice system our jury trial however today on behalf of the liberal democrats i want to raise our concern that reclassify certain offence and draw on magistrate to run the new intermediate court risk put unbearable strain on the magistrate court jeopardise their ability to deliver swift justice especially for survivor of domestic abuse crime before adopt any new proposal will the minister publish an impact assessment of the measure on victim in magistrate court and will she rule out any measure that will delay justice safety or freedom for survivor of domestic abuse 
 the proposal for the reclassification of certain offence in sir brian ’s report be just that it be sir brian ’s recommendation as i have say already we need to take those recommendation away and consider whether they be appropriate for our justice system the hon gentleman be right to highlight the essential role that the magistrate play in our criminal justice system currently some of criminal trial be hear in our magistrate court and they do a phenomenal job that be why we be continue to recruit magistrate annually and we want a more diverse magistracy all of that will be essential he be right that these proposal which sir brian have convey as a package need to interlock and to be operable together so we be take the summer to engage with stakeholder such as the magistrates association to ensure that we get this right 
 with the crown court backlog that we inherit at such high level and continue to rise do the minister agree that tackle it mean not just add more sit day but make fundamental reform 
 the crisis that we inherit in our criminal court with record and rise backlog be intolerable the human impact of that on people whether they be victim witness or they serve in the criminal justice system be simply intolerable if we do nothing as the conservative party be all too willing to do the system will in the word of of its own former lord chancellor alex chalk become irrecoverable it be not enough to sit our way out of this crisis we must have radical structural reform as well that be the abide lesson of sir brian ’s report and we will take it on board 
 we should thank sir brian for his report and carefully consider his recommendation criminal already get a discount for an early guilty plea and the idea that that should be increase to risk undermine trust in the criminal justice system by victim jury trial be a century old cornerstone of the british justice system the creation of an intermediate court to save £ be not worth it when we have empty courtroom and judge available and ready to sit we need to build capacity and make the jury system work 
 i agree with the hon gentleman that we all owe a debt of gratitude to sir brian leveson and his team for the comprehensive review that they have undertake to which the government will be give due consideration over the summer before we formally provide our response we have to ensure that whatever package of proposal we take forward knit together with the recommendation from the gauke review and the outcome of the spending review that the ministry of justice have receive with a commitment to make an additional investment of £ in our court i want to address his point about intermediate court they be not about save money but about address the backlog deliver swifter justice for victim and have a criminal justice system in which the public can have confidence if this package of idea be right and will achieve that aim we will pursue it 
 i spend the year of my professional life in the criminal court as a barrister there be no who love the criminal justice system or who have more respect for jury than i do however the court now be not what they be the delay be so appalling that defendant just plead not guilty because they know that their case will not come up for year and the chance of actually face justice be minimal it be in that extreme state which we have inherit from the conservative government that radical action be need i know that my hon friend on the government front bench feel as i do about the criminal justice system and want it to work so when they be look at sir brian ’s recommendation will they consider a sunset clause if his recommendation work there will come a time when we can increase the amount of jury service again 
 my right hon friend speak with huge authority and personal experience of how our crown court operate like we she be commit to restore and rebuild our criminal justice system to what it once be and to a system fit for the century that the public can have confidence in that mean   adapt our method take on new technology and become more efficient all of that will come in the part of sir brian ’s review as we have ask he to do i will not pre empty the response or give a running commentary on it but all those thing will be take into account as we consider our response over the summer 
 last year i be on a jury we all know that we need to get the court backlog down but my experience at reading crown court be that the availability of juror really be not an issue many of we sit there for hour upon hour and several juror be dismiss on the thursday have never set foot in a courtroom before we restrict the number of jury trial what work have the government do to actually understand the utilisation of juror to see how many be be use and whether they could be use more effectively 
 i thank the hon gentleman and all those who perform the civic duty of participate in a jury for their service as i say that will remain a cornerstone of british justice for the most serious case but that be not the issue the issue be that demand come into the system simply outstrip the rate at which the court be able to address and dispose of those case we need to look at the system capacity the amount of judicial time the number of prosecutor and defence lawyer and the availability of suitable court building usher and criminal legal aid we need all that system capacity and we need to get it work together to address the challenge that other have outline i remind the hon gentleman that not only be of our criminal trial hear in magistrate court but it remain a fact that magistrate court deliver a turnaround of case on average or time fast than in crown court that be swift justice for victim and that be why we need to look at whole system reform 
 my constituent have a very simple view of the criminal justice system they want to know that the victim of crime will have their day in court and that the perpetrator will have a punishment commensurate with the crime they commit that underpin their faith in the system so they come forward to report crime while the conservatives seek to talk down the justice system will the minister set out what she and her department be do to ensure that victim of crime feel confident enough to come forward to report crime hopeful that they will get the outcome they want 
 my hon friend speak so passionately on behalf of his constituent i think the public ask for something really simple if people be unfortunate enough to be the victim of a crime they expect to have their day in court in a timely fashion not to be make to wait for year only to find that the trial have become ineffective and be put off for yet another year that undermine faith in the system and that be what be so detrimental about the neglect and under investment under the conservatives that have be so corrosive of trust in the justice system it be not simply that we be not deliver swift justice for victim it be that the public risk lose faith in our justice system which to date have be of the glory of this country 
 do the minister agree that of the bad feature of the us justice system be the extreme process of plea bargaining which give such a huge differential if somebody plead guilty that it create a perverse incentive to do so even if they be innocent but not confident that they will be acquit can she guarantee that we be not go down that route with a discount for plead guilty couple with early release for other reason 
 english common law and our commitment to the rule of law with our independent judiciary be part of what make this country great we be not go to ape the american system or indeed any other system we will look carefully at the recommendation of sir brian leveson ’s report include in relation to the use of goodyear indication but we know that our law be robust provide that we have a justice system that be up to the task of enforce that law that be what we be really focus on 
 under the tories last year of rape victim drop out of their case because they be leave wait year for justice we finally have a justice secretary who have put victim and allocate the high number of sit day on record give all the outrage from the conservatives at the size of the backlog i be really keen to know what they do will the minister answer what this labour government be do to get justice for victim quick 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we talk about sit day and backlog and it can all sound a little arid and academic but it come back to people the fact that so many victim of rape and serious sexual offence pull out of the process be testament to the fact that the system be not work that be the direct consequence of allow the backlog to run out of control we have to keep victim engage in the process which be why we have invest specifically in victim service and why we be look to strengthen the victim code ultimately victim want swift justice that be why we will take a careful look at sir brian ’s recommendation and do what it take to bring down the backlog 
 magistrate court be already under significant stress some of trial do not go ahead on the day that they be list remove the right to choose a jury trial for sentence of under year under an intermediate court can not reverse year of underfunding the closure of local court and severe staff shortage from prosecutor to defence advocate the consultation on the reform of local justice area propose to merge north wales bench against the advice of local magistrate do the minister recognise the risk of yet further disruption to justice in wales 
 the right hon lady have describe how important the role of the magistrate court will be and the importance of whole system reform the government be not look to tweak aspect to tweak what go on in the magistrate court or the crown court of the genius of the magistrate court be the local link and the fact that it deliver local justice so we will look at that carefully but there be no   get away from it the scale of the problem and what sir brian ’s report tell we mean that we need whole system reform of the criminal justice system from begin to end 
 i thank the minister for her statement and for the recognition of the importance of magistrate court sadly harlow magistrate court be close by the previous government as be chorley magistrate court of course i recently speak to a police officer in my constituency who have be a police officer for year he be be ask to gather evidence to go to court for crime commit before he be even a police officer be it any wonder that victim have lose confidence in the system this government need to ensure that we have fundamental reform to this process to ensure that people in my constituency get the justice they deserve 
 and we can reopen the court in chorley they be available 
 i come back to the fact that this government be invest in our court estate we have invest an additional £ in our court building for maintenance and to keep the show on the road but my hon friend be absolutely right the delay will reach a tipping point if we choose to do nothing about they and that be simply not an option the obligation on the state be to deliver a fair trial and timeliness be critical to that the long the wait the more likely it be that victim will pull out of the system and that the evidence become undermine because people ’s memory fade that be why timeliness and get the delay down be so critical to the mission we have to pursue 
 here we go again labour always talk tough on crime and always go soft the minister talk about david gauke as of our own as if that be some defence i assure she that i probably have more in common with she than i do with david gauke that be not a good way to show off credential on be tough on crime i have see at hand where the court the police and the crown prosecution service work together to cut through all the bureaucracy and backlog to get tough on crime in lancashire organise crime gang member be be take off the street every single week through op warrior with many remand straight into prison and their case go through the court i plead with the minister to rule out as soon as possible any of the measure recommend that would see those organise crime gang member potentially not even get a criminal record 
 it be a bit rich to accuse those on the government benches of be soft on crime the hon gentleman ’s party allow the prison to run hot and add prison place in year we have commit the money for that simply do not stand up to scrutiny the conservatives allow the backlog in the court to simply run out of control to the point where alex chalk again another of their own point out that the position would become irrecoverable that be the consequence of do nothing be tough on crime be about rebuild and invest in our criminal justice system invest in prison and our court   deliver on the tough reform that will be require to deliver swifter justice for victim and get tough on exactly the sort of gang that the hon gentleman describe 
 after year of conservative government victim of rape and serious sexual crime be wait year to see justice it appear that the shadow justice secretary have recently discover that our criminal justice system be break when do the minister think he will discover who break it 
 that be not in order 
 order mr stuart i do not need any challenge from you you should know well you be on the speaker ’s panel of chairs you really do have to think about what you be say your behaviour be get intolerable 
 when the victim commissioner the london victims commissioner and those who engage and support victim through victim service tell i that we have to take this opportunity for once in a generation reform because we be let victim of crime down i take that more seriously than any other plea for change it be absolutely obvious that the delay from run a system with such record and rise backlog and the failure to invest have real consequence for people ’s life people be pull out of the system and out of the process because they have simply lose faith in it i will be think of their voice of the victim every day that we consider these proposal and drive they forward failure be not an option 
 i have caution about strip back jury trial so i ask the government to commit to tackle court backlog by invest in more court capacity particularly in bristol and the west country by support rehabilitation to stop reoffende and people come back into the system so quickly and by address the root cause of crime will the minister consider that under the leveson proposal there may be space for some of the good example of the us court system some state have next day hearing for domestic abuse case where court can catch perpetrator in the window of remorse when they will recognise their guilt and accept that they need to change 
 the hon member be right that as we take forward and be ready to announce the package of reform in response to sir brian ’s review we will consider how we can take forward the good of our exist system and indeed learn from other system whether that be intensive supervision court where we have see some good result or tackle the root cause that lie behind crime and engage in preventive measure we should be do all that this be our opportunity we have reach a point of crisis we have reach the point of emergency no more no less as a result of the inheritance from the previous government but we have get to take the opportunity to build back well with a more sustainable and more innovative justice system that the public can   have confidence in and that protect the public that be what we must do the hon member be right we should learn we should listen and we should build something well 
 as i think member across the house would agree alex chalk the former lord chancellor and justice secretary be take seriously in this place as be his opinion he recently say that some case 
 could conceivably be deal with by a judge and winger so reserve the crown court for the most serious case it be helpful to look at which case should be triable either way and which should be summary only 
 do the minister agree that it be worth take note of serious voice like alex chalk rather than the opportunism of the shadow justice secretary 
 this issue be far too serious not to take seriously i listen to voice such as those of the former lord chancellor former lord chief justice sir ian burnett the victim commissioner and sir mark rowley they be all say that we have get to take these matter and these recommendation seriously it be that serious work that this government will engage in and we will not duck the difficult decision 
 the minister rightly point to the comparative inefficiency between crown court and magistrate court the clear issue be that we need new technology to be introduce to crown court so that people who be on trial and victim be serve fast quick and more expediently the reality be that many case collapse as a result of the evidence not be sufficient or bring fast enough why then have the minister allow the efficiency part of the leveson report to be delay that could bring forward much need recommendation that we could action to cut the backlog
