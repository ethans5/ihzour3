on   april nail bomb go off in london kill and injure of they explode at brick lane the hub of london ’s bengali community explode in soho at the admiral duncan pub the heart of london ’s gay district and explode in brixton in an attack on south london ’s black community the sick terrorist who commit those evil act be motivate by hatred he hat bengalis and black people because of their race he hat lgbt people because of who they love and how they live their life he hat those group because they be different from he he hat they because of who they be 
 i raise that appalling incident to remind the house that hatred come in many form but whoever in our society it be against we must all stand equally strongly against it we must have hate crime law that show that whether the hatred be for someone ’s race religion sexual orientation gender identity or disability britain be a country that will not tolerate it that all hatred be equal and that all those who commit vile act of hatred will face the same grave consequence 
 i regret to say that that be not currently the case today the law recognise category of hate crime race religion sexual orientation transgender identity and disability but only race and religion be treat as aggravate offence subject to strong sentencing power the other be not that discrepancy can not be right we can not say as a society that some form of hatred be more evil than other 
 i be at university when section be introduce i remember it vividly it be more than a law it be an attack on the right of people like i to live openly it stigmatise lesbian gay and bisexual people and it push we out of public life i go into politic to fight that cruel law and everything it represent 
 hate corrode our entire society it do not just harm the individual who be target it create fear fear to go outside fear to speak up fear to be see it silence people it make we all afraid research by stonewall find that less than half of lgbt+ people feel safe hold their partner ’s hand in public that be the impact that the fear of hatred have on people it make they afraid even to show the world that they exist 
 unfortunately far too many recorded crime never result in charge of disability hate crime record by police lead to prosecution of homophobic hate crime lead to prosecution of hate crime against transgender people only lead to prosecution behind those statistic be real people whose scar may heal on the outside but who may never recover from the fear and trauma that they have suffer 
 in a teenage far right extremist be jail for target and attack a transgender woman along with another young man he kick she to the ground in a park in swansea and hurl transphobic abuse at she in cassie a phd student and wheelchair user be wait outside a shop when drunk man grab her wheelchair push she down the road and make sexual comment she have to escape by roll into traffic 
 we must fight back against this hatred we must show that we be not content to stick with the status quo the victim of these attack deserve to live in a society that say that we take this hatred seriously and will not stand for it victim must be at the heart of our criminal justice system and we must ensure that law protect they that be why my new clause be so important 
 lgbt and disabled people tell i that they do not feel as safe as they use to we be see rise transphobia everywhere pride flag be be take down at county hall and some politician be openly question whether disability be even real i be proud that labour in our manifesto commit to equalise our hate crime law by make hate crime against lgbt people and disabled people aggravate offence i be proud to be bring   forward that change through new clause i hope that i can persuade all my parliamentary colleague to support the new clause today and to take this important step forward for equal right 
 i thank my hon friend the members for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier and for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball for stand shoulder to shoulder with i throughout this process and i urge the house to support the new clause 
 as mp we receive a wide range of correspondence from constituent during some of the most difficult time in their life but the email that i receive from emma johnson be perhaps of the most harrowing that i have ever receive it be because of emma ’s story that i have table new clause and i will speak to it today 
 on   november emma have just go into labour with her young child mother and child be okay when she receive a call inform she that her parent have be tragically kill in a car crash the driver of the other vehicle have no licence and be uninsured on what be suppose to be of the happy day of emma ’s life she instead have to identify the body of her parent ian and gail when the case come to court the driver of the other vehicle be charge with the less offence of cause death by careless driving rather than by dangerous driving that produce the sentence available to the court even though he be swerve in and out of traffic and drive without a licence or insurance i put it to the house that this by its very nature be dangerous 
 since the verdict emma have be fight not for vengeance but to make sure that no other family have to suffer the same injustice she have seek justice not just for her parent but for other people who face the same heartbreak she be call for a simple but vital change any driver who kill while drive without a licence or insurance should automatically face the more serious offence of cause death by dangerous driving today i say directly to emma who i know be watch that i fundamentally agree with you your dedication to the cause be commendable and you be do your late parent proud 
 we know that road accident happen but if someone wilfully get behind the wheel of a car when unlicensed and uninsured and swerve in and out of traffic that be not an accident it be a dangerous choice to put other life at risk new clause would rightly treat such behaviour as seriously as drive under the influence of drug or alcohol it would close a loophole in the current law and bring great justice for victim if the new clause do not progress today i ask the minister to meet i and emma to ensure that her campaign continue 
 i thank the chair of the transport committee for her comment she be right to recognise the excellent work that hs2 have do on skill and the workforce we have over people work on this project at the moment and i think that hs2 have do good work on open up opportunity whether through apprenticeship for the next generation or through the supply chain i will heed my hon friend ’s advice about learn from the speed and ease with which other country deliver infrastructure project 
 i have be ask to reply as my right hon friend the prime minister have be attend the g7 summit in canada in an era of global instability we be work with our partner to urge de escalation in the middle east to put pressure on russia to agree to a ceasefire and to deliver security renewal for the british people

 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 the minister for women and equalities be ask 
 what step she be take to ban conversion practice 
 what step she be take to ban conversion practice 
 when she plan to bring forward legislative proposal to ban conversion therapy 
 let i be clear conversion practice have no place in today ’s society and this government be commit to bring forward trans inclusive legislation to ban these outdated and abusive act this be a complex issue that we want to get absolutely right we be work hard to publish later in this session draft legislation that offer protection from these harmful practice while also preserve individual freedom to explore their identity with appropriate support 
 since the supreme court ruling many trans people have feel discrimination and a loss of their right despite still be protect under the equality act i be pleased to hear that the government be bring forward a trans inclusive conversion therapy ban but what else will the minister do to ensure that trans people know they belong in our society and be value 
 i can indeed assure my hon friend that our draft legislation on conversion practice will be trans inclusive it be crucial that trans people be safe include and protect from harm and discrimination more widely this government be actively work on other manifesto commitment to strengthen service and protection for tran people include ensure that all trans people receive appropriate and high quality healthcare and equalise all strand of hate crime 
 i recently meet representative of trans liberation bournemouth who share with i their anxiety about the supreme court ruling a ruling that have cause not only confusion in their otherwise supportive workplace but distress incident for biological woman who do not conform to traditional gender norm what   assurance can the minister give my constituent that this government be commit to ensure that bournemouth remain an open and welcome place for our lgbt+ community 
 i will indeed give that assurance rightly law be in place to protect trans people from discrimination and harassment that remain the case to be clear i be absolutely committed to deliver on our key manifesto commitment aim at protect lgbt+ individual a full trans inclusive ban on conversion practice and our commitment to equalise all exist strand of hate crime dignity and respect for everyone run through every sinew of this government 
 previous government have promise to bring forward legislation to ban conversion therapy but it have not happen yet eris of my constituent in horsham tell i that recent headline have create fear and uncertainty within the trans community increase their sense of isolation will the minister show the lgbtq community that they be not ill or something to be convert and commit to action within the next month 
 as we know the previous government repeatedly break their promise to deliver on the issue of conversion practice and allow the debate to become ever more toxic and divided we be committed to bring forward legislation to ban these abusive practice that be a key manifesto commitment we will be publish our draft bill later in this session and we want to work with parliament to ensure that our legislation be robust and do not negatively impact legitimate support for those explore their sexual orientation or gender identity 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson interruption oh sorry i call jim shannon how could i forget he 
 absolutely right mr speaker i thank the minister very much for her answer but can she outline what support be in place for people of all faith and none to receive counselling that be right and appropriate help they to find the answer that they all seek 
 as i have explain we be absolutely committed to go forward with a ban on conversion practice but we want to make sure that when we legislate that legislation do not inhibit proper genuine supportive counselling and guidance as people explore their gender identity or sexual orientation 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as liberal democrats we have be concern about the lack of a draft bill on conversion practice so i be relieve to hear what the minister have say today however give the amount of fear and anxiety that there be among the trans community in this country can she reassure the house that when the bill come forward it will be uk wide to overcome the scottish government ’s withdrawal of their proposal far will the government consider whether we need fresh legislation to deal with   all the issue in the equality act that have be raise by the equality and human rights commission ’s interim guidance and the supreme court judgment 
 there be a real range of question there we be bring forward legislation that affect england and wales but i can assure the hon member that we be in talk with official in the scottish parliament on that very issue i also assure she that we will be bring this legislation forward very soon and that there will be a proper opportunity for that pre legislative scrutiny which i know she will want to take part in 
 whether she plan to take step with cabinet colleague to develop a strategy to improve educational outcome for boy 
 whether she plan to take step with cabinet colleague to develop a strategy to improve educational outcome for boy 
 attainment for boy be on average low than for girl this government be determined to understand and address the driver behind that we be focus on drive educational excellence everywhere for every child in every school and my school white paper in the autumn will set out our vision for a system that deliver on excellence for everyone 
 recent research by the centre for social justice show that at key stage key stage gcse a level and t level boy be underperform girl we simply can not allow half a generation not to be allow to reach their full potential as part of her approach will the secretary of state consider look at whether boy might need to be teach somewhat differently from girl 
 i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s interest in this area and the constructive way in which he be approach an important topic i too have look at the research from the centre for social justice which provide some important pointer through the school white paper we will consider all the way we can well support boy and young man as group we know that the performance of free school meal eligible white british boy be particularly low that be something we inherit from the conservatives 
 the logic behind have a woman ’s minister be the idea that woman present and have different problem in society by that logic man and boy do too we know about suicide and we have just hear about educational attainment we hear about help seek opportunity and i welcome the man ’s health strategy but be it not time we have a minister for man and boy to look across government and deal with education unemployment suicide and health and really get to grip with the problem face young man and boy 
 the hon gentleman raise some important area of concern include health outcome suicide educational outcome and the need to well support boy young man and man throughout their life he will appreciate that ministerial appointment   be for the prime minister so i will not get ahead of myself and make any announcement from the dispatch box today

 a constituent contact i specifically about the digital inclusion action plan explain that because of his voice disability spasmodic dysphonia he struggle to access essential service such as banking   because automated phone system could not understand his voice there be often no clear way of bypass those system and alternative like webchat be slow and ineffective this be a grow issue for many people with communication disability what step be the minister taking with cabinet colleague to ensure that service remain accessible and will the issue be address through the action plan 
 the hon lady have raise some interesting point the action plan outline initial action include the establishment of an ambitious digital inclusion innovation fund i do not know whether some of those idea could be use to address the concern that the hon lady have raise but we do want to be ambitious in all this in the pathway to work green paper publish a couple of month ago we talk about assistive tech and the possibility of make it more widely available maybe there be solution there that could be take forward i would be interested to talk to the hon lady about what more we might do

 my hon friend be right it be important to ensure that the tech that be available in jobcentre be appropriate for people ’s need element of the action plan be the launch this summer of an it reuse for good charter encourage organisation to set up device donation scheme because we think that they can play a helpful part as well

 far too many woman like samantha be force to leave work because they do not get the support that they need that be why we be meet the need of woman with endometriosis in the workplace through a number of measure in the employment rights bill strengthen statutory sick pay arrangement make flexible working available to more people and open up conversation about woman ’s health through employer action plan will benefit all employee manage the condition we be turn the commitment in the woman ’s health strategy into tangible action

 the hon gentleman will be aware that we be take forward a number of measure as part of the woman ’s health strategy he will also know that as a result of our pilot on woman ’s health hub which have be establish in of england ’s integrate care system we be work to make sure that we be support and tackle woman ’s health include by shift care out of hospital reduce waiting list and continue to engage with local area to use the learning from woman ’s health hub to improve the local delivery of service 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 woman be wait up to year for a diagnosis of endometriosis or adenomyosis our women and equalities committee report recommend a maximum wait of year which be still a long time to live with intense pain and fertility decline but it would be an improvement give that reproductive health issue cost the uk economy £ a year the soon condition be treat the soon woman can get on with their life do the minister agree that invest in woman ’s health be essential and how be she raise the importance of the woman ’s health strategy with her colleague include the health secretary

 i thank the hon member for raise this issue she be right it be unacceptable that woman can wait up to year for an endometriosis diagnosis the national institute for health and care excellence ’s update guideline on endometriosis make firm recommendation on referral and investigation which will help woman receive a diagnosis and effective treatment fast it be important that we continue to work as closely we can on this issue across the whole uk

 the hon member be right to raise this issue the current system do track too many people in financial inequality we want disabled people to have chance in work which other have always take for grant we will invest an additional £ a year by the end of the decade in work health and skill support 
 i have speak to several disabled constituent who be deeply fearful about the propose cut to the limited capability for work and work relate activity element of universal credit research by sense show that in disabled people with complex need could be push into debt if the change go ahead will the minister and his colleague in the department for work and pensions review this damaging proposal 
 at the moment there be people out of work on health and disability ground who would love to be in a job and who say they could be in a job today if they have the support to make that possible for they we be determined to provide they with that support 
 as the minister know the personal independence payment be a passport benefit for carer ’s allowance the government ’s impact assessment suggest that approximately family carer will lose out due to the propose change to the eligibility criterion for pip what further analysis have the government do of the financial impact of welfare reform on family carer 
 we be consult on the support that will be need over the next few year for perhaps in of those currently claim pip support will be need for those who lose their benefit and that will include family carer who receive carer ’s allowance at the moment 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 we be take firm action across government to deliver our unprecedented ambition to halve violence against woman and girl in a decade that be underpin by a new government strategy which be to be publish this summer last year we launch new domestic abuse protection order and set out new measure to tackle stalk through the safe street mission board and the vawg ministerial group ministers across government regularly meet to discuss and drive progress 
 it sadden i to see an article in the glasgow times about the rise of sex crime at scottish train station sexual abuse compensation advice find that there have be a increase in sex crime at scottish station with a total of crime report in do the minister agree that woman should be able to use public transport without fear of assault will she tell i what her department be do to tackle such issue

 i call the shadow minister 
 time and again we conservative members ask the government to hold a national statutory inquiry into the grooming gang scandal time and again government ministers insist that the local inquiry would be enough despite a suspect town have groom gang operate in they as report by charlie peters from gb news now after the casey review and the announcement of the national commission what reassurance can the minister give victim that the suspect town will be investigate if a town or   city where a grooming gang be suspect to operate refuse to have an inquiry can the minister compel the commission to investigate in other word do the government have any accountability whatever 
 the shadow minister may not have listen closely to the statement on monday because that be confirm by the home secretary he may want to know that early this year the financial times tell we the reality of what go on inside the previous government after alexis jay ’s report the ft say that no urge home office ministers to 
 do more to engage with alexis and draw up a plan for her recommendation 
 veteran admit that 
 the report come out at an unfortunate time and be maybe to some extent forget or deprioritise 
 forgotten or deprioritised”—yet now the conservatives have the cheek to lecture this government about the action we be take to support and protect victim 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i be proud to be drive our opportunity mission as part of this government ’s plan for change to break the link between background and success in our spending review we announce that we be extend free school meal to all child with a parent on universal credit lift child out of poverty by the end of the parliament that be the difference a labour government make 
 my constituent theo who be blind and a braillist have not receive a single useable braille past paper despite be nearly a year into his a level and report that his gcse paper last year contain so many error that they be nearly impossible to use will the minister take immediate action to ensure that exam board fulfil their legal duty under the equality act to provide accessible examination material and urgently review ofqual ’s monitoring 
 i be concerned to hear of the experience of the hon gentleman ’s constituent if he provide i with some information i can make sure that this be properly investigate 
 i be shocked to read recently that ofsted find that of teenage girl be be put under pressure to provide sexual image of themselves they can be ask for these picture multiple time a night what consideration will there be of social medium in the wide strategy to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question i share her concern about the issue and its impact on young woman and girl that be why the secretary of state for science innovation and technology be bring forward further action to ensure that girl be protect from harm and why later this year we   will publish update guidance on relationship sex and health education to tackle all form of misogyny and ensure that young man and woman can thrive in our country 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i point to page of baroness casey ’s report which show a worrying number of live investigation of case in which there be an overlap between child sexual exploitation and criminal exploitation the report note that a significant proportion of case appear to involve suspect who be claim asylum which minister be directly responsible for safeguard our community include those house in asylum hotel if the government manage to close asylum hotel as they claim they will and individual move into other accommodation will any danger transfer from hotel to the wide community be account for 
 the hon lady will know that the home secretary recently make an extensive statement to parliament set out the action that this government will take to address the many failure leave behind by the conservatives baroness casey outline that there have be a decade of lose time and a failure to deliver justice for victim this government will take action we will root out all form of child sexual exploitation keep child safe from harm and ensure that perpetrator be finally prosecute 
 for decade too many people block their ear and turn their back on town and individual ask for help as well as on the national call for help will the minister confirm that those in their ivory tower in whitehall can now be compel to give evidence under oath on their action and assumption include vitally senior civil servant former crown prosecution service employee and previous director of public prosecutions 
 as the home secretary set out on monday anyone find to have be responsible for cover up or hide vile crime of child sexual abuse must and will be prosecute however the conservatives have a decade to act the lose decade that baroness casey talk about and the recommendation from alexis jay sit on a shelf without be act on this government immediately bring forward the child ’s wellbeing and schools bill to deliver the big upgrade in child protection legislation in a generation a bill that the conservatives oppose 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question i welcome to the gallery the speaker of the assembly of representatives of tajikistan

 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday june 
 i have be ask to reply as my right hon and learn friend the prime minister have be attend the g7 summit in canada in an era of global instability we be work with our partner to urge de escalation in the middle east to put pressure on russia to agree to a ceasefire and to deliver security renewal for the british people 
 the air india plane crash last week be devastating our thought and condolence be with everyone affect by this awful incident and we be work closely with the indian authority to support those in need 
 year ago we lose our beloved friend and colleague jo cox who be a beacon of positivity and courage her legacy live on i must take this opportunity to also remember sir david amess who be much miss by the whole house 
 this sunday mark windrush day we celebrate the extraordinary contribution of the windrush generation and their descendant to our country 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 give the strong consensus across this house on the importance of de escalation of the deeply worrying conflict between israel and iran do the deputy prime minister agree that this house ’s action must match its word will she therefore give a commitment that before any further military support be give to the israeli government whether it be the deployment of raf jet or armed force her government will give mps in this house a free vote on the matter 
 the situation in the middle east be fast move and deeply concerning and there be clear potential for a significant and rapid worsening of the situation in every step we take we will always be guide by the safety of british national and the uk national interest that be why we have deploy jet to the region so that contingency support be in place for our armed force personnel and it be why we be ask british national to register their presence we will keep all advice under review 
 too many of my constituent be stick in unsuitable housing and after year of inaction from the conservatives local family be be split up because there be not enough affordable home i welcome this government ’s plan to turbocharge the delivery of social and affordable housing include through the new national housing bank i ask the deputy prime minister to confirm that this government will finally give my constituent the security that they deserve 
 my hon friend be right to talk about the year of failure by the conservatives labour be turn the tide on the housing crisis and i be proud to announce today our commitment to establish a new publicly own national housing bank back by £ of new finance this include £ in low interest loan for social housing to help achieve the big uplift to social and affordable housing in a generation 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 i associate myself with the deputy prime minister ’s remark about the tragic air crash in india and of course about our dear colleague jo cox and sir david amess i also join she in call for de escalation between israel and iran while note that everything possible must be do to stop iran get a nuclear weapon 
 yesterday the leader of the opposition and i meet survivor of the rape gang scandal and their family member fiona teresa lucia and marlon tell we how authority deliberately cover up the systematic rape of young girl and some boy by gang of predominantly pakistani heritage man they cover it up because they care more about so call community relation than protect vulnerable girl that be disgusting 
 the survivor tell we that they will only have confidence in an inquiry if it be independently lead have full statutory power and cover all town affect include bradford they will also only have confidence in it if those who cover this up be prosecute foreign perpetrator be all deport survivor be closely involve and it be set up before the summer recess can the deputy prime minister give the survivor and their family those assurance 
 i thank the shadow home secretary for his tone and for put the survivor and victim at the heart of his question it be absolutely right that we all look at what have happen over the last couple of decade and at the countless report that we have have and look to implement they he be right to talk about the confidence that people must have in the independent inquiry my right hon friend the home secretary speak about that early this week in relation to baroness casey ’s report which we will take forward at speed the inquiry will be independent and it will have statutory power we will also implement the jay report which he will have know about as the minister in charge at the time we will get on with take action i hope conservative members will adopt his tone so that we can make sure that the whole house put victim and that we all work together to get to the bottom of this 
 it be vital that scandal like this be never again cover up because of the racial background of perpetrator baroness casey ’s report say to use her word that people who downplay the ethnic dimension be let victim down so i have to raise the matter of the language that the prime minister use in january when i be afraid to say he smear campaigner as jump on a far right bandwagon simply for call for the very inquiry that he have now be force to set up stand up for rape victim be not far right will the deputy prime minister apologise for what the prime minister say 
 the prime minister do not just raise issue he have act on they he bring the prosecution against groom gang and call for action to address ethnicity issue in the right hon member will know that the datum that the previous government collect be inaccurate and not complete baroness casey recognise this and it be the subject of of the recommendation that we will take forward the prime minister make those comment specifically about tory ministers who sit for year in government and do absolutely nothing about this scandal 
 smearing campaigner who stand up for rape victim as be far right be completely unacceptable and the prime minister should never have say that i commend his predecessor my right hon friend   the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak for the grooming gang taskforce that he set up which lead to arrest in its year baroness casey ’s report also say that a significant number of rape gang perpetrator be non uk national or asylum seeker many of whom enter the country illegally we also know that most illegal immigrant cross the channel be young man contrary to what the chief secretary to the treasury say last week do the deputy prime minister now accept that the small boat crisis be of public safety as well as a border crisis 
 this be a very serious issue and more need to be do let i update the house work with our ally we have carry out a series of major arrest to tackle the smuggling gang behind this vile trade in the past month a ringleader who have smuggle almost migrant have be jail for year we can go further thank to the law enforcement agreement we have strike with germany italy serbia and the balkan state that be in stark contrast to the right hon gentleman who be the man at the heart of the home office when immigration soar we lose control of our border and we spend £ of taxpayer money on persuade just volunteer to be remove to rwanda i take no lecture from he 
 if she want to find out who have lose control of our border i suggest that she look to her immediate right because ever since the home secretary scrap the rwanda deterrent before it even start illegal immigration across the channel have go up by so far have be the bad year in history for illegal immigrant cross the channel that be on her watch that be down to her government 
 the prime minister be plan crisis talk with president macron and be finally admit that the situation be in his word deteriorate the government ’s laughable plan to smash the gang lie in tatter will the deputy prime minister at last accept that we need a removal deterrent so that every single illegal immigrant who arrive on these shore be immediately remove will she commit to that yes or no 
 if the conservatives want to argue that the arrival since july be down to the scrapping of the rwanda scheme they need to explain why there be more than arrival in the same period start in july when the rwanda agreement be in place it be absolute rubbish they lose control of our border we be get control of our border the right hon gentleman need to apologise 
 i do not see how the deputy prime minister have the brass neck to claim that she have the situation under control when the number cross the channel this year be the high in history she ask about the rwanda deterrent she be obviously not listen to what i say early the rwanda scheme never start indeed illegal immigrant in calais—[interruption 
 order i want to hear the question and i be sure our constituent want to hear the question and the answer 
 the rwanda scheme never start illegal immigrant in calais say before the election how much they want the prime minister to get elect because he would help they to get here when australia start a similar scheme about year ago it work within a few month 
 as a consequence of the government lose control they now accommodate in asylum hotel and flat grow number of illegal immigrant many of whom cross the channel the home office ’s supplier be actively offer above market deal to landlord to get hold of their property for use by illegal immigrant in the meantime hard press young people here be unable to rent or buy why do this government prioritise housing for illegal immigrant above housing for our young people 
 again i gently say to the right hon member that under his government ’s watch immigration increase fourfold until it reach almost a in a single year they also create the backlog—400 hotel which we reduce to just over in our month in government pound a day spiffed up the wall because they be so incompetent we be build the home that they fail to deliver over consecutive year of failure they should apologise while we get on with the job of rebuild britain 
 goodness i the deputy prime minister have a cheek housing start in quarter last year go down her mission to rebuild britain be not go very well she talk about asylum hotel but she obviously have not look at the most recent number the number of people in asylum hotel be high in march this year than it be at the time of the election and she give no answer about the priority be give to illegal immigrant over people already live here 
 a zimbabwean paedophile due for deportation be recently allow to stay in the uk because a court find that he might face some hostility back in zimbabwe which apparently breach his article right what about the right of child here to be protect from this dangerous paedophile who be look out for their right not the government there be thousand of such case involve foreign criminal there be a solution we need to scrap the human rights act for immigration matter so that this sovereign parliament decide on the law that our court apply but the deputy prime minister ’s party vote against that i have a simple question why do the government side with foreign criminal and not the british public 
 the conservatives have year of failure on these issue we have deport foreign national offender since we come to office which be more than they do over the same period i will take no lecture from the johnny come lately who could not do anything when he be in office 
 last saturday mark year since grenfell year fight for justice the hillsborough family include margaret aspinall from huyton have campaign for year for decade for the hillsborough law can   the deputy prime minister tell i whether this labour government will bring forward the hillsborough law without delay will they honour the promise make to victim of state cover up and will they finally deliver justice for the 
 i thank my hon friend for her question for the work that she have do with campaigner such as margaret in their fight for justice and for mention grenfell the anniversary of which be not so long ago we remain fully committed to bring in a hillsborough law the state have fail victim and their family too many time in the past which be precisely why our focus be now on get the legislation right i can assure she that measure will be bring forward as soon as we be confident that they will deliver the justice that victim deserve and we want to do this at pace

 in we liberal democrats be incredibly proud to lead the campaign against the iraq war a war in which the uk blindly follow the us in a move that be not back by the united nations in light of report that president trump be seriously consider join the war between israel and iran launch a us strike against iran ’s nuclear facility can the deputy prime minister confirm that if president trump do take such action today ’s labour government will not blindly follow the us into war again

 i be grateful to the deputy prime minister we support those effort 
 today the government be set to unveil their plan to cut personal independence payment and carer ’s allowance a prospect that of my constituent describe as terrifying liberal democrat analysis of the government ’s own datum suggest that disabled people be at risk of lose some support can the deputy prime minister honestly say hand on heart that that be the change that disabled people and their carer be promise 
 labour be the party of work and the party of fairness and social justice we have announce a plan to get britain work again and we be clear on the principle i want to be clear on that that those who want to work should be able to work and those who can never work should be protect 
 the current system which we have inherit do not support those who need that support and do not allow people opportunity for employment i have personal experience of it i know what the hon lady be say and i know how some people be fearful of the change but this labour government have put their value into place and will ensure that people be support into work where they can work and those who can not will be support we be the party of the welfare state we set it up after the world war and believe it should be there for people who need it but we should also help people into work

 my hon friend be a long stand advocate for child protection and i pay tribute to she campaign on these issue we share her determination to do what be right for the victim and the survivor we recognise that no sum of money can ever fully compensate for the horror they have experience we be commit to fund effort to tackle child sexual abuse in the future and support survivor to rebuild their life that be why we will make it easy for victim to make personal injury claim through the civil court by remove the year time limit and we be redouble funding for therapeutic support   service 
 this refugee week be an opportunity for the house to show solidarity with those flee war persecution and oppression compassion and welcome be core british value but for decade the home office have be undermine those value as my new report no way home show by treat migration as a crime rather than make it work for our community and for newcomer will the deputy prime minister read the report and consider its recommendation to remove migration from the responsibility of the fail home office 
 i will commit to read the hon lady ’s report because it be important that we take all information on these issue we inherit an asylum system under exceptional strain which cost up to £ a day we will end the use of hotel through suitable self sufficient accommodation for asylum seeker minimise the impact on local community and we will protect and support asylum seeker while demonstrate value for taxpayer 
 on   july warwickshire county council will permanently remove of nuneaton ’s fire engine its decision base on dubious datum that do not account for local factor such as high deprivation do not accurately represent the current risk to resident the cut will put life in nuneaton in danger will the deputy prime minister please look into this matter to confirm that there have be sufficient scrutiny and a thorough risk analysis to ensure safety for the good resident of nuneaton 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue and i know that the fire minister the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government my hon friend   the member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris will be happy to discuss it far i be committed to ensure that fire and rescue service across the country have the resource they need to keep community safe the deployment of fire engine though be decide locally so this really be a question for warwickshire county council which be now lead by reform   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   should have a word with his county councillor in nuneaton and get they to explain why reform be cut fire service 
 i remember when the deputy prime minister be a fierce critic of austerity and a proud champion for the disabled but today her government be introduce their £ disability cut bill that will push another people into poverty do she agree that everyone have the right to oppose such devastating cut be it the prime minister ’s intention to remove the whip from any labour mp who do the right thing and vote against these disability cut 
 the hon member talk about austerity but i gently say to he that we have give the big amount of increase to scotland—[interruption i have cover this point in an early question we be absolutely committed to end child poverty we have already introduce free school meal we be already support family and we have give a living wage rise to million of worker that need it we be get on with the job of rebuild britain the hon member have have decade of failure in scotland and it deserve well 
 derbyshire ’s derwent valley be the home of the industrial revolution and it be also now a unesco world heritage site that community show a victorian sense of purpose that deliver improvement to people ’s everyday life can my right hon friend set out how the government ’s £ investment in housing will instil that same drive while maintain the unique character of the east midland only unesco world heritage site 
 i know my hon friend be a champion for regeneration across his constituency and he be work hard to get home build in his patch for his constituent our plan for change will deliver the big boost for investment in social and affordable housing in a generation and for the time in recent memory we will give provider in his constituency a    decade of certainty over the capital funding to build ambitious housing project that honour derbyshire ’s history 
 the home secretary say that we should judge her success in smash the gang by whether the number of channel crossing fall but under this government the number be up by more than by which date should we judge the home secretary and if she fail will she be fire 
 the conservative continually vote against the measure that we be take to smash the gang we be get on with the job work internationally to disrupt the abhorrent work of these smuggler and gang while the hon member harp on from the sideline he should apologise for their record in government which be abysmal 
 since become an mp i have receive thousand of piece of casework from constituent who be stick on social housing waiting list i recently have an email from a woman with severe mobility issue who be effectively trap in her front room while she wait and wait for suitable social housing even when a home become available she will be force to compete with other resident because there simply be not enough affordable option what will the recent new funding announce by the government mean for my constituent and other like she who have already wait too long for a decent home 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight that case it be not an isolated case we inherit a really dire situation and there be far too many people that do not have a safe and secure home that meet their need my right hon friend the chancellor have announce record funding of almost double the level provide by the previous government who end up hand back the cash for social and affordable home labour ’s plan for change be renew our country and investing in britain ’s future 
 i call the father of the house 
 the government quite rightly give full and unequivocal support to israel in its bid to end the scourge of iran ’s nuclear weapon programme forever will they also work with our ally to try and convince the israeli government that it be not in the long term security interest of israel to carry on with this policy of illegal settlement in the west bank which be simply lead to radicalisation and desperation throughout the region have not the overwhelming majority of palestinian people the right to yearn for peace and security in their own homeland as the jews yearn for their homeland for year 
 i thank the father of the house for his important question settler violence and expansion in the west bank be appalling and completely unacceptable alongside our ally we have sanction individual responsible for incite this extremist action but a state solution be the only way to bring the   peace that the israelis and the palestinians deserve that be only achievable if the hostage be release aid be surge into gaza and the ceasefire be restore we will do everything we can to make that happen 
 in scotland over child be stick in temporary accommodation include many in my constituency too many family face soar rent long waiting list and dwindle option it be just of so many policy failing we be all lose count and lose patience as public confidence in the snp ’s ability to govern collapse what advice do the deputy prime minister have for the snp government as they continue to preside over a chronic failure to invest in the social and affordable housing that scotland desperately need 
 my hon friend be right homelessness level be far too high which have a devastating impact on those affect under the snp child in scotland a record high shamefully have no fixed home to call their own our decision have give scotland a record settlement the large since devolution we see in hamilton how scot be feed up with the snp ’s excuse the snp have be in power for nearly decade and have nowhere leave to hide from its failure 
 diolch mr llefarydd welsh farmer be take hit after hit from tory trade deal to labour taxis now on top of that bluetongue restriction affect wales and england will hamper cross border trade over farm on the border and key livestock market rely on summer trading once in a year opportunity like the royal welsh show be crucial and the disruption will be devastating will the deputy prime minister commit to work with the welsh government on a scheme to compensate the loss 
 i gently say to the hon member that you do not deliver for wales by vote against an extra £ for public service like plaid do in the senedd we will ensure that we support wales and welsh farmer and will continue to do that as a uk government 
 in the spending review last week the government back peterborough with support for our new pool and a sport quarter in the city that commitment have the power to turn year of campaign into a reality but that be not all the government have also recently approve the business case for our new station and have give we new police do the deputy prime minister agree that this be just the start and that place like peterborough that be forget for too long by the conservatives be now at the top of this labour government ’s agenda 
 i thank my hon friend for his comment i be flank by the lady the chancellor and the home secretary who have ensure that those thing happen the chancellor have guarantee funding to accelerate project like peterborough ’s new sport quarter which will include a new olympic sized   swimming pool i can also confirm today that subject to the business case approval we will provide nearly £ of funding for a new city centre quarter and a refurbish eastern station building 
 a small family business in my constituency be recently burgle by a prolific offender serve an month suspend sentence the man be catch arrest charge and appear in court where he be give another month suspend sentence and be release the business be offer £ in compensation do the deputy prime minister think that that be justice serve or be this government now soft on crime and soft on the cause of crime 
 of all i be sorry to hear about that hard work businesspeople who spend a lot of their time build up a business should expect the full force of the law to protect their property and their interest also while i have the opportunity can i congratulate the hon member on run hamble valley ’s very pub competition this year i hope that i will get an invite he be absolutely right that we have to have increase police number and ensure that they be responsive to people ’s concern we be do that his government let people down 
 saturday mark year since people lose their life in the grenfell tower fire year without justice but finally there be the prospect of some systemic change follow the public inquiry i welcome the government ’s commitment to bar all the cite company from access public contract and their full support to the police investigation to deliver real accountability can the deputy prime minister also reassure our community that alongside the hillsborough law the government will consider some independent oversight so that victim from the post office to hillsborough to grenfell know that inquiry recommendation will actually lead to real change 
 the grenfell fire be a national tragedy and we must never forget the life that be lose it be a honour to pay my respect on the anniversary at the weekend we remain fully committed to introduce the hillsborough law include a legal duty of candour for public service and criminal sanction for those who refuse to comply i know my hon friend speak with passion and authority on the matter and have speak to the grenfell community i know that they really want to see this happen as quickly as possible we be explore reform to ensure that we can get to the truth more quickly and deliver the meaningful change that these victim deserve 
 bishop challoner school have be help to educate bromley pupil for nearly year but it will close its door in july due to labour ’s decision to impose vat on independent school give the deputy prime minister ’s well publicise view on independent school do she welcome this closure or would she like to apologise to the parent pupil and staff 
 as i have say for a long time taxpayer in this country should not be subsidise tax break for private school i welcome all school that give child a great education but i be also determined to ensure we have qualified teacher in every classroom for every child which be something the hon gentleman ’s government fail to do 
 as a train physics teacher and a former engineering lecturer may i ask the deputy prime minister what this government be do to help people improve their math skill after they have   leave school i come across an awful case the other day a year old man who believe he have count up £ of government spending when there be really only £ what can we do for people like the leader of reform uk   the hon member for clacton nigel farage who evidently can not add up hon member more 
 my hon friend highlight an important fact reform ’s sum simply do not add up he will be pleased to know that we be invest £ in skill bootcamp and i will be sure to send the detail to   the hon member for clacton nigel farage 
 with permission mr speaker i shall make a statement on hs2 
 as a london councillor over year ago i remember hear the then labour government ’s bold plan for high speed rail to link our major city address the capacity need of the future and in the word of then prime minister gordon brown to join 
 the high speed revolution sweep the world 
 it be a vision of a confident nation and a clear signal our great town and city in the midland and the north with potential that have be untapped at well and ignore at worst could be place of opportunity and aspiration again that be the promise of hs2 
 but after a decade and a half of tory timeline plan then delay route draw up then cancel budget calculate then blow and promise make then break we inherit a project that have lose the trust of the public that create an image of a britain woefully unable to deliver big infrastructure project and that have be ax from swathe of the country it be originally mean to serve phase could end up become of the most expensive railway line in the world with project cost soar by £ under previous conservative government and £ of taxpayer money be sink into phase work before it be cancel by the previous government 
 there be also clear evidence of poor management despite the oakervee review advise that government halt construction contract pende improvement in price and simple engineering they press ahead regardless it have be no less than a litany of failure and today i be draw a line in the sand call time on year of mismanagement flawed reporting and ineffective oversight it mean this government will get the job do between birmingham and london we will not reinstate cancel section we can not afford but we will do the hard but necessary work to rebuild public trust and we have not waste any time 
 since july we have appoint new leadership of hs2 ltd to turn this project around we have make clear to the new chief executive mark wild that the priority be build the rest of the railway safely at the low reasonable cost even if this take long we have start the year long task of fundamentally reset the project include commission infrastructure expert james stewart to lead a review into governance and oversight as part of that reset we have reduce financial delegation to hs2 ltd place a lid on spiral cost until the reset be complete and we regain confidence and we have support mark wild ’s review of the size and cost of hs2 as an organisation 
 but today we be go far i can confirm we have publish the landmark james stewart review and the department ’s response the review commission in october last year by my predecessor be a tough independent look at how the department for transport and government deliver major project the government not only welcome the review but have accept all the recommendation and my department be already deliver on these specifically across key area 
 on the lack of oversight and scrutiny quite simply there have be too many dark corner for failure to hide in the ministerial taskforce set up to provide oversight of hs2 have inconsistent attendance from key minister include the then transport secretary and the then chief secretary to the treasury the government have re establish the taskforce with full senior attendance per the review ’s recommendation a new performance programme and shareholder board will offer much need oversight and accountability 
 secondly the report highlight hs2 could cost the taxpayer million more than plan we will stop this spiral any far by deliver all the recommendation on cost control that start with hs2 fundamentally change its approach to estimate cost it include certainty over funding which the spending review have give it also mean hs2 work with supplier so that their contract incentivise save cost for taxpayer as far as i be concern supplier should make a well return the more taxpayer money they save 
 thirdly the review identify a deficit in capability and skill with a fundamental lack of trust between my department and hs2 ltd. i be clear that both capability and cultural issue within hs2 must be address the new chief executive be already strengthen the organisation include by fill critical gap in area such as commercial expertise and he will be back by mike brown announce today as the new chair this be a new era of leadership that the project desperately need with mike bring significant experience as a former transport for london commissioner mark and mike be part of the team with i that turn crossrail into the elizabeth line we have do it before and we will do it again 
 fourthly between and hs2 ltd provide initial design for euston station come in almost £ over budget when ask for a more affordable option it offer cost £ more than the attempt the word affordable be clearly not part of the hs2 lexicon the combined cost for those fail design which have now be write off be more than a quarter of a pound 
 what be more the previous government announce a euston ministerial taskforce unbelievably the taskforce never meet this government recognise euston ’s huge potential we have already commit funding to start the tunnelling from old oak common to euston and we will set out more detail in our year infrastructure strategy 
 we will use james stewart ’s finding to transform infrastructure delivery across government implement real change in how we deliver infrastructure be not just for the department for transport this government be commit to implement these recommendation and adopt a new approach to deliver infrastructure as will be set out in our upcoming year infrastructure strategy in that spirit the prime minister have also ask the cabinet secretary to consider the implication for the civil service and the wide public sector of the issue raise in the report include whether further action or investigation be warrant 
 we be waste no time in deliver on this review i will update parliament on our progress through my monthly report even if the information be uncomfortable because for a government who last week pledge billion in capital investment for new   major project and who believe in the power of transport infrastructure to improve life and deliver on our plan for change that level of failure can not stand we will learn the lesson of the past year and restore our reputation for deliver world class infrastructure project 
 i have speak about our inheritance and james stewart ’s review so let i finally turn to mark wild ’s initial assessment which lay bare the shocking mismanagement of the project under previous government i will place a copy of his interim finding in the library he state in no uncertain term that the overall project with respect to cost schedule and scope be unsustainable base on his advice i see no route by which train can be run by as plan he reveal that cost will continue to increase if not take in hand far outstrip the budget set by the previous government and he can not be certain that all cost pressure have yet be identify 
 it give i no pleasure to deliver news like this billion of pound of taxpayer money have be waste by constant scope change ineffective contract and bad management there be also allegation that part of the supply chain have be defraud taxpayer and i have be clear that those need to be investigate rapidly and rigorously if fraud be prove the consequence will be feel by all involve 
 i have to be honest this be an appalling mess but it be that we will sort out we need to set target that we can confidently deliver and that the public can trust and that will take time but rest assure that where there be inefficiency we will root they out and where further ministerial intervention be need i will make they without fear or favour hs2 will finally start deliver on our watch 
 year of mismanagement and neglect have turn hs2 into a shadow of that vision put forward year ago but this government be elect on a mandate to restore trust to our politic and that be why we will not shirk away from this challenge and why today we turn the page on infrastructure failure i can think of no well mission than deliver new economic opportunity new home commercial regeneration and an upskilled supply chain all of which hs2 can still unlock but no should underestimate the scale of the reset require passenger and taxpayer deserve new railway that the country can be proud of the work to get hs2 back on track be firmly under way under this government and i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for her statement and for update the house on the initial finding of the hs2 review i also thank she for advance notice and a copy of her statement 
 on the substance of the secretary of state ’s statement i believe there be a broad consensus in this house on the central point that mistake be make in the delivery of hs2 as she note cost more than double the project have be repeatedly delay and the pandemic completely change travel pattern it undercut the assumption that guide the original plan and cause construction cost to rise sharply across the world by up to in some case as a result of supply chain shortage as the world emerge from the crisis 
 it have long be apparent that hs2 be not go accord to plan in my year as a member of this house i sit on the public accounts committee then chair by   the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier in the summer of we publish a report on hs2 that raise serious concern in a number of area and contain recommendation for how to improve the project 
 in the previous government concede that hs2 be not go to plan and make fundamental change to it the result be the cancellation of the northern leg of hs2 and the creation of the network north plan under that plan £ be to be divert from the northern leg of hs2 to a multitude of transport project that would benefit more people in more place and more quickly than the then government believe the delivery of hs2 could however we also recognise that the path we take to reach that point be not perfect far from it i will not today pretend that the network north plan be not a product of mistake we make in the handling of hs2 because it clearly be as a country we must learn from those mistake and we must not repeat they 
 on that note and with your permission mr speaker i would like to express my gratitude to mark wild the chief executive officer of hs2 for his continue effort to support the delivery of the project recognise his leadership in rescue the crossrail project in london it be the noble lord harper then secretary of state for transport who appoint he to lead hs2 in may we be all encourage to see he play a lead role in oversee the correction and completion of the project because his experience will be invaluable in help to get it back on track i also welcome the appointment of mike brown as the new chairman of hs2 ltd. like the secretary of state i know he from my year in london politic when he be commissioner of transport for london he be a very capable man and i wish he well in his new role 
 the secretary of state have inform the house of her intention to accept recommendation of the independent review into hs2 i have not yet see a copy of that report which i believe be be release today although we will need to study those proposal carefully before confirm our support for they i can assure the secretary of state if they offer well value for taxpayer we will back they the secretary of state have also raise very serious concern that taxpayer may have be defraud by subcontractor i assure she that if that prove to be the case i will share her anger and will support whatever action be necessary to get to the bottom of those allegation i would request that she keep the house inform as the investigation by hs2 and his majesty ’s revenue and customs progress 
 before i close i would like to press the secretary of state on a number of matter in recent week the government have announce several project that either be fund by network north or align with its commitment however we have yet to see a clear government commitment to either fully support the network north plan or scale it back can the secretary of state now provide a definitive update on which element will proceed and which will be abandon it have be report that official be consider a plan back by the mayor of greater manchester to build an hs2 lite track between birmingham and crewe will she confirm whether those report be true 
 i will conclude by turn to the planning system more generally the whole house will recall that hs2 grapple with legal challenge high court proceeding and judicial review all of which add delay and cost what assessment have the secretary of state make of the extent to which legal challenge and judicial review delay the delivery of hs2 how can future infrastructure project be protect from excessive or politically motivated litigation and do the secretary of state believe that sufficient action have be take to prevent some of the more spurious concern about such thing as bat and newts obstruct future vital infrastructure project 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his response and indeed for the tone with which he make his comment i be pleased to hear he acknowledge that mistake have be make on hs2 by the previous government i think he describe the path as not have be perfect i would go so far as to say that it have be a shambolic mess he strike a sombre note in his remark and i would ask he to consider go far once he have have the opportunity to read the full james stewart report because an apology on the part of the conservative party for the mess in which it leave this infrastructure scheme be undoubtedly warrant i also thank he for his comment on the action that hs2 be take with regard to allege fraud within the supply chain i can assure he that i will provide appropriate update to the house on the progress of the hmrc investigation that be now under way 
 the hon gentleman ask i to set out our plan for investment in transport in the midland and the north the conservative party take the decision to cancel hs2 north of birmingham and make wild promise about what it would do with the money it claim it be save he be kid himself if he think that that money ever exist in last week ’s spending review this government set out £ to be invest in local transport scheme across the country whether in birmingham liverpool manchester leeds or newcastle the hon gentleman ’s approach be a fantasy he promise the moon on a stick and have absolutely no mean to deliver he ask i to set out the government ’s plan for far enhance rail connectivity in the midland and the north i can assure he that further announcement will be make both as part of the government ’s year national infrastructure strategy and beyond that in the week and month ahead 
 the hon gentleman also ask i to opine on the extent to which litigation have cause delay in the delivery of infrastructure project he will know that through this government ’s planning and infrastructure bill we be tackle this issue by limit the number of judicial review and legal challenge that can be bring unlike his party this government be serious about deliver infrastructure and about provide the stable leadership that this country need when it come to infrastructure 
 before come to the chamber today i look up the number of rail ministers in the department under his government it be in year it be no wonder that project such as hs2 be leave in such a state of disarray just as this government have return stability to the nation ’s economy so will we return common sense and stable leadership to the delivery of the nation ’s infrastructure 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 i also thank the secretary of state for the decisive action she have take to address the cause of hs2 ’s cost overrun we look forward to have mark wild and the rail minister at our committee very shortly 
 i actually want to celebrate something that hs2 ’s leadership should be proud of the work they have do on skill and workforce innovation they have provide good practice work that the construction industry and transport project can learn from and in fact be learn from however i urge the secretary of state to get her department to learn from country such as france and spain which have manage to deliver extensive high speed rail project to time and at a fraction of the cost of hs2 here in the uk 
 i thank the chair of the transport committee for her comment she be right to recognise the excellent work that hs2 have do on skill and the workforce we have over people work on this project at the moment and i think that hs2 have do good work on open up opportunity whether through apprenticeship for the next generation or through the supply chain i will heed my hon friend ’s advice about learn from the speed and ease with which other country deliver infrastructure projects.[official report   june vol c. 4wc correction 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the secretary of state for her statement and for advance sight of it what we have hear today be clearly a damn indictment of conservative mismanagement connect our large city with high speed rail be mean to help boost economic growth and spread opportunity the original idea a high speed rail network connect london to manchester and leeds be clearly the right but what we have end up with be year of delay and billion of pound of taxpayer money be pour down the drain with no end in sight the litany of error that the secretary of state have outline be truly shocking and show that the conservatives be comatose at the wheel a lack of oversight trust and planning have leave we with a high speed railway drastically reduce in scale and inflate in price the shocking allegation of fraud by a subcontractor be emblematic of the tories lack of oversight and interest in properly safeguard the public interest and public money as we see with the scandal of personal protective equipment procurement during covid we must now make sure that any money lose to fraud be claw back as soon as possible 
 may i ask the secretary of state thing can she guarantee that if any fraud have take place any money lose will be return to the government and her department as soon as possible and that the police will be provide with the necessary resource to investigate the matter fully secondly the secretary of state have say that the ministerial taskforce set up to provide oversight on hs2 have inconsistent attendance from the then transport secretary and chief secretary to the treasury do the secretary of state agree that those right hon member should apologise for those particularly damn lapse thirdly we share the secretary of state ’s confidence in mark wild and mike brown but   can she say when she expect to be able to give the house an accurate assessment of the scheme ’s full cost and of when hs2 will finally be up and run 
 the hon gentleman raise fair issue and i agree with his assessment that the previous government be not just asleep but comatose at the wheel he ask whether the alleged fraud in the supply chain will be fully investigate and whether money will be return to the taxpayer i can assure he that no stone will be leave unturned in get to the bottom of this matter he be also right to highlight the question of poor and inconsistent attendance by individual who hold my role the rail minister ’s role and treasury role it be imperative that politician who have oversight of these infrastructure scheme stay close to the detail of what be happen both through their own official and directly with the executive and non executive leadership of the project that be certainly what i intend to do i know the rail minister have a monthly meeting with the new chief executive we have already hold a meeting of the ministerial taskforce and there be another due soon i have have multiple to conversation with the leadership team at hs2 
 the hon gentleman ask when i will be in a position to provide a full update on cost and schedule mark wild have tell i that he will require until the end of this year to do that full piece of work i be not prepared to get ahead of that because that be how we have get into problem previously the hon gentleman can rest assure that as soon as i have more information in addition to the monthly report that i provide to parliament i will come back to this house 
 this be the late national scandal to arise in our attempt to bring in infrastructure scheme on budget and on time but the taxpayer be not the only victim of the failure of this project so far there be also the people of the north of england hs2 be originally a scheme intend to help the economy of the north west and yorkshire and those community on the way so there be a complete failure there what we will be leave with be an extension to the london underground system and that will not help people in leeds bradford manchester sheffield and elsewhere will the secretary of state consider safeguard the original route so that when we get our infrastructure plan in place we can build something that this country can be proud of 
 i gently say to my hon friend that the mayor of the west midlands might have something to say about his great city be see as the end of an extension to the london underground line it be completely right that our great city birmingham and london be connect with high quality rail service although this be a difficult day in expose the state of the project i have no doubt that in time it will be a railway we can be proud of 
 i also say to my hon friend that i be aware of forecast capacity constraint between birmingham and manchester and in other part of the country we be invest through thing such as the trans pennine route upgrade in improve connectivity to other great city in the north of england we be determined to   ensure that everyone no matter where they live in the country have an excellent public transport system that they can rely upon 
 my constituency have be devastate by roughly mile of hs2 and i have consistently warn this house during the previous parliament and this through the lens of the miserable experience on the ground in buckinghamshire about the reason for the cost overrun poor governance and everything else that the secretary of state have highlight in her statement today if she must persist with this wrong project with a new delay will she give a commitment to my constituent and the rest of the county of buckinghamshire on how much long they will have to live in misery as part of a building site more importantly will she look urgently at unlock some of the mitigation fund that we be find incredibly hard to access and get spend on the ground that would be of some small tiny comfort to my constituent who be live in misery 
 it be essential that we proceed as quickly as possible with the remain civil engineering work that will have affect the hon member ’s constituent to date if he wish to write to i with detail of the problem he have experience with access mitigation fund i will raise that for he with the chief executive of hs2 
 the conservatives announce that they be scrap the northern leg of hs2 in a former railway station sum up their attitude to the railway and send shockwave through the industry include in derby a rail city that will be build the hs2 train will the transport secretary ensure certainty and timeliness go forward so that the industry can have confidence that we will not see further delay which have already be so damaging for the supply chain 
 my hon friend be right that certainty be critical for the rail supply chain it will be a number of month before i be in a position to confirm with any certainty the schedule and estimate final cost as soon as the new chief executive mark wild have provide that information to i and my department i will be update the house 
 the secretary of state know that hs2 run through my constituency and she will accept that what make my constituent particularly angry about what she have describe be that hs2 have pinch every penny in compensate someone unfortunate enough to find themselves in the path of this railway yet waste million elsewhere can she assure we that as part of the reset line drawing or page turning however she describe it she will look at how people be compensate when affect by such major infrastructure project do she accept that it would be sensible to consider how parliament could look again at this project whose budget and timescale have balloon and decide whether we still think it be a worthwhile use of taxpayer money 
 the right hon and learn gentleman be right to point out that we have some form as a country in seek to gold plate infrastructure project the last government talk about this railway be   the fast and the good in the world frankly i would like this country to do thing well and properly the point he raise about compensation be that any government should keep under review while bear in mind the need to provide value for money to the taxpayer i can assure he that i will make sure on any infrastructure project i oversee in this role that the house be appropriately update and that we proceed with transparency on the cost and benefit of the scheme 
 i thank the secretary of state for her statement and the candidness with which she have deliver it the village i represent in north buckinghamshire be they turweston westbury quainton or north marston i know   the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith   will be familiar with those community have for too long face chaos and disruption from hs2 and its contractor news that there will be yet more delay will cause they significant distress will the secretary of state update the house and explain what additional practical support financial or otherwise her department plan to give rural community such as mine over the year ahead 
 i think the big reassurance that i could give my hon friend be my cast iron commitment to ensure that we proceed as rapidly as possible with the completion of the remain construction work which i know will have have an impact on his constituent while i can not commit myself to the provision of further compensation from the dispatch box today if they be experience particular problem he should not hesitate to bring they to my attention and that of my department 
 i welcome the statement and i do not disagree with a word of the secretary of state ’s analysis of what have go wrong in the past
