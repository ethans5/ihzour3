 my hon friend will be aware that foreign donation be not permit in our electoral system and that be absolutely as it should be our democracy do face daily threat from rogue state rogue actor and other who try to disrupt it and to spread myth and disinformation and these be issue that we should be very alive to 
 a merry christmas to you madam deputy speaker and to everyone across parliament and in my constituency 
 thornbury and yate resident drive home for christmas will face a festive season of chaos on local road with at least more still to come thank to the ongoing closure of the a432 m4 over bridge there be no conversation with the small business affect or with resident live on the now choke local country lane give that hundred if not thousand of such post tensioned bridge be build in the 1960 70 and 80 this horror could be come to many constituency but i have so far be unable to secure a debate on this important topic will the leader of the house ensure that we can discuss the issue in the new year 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what reform he have make to fund for flood protection 
 what reform he have make to fund for flood protection 
 mr speaker merry christmas to you and all your staff i put on the record my sympathy with everyone affect by water outage in southampton i discuss the matter with the chief executive officer yesterday 
 we will have a public consultation in the new year on the formula that allocate flood defence funding to ensure that the challenge face business in rural and coastal community be adequately take into account protect community from flooding be a top priority and later today i will have a winter flood preparedness meeting i thank everyone who will be on duty over the christmas period 
 my constituency of stoke on trent south have many farmer some of whom be personal friend on their behalf i ask the minister to update the house on the fund that the government be make available via the farming recovery fund to support farmer impact by last year ’s severe weather 
 the government recognise the awful impact that flooding have have on the farming community we be release £ via the farming recovery fund to support farmer impact by last year ’s severe weather—£10 more than be plan by the previous government and £ have be pay out to over farm business 
 while the far right and shamefully even some mps in this house be busy deny climate change and try to turn it into the late culture war people in our community be pay the price more and more severe flood be devastating people ’s life as   we have see again in recent week and i be afraid it will only get bad do the minister agree that it be an absolute disgrace that the last government leave our flood defence in the bad state on record and that fix that have to be a national priority and a key part of prepare for climate change 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the previous government leave flood defence in a state of disrepair the bad state on record leave home expose that be why this government will invest £ into defence over the next year 
 in fylde a number of new housing development over the year have be construct in flood area where the developer know that the construction site have flood yet they still sell property without disclose that to buyer and in some circumstance they have not construct the flood defence requirement the mitigation on site to spec both resident and council have feel powerless to get developer to correct what they should have get right in the place and a number of property have flood several time since people purchase they what plan do the minister have to give resident and council more power to hold developer to account when they do not properly construct development or disclose information about flooding 
 i share the hon gentleman ’s upset about the rule on housing and flooding not be implement by the previous government we need more sustainable urban drainage in more development and it be important that it be build into planning application to begin with if he would like to contact i i can look into the matter in more detail for he 
 across huntingdon flooding continue to be an issue that impact a huge number of constituent with flood almost inevitable every time it rain alconbury flood group be a lead flood group in the constituency and charles dalleywater have be a drive force in implement flood mitigation measure such as the recently open alderman ’s retention pond at sallows farm that be plan by the flood group after funding be provide by anglian water huntingdonshire district council and cambridgeshire county council what funding be available from the government to facilitate the construction of further retention pond 
 i thank all flood action group around the country for do incredible work for their community that sound like a brilliant example as i mention we be invest £ over the next couple of year i hope to be able to give more detail in the new year 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of extend the rural england prosperity fund 
 mr speaker i wish you and all your staff a happy christmas and thank all those who work   in our food system for ensure that we be feed every day and that particularly at this time of the year so many of our constituent can enjoy a traditional wonderful british celebration 
 the autumn budget on   october   confirm the department for environment food and rural affairs budget for and and funding allocation for individual programme will be determine in the upcoming month through the department ’s business planning exercise we will update the house on the rural england prosperity fund in due course 
 i thank the minister for that answer farmer in my constituency of south west devon have highlight the role that the rural england prosperity fund could play in the economic growth of our community give the publication of the english devolution white paper this week what conversation have the minister have with the ministry of housing communities and local government about how funding such as the rural england prosperity fund can ensure that devolution be a success for the countryside 
 we be in constant dialogue with our mhclg colleague i be delighted that area with a significant rural population will on average receive about a increase in their core spending power that be a real term increase i hope we can continue to work well to address the rural productivity gap of some which be a real challenge for all of we 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the autumn budget on family farm 
 may i take this opportunity to wish a very merry christmas to you mr speaker and to the hard work house staff 
 the government have commit £ to the agricultural budget over the next year that be the big budget for sustainable food production and nature recovery in our history we be also invest £ into the farming recovery fund to support farmer affect by unprecedented extreme wet weather last winter we understand concern about change to agricultural property relief but the majority of those who inherit farmland after a death and claim relief will not be affect by the change 
 have the right hon gentleman see the late research which show that of commercial farm will exceed the £ threshold and therefore will become liable for inheritance tax just to give he example a family in west hanningfield in my constituency who have farm for generation say that they face a potential inheritance tax bill of £ they say that it will put an end to all that have go before and end the aspiration of their family i plead with the government to look at this again 
 of course we hear the concern but i say to the right hon gentleman that in the last year for which we have actual claim datum available over of claimant would not be affect of course most farm   like every other business can do succession planning in the usual way so they do not have to pay any more than they need to 
 merry christmas mr speaker our hard work farmer across calder valley want to earn a living from farming not use their land to avoid tax after year of neglect by the last government which undercut farmer in trade deal the sector be however become increasingly unprofitable i welcome the labour government ’s new deal for farmer and the year road map to make farming profitable again can the secretary of state assure i that calder valley farmer will get their fair share in this new deal and in the new improve countryside stewardship high tier scheme next year 
 my hon friend will be aware that the shadow secretary of state   the right hon member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins and the former prime minister   the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak keep tell farmer that they be not in it for the money we know that they be they be business that need to make a profit and our new deal for farmer which include increase supply chain fairness be intend to make farm profitable and successful for the future in the way they be not under the previous government 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the autumn budget put family farm in jeopardy those farm also need biosecurity to protect their future with avian influenza spread bluetongue still with we and african swine fever at our doorstep in europe biosecurity be national security central to that be the animal and plant health agency whose headquarters in weybridge need a £ redevelopment to protect farming and animal plant and public health the conservative government rightly start that work with £ commit in i note that labour have commit £ to support that transformation but that will not touch the side will the secretary of state confirm that the government will complete the project in full as the minister for food security and rural affairs call for in opposition and commit the remain £ to protect our nation ’s biosecurity and prevent an animal disease outbreak catastrophe 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman who raise an important point however i find it a little ironic that conservative members be call for this government to commit to spending that their government never commit to the weybridge biosecurity facility be so dilapidated that it face obsolescence by the early 2030s that be the legacy that the conservatives leave the £ that we have commit will start the process of improve those facility and through the spending review phase come forward we will consider how we can commit further funding to ensure biosecurity for farmer which the conservative absolutely fail to do 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 merry christmas to you mr speaker and to all here and beyond 
 farmer in my community and across the country be genuinely devastate by the government ’s family farm tax which will affect many in my patch who be on less than the minimum wage and by the cut in the basic payment next year perhaps what dismays farmer across our country and in westmorland even more be that the overall agricultural policy of this government and their conservative predecessor be to actively disincentivise farmer from produce food despite the fact that this country produce only of the food we need that be a dereliction of duty by both main party and a threat to national security what plan do the secretary of state have to change his policy and back our farmer to produce food 
 the hon gentleman raise a number of important point i will repeat my early comment about agricultural property relief the last year for which we have datum available show that the vast majority of claimant will not pay anything unlike the previous government who think that farmer be not in it for the money we want they to succeed so we be embark on a farming road map and a new deal for farming that will consider supply chain fairness and stop farmer be undercut in trade deal such as the the conservatives agree with australia and new zealand our intention be to make farming profitable for the future the conservatives record be the farming business that go bust 
 whether he have make an assessment of the potential merit of put the drinking water inspectorate ’s guidance on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance on a statutory footing 
 i thank the hon lady for raise this important issue the drinking water inspectorate require water company to monitor assess and report on the risk from pfas we be aware of concern relate to that and official be work on it 
 happy christmas mr speaker 
 i thank the minister for her answer and for offer i a meeting on this topic early this week i look forward to pursue it with she give the wealth of authoritative evidence on the harmful impact on human health of pfas in our drinking water and that scotland the european union and the united states have all put pfas guidance on a statutory footing why do this government appear to have no plan to do the same for england and wales will the minister consider amend the water special measures bill to that end 
 as i have mention this be an important issue and i look forward to discuss it in more detail work to assess the risk of pfas and to inform policy and regulatory approach include ban or highly restrict certain chemical and addressing issue cause by their historical use be continue the nature of pfas chemical and their persistence once in the environment mean that there be no quick fix but this be a global challenge innovation in suitable pfas alternative be   need and we be work to harness industry leadership in the transition away from pfas i assure the hon lady that work on this issue be ongoing 
 what his plan timetable be for the introduction of legislation to ban import of hunt trophy 
 may i wish you mr speaker all the staff of the house and all those in our public service who will be work over the weekend a very merry christmas and a safe and successful new year 
 the uk have a long history of champion the global conservation of endangered specie we be in the process of extend the ivory act to include further specie hippopotamus killer whale narwhal and sperm whale in addition to elephant the government have also commit to ban the import of hunt trophy we be consider the most effective way to do so 
 it have be year since the senseless killing of cecil the lion it be still legal to import hunt trophy into this country there have for a long time be cross party support for ban trophy hunting in the labour party ask the then conservative government what be stop you bring in legislation stop the dither and delay why be this government still dither and delay 
 with the great of respect the hon lady ’s party be in government for year and the conservative party be in government for year it be always good after month in office to be criticise for previous failure 
 i agree with the hon lady that the conservatives can not be trust on animal welfare they fail to pass the hunt trophies import prohibition bill which would have stop selfish hunter who slaughter and display endangered animal body part for their own perverse self gratification and they drop the animal welfare kept animals bill which would have end puppy smuggling puppy farming and pet theft as i say we be look for a suitable legislative vehicle and we will do it in government time 
 merry christmas mr speaker this time of year bring festive cheer but it also bring the boxing day hunt alongside many of my constituent i be keen to see an end to the smoke- screen that be trail hunting follow the last labour government ’s historic foxhunt ban will the minister confirm this labour government ’s commitment to ban trail hunting once and for all 
 we have indeed commit to a ban on trail hunting which will provide significant protection to wild animal include fox and hare work to determine the good approach for do so be ongoing and further announcement will be make in due course 
 what progress he have make on reduce pollution in waterway 
 the public be sick and tired of the scandal of sewage pollute our river lake and sea that be why we be take immediate action to place water company under special measure through a new bill that will give the regulator the power to ban the payment of undeserved bonus for pollute water company and bring criminal charge against persistent lawbreaker we be also carry out the big review of the water sector since privatisation to shape further legislation that will transform how our water system work and clean up our river lake and sea for good 
 last year there be hour of sewage dump into the river and stream of altrincham and sale west leave sinderland brook the bollin and other waterway in a terrible condition will the secretary of state outline far how the government ’s water special measures bill will ensure the end of sewage dump into the river and stream of my constituency for good 
 i congratulate my hon friend on be such a champion for clean river in his constituency as i say the bill will ban the payment of undeserved bonus to water executive who be responsible for this kind of pollution and will ensure instead that money be spend where it should always have be spend on fix the infrastructure so that we can stop once and for all the kind of sewage scandal that be create the river pollution his constituent be so aghast to see on their doorstep 
 merry christmas to you and your staff mr speaker 
 i declare an interest as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on water pollution while i welcome the limited measure that the government be take to tackle pollution from the water industry there be an elephant in the room because agricultural pollution be just as important a source of pollution in our river lake and sea what will the secretary of state do to tackle the problem of agricultural pollution with the same degree of urgency and focus and how will he support farmer who themselves stand ready to take action to tackle this problem by provide the funding support and clear regulatory enforcement that be need for a level playing field 
 i thank the hon lady for raise such an important issue and i recognise that over of pollution in our waterway come from agricultural run off sir jon cunliffe and the commission he be lead will look at all source of pollution into our water the budget for more sustainable form of agriculture that we have commit to will seek to reduce the use of fertiliser so that there be less run off into our water the farming road map that we be work on with the farming community be also intend to reduce the amount of run off from agriculture into our waterway and we be   look at move to a whole catchment base model we be look at all source of pollution into water so that we can clean up all of our river lake and sea from whatever source the pollution come 
 i call the shadow minister 
 thank you mr speaker i take this opportunity to wish you and all in the house a very merry christmas 
 many customer be rightly concerned about thames water and the situation that company find itself in for the time of ask the secretary of state in this chamber will he confirm that he will not issue any regulatory easement to thames water in his discussion with that company so that its environmental obligation and service commitment to its customer will not be reduce 
 the government continue to monitor very closely what be happen in thames water and indeed in all the other water company the only easement i have ever see give to water company over pollution be that of the previous government who turn a blind eye as sewage be flood through our river lake and sea this government be put the water company under tough regulatory special measure measure that the previous government could have enact but fail to enact 
 what progress he have make on reduce electronic waste 
 as my hon friend know each week vape such as single use pod and big puff be throw away or recycle incorrectly which be vape a that be why we have already ban single use vape and create extra vape recycling point in store we will ensure that online marketplace and vape producer pay their share of electronic recycling cost in order to avoid the fire which we know be so devastating 
 mr speaker i wish you and your team a very happy christmas 
 i thank the minister for her reply we be all keen to increase recycling but too often the opportunity for recycle electronic waste be very limited mean that it go into mainstream waste lead to increase pollution and hazard we be see an increase number of bin fire start with vape which as she have highlight be a particular problem will the government consider what opportunity there be to work with local authority to increase recycling opportunity and in particular to ensure that the public be aware of the downside of not dispose of electronic waste properly 
 i thank my hon friend for that question my own city council in coventry have introduce small electrical item take back point in its library which be an example of an excellent council innovating i recently visit the currys recycling plant in newark which show the importance of recycle electrical to ensure   that the gift of christmas past can be conserve and use for many christmas to come more importantly last minute christmas shopper will get £ off a new product i hear that air fryer be very popular 
 mr speaker i wish you and all a merry christmas 
 we know that electronic and similar good in landfill can leach into our waterway and affect water quality will ministers reintroduce water restoration funding as part of the package of measure they be talk about early so that the river tone and bathing station elsewhere across the country can benefit from clean water 
 our policy be certainly intend to tackle fly tipping and stop persistent organic pollutant enter the environment but i will have to consult the minister for water my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy before answer on that detailed point 
 what step his department be take to improve the dredging of river 
 dredging can be a useful option for manage flood risk usually as part of a wide approach where it be technically effective cost- effective and do not significantly increase flood risk for other of course we need to adopt the good solution for each place 
 i wish a merry christmas to and all 
 my constituent in boston and skegness be very concerned that the environment agency be unable to properly maintain riverbank and properly dredge river in order to protect home and livelihood because of the very demanding requirement of natural england regard the protection of badger and water vole which mean that the priority be wrong will the minister meet i and senior people at the environment agency to ensure that we get these priority correct 
 dredging use to be commonplace but some evidence show that it can speed up flow and potentially increase the risk of flood downstream there be currently no plan for any further dredging in boston and skegness but i be happy to meet the hon gentleman and the ea area manager to discuss this far 
 what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the potential merit of safeguard high grade agricultural land 
 we all know that food security be national security and most of we also recognise that the impact of climate change and nature loss pose a significant risk to domestic production so it be very important that   we use our land carefully consequently the government will be introduce a land use framework to ensure that we protect our most productive agricultural land 
 high grade agricultural land in mid bedfordshire have be farm for generation and it be critical for our food security and our freedom but it be under extreme pressure we have talk this morning about climate change and flooding and also about the government ’s family farm tax what have not be mention so much be urban sprawl which be a major threat to high grade agricultural land we live in an uncertain world and we need our country to feed itself consider the threat will the minister guarantee that high grade agricultural land will be protect by this government 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point and refer he to my early comment we see more and more pressure and there be so many thing we need to do on our land to house and feed people so it be important that we have a proper structure in place it be widely acknowledge that the current planning system do not necessarily do that the previous government promise a land use framework we will actually deliver it 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 i share customer anger about the water bill rise announce by ofwat this morning customer have be leave to pay the price of conservative failure after the previous government let company spend million of pound on bonus and shareholder payout instead of invest in our crumble sewerage infrastructure if you find crack in your house and do nothing about it for over a decade the problem get bad and the cost of fix it escalate and that be exactly what have happen to our sewerage system we have introduce the water special measures bill to curb unjustified bonus money earmark for investment will be ringfence so that it can be spend only on infrastructure rather than bonus and shareholder payout as happen under the conservatives i have appoint sir jon cunliffe to lead a commission into the regulation of the water industry so that the failure that lead to today ’s bill rise can never happen again this government will end the tory sewage scandal once and for all 
 recent investigation have show that a lack of investment in drainage infrastructure have contribute to significant flooding in uxbridge and south ruislip how will water company include thames water be hold to account where their lack of investment blight community through repeat flooding 
 the government of course recognise the importance of and need for a robust drainage system but my hon friend will be aware that the previous government fail to ensure adequate investment to maintain and upgrade it water company have a duty to ensure that the area they serve be effectively drain this include drainage of surface water from the land around building as well as the provision of sewer 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i wish a merry christmas to everyone in the house and also to everyone in our farming food hospitality and water sector but not everyone will be able to celebrate christmas in recent week a farmer take himself off to a remote part of his farm and kill himself the message he leave his family who wish to remain anonymous be that he do this because he fear become a financial burden to his family because of change to inheritance tax this be the human cost of the figure that the secretary of state provide so casually what do the secretary of state say to that grieve family 
 i extend my heartfelt sympathy to that family but i think it be irresponsible in the extreme to seek to weaponise a personal tragedy of that kind in this way where there be mental ill health there need to be support for that and this government be invest in it the right hon lady know from the last year for which data be available that the vast majority of claimant will pay absolutely nothing follow the change to agricultural property relief 
 how heartless and how extraordinary that the secretary of state be more discomfited by be present with the fact of the consequence of his policy than the reality of what this policy ensure i be a minister for and a half year and i have never see a policy have the consequence that this have interruption member of the public will see labour members react in that way because i have dare to present they with the fact we know that there be a tragically high suicide rate among the farming community the national farmers union give evidence about this and the secretary of state have be tell repeatedly will he collect datum on a monthly basis of suicide from farmer farming family landowner and family business so that we the house and the outside community can understand the human cost of this tax policy before it come into force 
 mental health service be the responsibility of the national health service and the former health secretary who break the nhs be in no position to lecture anybody about public service she be no friend of the health service and mental health service and she be no friend of farming some farm go bust on the conservatives watch they fail to get £ out the door and into the pocket and bank account of farmer and they sign a trade deal with australia that undercut british farmer on environmental and welfare standard i hear the posturing but it be this government who be stand up for farming 
 i recently meet farmer in the northern parish of my constituency and they tell i about the urgent need for improved water management to protect farmland they want to establish an internal drainage board for flood management but they can not take action to set it up until the necessary statutory instrument be in place give the importance of establish an idb in my area will the minister commit to work with i and stakeholder to reduce flood risk and will she outline when the statutory instrument for an idb in my area might be put before the house 
 i would be delighted to work with my hon friend on this important issue the association of drainage authorities be on the flood resilience taskforce and the statutory instrument will be lay as soon as parliamentary time allow 
 a farmer in my constituency tell i that even in a good year he be lucky to see much beyond £ in profit with margin as wafer thin as that regular farming barely qualify as investable at all the risk of lose a huge slice of that farm to inheritance tax at random interval would not only go to put this generation out of business but go a long way towards ensure that they can never be replace do the minister agree that this measure 
 order we need to get our act together this be the short set of topical question and i will not be able to get many member in we have to remember what topical be always about i hope you have get the gist of the question minister 
 the point that farmer need to get a well return from their business be well make and that be exactly what this government will be address 
 merry christmas to you mr speaker and to your team and to colleague across the house my constituent have long feel the impact of flooding and many resident have be isolate in rural area after a storm i have recently produce a flooding report will the minister meet i to discuss it so that i can support the work of the department 
 there be a very easy and short answer to that i would be delighted to meet my hon friend 
 north cornwall have world class beach and river but santa swim have be cancel due to the constant dumping of raw sewage meanwhile water company receive million from bill payer but then the very next day they give it away to their shareholder do the secretary of state agree that the good gift he could give my constituent this christmas would be a total ban on water bill rise until south west water boss finally end this scandal 
 the hon gentleman be right to point to the scandalous situation that the previous government leave our waterway in with record level of pollution and raw sewage filthye our river lake and sea i have appoint sir jon cunliffe to lead a commission to review governance and regulation so that we can stop it ever happen again 
 i welcome the landmark £ agriculture budget announce in the budget which be the big ever budget for sustainable farming my farmer in north northumberland desperately need that money in that context what more can the secretary of state do to push for his department to get that money out the door in a way that the previous government do not 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be extraordinary be it not that the last government manage not to spend £ of the farm budget we be determined to ensure that we do well i wish he and his farmer a very merry christmas 
 in my constituency we have an incinerator that regularly breach its air pollution limit but the environment agency do nothing about it will the government tell we what they be do to give the ea tooth 
 incineration permit breach be a matter for the regulator the environment agency but we be review energy from waste capacity across the country and will be make a statement imminently 
 merry christmas mr speaker and happy hanukkah to those who be observe 
 what action be this government take to promote the purchasing of british grow and seasonal produce through their public procurement framework 
 we be absolutely determined to ensure that we see more british produce buy across our public sector we will come to the house with our plan in due course 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 it would be helpful if the secretary of state encourage sir jon to engage with parliamentarian across the house the necessary change that he have outline will take time however the truth of the matter be that if those who currently have responsibility be to change their culture and focus on outcome for customer rather than their own internal process we might see early improvement 
 there will be an opportunity for member to engage with sir jon cunliffe ’s commission in january and i be sure that the right hon member ’s committee will want to do precisely that the water special measures bill which be go through parliament right now be intend to make quick change to the system sir jon ’s review will give we the chance to reform regulation and governance for the long term 
 i recently meet the alde and ore estuary trust which have long be campaign and fundraise to refurbish and secure flood defence on the alde and ore estuary will the minister meet i to discuss the trust ’s project and the barrier to progress 
 each time i come here for question i promise that i will not arrange to meet as many member and each time i fail i would of course be happy to meet my hon friend 
 last year i visit the game and wildlife conservation trust ’s allerton project in loddington may i commend the contribution that it can make to define sustainable intensification of agricultural food production perhaps it would be a suitable place for a defra ministerial away day early in the new year to help with the use strategy 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his suggestion i be a great admirer of the allerton project and have be mean to visit it for a long time my official be work on a visit and i be really look forward to engage with those people because they do great work 
 on a point of order mr speaker 
 presumably it be relate to the question 
 it be relate to the question we just have thank you for grant the point of order mr speaker at o’clock this morning entirely foreseeably ofwat announce bill rise of for water bill payer around the country which be an increase time large than current inflation we know that a large proportion of that rise will be spend on pay off the debt of water company a debt incur simply by pay dividend that be unearned and bonus that be undeserved be it in order for the government to have know that be come but not to have come to the house to make a statement which would have allow we to hold they to account for their failure to ensure that ofwat have the tooth it need to hold the water company to account 
 i thank the hon member for his point of order i have receive no notification from the government of such a statement but he have certainly put his point on the record and i be sure that it will have be hear by those on the treasury bench 
 the solicitor general be ask 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on prosecute knife offence

 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this important matter knife enable robbery surge under the previous government which be why the home secretary have make tackle these offence an urgent priority enforcement be key and that be why we be put police back on the beat with a name officer for every neighbourhood 
 i commend the government for act swiftly to ban ninja sword seize zombie style knife and crack down on the illegal online sale of these weapon it will reassure community such as mine in ilford south which sadly know all too well the deadly effect of these weapon with a number of heinous attack this year where teenager lose their life what be the government do to support the victim of knife crime and their family 
 my hon friend make a powerful point many of our constituent will have go through the same pain as his that be why we be take strong action on knife crime ban lethal weapon and work to ensure that dangerous blade do not end up in the wrong hand this september it become illegal to possess zombie style knife and machete and we be bring forward legislation to ban the ninja sword to which he refer

 the hon gentleman be absolutely right that knife crime be still too high more than instance in the year to june he be also right to highlight that this government be take strong action to combat knife crime we know that effective local policing be vital to tackle knife crime which be why we be put more police and police community support officer on our street because we be determined to make our street safe the home secretary have also commission a rapid review to understand how these weapon be sell online and deliver to under-18s and identify gap in legislation and the most effective way to stop this

 i thank the hon lady for that reply and i appreciate the additional resource but what my constituent and i be sure constituent up and down the country want to see be robust effective policing and prosecution of what be low level crime in the great scheme of thing but which can be a real curse particularly on our housing estate can the hon lady give an assurance to my constituent that there will be real robust and positive action 
 i can give that assurance the hon gentleman call this kind of crime low level i know from experience in my constituency that these issue can affect daily life and really blight community so yes he have my assurance 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i wish you and your team mr speaker and everyone in the house a very merry christmas and i welcome the solicitor general to her place however i be afraid that it will not be a merry christmas for all my constituent rural crime in north cornwall be on the rise from rural theft to increase drug trafficking county line drug gang be groom and recruit child as young as to traffic drug while elderly and vulnerable constituent have be cuckoo in their own home by the gang what step be the solicitor general take to work with the police to increase the number of prosecution of the ringleader of these ruthless gang that blight our community and expose our young people to violence and crime 
 the hon member be right to raise this important and press issue we know that those who commit such crime include crime in our rural community be some of the most manipulative criminal in society the crown prosecution service supply early investigative advice to law enforcement agency to build strong case and ensure the robust prosecution of those involve in county line i be determined that we will continue to do everything we can to prevent young people from be draw into crime and to stop this exploitation 
 what step the crown prosecution service be take to improve support for victim of crime 
 of my priority as solicitor general and the priority of the director for public prosecutions whom i meet early this week be tackle the intolerable backlog in our court and transform   the way in which we support victim of crime the prime minister have set out our plan for change which will restore confidence in our criminal justice system we have work with the cps to make recent change to its process in order to improve communication with victim strengthen the victim right to review scheme reduce the rate of victim attrition and reduce delay 
 you will know mr speaker that edmund burke say 
 justice be itself the great stand policy of civil society 
 but injustice reign when victim feel that the cause of their plight be be neglect such be the case in sutton bridge where a constituent of mine a year old girl suffer the dreadful event of indecent exposure the man be know in the community and be report by the father of the child and cctv footage be available when crime of that kind be not investigate properly people lose their faith in justice we must deal with those crime in the interest of the very justice that edmund burke recommend 
 i be very sorry to hear of the incident in the right hon member ’s constituency that be indeed appal it be vital for this type of conduct to be take seriously and policing be key to that we need more police officer and police community support officer which be why as part of our plan for change we have promise to put more police officer and pcso back on the beat with a name officer for every neighbourhood we also need to improve the experience of victim within our criminal justice system and that include well communication between victim and the cps 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 merry christmas mr speaker i welcome my hon friend to the front bench and congratulate the former solicitor general my hon and learn friend   the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman on her promotion to minister of state in the ministry of justice it be sometimes difficult to keep up with this government ’s pace 
 give that the crown court backlog stand at over and trial be be list for victim be await justice for an unacceptably long time with the consequence that many no long feel able to support the process how be the solicitor general work through the cps to ensure that victim face a wait of between and year for trial stay the course 
 i be grateful to the hon member for his kind word and i look forward to appear before his committee on   january he be right to say that we need to be do much more to support victim he allude to the review of the crown court he will also know that the lord chancellor be take step to reduce the crown court case load by increase funding for sit day and far sitting day be announce yesterday an extra i believe 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate in case of violence   against woman and girl 
 this government have pledge to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade as part of our plan for change and secure prosecution will be key to that our commitment to tackle violence against woman and girl in this way be unprecedented and it will require a wholesale change in how we think about and deal with these kind of offence only through a truly cross government effort can it be achieve as solicitor general i will work with colleague in the ministry of justice and the home office to ensure that we deliver on that commitment 
 may i welcome my hon friend to her place i know she will do a fantastic job crown prosecution service guidance recognise that perpetrator of economic abuse harm their victim survivor not just during a relationship but long after it have finish when will cps guidance be update to reflect post separation controlling and coercive behaviour be make a criminal offence and what training on recognise such abuse be offer to the cps 
 my hon friend be absolutely right he have be work on this issue with survivor of economic abuse and i know that he care about it very deeply domestic abuse can take many insidious form and we must do everything we can to ensure that we be equip to spot it and tackle it the guidance to which he refer be update early this year and be under regular review i can also confirm that the cps will take part in a further knowledge share event on economic abuse which will be deliver for police and prosecutor as part of the domestic abuse joint justice plan 
 my family know what domestic abuse look like but the law do not that be because there be no specific offence of domestic abuse in the law which mean that many abuser be convict of thing like common assault or actual bodily harm for victim and survivor that do not reflect the full gravity of the offence and it also mean that abuser qualify for early release scheme woman ’s aid be back my bill which would create a dedicated set of domestic abuse aggravate offence in the law will the solicitor general meet i to discuss my bill so that we can well respect and protect survivor 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point we be strengthen the law and the criminal justice system to improve prosecution for violence against woman and girl and to well support victim 
 i call the shadow minister welcome 
 thank you very much mr speaker i wish you and the team a very happy christmas indeed i congratulate the solicitor general on her position and welcome she to her place i hope to work constructively and effectively with she on this challenging and very important part of government 
 as the solicitor general know rape victim need action now urgently give that many rape case take more than year to come to trial there have be much talk from ministers about open specialist fast track rape court but disappointingly there have be very little detail to date how will the government achieve   that fast tracking if they do not use all potential court sitting day as request by the lady chief justice but refuse by the lord chancellor 
 i be grateful to the shadow solicitor general for her kind word she bring an awful lot of experience and expertise to her role and i look forward to work constructively with she she raise the issue of violence against woman and girl and refer to crown court sitting day i say early that i be very pleased that an additional crown court sitting day be add by the lord chancellor yesterday that be very important because it will allow the fast tracking that she refer to of the backlog in our court 
 i fully support the government ’s mission to halve violence against woman and girl within the next decade but how will the government ’s progress be measure to ensure that they deliver against their target what assessment have be make of the definition of violence against woman and girl 
 timeliness be clearly key and the hon lady be absolutely right to refer to our commitment to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade we will take urgent action build on the urgent action we have already take in november for example pilot of the new domestic abuse protection order begin with police force enable they to provide additional protection to victim 
 the hon lady will know that the police and the cps have launch their domestic abuse joint justice plan improvement in partnership work under the plan have already lead to a modest increase in referral of domestic abuse case from the police to the cps set a strong foundation for future improvement 
 what step she be take to increase prosecution rate of freight crime 
 freight crime pose significant challenge to the logistic and transport sector affect business community and our economy this government recognise the importance of address this issue and the crown prosecution service will always seek to prosecute serious offending when the relevant legal test be meet prosecutor can also apply for compensation to be pay to victim and in appropriate case can seek the seizure of asset that represent the proceed of crime 
 mr speaker i wish you and your team a very merry christmas and i thank you in particular for all your support over the last month i very much welcome my hon friend the solicitor general to her position and i know she will be a powerful voice for justice in the government 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group on freight and logistic i have be listen to business across the country include many in my north    warwickshire and bedworth constituency they have tell i that freight crime have reach unacceptable level and be damage their business and their driver welfare yet organise gang steal good from freight vehicle be class as the same as someone break into a car and steal a phone from the passenger seat what do the solicitor general plan to do to ensure that freight theft be prosecute as the serious crime it be 
 i know my hon friend have formidable knowledge and expertise in these matter which she raise very effectively on behalf of her constituent we be clear that freight crime be a serious threat and the government be work closely with the police the automotive industry and the national vehicle crime intelligence service to combat this threat the cps be of course alive to the prevalence of freight crime and bring together expertise to ensure that there be the resilience skill and flexibility that be need to well respond to new and changing area of organised crime like freight crime 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help increase prosecution rate in case of people smuggle 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question and i know how much work he do in this area prior to his election to this place criminal gang must not be allow to undermine our border security by illegally bring people into this country that be why this government be commit to smash the gang we have set up the new border security command which will bring together law enforcement across the system and boost the crown prosecution service ’s ability to deliver charge decision swiftly in international organise crime case 
 merry christmas to you mr speaker i congratulate my hon friend the solicitor general on take up her position 
 have work with the national crime agency in the past and have work in a counter terror role i have see at hand the effectiveness of counter terror power and the difference that they can make be the government work to maximise the effectiveness of the border security command by use counter terror style power or adapt such power in order to take on the smuggling gang and treat they like terrorist 
 my hon friend make a very important point quite simply the previous government lose control of our border that be why we need a much tough approach learn from the success of our world lead counter terror measure our border security asylum and immigration bill will create new strong power for law enforcement agency to tackle investigate and prosecute organised crime and strengthen uk border security 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make a statement on hospice funding 
 i be grateful to   the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson   for ask that important question this government want a society where every person receive high quality compassionate care from diagnosis through to the end of life we will shift care out of hospital into the community to ensure that patient and their family receive personalise care in the most appropriate setting palliative end of life care service include hospice will have a big role to play in that shift most hospice be charitable independent organisation that receive some statutory funding for provide nhs service the amount of funding that each charitable hospice receive vary both within and between integrate care board area 
 on child and young people ’s hospice funding the minister for care meet representative from nhs england and together for short life and of the chair of the all party parliamentary group for child who need palliative care to discuss child ’s palliative and end of life care and that funding stream be discuss at length at that meeting 
 this government recognise the range of cost pressure that the hospice sector have be face over a number of year so today i be delighted to announce the big investment in hospice and end of life care in a generation we be support the hospice sector with a £ boost for adult and child ’s hospice to ensure that those hospice have the good physical environment for care and with £ in revenue to support child and young people ’s hospice the funding will support hospice and deliver much need funding for improvement include refurbishment overhaul of it system and improve security for patient and visitor it will help hospice in this year and next year in provide the good end of life care for patient and their family in a supportive and dignified physical environment 
 hospices for child and young people will receive that furth £ in funding for through what be until recently know as the child ’s hospice grant we will set out the detail of the funding allocation and dissemination in the new year 
 we completely understand the pressure that people be under to govern be to choose and the chancellor choose to support health and social care in the budget the alternative be not to fund the sector have suffer from year of underfunding and we be right that historic wrong this government be commit to ensure that every person have access to high quality palliative and end of life care as part of our plan for change we be take immediate action to make our healthcare fit for the future i be sure that the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham and everyone in the house will welcome this announcement i thank she for give i the opportunity to give the house an early christmas present 
 order i think you might find that i grant the urgent question but do not worry minister i call the shadow minister 
 after the confusion of yesterday i welcome the fact that further detail on hospice funding have be announce albeit by our drag they out of the government on the very last day of parliament before the recess 
 on   october the chancellor decide to break her election promise by increase employer national insurance contribution and reduce the threshold at which employer contribution be payable it be later confirm that hospice would not be exempt from the increase in cost now the government have announce new funding for the sector which they have the audacity to call 
 the big investment in a generation 
 let we be clear about what be go on the government be take million of pound off hospice and palliative care charity and then think those hospice and palliative care charity should be grateful when the government give they some of that back that be socialism at its fine 
 we will look more closely at the funding announce today but despite many question from right hon and hon member to date the government have refuse to give any clear answer on how much their tax rise will cost hospice i will try again will the minister please tell we how much the government estimate they will raise from tax hospice more be an impact assessment ever produce on how hospice will be hit and how that will affect the care that they provide do the government expect the funding that they have announce today to cover the additional cost in their entirety 
 at the heart of this discussion be charity that provide compassionate care to terminally ill people in their final day week and month while hospice be leave without information hospice uk report that bed have already close with many more closure to come do the minister accept any responsibility for that ultimately it be patient who will pay the price 
 while we welcome this update for hospice when will the health secretary come forward with more detail on the many other health provider who have be hit by labour ’s tax increase include gps community pharmacy and dentist will they be expect to be similarly grateful for get back some of the money that the government have take from they 
 to govern be indeed to choose the conservative party choose neither this sector nor any other health sector and it refuse to govern within month we have not only increase the funding to the health sector to stabilise it but make today ’s announcement 
 beneath all that there might have be a welcome for the announcement i be not entirely sure whereas the sector be pleased to have the money the chief executive of hospice uk say 
 this funding will allow hospice to continue to reach hundred of thousand of people every year with high quality compassionate care we look forward to work with the government to make sure everyone approach the end of life get the care and support they need 
 the chief executive of haven house child ’s hospice say that it be 
 very positive to hear about the government ’s plan to invest significantly in the wide hospice sector we hope that there will be as much flexibility as possible to determine locally how this new money be spend 
 this be an important issue for many hon member and we look forward to work with the sector in the new year on the specific of the announcement 
 this be a very welcome announcement and i be sure the hospice be breathe a sigh of relief after the level of funding they endure for year under the tories if we be to move palliative care out of hospital and into care situation or people ’s home the money need to be passporte to the hospice sector for it to play its part integrated care board have be charge under the health and care act to provide that funding will the money go through icb or will it be passporte straight to the hospice sector 
 my hon friend make an important point about the need for more people to be treat at home that be absolutely the direction of travel that we want to see this money will help for example with technology to support more people to be treat at home icb be responsible for commission and allocate funding so that will be do in the normal way 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i wish you and the whole team a very merry christmas mr speaker 
 last week i visit hope house in my constituency where i meet beautiful young esmay of hundred of child care for by the hospice every single year she be nearly and have a life threaten heart condition esmay ’s family do not know what the future hold for she but they know that hope house will be there to support they as it have since before she be bear 
 there be people like esmay treat in hospice every year and just of their funding come from the nhs that leave institution such as hope house and nearby severn hospice reliant on generosity and unable to plan as they wait for confirmation of the funding they will receive from the nhs that situation have be make more difficult this year because of the increase to national insurance contribution which hope house estimate will cost £ 
 funding be welcome and i welcome the minister ’s commitment today will she explain whether the increase that she have announce today will cover the nic hike for hospice and the increase in the living wage that be announce at the budget will she also commit to provide future settlement in a timely manner so that hospice manager can budget effectively for the come year 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and for welcome the announcement she will know that in the past year the sector have be neglect like the rest of the nhs and social care system as we have repeatedly say to govern be to choose we have improve the settlement for the sector this year today ’s welcome announcement can be use by the sector to manage some of those pressure and deliver the sort of service it want for the future 
 do the minister agree that the amazing staff at overgate hospice in my constituency should be focus this christmas on care for their patient and not on funding will she confirm that this funding allow they to do so also in april i will be run the london marathon for the overgate hospice ’s big build appeal will the minister sponsor i 
 that be possibly of the cheeky question i have ever hear ask here and i be obviously go to have to say yes frankly rather he than i but good luck to my hon friend on do that i know that many hon member raise money for their local constituency and that the marathon be an important part of that 
 we understand how different hospice be fund differently throughout the country we want to make sure that end of life care with all the different option that people have in their local system be well support it be really important for people to have some of that security and i know that this announcement will be welcome by my hon friend ’s local hospice as it be by the sector today 
 merry christmas mr speaker 
 the st helena hospice in colchester which serve my constituency and that of   the labour hon member for colchester pam cox estimate that the national insurance increase will cost it £ in a full year can the minister now give a guarantee that the hospice will be compensate by the government in full 
 it be good to hear the hon gentleman support his local hospice with his neighbour my hon friend   the member for colchester pam cox we will announce allocation for the whole sector and the nhs in the usual way in the new year 
 st giles hospice in my constituency have funding challenge like any other thing that staff mention to i be the sustainability of when they be contract to do thing be the department consider the timing and not just the funding to enable well planning and well staff planning 
 yes stability and understand long term planning be important for this sector as well as for many other certainly we want to make sure that we work with the sector and the wide nhs so that we deliver our long term year plan but get to that process in the next few year 
 merry christmas mr speaker 
 st luke ’s hospice in my constituency cover the whole of brent and harrow i help to form it back in the 1980s the staff tell i that the big problem they face be that every time there be an increase in nurse or doctor pay it be never pass on to they so they have to find the money from charitable giving the minister ’s announcement of extra money be of course welcome but she have fail to answer the question will it cover the national insurance increase or not 
 all hon member support their local hospice which i know be important but i have to remind the house of the parlous state of the sector that we inherit after year of the previous government if conservative member many of whom be part of that government have want to rectify the way in which hospice funding be allocate or indeed that end of life care be manage they have plenty of opportunity to do so this government have hit the ground run we have fast track these measure and this announcement today be clearly a part of that i hope that they all welcome it it be just a shame that they do not do it themselves 
 merry christmas mr speaker 
 may i welcome this record investment in our hospice from the labour government the conservative government have year to do that but they shirk that responsibility will the minister join i in thank the amazing staff and volunteer at saint michael ’s hospice and demelza hospice in my constituency who do such amazing work all year round to support family and child who need amazing care 
 i be delighted to support my hon friend in the work that she have be do with st michael ’s and demelza hospice she be absolutely right to highlight that and i hope that she will be able to meet the staff in the new year and discuss how they can well use some of this funding 
 i wish you mr speaker and all the house staff a very merry christmas 
 follow on from   the hon member for calder valley josh fenton glynn next year i will be take part in a strictly dance competition for my local rowcroft hospice however i be pretty sure that even if all the member in this house sponsor i i would not be able to raise the £ need by rowcroft to cover the additional national insurance contribution payment that it will have to make will this extra funding which be very welcome be additional funding or will it be just enough to cover the extra cost that have be impose on the hospice sector through the increase in national insurance contribution in the recent budget 
 i have to say that dancing be more my style than marathon run so i wish the hon lady luck with that at least she do not ask i for any money i refer she to my early answer this be additional money to support the hospice sector it be a £ boost for adult and child ’s hospice to ensure that they have the good physical environment for care and £ in revenue to support child and young people ’s hospice we look forward to work with the sector in order to well deploy that in the new year 
 merry christmas to you and your team mr speaker 
 our hospice do an amazing job and i look forward to visit my local hospice in the next few day but scottish hospice have warn that they might have to turn patient away because of the funding crisis that they face under the snp do the minister agree that the scottish government must at least match the level   of investment that she have announce today they must have a similar level of ambition for scottish hospice and provide fresh investment for our hospice which do an amazing job in scotland 
 as my hon friend highlight this be a devolved issue for the scottish government we hope that they match our ambition as she rightly put it i wish she well with her local hospice and i hope that the scottish government take note of what we be do here in england 
 over charity and voluntary group have write an open letter to the chancellor warning that the national insurance increase will cost they £ and have a devastating impact at this time of the year ahead of christmas many charity include hospice be try to raise fund i know that the chancellor do not go into politic to be the grinch who steal christmas for charity so will the minister please look at this again and exempt charity and voluntary group include hospice from this cruel tax increase which be suck up good will and donation and really hurt valuable charity 
 the hon gentleman be a government minister so he have plenty of opportunity to change the system have he want to do so at the time 
 i thank the minister for her announcement of a huge funding boost for the hospice sector will she join i in thank all the brilliant staff at keech hospice which serve luton south and south bedfordshire and especially all the volunteer who be out fundraise with smiley sam and santa ’s train across the street of luton include farley hill tomorrow and wardown crescent on saturday 
 i thank my hon friend for make that point and wish the volunteer well in their weekend activity she be right to highlight not only staff but the hundred of thousand of volunteer across the country who work to support the hospice sector and other with end of life care that support be so important for people receive end of life care and their family it be something that i have experience my father die over the christmas period a number of year ago it be a hard time of the year to have a death and i warmly support what those volunteer be do this weekend 
 the fact that the minister have come here expect we to welcome her announcement and congratulate she on give money that her government take away in the place really beggar belief mountbatten hospice in my constituency need an extra £ because of the nics increase that her government have bring forward will she guarantee to mountbatten and the charitable sector include hospice which the last government increase funding for before she come back to i with that answer that today ’s announcement will cover the £ that her government have take away in nic 
 what beggar belief be that person after person man after man on the opposition benches still feel able to get up and defend their record in   government not once have we hear that they agree with lord darzi ’s diagnosis or that they welcome the extra investment that the chancellor find by choose to support the health sector in the budget i be afraid that until they reach that conclusion they be destine to be on the opposition benches for a very long time 
 merry christmas to you and your team mr speaker 
 compton care hospice in my constituency provide specialist palliative and bereavement care hour a day day a year have previously discuss the lack of funding with the hospice i be sure that it will welcome the extra funding that have be announce today will the minister please join i in thank compton care hospice and its incredible staff for the care that they will continue to provide throughout the christmas period 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s comment and i be very pleased to thank compton care hospice for all its work he be right to highlight that the care be day a year around the clock 
 hospice such as st ann ’s in stockport provide really high quality care to my constituent and other at what be often the tough point in their life but they be struggle in a system that be no long fit for purpose it be of course welcome that the government be provide additional funding for they of the challenge that the hospice sector face be a really high rate of staff vacancy so i would be grateful if the minister would confirm whether the year plan for the nhs include a specific workforce plan for our hospice sector so that it continue to care for our constituent at the tough point in their life 
 the hon lady make an excellent point about the stability of the workforce across the piece from diagnosis to the end of life we absolutely need to consider support for all part of that through the year plan i encourage hon member and other to ensure that they keep make those point we be get excellent contribution from the public patient and staff and we look forward to develop the plan over the next few month and year 
 i welcome the large funding increase for hospice in a generation if that can not bring some christmas cheer to the conservative benches it will in my constituency of wirral west where claire house hospice do such important work all year round i be there just last week for their christmas carol will the minister take the opportunity to thank they for the important work they do in my constituency of wirral west 
 i thank my hon friend for his contribution and indeed for his singing those event bring joy to people at a particularly difficult point in their life and they be very welcome 
 any increase in funding for the hospice movement be of course welcome but let we be honest it be give with hand and take with the other the excellent   hospice that serve my constituency st andrew ’s in grimsby and lindsey lodge in scunthorpe tell i they want certainty the minister say they will be tell early in the new year can the minister give a categorical assurance that in the half of january hospice will be tell how much extra they be get from the £ she mention 
 i thank the hon gentleman for welcome the announcement as i say we will be work with the sector in the new year and then we will make allocation accordingly 
 stoke on trent be wonderfully serve by the dougie mac and donna louise hospice they be part of a healthcare system in staffordshire and stoke on trent that the minister know have a £ project deficit what oversight will there be to ensure that the money that go to the icb reach the hospice and that the team in staffordshire and stoke on trent do not try to use some of this welcome new money to fill hole elsewhere 
 my hon friend make an excellent point that be raise early it be vital that icb work with all provider to understand the need and how they be well meet i know he will be diligent as he already have be in pursue what be happen with the funding with his local icb we will work with hospice uk to ensure that that happen across the piece 
 the hon member for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward   call for a fresh approach by the snp government in holyrood but she clearly expect we to do that with fresh air because part of the £ additional cost from the national insurance contribution will fall on hospice on tuesday she have the opportunity to vote against that cost will the minister confirm that there will be barnett consequential for scotland how will she address the problem that marie curie in scotland face 
 i admire the hon gentleman for keep on the same wicket in the budget this government make the great allocation to the health sector what the scottish government do with their consequential and how they manage that be entirely a matter for they and if they be not do a good job the public need to vote for someone else 
 i wish you the team and all the wonderful staff on the parliamentary estate a merry christmas i very much welcome this big investment into local hospice and i know it will be welcome by my local child ’s hospice forget i not and kirkwood hospice which do invaluable work in my constituency what assessment have the minister carry out on long term sustainable funding for the sector particularly in relation to statutory funding and the increase role that hospice play in the community and in people ’s home 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight that need as i say early end of life care and its stability as part of the wide system which be a   commission role for icb be not address by the last government over year as part of our year plan that will be important to do 
 we can all agree that hospice such as st barnabas in lincolnshire do vital and value work i hope we can also all agree that every government labour and tory have increase national health spending for that be simply a matter of fact i ask the minister to show a little wisdom in contrition in acknowledge that the national insurance increase that be impose on charity and hospice have do immense damage we welcome the funding today of course we do but she need to be straightforward be she or any of the health team consult before the budget about the impact of the ni increase on hospice health charity pharmacy and so on may i advise she to put down the folder and tell we what she really think 
 i have scribble my own note the right hon gentleman say that he agree but the issue be that his government do nothing over year to support or make a change that be why the announcement we be make be so important i reiterate my early point which i will repeat every time i be at the dispatch box the conservatives have not read the darzi report if they do not agree with the diagnosis they can not agree with the solution that be their fundamental problem 
 i welcome the announcement of additional funding as will many family across the country although it be not in my constituency rowans hospice be use by people in pompey indeed my nan pearl and my very dear friend fiona spend their last few week in the hospice ’s care and what a wonderful place it be at a city council meeting this week concern be raise about the future of that amazing service will the minister confirm that the government be commit to ensure that every person have access to high quality end of life care 
 that be absolutely what we want to do and today ’s announcement be a step towards it as my hon friend highlight hospice be very special place but most people want to die at home with their love one in the place they know well and many part of the sector will be able to use this money to help more people to die peacefully at home 
 this additional funding will benefit hospice serve westmorland community st mary ’s st john ’s eden valley and the child ’s hospice jigsaw only if thing happen the government must provide additional funding to match the national insurance increase that those hospice will have to bear and secondly the government must ensure that the integrate care board in south cumbria and north cumbria pass on that money in full and on time will the minister press they to do so on the morecambe bay end will she press they on the closure of the abbey view ward at barrow hospital the trust be plan to close that end of life ward which will put additional pressure on our local hospice but without any additional funding to support they 
 the commissioning of those service be the responsibility of the icb and we expect they to do that they be responsible from diagnosis to end of life in the past few month i have meet many hon member from across political party to discuss issue in their icb i know that he will like other be assiduous in pursue the icb to ensure that funding go to the right place 
 i wish you mr speaker and the fantastic staff across the estate a happy christmas 
 i thank the minister for the way in which she and her team have listen to i and colleague who arrive in this place with real concern about the state of palliative care after year of under investment by the previous government the funding announce today will be welcome by keech hospice and garden house hospice which provide fantastic palliative care for constituent in and around my area will she join i in thank they for the fantastic work that their staff and volunteer do all year round to support people in incredibly difficult moment in their life will she also assure they that palliative care will remain at the front and centre of the government ’s mind in the difficult work of get health service work again 
 i be happy to support my hon friend who make an excellent point in his work with local provider he congratulate i but the work have be do mainly by the minister for care my hon friend   the member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock and by the secretary of state who have personally take on this issue they be visit hospice today so they could not be here even though they want to we be commit to support people throughout their life from diagnosis to end of life 
 i have be contact by vast number of family and relative of those who have be wonderfully care for by sue ryder manorlands hospice in oxenhope in the worth valley they be all concerned about the impact that the rise in employer national insurance will have on they those at manorlands be deeply concerned that it will cost they hundred of thousand of pound in answer the urgent question the minister have announce additional funding but can she confirm whether it will cover the cost of those rise to sue ryder manorlands hospice in my constituency do the government carry out an impact assessment of the negative impact that the budget would have on those in the charitable and hospice sector 
 the hon gentleman ask the same question again through the budget this government have allocate more money to the health service than the previous government a record announcement and we have announce money again this morning to govern be to choose the last government neither govern well nor choose to support the health sector from diagnosis to end of life this government have and will continue to do so 
 some week before the budget i visit both st catherine ’s hospice and st peter and st james hospice which serve my constituent i have not expect how quiet and empty those hospice be because of the empty bed and mothball wing   that have be close due to a lack of funding evidently the funding crisis in the hospice sector be very deep before the budget but the budget have only make it bad through the nic increase as such i will try again will the welcome funding announce today cover the cost of those nic increase 
 as lord darzi ’s report announce the entire sector have be under pressure and struggle since the disastrous lansley reform they be part of the coalition government through to when we take over in july we will fix the nhs and rebuild it to make it more sustainable and fit for the future that include everything from diagnosis to end of life care 
 for my sin i too will be run the london marathon next year i will be run to raise money for keech hospice i know as do other hon member who represent constituency in bedfordshire what fantastic work that hospice do and the care it provide to our county the minister have be ask lot of time to comment on the impact of the nic increase which be go to hurt hospice in constituency all around the country so may i ask the question in a slightly different way do the minister think that keech hospice take in the round will be financially well off or bad off next year as a result of both the budget and this announcement that she have be drag to the house to make 
 i have not be drag i be very happy to be here the reality be that the health sector in its entirety from diagnosis to end of life care will be well off this year than it be last year or the year before under the hon gentleman ’s government 
 i place on record my thank to all those in my constituency who will be care for other over christmas whether they be unpaid family carer or pay care provider that include the register nurse and register care provider who have write to i to say that there will be an extra cost of £ per employee as a result of the change in the budget i will not attempt to ask whether the money announce today will cover national insurance    contribution but i will ask what the government will do to help register care provider where will the money come from to enable they to meet their increase national insurance contribution 
 as the hon gentleman know this government have allocate an extra £ in this year for the health and care sector the full allocation to cover the entire area of health and social care will be announce in the new year 
 it would be churlish of anybody in this chamber not to welcome the money that the government be set aside i thank the minister and the government for that announcement but what discussion have the minister have with cabinet colleague to secure exemption from national insurance contribution hike for hospice worker i think of marie curie i speak about that charity yesterday in westminster hall and the minister probably have a marie curie in her constituency we know what that charity do unlike the mainstream nhs it will not be exempt yet it carry out the end of life care that the nhs simply can not provide far what help will be provide to carer in the community the withdrawal of their service would leave the care system decimate 
 the hon member make an excellent point about carer and their support we make announcement about that in the budget and we will make more general announcement about allocation in the new year 
 may i gently say that i know you welcome be here minister but it would have be easy if the announcement have come as a statement rather than through have to grant an urgent question when ministers be go out quite rightly to visit hospice we should be tell at the same time it would be nice and easy for we all to do it that way but i thank the minister for come
