maternity service in yeovil be due to shut on monday after a deeply flawed care quality commission inspection in january and be to be move to musgrove park hospital in taunton which do not have capacity for an extra birth a year although the closure be initially for month i have receive no guarantee that the service will open again which be create huge fear will the prime minister or the relevant minister agree to meet i and colleague from the south west to stop this decision 
 we have see the contempt in which the government hold the waspi women against state pension inequality campaign woman pensioner and the disabled and their contempt for scotland ’s energy sector job creator and the hospice sector but that be all a function of policy policy be discretional and therefore for well or bad usually bad legitimate adhere to the ministerial code be not a matter of discretion to be honest it be a little beneath the leader of the house to say we do not announce thing to parliament every time but we do some of the time and sometimes the house be not sit every example present to she today relate to a time when the house be sit when will she relay to the government and the prime minister that member be severely annoy by the government ’s repeat inaction for her information contrary to what be be say by the scottish craw sit on a wall behind she there be no such duty on scottish government ministers as that set out in section of the ministerial code 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to ensure that rural community be support in the transition from analogue to digital landline 
 of the thing that keep i awake at night be how we ensure that people be protect the most vulnerable and rural community in particular as we transition from the copper network to fibre that be why i be glad that in november last year i be able to get all the network operator to sign up to a new code of conduct that will i think provide precisely that protection 
 dominic ’s aortic aneurysm burst at his rural home year ago with no phone signal in their stone build house it be a minute landline call to emergency service that help his wife keep he alive while they wait for an ambulance as dominic wait for more open heart surgery can the minister reassure his family that we be do all we can to mitigate the risk to he and other vulnerable people during power cut 
 i certainly can i send my good wish to my hon friend ’s constituent he say that it be a stone build house he be absolutely right that there be particular difficulty with mobile signal in stone build house i live in myself in porth in the rhondda thing that we have do recently as a result of the pressure that i have put on people be to ensure that the battery back up power be not just the ofcom guarantee hour minimum but considerably long and that be what lot of the operator be now provide 
 what awareness be there in very rural area where there be not great broadband coverage and very poor indoor mobile phone coverage sometimes no coverage at all of the effect of this change particularly in place where there be frequent and sometimes extend power cut when can we expect a full national awareness campaign 
 i welcome the right hon gentleman ’s comment i be glad that he be express an interest in this issue he take part in a westminster hall debate on it only a few week ago when i be a bit grumpy with he for which i apologise he make some good point he may not be aware of the campaign which be already up and run so obviously the awareness campaign need to do a bit more work to make he aware of the awareness 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of rural broadband coverage 
 rural broadband coverage simply be not good enough 
 many rural village in my constituency still suffer from poor broadband access with no clear date for when it will get well and more demand for huge expenditure to get they connect to the network i think particularly of resident in banningham who have suffer from poor broadband access for year and feel they be at the bottom of the pile in finland the broadband roll out start with the hard to reach property and reach inward tackle the big challenge do the minister agree that a roll out strategy like that rather than that go for the easy property would have serve those community well and fast 
 the large chunk of broadband delivery will be do on a commercial basis by the private sector we do not want to do with taxpayer money what could probably be do by the commercial sector i do not catch the name of the village that the hon member refer to i be not sure whether he have be to of my building digital uk drop in session but if he need further information for that particular village i would be very happy to try to sort it 
 in my constituency resident of the rurally isolate community of balquhidder do not wait for a major provider they dig and lay km of fibre optic cable themselves use the government ’s broadband voucher scheme to partner with a small business and deliver gigabit broadband a remarkable achievement that success be now at risk however because for well over a year the government payment process have be struggle to engage with the volunteer lead project will the minister meet i to help resolve that and will he join i on a visit to the beautiful balquhidder glen to see at hand what that resourceful and determined community have deliver 
 everybody tell i that balquhidder be very beautiful in fact my hon friend tell i early this morning i would be interested in a visit if it be also possible to visit the new film studio that i think might be come to his constituency stirling be matter but strathallan and the very wide rural area in his constituency be different i would be very happy to try to sort out the specific issue that he have in balquhidder 
 what step his department be take to improve digital inclusion in bathgate and linlithgow constituency 
 what step his department be take to improve digital inclusion in north somerset constituency 
 it be important that we have the right datum on which place be miss out that be why as i have say before i be desperate to ensure that if people check ofcom ’s online announcement on coverage in their area it match their live experience i can announce that ofcom will be radically change its online coverage network system i have place a letter in the library today between myself and ofcom which lay out when we will do that in june 
 i welcome the investment in my constituency from project gigabit ’s £ deal to upgrade scotland ’s broadband the remote job market open up employment opportunity for those who live outside the major city however several constituent from more rural area around bridgend armadale bo’ness and bathgate have tell i that they have lose out on opportunity for flexible working and even lose job due to poor connectivity can the minister reassure my constituent that they will not lose out on future opportunity because of where they live 
 my hon friend be absolutely right in a digital world we can not have some people engage and who have the connectivity they need while other do not because that simply will not drive forward economic growth in this country she make a very fair point and yes i can give that guarantee 
 i thank the minister for his response during my recent visit to the nailsea backwell disabled access café i have the privilege of meet remarkable resident such as alison a recur theme emerge about access government service which often assume internet access and capability what additional measure be the department implement to ensure that everyone in north somerset particularly those with disability or limited digital skill can access vital government form and assistance in format that truly work for they 
 there be so many part of deliver our public service where we can improve productivity if we manage to do so on a digital basis i be conscious that for example a doncaster hospital still employ people just to carry around physical medical record that be clearly nonsense and we need to change it my hon friend be absolutely right if we go to a digital future we must be able to take everyone with we that must mean that non digital option should be available to those who be not able to take up digital option 
 my constituent john write to i to highlight the slow and weak internet connectivity in boyatt wood meanwhile constituent who live in the centre of eastleigh regularly struggle to   get online do the minister agree that all my constituent deserve access to fast and reliable broadband what assurance can he give they that that be a priority for the government 
 i would argue that her constituent have a right not only to good broadband if the hon lady want to come to of my building digital uk drop in session she would be very welcome we can go through street by street if necessary but to mobile connectivity i bet there be people in her constituency as there be in every constituency in the land who see on the ofcom checker that they have a perfect signal and know that they do not that be thing that i be change with the deal i have do with ofcom 
 there be some really good example of the delivery of innovative product that provide access in remote and rural area and some good small scale provider but in the cairngorms national park area a provider recently unexpectedly cease the service consumer have be leave out on a limb so be it time to put in place as with the energy system consumer protection should a provider fail to provide a service 
 i have long think that digital connectivity be now akin to a connection to electricity water or any other public utility that be how we should treat the law and i think that would assist the hon gentleman ’s constituent 
 what step his department be take to support innovation in hertfordshire 
 the government be commit to support innovation in hertfordshire and across the country and we be invest a record £ in research and development this financial year alone in the last financial year uk research and innovation invest £ in project in hertfordshire for example more than £ be award to copco ltd which be base in hemel hempstead to develop a digitally enhance low cost technology in aerostructure 
 i be fortunate enough to visit the british standards institution in hemel hempstead recently to see its work help business to deliver well product and drive towards a more sustainable planet its research show that of uk company increase turnover and productivity because of the bsi ’s standard what step be the government take to support more company to adopt and certify standard such as the bsi ’s ai management system standard so that we can grow the uk tech sector and enable innovation and collaboration safely and securely

 the minister be right that such work be help not just hertfordshire but everywhere else he have be a regular visitor to northern ireland and have take a specific interest in cyber security there have he have the opportunity to interact with company in northern ireland to ensure that we can benefit from the expansion of the cyber security industry 
 i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s recognition that i have a personal commitment to northern ireland which i recently visit for the time this government be commit to cyber security right across the united kingdom the budget for it and their application be subject to barnett consequential i know that he will be work with the devolved administration to ensure that that money be spend wisely and in central government they will have the partner they need

 the astonishingly successful growup vertical agriculture project in sandwich in my constituency be highly dependent on datum which could be hugely assist by artificial   intelligence i understand that agriculture be not represent on any of the work party will the minister seek to ensure that agriculture be include and possibly find time to visit the project 
 as i have set out we have inter ministerial meeting that bring minister together include ministers from defra the secretary of state regularly meet representative from the national farmers union and other secretaries of state to discuss these issue

 i reassure my hon friend that i be look very closely at how we strengthen the online safety regime in order to protect child far into the future i have commission research into the exact causal relationship between which product young people use and the impact that they have on they and i will act accordingly from there 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson

 i thank the secretary of state for that answer the government be rightly focus on drive public sector reform through the smart use of technology and in basingstoke we have see what be possible ics.ai have already help derby city council to save million of pound use ai gemasecure another local firm be develop home grow tech to help to protect vital infrastructure from cyber threat and tbsc have produce software to reduce cost waste on unused it subscription by up to will the secretary of state join i in basingstoke to meet those firm and other to discuss how his department can work with they to help to achieve our mission of build a more efficient secure and modern public sector

 i call the shadow minister 
 accurate datum be important particularly in the public sector we will be vote on this later today how will the secretary of state measure his plan productivity improvement how will he define success and over what time period 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that we be deploy technology to deliver productivity gain across whitehall which be start now we be invest heavily through the digital centre that we create in the department for science innovation and technology and work intensively with department such as the department for work and pensions and his majesty ’s revenue and customs we have already identify billion of pound worth of saving which will be put to use within government without delay for the benefit of citizen

 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 labour have cancel britain ’s new national supercomputer at the university of edinburgh damage our research capability and economic growth that project be fully fund by the conservatives and the university say that it will be a disaster if the cancellation be not reverse so will the government reinstate that supercomputer or will it be another victim of the chancellor ’s fail economic experiment 
 it surprise i that the hon gentleman continue down this path of the decision i have to take after become secretary of state be how we deal with an unfunded commitment for hundred of million of pound where the money never exist the treasury have not commit it not a single letter have go to my department from the treasury yet the previous government spend year make verbal commitment we will deliver a compute strategy that be fit for purpose that will get our country where it need to be 
 order we be not go to get everybody in secretary of state 
 that project be fully fund and the secretary of state know it while labour cancel our tech investment our competitor the us germany and japan be all increase theirs next month the chancellor will cut the department ’s budget in real term so can the secretary of state tell we today whether he will allow the treasury to cancel more investment in britain ’s future or will he finally speak up for britain ’s vital tech sector 
 we will release the compute strategy that strategy will be fully fund and fully deliver unlike under the government which the hon gentleman be part of that let our country down 
 there   be   incredible dividend from digital for government administration and service delivery but some old and vulnerable constituent tell i that they can not use smartphone or be not online and be worried about be leave behind i be liaise with citizens advice the local council age concern and other to take action locally to help they can the minister reassure i that sufficient advice support and funding will be   make available to my constituent to ensure digital inclusion as we rightly seek to utilise digital far more effectively 
 my hon friend be absolutely right there be old people and other for that matter who either have no online access or do not have a smartphone who would not be able to access thing in a digital world that be why we introduce a digital inclusion plan and that be of the key difference between a labour government and a tory government they do not have any interest in digital inclusion and they do not have a plan for year and we bring in 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question i welcome to the gallery the speakers of anguilla bermuda the british virgin islands the falkland islands gibraltar montserrat and st helena 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday may 
 over the past week we have secure a historic trade deal with india and a landmark agreement with the united states protect and create british job slash tariff and drive economic growth we have also publish a white paper set out how this government will end the open border experiment of the conservatives bring net migration down back british worker and deliver fair control of our border 
 i know that the whole house will also want to mark the anniversary of the bradford city fire we remember the victim of that devastating tragedy and celebrate the strength of the community 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 year of conservative cut have strip the environment agency of the resource and the staff it need to properly deal with badly manage landfill site blight community like mine the jameson road landfill site in my constituency of blackpool north and fleetwood have be produce toxic stench for more than a year now cause nosebleed headache vomiting and breathing problem for my resident will the prime minister commit to ensure that the environment agency have the staff and resource to police such badly manage site across the country so that it can act swiftly and effectively to protect community like mine 
 i love the fact that when anyone say year of a conservative government opposition member all go oh no that be how the country feel once again a hard work labour mp be clear up the mess that be leave behind my hon friend ’s resident deserve far well and we expect rapid improvement   we be closely monitor air quality and will not hesitate to take further action she be right that we must tackle rogue operator who blight our community that be why we have boost environment agency funding by £ alongside tough new rule on incinerator and commercial fly tipper 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 if i may mr speaker sir roy stone serve chief whips and prime ministers from margaret thatcher to boris johnson i would like to pay tribute to his extraordinary service and send my good wish to his family 
 before we start i would also like to say to the prime minister how horrified i be to hear about the attack on his family home it be completely unacceptable and i think i speak for the whole house when i say that it be an attack not just on he but on all of we and on our democracy 
 yesterday we learn that unemployment be up since the election why do the prime minister think unemployment be rise on his watch 
 may i pay tribute to roy stone as well and the service that be give to we in various capacity 
 i thank the leader of the opposition for her word about the attack on i and my family and many other for their kind message in the past few day the leader of the opposition message i pretty well straightaway which i really do appreciate she be absolutely right that it be an attack on all of we on democracy and on the value that we stand for 
 the right hon lady come here every week to talk the country down we have get new job record investment and interest rate cut contrast that with the disastrous liz truss mini budget inflation through the roof and a £ black hole 
 i be not sure that the prime minister even know that employment be up but there be no point in he blame everyone else the fact be that the conservatives reduce the deficit every year until the pandemic more than double the personal allowance leave extra job tackle the post pandemic inflation spike and leave the fast grow economy in the g7 
 let we talk about what be happen today let we look at beales a year old department store in dorset it survive world war and the winter of discontent but it could not survive this labour government beales be have what it call a rachel reeves close down sale what do the prime minister have to say to all the people who have lose their job 
 nobody want to see job loss but the right hon lady must be the only person leave in the country who think that the economy be boom after the last government we have create new job record investment and trade deal the last government try to do the india deal for i think year and fail we do that deal they talk about a us deal we do that deal we also intend to get a strong relationship with the eu 
 this former trade minister must be the only former trade minister who be against all trade deal that boost our economy she say she be against the india deal even though it contain the same provision that she put on the table she be against the us deal even though it save thousand of job in car manufacturing and most absurdly she say she be go to rip up the eu deal when she have not even see what be on the page the opposition have be reduce to this brain rot a once great political party be slide into brain dead oblivion 
 i be very happy to welcome the prime minister ’s tiny tariff deal but the fact be that it have put we in a bad position than we be in in march he should not over egg the pudding 
 let we talk about how thing be get bad now in every month of this year household name like sainsbury ’s tesco asda and santander have cut staff number the office for national statistics estimate that there be few job than there be a year ago and that be before the prime minister ’s job tax which will make thing bad can he promise the house that by this time next year unemployment will be low than it be today 
 i think the right hon lady just say tiny tariff deal can i suggest that she get the train to solihull which take hour and tell the workforce at jaguar land rover and their family and community that she would rip up the deal that protect their job when she have do that she might travel across to scunthorpe and tell the steelworker there that she be go to rip up the deal that save their job then if she have time she could go up to scotland and tell the people at the whisky distillery that she would rip up the deal that be create job for they boost their export and then she can come back here next week and tell we what reaction she get 
 i do not hear a promise to get unemployment down and that be because the prime minister know thing be go to get bad this go wide than business last week i meet staff and patient at farleigh hospice they do fantastic work but they need to find an additional £ to pay the job tax how do the prime minister suggest that farleigh hospice a charity that rely on donation pay for his tax hike 
 we have provide a £ boost for the sector and child and young people ’s hospice receive £ of funding this year 
 the right hon lady turn up every week to carp from the sideline she moan about what we have to do in the budget to stabilise the economy but she have not get the courage to stand there and say that she would reverse our decision on national insurance contribution and i know why it be because she do not want to say she be against the £ investment in our nhs she do not want to say she be against the £ more for our police and she do not want to say she be against the £ more for our school all the time she do not have the courage of her conviction and it show that her criticism be totally confect 
 i can not believe the prime minister be still use that figure we have have this very conversation at the dispatch box he know it be just capital spending   either he be not pay attention or he be say thing to disguise what be go on that money will not pay for the job tax he know that and the hospice know it too 
 the other people who know that thing be get bad be the lead business group in the uk they say that his so call employment rights bill will be deeply damaging to growth do the prime minister accept that they be right or do he believe that he know well than business 
 it be the same old tories every time well right for worker be on the table and they vote against they respect dignity and protection at work be good for worker good for the economy and good for growth 
 the prime minister need to listen to business we can not have employment right without employment labour always forget that it be not government that create growth it be business that create growth business be close and they be blame he and his chancellor there be few job hospice charity and nursery be face bill from the job tax that they can not afford even the union say worker be be throw on the scrapheap and all of this before his unemployment bill make hire even more expensive when will he admit that labour be not work 
 the right hon lady say we should listen she should listen to business it be in favour of our trade deal the india deal be a fantastic deal with tariff on car cut to tariff halve on whisky and gin and £ come into our economy what do she say she would do with the india deal she want to rip it up the us deal save thousand upon thousand of job what do she want to do she want to rip it up the eu deal will be good for our economy she be not even go to wait to see what it say she absurdly say she be go to rip it up it be so unserious she be even reduce last week to accuse the indian government of fake news no wonder she do so badly as a trade secretary the project for the conservatives be over they be slide into oblivion they be a dead party walking 
 thousand of british job have be safeguard by this government ’s trade agreement with the us include for those in my constituency who work for jaguar land rover like my next door neighbour ollie prove that when labour negotiate worker win can the prime minister confirm that he will continue to stand up for all worker and our vital motor manufacturing industry as he negotiate a well deal for britain around the world 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for her work with jlr and for stand up for the job in her constituency the deal that we have agree save thousand of job in our car industry secure the livelihood of countless family i have be up to jlr on a number of occasion include last week i know at hand what it mean for the workforce their family and their community and the leader of the opposition say she would go and tell they that she be   go to rip it up she should go up there—[interruption well she say she be go to go against it what do the reform leader say about jlr he say jlr deserve to go bust shame on he labour be strike deal in the national interest 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 on behalf of my party may i offer heartfelt congratulation to his holiness pope leo xiv may i also offer our support to the prime minister and his family after the appalling arson attack on his home i echo his thank to our brilliant police and firefighter 
 year ago the previous government be face with a choice their own migration advisory committee tell ministers that recruit more care worker require improved condition career progression and well pay but the conservatives choose not to do that and instead bring in large number of care worker from overseas the carer look after our love one in care home should be thank not demonise will the prime minister now do the thing that the conservatives refuse to do start with a high minimum wage for carer 
 may i thank the right hon gentleman for his comment about i and my family i really appreciate it 
 it be important that we have fair pay for care worker and that be why we have put in place our fair pay agreement this be the of its type it will be apply to care worker to ensure that they get fair pay but also a well framework for progression as he will know most people leave care work be go to the nhs because of the pay and the ability to progress our fair pay agreement will deal with make sure that in the future those job be more secure i will just add a declaration of interest my sister be a care worker i know at hand how important the work be and how difficult sometimes the situation face they be 
 i thank the prime minister for that reply it be a good step but we will still see people earn more in amazon warehouse and supermarket than in care home and that will mean our love one go without the care they need 
 turn to the middle east for more than week israeli force have block food water and medicine get into gaza there be now a humanitarian catastrophe with people at risk of famine and in face starvation rather than end this crisis the netanyahu government be plan to seize all gaza indefinitely i know the prime minister will agree that the blockade of gaza should end and i be sure he will agree that it would be appal if netanyahu proceed with that escalation but will he act now and pick up the phone to president trump for a joint plan to recognise palestine and get food water and medicine into gaza 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise this because the situation in gaza be simply intolerable and get bad we be work with other leader urgently to bring about the rapid and unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid into gaza which be desperately need obviously alongside the release of hostage and get back to a ceasefire and that   work be go on through my team i do believe that that be the initial action that need to be take but i still fundamentally believe that however remote it may seem at the moment the pathway to a state solution be the only way for settled and last peace in the middle east we will continue with our ally to pursue that path 
 find in my constituency durdle door be of the most iconic bathing site in all the country last friday i be join at durdle door by my hon friend the members for bournemouth east tom hayes for bournemouth west jessica toale and for poole neil duncan jordan)—and most importantly by ron the local seal to test the water quality currently water quality at bathing site be monitor only from mid may to september which put at risk the health of all water user who could be swim in pollution or sewage with that in mind will the prime minister work with i and my hon friend to introduce all year round testing at popular bathing site such as durdle door 
 everyone enjoy our beautiful beach lake and river be entitle to know that the water be clean and safe that be why we be modernise outdated bathing water regulation include more regular monitoring site to reflect local demand after year of failure by the conservative party we be act through our plan for change with new power to tackle pollution include ban bonus jail term for law break boss and real time monitor of every sewage outlet 
 diolch yn fawr iawn llefarydd this prime minister once speak of compassion and dignity for migrant and of defend free movement now he talk of island of stranger and take back control somebody here have to call this out it seem that the only principle he consistently defend be whichever he last hear in a focus group so i ask he be there any belief he hold that survive a week in downing street

 as the hon gentleman will know the secretary of state for energy security and net be go through a quasi judicial exercise and i be therefore limited in what i can say let i do the good i can within those constraint the project be go through its examination where interested party can and should put forward their view on the application more broadly as we drive forward renewable project the planning process be design to ensure that impact be carefully consider 
 the united kingdom have rightly help to arm ukraine with modern effective capability and we be send it some £ this year however after decade of rely on the peace dividend our own force be ill equipped for modern warfare with colleague interested in defence technology i be develop a proposal for a joint uk ukraine production hub on british soil which would support ukraine while modernise our own force at warfighting scale and create the job and know how need to rearm and stay secure will the prime minister use his good office to support this proposal

 the hon member ’s constituent have be badly let down by the previous government ’s empty promise which be never go to be deliver we have put the new hospital programme on a sustainable financial footing and increase the nhs capital budget to record level so that we can address the backlog of critical maintenance repair and upgrade i will make sure that he get a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss that particular case

 my hon friend be a superb champion for energy security drive down bill and the good secure job that renewable offer those on the opposition benches be climate defeatist anti job anti growth anti business and anti investment and they should try to peddle their policy to the ten of thousand of people in this country who work in renewable every single day those on the opposition benches do not think that britain have the skill and they would deny we incredible opportunity we be focus on secure billion in investment create ten of thousand of job and take we off the rollercoaster of international fossil fuel

 may i extend my thought to victor and the awful circumstance that the hon lady describe which must be extremely challenging we do have to reform the system because it be not work i think there be general agreement about that but the principle must be clear we protect and secure those in need of protection and security we help those who can work into work and we believe that those who can work should work we have to reform the current system to make it well because what we have do not work

 i be grateful to the hon member for raise this issue which must be of concern i be not across the detail at this stage but i will make sure that he get a meeting with the relevant minister to get to the bottom of the issue 
 rise 
 that complete prime minister ’s question 
 on a point of order mr speaker during prime minister ’s question the leader of the opposition claim that unemployment have rise by since the general election that figure be completely and utterly incorrect it be no wonder that george   osborne the former conservative chancellor have say that she have no economic plan if she can not even get basic statistic right will the leader of the opposition return to the house and correct the record 
 the accuracy of what a member state be not a matter for the chair but you have correct the record in your opinion we will leave it there for now 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the uk ’s assessment of the likelihood of genocide in gaza 
 yesterday alongside partner the uk convene a meeting of the un security council in response to the intolerable civilian suffering and humanitarian need in gaza as i tell the house yesterday israel ’s denial of aid be appalling tonne of food be currently sit rot at the gaza israel border block from reach people who be starve israeli ministers have say that israel ’s decision to block this aid be a pressure lever this be cruel and indefensible overnight yet more palestinians have be kill in israeli strike this must end 
 the message yesterday be clear the world demand that israel stop and change course immediately with our ally we be tell the government of israel to lift the block on aid enter gaza now and enable the un and all humanitarian to save life now we need an immediate ceasefire now humanitarian aid must never be use as a political tool or military tactic and the uk will not support any aid mechanism that seek to deliver political or military objective or that put vulnerable civilian at risk 
 the international court of justice case on genocide be ongoing we support the icj we support its independence the icj issue a set of provisional measure in this case and we support those measure israel have an obligation to implement they it be the uk government ’s long stand position that any formal determination as to whether genocide have occur be a matter for a competent court not for government or non judicial body the uk be fully commit to uphold our responsibility under domestic and international law and we have at all time act in a manner consistent with our legal obligation include under the genocide convention 
 the devastation from this conflict must end our complete focus be on lift israeli restriction on aid on free the hostage on protect civilian and on restore the ceasefire we will work urgently with our ally and partner on further pressure to make israel change course 
 overnight the un ’s emergency relief co ordinator tom fletcher warn that a genocide be possible in gaza in people face starvation the entire population be face high level of acute food insecurity in gaza gaza north deir al balah khan yunis and rafah there be a risk of famine there be primary cause israel ’s aid blockade since   march 
 the security council be tell that civilian in gaza have again be forcibly displace and confine into ever shrink space with of the territory either within israeli militarise zone or under displacement order israeli airstrike on the european hospital in gaza yesterday kill people with further report of at least death overnight from strike elsewhere can the minister tell we whether the foreign commonwealth   and development office have conduct any recent assessment of its own on the risk that the israeli authority be commit genocide 
 last night the uk ’s ambassador to the un rightly call on israel to lift the restriction and ensure a return to the delivery of aid in gaza in line with humanitarian principle and international law but that be not enough 
 notwithstanding the government ’s position that it be for judicial body to make a determination what be the minister ’s response to the late un assessment that genocide be possible in gaza can he confirm whether the uk stand by the obligation to prevent duty in the genocide convention parliament need to know whether the un emergency relief co ordinator ’s assessment will lead to a shift in the uk government ’s position why be it that when the horror increase the uk government ’s position stay the same 
 lastly to echo the word in tom fletcher ’s briefing 
 will you act decisively to prevent genocide and to ensure respect for international humanitarian law 
 or will you instead repeat 
 those empty word we do all we could 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for ask those important question the testimony of the emergency relief co ordinator the very most senior official in the world ’s entire humanitarian system give last night at the un security council meeting that we call with our ally be clearly incredibly important i can confirm to the hon member that we do abide by our international law obligation include to the genocide convention and we consider in all of our ihl assessment which be ongoing all the relevant test and we will continue to do so 
 the hon gentleman ask important question which have echo in this chamber yesterday and throughout this long and painful conflict this government have take step whether restore funding suspend arm export or work with our partner in the un and elsewhere but clearly we be in a situation today that nobody in this house would wish to be in nobody on the government benches and i be sure nobody on the opposition benches either 
 we will need to take more and more action until we see the change that we need but the central question as i have tell this house repeatedly be that aid be not be allow into gaza while it be not allow into gaza there be nothing that can be do to get the aid at the scale and in the manner necessary to save palestinian life it be on that point that we call the security council and on that point that we will continue to act 
 order may i remind member not to use the word you because i be not responsible for some of those statement 
 the minister have repeatedly say that we do everything to observe international law will he please accept that there be a grow body of opinion that say that the uk be not do that and that we be not comply with our obligation if we continue to supply part for the f-35 programme because these be drop weapon on child in gaza we can not say that we   be observe the geneva convention the genocide convention and rome statute if we continue to supply those good he talk about do all that we can if that be the case why on earth be we not make it abundantly clear to israel that trade with it be not an option while this continue so in answer to the question be he do all he can there be many people in this place and beyond who think that we be not 
 i know my hon friend ’s commitment to these issue over a long period of time i do not accept the premise of his question whether or not we abide by our legal obligation be a question that will be determine by the court it be be determine by the court this week so i will leave it to the court to make judgment on our obligation we be take all the step that we can to bring this conflict to a close he mention the vital question of the f-35 programme i know this house understand the significance of that programme not just in europe but across the world the carve out that we have put in place have be do on the basis of robust legal advice which be be test in the court this week we must abide by our obligation to our ally we be not sell f-35s directly to the israeli authority we continue to supply a global spare pool that be necessary for the continue function of the f-35 programme which have critical importance to european security we make these judgment calmly and soberly and we will continue to do so 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the situation in the middle east continue to cause concern that be why we on this side of the house have be clear on the need to see the return of the hostage and a last ceasefire although we welcome the release of edan alexander there be still hostage hold in gaza by the iranian back terrorist those who be still alive be be hold in the most dreadful and appalling condition without access to aid and medicine what they and their family have be go through for approach day be unimaginable they must be release as a matter of urgency so can the minister give an update on the diplomatic step be take by the government to secure the release of the remain hostage and what be britain contribute to those effort 
 this conflict would have be over long ago have hamas release the hostage and the house should not be in any doubt that hamas and their iranian sponsor be commit to wipe out the state of israel can the minister tell we what step be be take with international partner to deal with the threat to peace security and stability pose by iran we have constantly ask for a strategy to tackle iran so when will this come forward the government have share our view that hamas can have no role in the future governance of gaza so can we have an update on the practical step the government be take to secure this outcome and end the misery that hamas be inflict on gaza and the threat they pose to israel 
 we have debate aid access to gaza on several occasion include in recent day so can the minister tell we exactly how much uk fund aid both directly and indirectly through multilateral organisation be wait to enter gaza and give we a breakdown of what that aid be the government have know for a number of month   about the concern israel have about the delivery of aid to gaza and aid diversion so can the minister today explain what discussion have take place with israel and what practical solution minister have offer to support the delivery of aid that address its concern have the minister be directly engage in the discussion that have take place with israel and the us over alternative way to get aid into gaza do he have a view on this and will the uk be participate 
 we have also be clear that while we continue to press for humanitarian aid and accountability we do not consider the action in gaza to constitute genocide the case bring by south africa to the international court of justice be not help 
 order can we please stick to the time the right hon lady be almost a minute over we have to work within the timescale and member need to time speech lot of members need to get in and we have to support each other i think the minister have enough to go on 
 i of course welcome as the foreign secretary do yesterday the release of edan alexander i know the whole house think of those hostage who remain in hamas captivity i have be in direct contact with the american official involve in that release and it be a very welcome development we be focus on ensure that there be no role for hamas in a future for gaza we be work as part of the arab reconstruction plan to try to achieve that 
 the right hon lady ask an important question about the proportion of british aid unable to get into gaza at the moment for almost month the horrendous answer be even before then there be significant restriction on the aid that we wish to get into gaza i see for myself the item that be unable to cross from al arish into rafah the proportion will be very high but i will see with my official whether i can break it down in great detail for she 
 slow and agonising breath scar crying emancipate body fight for every heartbeat it be death by a cut for the child and for the parent watch their baby deliberately be starve to death almost child be at risk of famine and death in gaza those who have stand by and allow this to happen should hang their head in shame i call on the government to sanction israeli official until the blockade be lift because if we do not act now this will be on we 
 i know the strength of feeling behind my hon friend ’s word i be sure she be aware of the finding of the ipc report on monday which delineate in great detail the precise suffering be feel because of a lack of food and nutrition we be horrify by those finding the need for action could not be more urgent 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 israel ’s continue blockade of gaza now exceed day be utterly unacceptable will the government now recognise that the blockade constitute a clear violation of international law the government must respect whatever determination the icj reach regard genocide there    be already clear obligation on the government to prevent genocide in gaza arise from the icj ’s january order have the government take any step to meet those obligation will they commit today to ban the export of all uk arm to israel will they reconsider sanction on extremist israeli ministers like bezalel smotrich who call for gaza to be destroy will the government commit to the immediate recognition of a palestinian state as the un ’s british relief chief tell the security council yesterday if we have not do all we could to end the violence in gaza we should fear the judgment of future generation do the minister agree 
 these responsibility weigh heavily on i and on every member of the government and the foreign office team but let we not forget what this government have do whether it be restore funding to the united nations relief and works agency suspend arm export in the way we have describe provide £ of humanitarian aid and then be of the loud voice in try to ensure that it enter gaza or work with jordan to fly medicine into gaza with egypt to treat medically evacuate civilian with project pure hope to help gazan child in the uk and with kuwait to support vulnerable child through unicef we be take step we take the judgment of the icj incredibly seriously but i can not pretend to the house that the event in the occupied palestinian territories of recent day be acceptable and we will continue to take every step we can to get a change of course 
 tomorrow be the anniversary of the nakba which see hundred of thousand of palestinians displace from their home that still continue today and the un security council have say that action be now require to prevent genocide a key step to a peaceful state solution would be recognise palestinian statehood something that israel be try to prevent with country recognise palestinian statehood be now not the right time for the uk to do so too 
 the question of recognition of a palestinian state be obviously of vital importance we want to do so as a contribution to a more stable region we can see the serious and immediate threat to the viability of palestinian life and that be what we be focus on in these most urgent of day 
 i call the father of the house 
 i have be a member of the conservative friends of israel for over year long than anybody here hamas be a brutal terrorist organisation that hide its own fighter under hospital but it be frankly unacceptable to recklessly bomb a hospital it be unacceptable to starve a whole people be the minister aware that many friend of israel worldwide notwithstanding narrow legal definition be ask this moral question when be genocide not genocide 
 i have hear in recent week a series of powerful intervention from opposition members and i take they seriously with the weight they hold particularly   from the father of the house and my neighbour in lincolnshire we will not move towards make determination from the dispatch box on question of legal determination but that do not mean we will wait the preliminary judgment of the icj and the provisional measure it set out be important and we will abide by they 
 as the minister have say the situation be intolerable with in gazans face starvation the use of aid as a weapon of war by israel be inexcusable the continue firing of rocket by hamas and detention of hostage be also inexcusable and it all must end i welcome the uk with our international ally call an urgent briefing on the situation at the un security council there the un humanitarian chief be clear in his warning about the dire consequence of the situation continue what step be this labour government take to get more aid in get the hostage out and bring about the ceasefire and state solution that we all in this house desperately want to see 
 i thank my hon friend who i know have be long commit to these issue and use to be an aid worker herself she be a doughty advocate on these point we remain absolutely committed to a state solution we be focus all our diplomatic effort on ensure that the current approach be change that we return to a diplomatic solution and that we have a ceasefire the release of hostage and a move back to that state solution which as she rightly put it be vital 
 the situation in gaza be clearly intolerable and israel have to find a way of get aid in safely and without diversion but do the minister agree that we need to be very careful about the use of the word genocide and that we do not devalue the word it be use to describe the systematic and deliberate murder of jews by nazi germany we must question whether and i do not believe that a war design to release hostage and remove a terrorist threat against terrorist that hide among the civilian population cross that threshold 
 it be the long stand position of government of all stripe that it be for international court to make determination of that nature and we will abide by our obligation under international humanitarian law 
 since   march no food or medical aid supply have reach over palestinians many of we from across this house have attend many statement and westminster hall debate and have submit parliamentary question ask the government about this critical issue the hostage still remain in captivity and need to be release but the reality be that use aid to punish so many people be wrong do the minister agree that under the genocide convention the uk as a state party have an obligation not only to prevent and punish genocide but to avoid action that may assist or enable genocidal act 
 my hon friend ask important question about aid access and the nature of aid delivery let i be clear the uk will not support any aid mechanism   that seek to deliver political or military objective or put vulnerable people at risk the obligation under international humanitarian law and international law more broadly be clear and they fall on israel as the occupy power it must abide by they 
 very few issue in politic particularly international politic be black or white but this be such issue the israeli government be use collective punishment of the civilian palestinian population which be illegal under international law and contravene the geneva convention to which israel be party do the minister think that the british government have lose their moral and legal compass in continue their tacit support for israel 
 i have set out some of what the government have do and i could continue do so for some time let i be clear the hon gentleman rightly point out the absolutely appalling nature of any attempt to weaponise aid and use incendiary language which be clearly breach of international obligation we have condemn from the dispatch box much of that language some of which be repeat by the liberal democrat spokesperson   the hon member for esher and walton monica harding i take this opportunity to say again that the british government absolutely condemn that inflammatory language we will continue to do so and to make our view know to the israeli government in the most forceful possible way 
 the international community have fail to stop israel ’s impunity we have collectively fail to act on violation as they be commit and to hold israel to account with our collective failure palestinians in gaza face collective punishment israeli ministers have state that stop humanitarian aid be of their main lever of pressure that be not only cruel and indefensible but an explicit admission of violation of international law i hear our condemnation minister but i see no action why be we still send arm why be we not sanction israeli minister the un have say what many know to be true as a signatory to the geneva convention we have a legal obligation to prevent genocide minister when will we act 
 my hon friend be forceful advocate on these question she point to failure and i recognise that failure so many day and month on the people of gaza and the west bank and of course the hostage be in the most distressing circumstance possible i will not comment from the dispatch box on sanction as she would expect but i can assure she that we will work urgently with our ally and partner on further pressure to make israel change course 
 it be become increasingly difficult to keep up with the slaughter in gaza the brutality and cruelty on the west bank and starvation as a policy the crime come daily such as the recent killing of mohammed bardawil of only key eyewitness to the slaughter of rescue worker just a few week ago whose body be bury in shallow graf it be clear to everybody that crime be be commit daily 
 as a number of member have point out the uk be a party to international agreement that provide a positive obligation to act to prevent genocide and torture and protect the right of other we have an obligation as a member of the united nations security council and a state party to the geneva convention to promote peace and security what advice have the minister take on the liability that will attach to he as a decision maker have the government receive advice on whether the prime minister the foreign secretary any senior official or previous ministers may be expose when the reckoning come 
 as member would expect i will not discuss internal legal advice in the chamber whether it apply to i or other ministers i reassure the right hon gentleman that right across government we understand the gravity of the situation and the weight that fall on we to ensure change to this diabolical trajectory we will continue to use our role in the security council the g7 and the e3 as we do yesterday and that action will not stop 
 the minister still refuse to address the central issue which be that our obligation to prevent genocide under the rome statute have already be trigger by the ample evidence of israeli war crime in gaza in the week mark year since the nakba how many more time will he come to the chamber with just word word that do nothing we need action let we be clear it be not a case of if but when he will end the uk ’s complicity in arm a state that be accuse of genocide against the palestinians and of when he will finally impose sanction on israel history will judge his delay 
 i remind the house of the decision that we take last year we have discuss the question of the f-35 global spare pool the basis on which we make a carve out be clear and have be debate many time let i be clear aside from that carve out when we come into government we take on the solemn duty of make an assessment which do not appear to have be make of the serious risk of potential breach of international humanitarian law we then suspend arm export licence where those weapon could be use in such conduct that mean in gaza on the west bank and in relation to all the area where those risk accrue we take far reach action that action be still in place and we continue to conduct those assessment 
 i can understand why many member may feel frustrated by the f-35 carve out perhaps they also feel frustrated about our continue to sell arm that do not risk a violation accord to the assessment that have be much discuss here we think it right that we for example continue to provide body armour that might be use by non governmental organisation in gaza or provide part of the supply chain that could end up in the hand of nato ally we have take far reach action on arm that be important work that we be proud of 
 i have just return from the high court this morning where government lawyer will argue in defend the continue supply of f-35 component that the evidence available do not support a finding of genocide and that there be a 
 tenable view that no genocide have occur or be occur 
 it appear that the government whether they have tell the minister so or not have already make a determination and that explain why they have no intention of ask for an independent assessment of whether a genocide be likely the government know that if they do ask for it would reveal an unpalatable truth that would prevent they from supply israel with the weapon that it need to continue its merciless onslaught it really be as grubby as that be n’t it minister 
 it be not as grubby as that we will not litigate an ongoing legal case in the chamber as members would expect a judicial review on the f-35 element be happen over these day the judge will find on that and we will respect the judgment let i be absolutely clear to the hon gentleman we continue to conduct assessment across a full range of responsibility under international law it be simply not true to suggest that we be avoid make any internal assessment in order to justify policy we continue to assess these thing carefully we do it on a rolling basis regularly what he say be simply not true 
 i thank the minister for his personal commitment to this cause and the uk government for put this matter on the record at the un yesterday as a matter of extreme urgency may i also put to the minister directly the challenge yesterday from tom fletcher the un ’s aid chief he say 
 for those kill and those whose voice be silence what more evidence do you need now? will you act decisively to prevent genocide 
 what be the minister ’s answer to that question 
 my hon friend have be commit to these issue since before he come to this place tom fletcher ’s word be important as i say early he be the most senior member of the humanitarian community in the world and what he say at yesterday ’s meeting which we call be very important we have not wait for yesterday ’s meeting or for the determination of international court to take action let we not forget what we have do in relation to unrwa on arm suspension on sanction on israeli settler or through our convene role on the united nations security council we will continue to take action mr fletcher rightly ask for decisive action have our action yet be decisive clearly it have not hostage remain detain palestinians continue to suffer and a state solution feel very distant indeed we have not yet have the decisive effect that we would wish to see and we will continue to act until we do 
 as well as rap kidnap and kill civilian on   october   for the sake of it hamas have a strategy to try to prevent further peace deal between israel and its arab neighbour by provoke a massive frenzied reaction to the atrocity do the minister share my dismay that this brutal strategy seem to be succeed 
 i share the right hon gentleman ’s dismay that event in the region since the horrific action of   october   have involve an enormous amount of   bloodshed and civilian suffering this government hope that we will yet see a day when the region be stable when there be normal diplomatic relation between all its member and when there be a state solution with the state live securely and safely side by side i regret that it feel such a distant prospect 
 year since the nakba israel ’s illegal occupation eat away at the land we now have i will repeat these word loud and clear—“plausible genocide accord to the international court of justice the international criminal court amnesty international and the united nations give this week ’s news what new assessment have be make and how often to determine what other action we can take to stop what be happen to the gazans the child the civilian and the aid worker and to make sure that we can get aid in what other pressure and lever can the government use include as part of a bloc together with international partner and other in addition to recognise palestine surely that recognition be long overdue 
 my hon friend ask important question about assessment those be make regularly on a rolling basis and in the light of new event i reassure she that we do not wait for assessment or final legal determination before take action i have list some of that action already and i reassure she that we will work urgently with our ally and partner on further pressure to make israel change course 
 even if the minister can not condemn what be obviously an act of genocide will he tell we in clear term whether we be still supply part for f-35 jet that find their way to israel and take part in the bombardment of gaza be there still flight go from raf akrotiri over to israel that be carry military equipment that can be use either to bomb gaza or to undertake military action against the people of the west bank 
 the decision that we take on arm bind every part of the uk government we be a government commit to abide by our international legal obligation and we will continue to do so let i be clear again on the position on f-35s the f-35 sale directly to israel whether in relation to any particular component have be suspend sale to a global pool which be necessary for the continue function of the global f-35 programme have not be suspend where sale go to a global pool it be clearly possible that they could find a final destination in israel but to suspend our provision of component to the f-35 global pool would in effect render the f-35 programme inoperable it be on that basis that we set out the decision that we take in september 
 may i put on record the relief that i and many other feel about the release of edan alexander i be say a prayer for the other hostage 
 every week that we come back to this house the horror be great many of we wake up this morning to a spokesperson for the israeli government on the today programme deny that there be hunger in gaza at all this house know the reality we be week into a   blockade of aid by the israeli government and in be starve the minister will know that tom fletcher speak passionately and with purpose yesterday at the un about the collective failure of the un to speak out previously how do we avoid that this time what more evidence do we need before we take action and what more action can be do 
 as i say early the word of tom fletcher in the united nations security council be important the integrated food security phase classification assessment that be produce on monday that assessment be authoritative and thorough in its production be the most important indication of need in gaza it should be take seriously by everyone in this chamber and indeed by the israeli government my hon friend have long be commit to these issue and he know the action that we have take so far i will not speculate from the dispatch box other than to reassure the house that we will be work urgently with our ally and partner to ensure that israel change course 
 there can be few now who would believe that the conduct of the netanyahu government be anything other than gross and disproportionate however do the minister agree with i that the actor in the region that have unequivocally embark on genocide be hamas with their self avow policy of kill jews and eradicate the state of israel 
 i have condemn hamas for their despicable action and ugly and unacceptable rhetoric many time from this dispatch box and i be happy to do so again it be the event of   october in all their full horror that trigger this most recent most horrific round of violence 
 in addition to call for the release of all hostage tom fletcher the un emergency relief co ordinator ask last night what action we will tell future generation that we each take 
 to stop the century atrocity to which we bear daily witness in gaza 
 what action will the government take if in the next hour israel do not allow aid into gaza 
 as i have say throughout the course of the afternoon the responsibility weigh heavily on all of we we do not view the situation as acceptable and we will continue to take step with our ally and partner to urge israel to change course 
 as we meet here in this rather grand palace of westminster the reality on the ground be that palestinian child continue to die in the rubble be it not become clear that the central policy of the israeli government seem more about protect the political skin and life of the current israeli prime minister than even save the life of the remain israeli hostage and save the life of palestinians i appeal to the british government to be again on the right side of history of the law and of moral judgment and not to back particular individual fight for his political life back in tel aviv 
 the right hon gentleman speak powerfully about the various view in israel i will not speculate on the decision making of other but i listen very carefully to the word of the israeli hostage themselves when they have be release what they make of the circumstance in israel and what policy they think should be adopt those be important voice and they echo loudly both in this chamber and across the world we be clear that whatever the intention the international obligation under law on the israeli government in relation to gaza be indisputable and we call today as we have call every day for they to abide by they 
 i declare an interest as the secretary of the national union of journalists parliamentary group 
 it be the anniversary of the murder by israeli force of shireen abu akleh the renowned journalist alongside she on that day be another journalist ali samoudi who be shoot in the back week ago the israeli force arrest he and drag he from his home and ali be now in detention somewhere but we do not know where under international law journalist be afford special protection will the minister immediately take up with the israeli government the question of where ali samoudi be and seek to do everything we can do to secure his release he work for cnn reuters and al jazeera and all he be do be simply report on some of the war crime that be take place 
 my right hon friend raise incredibly important point about journalist and i be happy to take up the case in question not just journalist but a whole set of people be afford special protection under international law include medical professional and aid worker many of whom we have see involve in terrible incident in gaza we have be press for accountability and justice on those question i think in particular of the british national kill in the world central kitchen incident more than a year ago for whom we be still wait for justice
