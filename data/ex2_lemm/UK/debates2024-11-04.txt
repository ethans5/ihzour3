with permission i would like to make a statement about the future of our high education sector and the change that we will be make for student in the upcoming academic year 
 before i go far i want to make clear the approach that this labour government take to our university and above all to the student whose education be their central purpose because the conservative government do not just talk down university they talk down the aspiration of working class family across our country and they dismiss the ambition of our young people and undermine their opportunity this government take a different approach we be determined to break down the barrier to opportunity and high education be central to that mission 
 high education be part of what make our country great it enrich our culture power our economy and sustain intellectual tradition stretch back century it be a beacon of opportunity to student not just from this country but from across the world and a sector of which everyone in this house ought to be proud but when this government take office in july we find a university sector face severe financial challenge with tuition fee freeze for the last year university have suffer a significant real term decline in their income we also find a regulator subject to political whim unable to focus on the challenge our university face a succession of conservative ministers face with tough decision have for year after year duck they time and again 
 we inherit in our university as across so much   of our public sector the consequence of long year   of shameful abdication of responsibility long year   in which i hear too often from student of the gap between the course they be promise and the experience they have about the trouble they have make end meet as they work hard not merely at their study but often at or more job on top long year in which i see the amazing research our university deliver but how infrequently those triumph drive wide success and long year in which i hear from international student who make such an important contribution to our country that the previous government have make they feel neither value nor welcome that be the mess that opposition member leave behind but where the conservatives shirk the hard choice this government have not hesitate to grip the challenge we face and take the tough decision to restore stability to high education to fix the foundation and to deliver change 
 we have accept in full the recommendation of the independent review of the office for students we have also bring new leadership to the office and refocus its work to monitor university finance and to hold leadership to account i thank sir david behan for his work both lead the independent review and now as its interim chair we have pause the commencement of the last government ’s freedom of speech legislation while we consider the impact on university student and the regulator because although university must be home to robust discussion and rigorous challenge regulation must also be workable 
 i be here today to make set of announcement on high education reform address the challenge our student and university face and grip these issue as a responsible government we will fix the foundation we will secure the future of high education so that student can benefit from a world class education for generation to come that be why i be announce that in line with the forecast set out in the budget last week from april we will be increase the maximum cap for tuition fee in line with inflation to £ an increase of £ per academic year 
 i understand that some student may worry about the impact that the increase will have on their loan debt so i want to reassure student already at university that when they start repay their loan they will not see high monthly repayment as a result of these change to fee and maintenance loan that be because student    loan be not like consumer loan monthly repayment depend on earning not simply the amount borrow or interest rate and at the end of any loan term any outstanding loan balance include interest build up will be write off 
 increase the fee cap have not be an easy decision but i want to be crystal clear that this will not cost graduate more each month as they start to repay their loan university be responsible for manage their own finance and must act to remain sustainable but member across the house will agree that it be no use keep tuition fee down for future student if the university be not there for they to attend nor if student can not afford to support themselves while they study i therefore confirm that we will boost support for student with living cost by increase maximum maintenance loan in line with inflation give they an additional £ a year in i also confirm that from the start of the academic year a low fee limit of £ will be introduce for foundation year in classroom base subject such as business social science and humanity the government recognise the importance of foundation year for promote access to high education but they can be deliver more efficiently in classroom base subject at a low cost to student 
 the change that the government be bring about must go far so my set of announcement signal the start of deep change for our student our university and our country today i will set out the scale of our ambition to build a high education system fit for the challenge not just of today but of tomorrow in the month ahead we will publish our proposal because in university as across our public service investment can come only with the promise of major reform the contribution of high education to our economy our community and our country must grow and strengthen that begin with university do more to spread opportunity to disadvantaged student in both expand access and improve outcome our most recent datum show why the gap between disadvantaged student and their peer in progression to university by age be the high on record i will not tolerate that shameful divide any long university can and must do more and they must rise to the huge challenge of technological change support adult with the flexibility that they need to retrain that be why we confirm in the budget that we be press ahead with the lifelong learning entitlement 
 while the uk be home to many world class university it be time that all student in high education in this country feel the benefit it be time to raise the bar far on teaching standard to improve our world lead reputation and drive out poor practice and it be time to ensure that all student get good value for money which if we be honest have not always be the case in the past furthermore university must do more to raise their impact beyond their gate they must do more to drive the growth that this country sorely need by attract talent from around the world join with skills england employer and partner in further education to deliver the skill that people and business need and shape world class research to create good job across the country member across the house will know how important university can be for the area that surround they not just local economy but local community i want university to work hard to embed themselves   in those local community as civic anchor the beat heart of local life in our town and city not ivory tower far from local concern 
 lie beneath those challenge must be a further transformation a renew drive for efficiency student and taxpayer support the cost of our university they be right to expect that every penny be spend effectively we will not accept wasteful spending university must rise to the challenge which mean ensure that the pay of their top team be fair and justifiable i be determined that our world class high education sector do not merely survive in the year ahead but thrive support student in every corner of our country and at every stage of their life i be determined that our university become all that i know they can be the scale of our ambition demand a new approach root in partnership so i look forward to partnering with the sector the office for students and uk research and innovation i will work closely with ministers across government in particular the secretary of state for science innovation and technology to deliver a reformed and strengthen high education system for our country 
 as today the government look to the future i be remind that more than year have pass since the robbins report on high education be present to this house with its famous principle 
 that course of high education should be available for all those who be qualified by ability and attainment to pursue they and who wish to do so 
 that principle drive the expansion of high   education over the decade that follow under successive government of both party it be central to the thinking of this government today that be why responsible government must treat university not as a political battleground but as a public good it be why government member want to see the continued success of our young people and it be why we be determined to ensure the sustainability and success of our high education sector not just in the year ahead but for decade to come i commend this statement to the house 
 everyone know that a knowledge rich curriculum be the reason why the english education system improve dramatically under the last government the embed of academic rigour produce phenomenal result in pisa the programme for international student assessment with that in mind will the minister confirm that she have no intention of dilute the curriculum or any focus on academic rigour

 that course of high education should be available for all those who be qualified by ability and attainment to pursue they and who wish to do so 
 that principle drive the expansion of high   education over the decade that follow under successive government of both party it be central to the thinking of this government today that be why responsible government must treat university not as a political battleground but as a public good it be why government member want to see the continued success of our young people and it be why we be determined to ensure the sustainability and success of our high education sector not just in the year ahead but for decade to come i commend this statement to the house 
 we want to ensure that we support young carer in school as well as other child who may be suffer from mental health condition this government be entirely commit to support young people with mental health condition and we be make sure that there will be mental health support in every school up and down the country for young carer who may be experience increase mental health condition we be expand the attendance mentor programme to ensure that around an extra young carer be support especially in the area of mental health 
 i note the hon member ’s point on that specific college as he will know the chancellor commit £ at the budget to drive the delivery of the current school rebuilding programme for next year over the come week and month we will work with trust and local authority to identify which school will be in scope 
 i congratulate my right hon friend the chancellor not only on be the woman ever to deliver a budget to this house but on be the chancellor to deliver a join up grown up budget in year 
 represent a welsh constituency i be proud that this budget provide the large funding boost—£21 that wales have receive since devolution that be proof if ever that be need that only labour governments work together will ever properly listen to understand and fight to meet the need of the people of wales who have be ignore belittle or attack by generation of conservative we all know that our broken public service would collapse overnight without the selfless dedication of the countless woman and man who day in and day out serve as unpaid carer i be particularly pleased that the budget have raise the amount by nearly £ a month that carer can earn before lose out on carer ’s allowance 
 turn to agriculture as co chair of the all party parliamentary group for farming and have grow up on a small family farm i know there have be much disquiet over the change to agricultural property relief i have be in constant communication with our excellent local nfu policy staff since the budget and i be listen to their concern and feed they directly back to defra it be unsurprise that farmer be worried give that many journalist and the conservative   party have unfortunately be selectively focus on a £ figure that do not reflect the reality of the policy 
 let i seek to reassure small family farmer and repeat the word of the exchequer secretary to the treasury my hon friend   the member for ealing north james murray   last week who say 
 the total value of a farm should not be confuse with the value be pass on at death multiple family member can own part of a farm for example if an individual jointly own a farm worth £ with their partner only £ be in their estate at death 
 those be wise word which will give comfort to many who have be mislead by selective and mischievous comment on the budget with the additional £ relief for each partner if there be a property on the farm a farm worth up to £ may still pay inheritance tax yes this budget recognise that family farm form part of the backbone of rural community but it also recognise that our rural community rely every bit as much on strong function public service 
 this historic budget call time on austerity and bring stability back 
 i would like to remind hon member of the important courtesy relate to constituency business you must make every effort to inform colleague in advance whenever you intend to visit their constituency other than for purely private purpose this apply equally to front benchers and to back benchers failure to do so be rightly regard by colleague as very discourteous 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she   be take to increase the availability of high quality childcare 
 the early year be my no priority as education secretary we will deliver a sea change in early year education to give parent well work choice and child well life chance we will start by repurpose empty classroom to create or expand school base nursery make childcare more accessible and affordable for hard press family i encourage state fund primary school work with their local authority to consider apply before the application window close on   december 
 with government datum show that more early year place need to be create by next year and with an overhaul of outdated business rate promise will the secretary of state commit to remove unfair business rate from nursery and pre school which will now be mostly deliver government fund childcare 
 it be undoubtedly a challenge to deliver the roll out but we be determined to do it because it be so important for parent and for child ’s life chance we intend to reform the early year sector overall we will be look very closely at this into next year i would welcome further input from the hon gentleman and his party on the way forward 
 rise 
 i call ashley dalton oh you be not stand this be not direct at you personally but when you stand i think you be go to ask a question and then when you sit down i be leave high and dry 
 as a mother in the north west i thank the secretary of state and welcome the government ’s £ commitment to expand publicly fund childcare as we transition towards more publicly fund childcare can she share any plan for interim support to keep childcare affordable for work family rely on private provider 
 my hon friend be right as the roll out continue we will shortly reach a situation in which of childcare be government back it be therefore right that in those circumstance we look closely at whether we be get the good quality provision for our child as part of our early year strategy review we will take account of all consideration we be look at a range of factor for the sector include workforce recruitment quality of provision and much more besides i look forward to work with she   on this 
 we welcome the new shadow secretary of state 
 thank you mr speaker may i say how delighted i be to be in the role we will be a constructive opposition work in the good interest of young people in that spirit i ask the secretary of state to confirm that the government ’s early year fund rate for all age group will increase to reflect the change in employer national insurance contribution will she give we a figure for how much that will cost the department for education 
 i welcome the right hon lady to her place it be the good job in opposition just as mine be the good job in government i be sure that whatever disagreement we might have in the week and month to come we can all get behind the importance of education to our country 
 we will set out more detail on funding rate in due course what i would say to the right hon lady be that the conservative party leave behind commitment but no plan to make they real instead they leave we a £ hole in the public finance and this government have have to take some tough decision to get our public finance back on a stable footing 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 third of early year place be deliver by private and voluntary provider far to the shadow education secretary ’s question what assessment have the department for education make of the impact of last week ’s national insurance rise on those provider how much more do the department expect that parent will have to pay in nursery fee how much additional cost will the department have to bear to fund exist and plan so call free hour for parent 
 as be announce at the budget we expect to provide £ for the early year entitlement in which be an increase of about on the previous year we will continue to deliver the roll out because this government have seek to protect education priority in the budget 
 on the hon member ’s precise question we be look in more detail at what the change mean for provider in the early year sector and we will have more to say shortly alongside the change to the national insurance employer contribution rate we be increase the employment allowance to £ and be expand this to all eligible employer so small provider may pay no national insurance at all in 
 alongside formal childcare many parent want to have the option of spend more time at home with their baby in those precious early month that be so crucial for a child ’s development do the secretary of state agree that at less than half the minimum wage statutory maternity pay be far from excessive what discussion have she have with ministerial colleague about boost support for those parent who want to spend more time at home rather than be rush back to work in order to give family real choice in how they care for their child 
 i agree that it be important we get the balance right that be why the deputy prime minister and the secretary of state for business and trade be    look carefully as part of our wide reform to employment support and employment law at what more we need to do around parental leave entitlement i share the hon member ’s concern about the comment we have hear from the now leader of the conservative party   the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch about maternity pay i want to make sure that parent have choice about what work for they what be good for they and what good support their child ’s development in those crucial early year 
 what step she be take to provide preventive education for schoolchildren about knife crime 
 what school teach can play an important part alongside wide activity in the government ’s safe street mission and tackle knife crime relationship sex and health education include content on situation that lead to young people carry knife include criminal exploitation county line operation and groom relationship we be review the content to ensure that it remain relevant and protect child ’s wellbee 
 greater manchester continue to experience some of the high rate of knife violence in the country with more than record incident since organisation such as the greater manchester violence reduction unit have be do excellent work in early prevention by engage child and young people through community lead project include theatre production give the importance of early community base intervention do the minister agree that provide support for such initiative be important in tackle knife violence 
 i thank my hon friend for raise such an important topic and highlight the good work of the greater manchester violence reduction unit as well as the work on the rshe curriculum the government will create a new young future programme intervene early to stop young people be draw into crime through preventive action and learn from good practice across the country it be vital that we have a system that can identify and support those young people who need it most be they victim or potential perpetrator 
 preventive education be critical and not just when it come to knife crime a recent report from the university of bath highlight that in vape confiscate in school contain the synthetic drug spice a highly addictive drug that condemn young people in particular vulnerable young people to a life of crime and addiction will the secretary of state agree to a special educational programme to address the alarming issue of spice spike vape in school 
 we want to make sure that every school and college across our country be a safe environment for child to learn i be happy to meet the hon member to understand those issue in more detail 
 what step she plan to take to improve the pay term and condition of teach assistant and support staff 
 school support staff be crucial to ensure that we give child the good possible life chance that be why we be reinstate the school support staff negotiating body the new national voice for some of those who do the most important work in our school in the tories scrap the body within our day labour start the legislative process to bring it back that be because we value the vital role that support staff play in our education system 
 low pay and limited career progression be drive many teaching support staff out of our classroom quarter of the profession be either consider leave or be actively look to leave with in teaching assistant post currently vacant will my right hon friend recommit to address this recruitment and retention crisis and ensure that these hugely value employee receive the wage and term and condition that they have long for for so long 
 my hon friend can be assure that the school support staff negotiate body will be task with establish a national term and condition handbook training career progression route and fair pay rate for support staff to make sure that we can recruit and retain the brilliant people include teach assistant and catering staff who be essential to the functioning of our school 
 teaching assistant in my constituency be struggle to support a grow number of child who need extra help with speech and language skill what be the secretary of state do to ensure that all school support staff have access to relevant training in speech and language development so that they can well support those child 
 the hon lady be right to raise that our teaching assistant in particular have a crucial role to play in support child with special educational need and disability that be why we have commit additional funding this year so that we can roll out the nuffield early language intervention to ensure that there be additional early speech and language support for child who be struggle our teaching assistant and other in support role will be a crucial part of that but i recognise that there be much more that we need to do after year of conservative failure 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on pay what be the cost to school and college of the national insurance increase how much will be provide to they in compensation will the secretary of state confirm clearly that they will be fully compensate for the increase price that supplier and indirectly employ   member of staff such as caterer and it and premise staff will charge as a result will those indirect cost be cover yes or no 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his place school and college will be compensate at a national level i would however point out to he that when i become secretary of state in july i be present with the teacher pay review body award of that the last government receive put in a drawer and then run away from and call an election we have back our teacher who be crucial to the life chance of our child that be why i be delighted that we be able to honour that award and recognise the vital contribution our teacher make that be how we will recruit new expert teacher if the opposition refuse to back our commitment on vat they should set out how many teacher they intend to cut 
 what step she be take to link the school curriculum with skill need in the workplace 
 under the conservatives young people feel unprepared for their future and employer agree that be why this labour government have establish an independent curriculum and assessment review chair by professor becky francis the review aim to deliver a broad and rich curriculum that ensure that young people leave education ready for life and work which include embed digital oracy and life skill 
 there be a shortage of technical skilled worker across our economy it be a chronic problem not least in sector such as clean energy for example there be only register heat pump installer but to deliver the last government ’s target of installation a year we would need of they that be repeat across the economy do my hon friend agree that school have a hugely important role in encourage young people into technical role what be the government do to support young people into technical skilled job 
 i congratulate my hon friend on his work on the energy security and net committee he have a long establish record of championing this issue in the house and i agree with he that be why our curriculum review will include speak to employer as part of the consultation about the essential knowledge and skill that will support and enable student to adapt and thrive in the world and workplace of the future as well as ensure that we have that specialist knowledge in school to support young people to thrive 
 everyone know that a knowledge rich curriculum be the reason why the english education system improve dramatically under the last government the embed of academic rigour produce phenomenal result in pisa the programme for international student assessment   with that in mind will the minister confirm that she have no intention of dilute the curriculum or any focus on academic rigour 
 the hon gentleman ignore the many challenge that young people face in our school system we have establish the independent review which will consider area to focus on in the light of the evidence response to the call to evidence and widespread engagement with stakeholder include employer the review will seek to focus on the most significant issue in our curriculum and assessment but will not destabilise the system we be look for evolution not revolution of our curriculum 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i think we will have to agree to disagree with the minister about the record of the last government on drive up apprenticeship and in particular the work do by our colleague robert halfon look ahead by how much do the minister expect the number of full apprenticeship to grow over the course of this parliament will she publish the department ’s assessment of the move to the growth and skill levy and what that do to the number of people start apprenticeship 
 our reform growth and skill levy will deliver great flexibility for learner and employer and will align with our industrial strategy create route into good skilled job in grow industry such as construction digital and green skill we want a short duration of foundation apprenticeship in those target sector to help more people learn new high skill at work fuel innovation in business across the country and to provide high quality entry pathway for young people we be in the process of design the growth and skill levy and we will set out more detail in due course 
 what step she be take to help increase the number of student undertake vocational training course 
 further education be vital in break down barrier to opportunity drive growth and generate clean energy the budget allocate £ to support young people and improve skill development in september the department launch a new phase of the it all start with skill campaign to promote programme such as apprenticeship and t level 
 after year of tory decline there be much to do in this country to rebuild our crumble infrastructure a lot of people need job to help we achieve that i be glad that the new government be work to increase the number of student be train in the industry of the future but will the minister tell we how she be work across government to make sure that more young people can find those opportunity locally rather than have to move away from their local community 
 central to our opportunity mission be that where someone be from should not determinewhere they end up in life this government be serious about support young people we be work across government to ensure that young people be support in their community through devolution local growth plan local skill improvement plan and the youth guarantee 
 the large provider of vocational education and training opportunity in my constituency be harrogate college which be previously promise more than £ in a combination of loan and grant under the fe capital transformation fund i have write repeatedly to the government to ask if they can secure an extension to that funding period because due to a hold up in the planning process it will not be able to meet the deadline will the minister commit to guarantee the funding for harrogate college for that rebuild 
 the hon member outline many failing by the previous government i will ask my noble friend the minister for skills to meet he 
 what step her department be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step her department be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step her department be take to support child with send 
 what step she be take to improve send provision in warwickshire 
 every child deserve the opportunity to achieve and to thrive but currently far from every child have that chance we have announce that high need funding will increase by almost £ in compare with we will work with the sector to strengthen accountability improve inclusivity through ofsted support professional to increase send expertise and encourage school to set up resource provision or special educational need unit in mainstream school 
 my constituent suzie wait for an education health and care plan for her son harrison for week by law they have to be provide within week so conservative run kent county council take more than twice the amount of time that it should have do when it come it be full of mistake and harrison be now in the wrong school his class size be too big and he do not have the specialist support he require previously kent county council be put in special measure to sort out the problem with ehcp provision would the secretary of state support kcc go back into special measure so that student like harrison get the support that they deserve 
 i be sorry to hear about the challenge face by the hon gentleman ’s constituent local authority have be impact by the increase    demand for education health and care plan and by workforce capacity issue so more efficient and effective service delivery and communication with school and family be central to turn that around we will work as quickly as possible to ensure a more effective response and early identification for child and i will take away the particular example he raise 
 devon county council be spend   £ on private provision for special educational need and disability without enough quality control by the county council state school in mid and east devon want to be able to help provide more send specialist and teaching assistant but ehcp be prescribe to care with just £ which be hardly enough for to provision will the government consider set up more send resource basis in devon 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point it be vital for turn around the current situation face by far too many part of the country there be not sufficient mainstream inclusion for child with special educational need there be not enough specialist unit as part of mainstream school inclusion and we do not have the specialist place need so i will of course take away the hon gentleman ’s specific example 
 in west sussex ehcp request be run at over per month will the secretary of state ’s send reform include measure that could make it hard to get an ehcp potentially make it hard for child to qualify for special school place 
 the hon lady raise an important point i suspect it be on the back of year of let down child who need the education that be clearly want in so many part of the country that explain the number of member raise these issue today she would do well to reflect on the record of the past year we be change the situation as fast as we can but it will take time 
 the previous conservative government leave send family in stratford on avon to fend for themselves i want not just additional send place but continue support for child already attend specialist provision far we need proper investment in home to school transport child be leave without transport at the beginning of the academic year deprive they of access to their education what be the government do to ensure not just that budget reflect need but that they do so to address the problem immediately 
 i recognise the long list of challenge the hon lady set out which she know her constituent be face child with special educational need and disability be be fail with poor outcome and parent be struggle to get their child the support they need and deserve this government ’s ambition be for all child and young people with special educational need or in alternative provision to get the right support to achieve and succeed in their education and as they move into adult life we be move as fast as we can it be a key part of our opportunity mission and we will continue to do so 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 the additional £ in the budget for send support be very welcome but the minister will know that local authority remain anxious about the forthcoming end to the statutory override of dedicated school grant deficit in march what discussion be the minister have with the treasury and the ministry of housing communities and local government on a plan to prevent the end of the statutory override from become a cliff edge financial calamity for local authority and child with send 
 as my hon friend mention high need funding will increase by almost £ in compare with bring total high need funding to £ that funding will help local authority and school with the increase cost of support child and young people with send we will continue to support local authority to meet those demand and reform our system so we can create inclusive education for every child 
 i want to raise the issue of governance there be too many mind control the system which ultimately stymie local authority ability to reform service in order to embed a culture of nurture and to ensure that the good interest of child be represent while review the send system will the minister take a look at governance and ensure that be there be control mind and it be that of the local authority 
 my hon friend will be aware of our plan to ensure that all school co operate within their local facility with their local authority when it come to place planning and admission to ensure that we have a school system that serve the whole community and to ensure that all child whether or not they have special educational need and disability be properly serve and give the opportunity to thrive within that system 
 i apologise for my premature bob at the beginning of this question session mr speaker 
 my constituent have be wait for more than a year for conservative run lancashire county council to issue her year old son ’s ehcp in that time he have attempt suicide and have stop eat and my constituent ’s health be suffer as a result of the stress how can the minister reassure my constituent that the additional £ for send provision will speed up the issuing of ehcp so that student with special need receive the support that they need 
 i be sorry to hear about the experience of my hon friend ’s constituent and she be right to raise it today we know that far too many family and child be wait far too long to receive the support that they need and we be determined to reform the system because child ’s need should be recognise at the early possible stage they should not be wait for ehcp in order to receive that support within our education system that be the change   that we want to see but we recognise the demand on ehcp and the process and we recognise that we need to improve 
 that be happen throughout lancashire include chorley 
 the reform put sen right at the heart of the special educational need system but the then government do only half the job fail to honour the resource that they have promise ehcp take too long to access and child be often send out of borough to receive specialist education which be more expensive how will the government provide more sen provision in our mainstream school in town such as mine 
 my hon friend be right to raise the priority of ensure that child with special educational need and disability be accommodate in mainstream school with their friend whenever possible we be ensure that training be available from the early possible stage so that those in the workforce can teach child with send and that educational psychology service be there to help school to make any change that be necessary we want to work in partnership with the sector to secure the good outcome for every child 
 what step she be take to make childcare more accessible 
 ensure that parent have access to affordable and high quality childcare be a priority for this government we will focus on great opportunity for every family to access early education and on great opportunity for child to thrive and develop as an initial step we have announce the bidding round for the school base nursery from next september 
 many early year provider struggle to meet the need of child with send lack of fund lack of training and lack of specialist staff often mean that those that do provide a good or excellent service quickly become over subscribe what step be the department take to reassure parent and carer of child with send that those child will have access to the childcare or early year provision in their area that meet their need 
 we be help member of the workforce to develop the skill and confidence that will enable they to work effectively with child with send and review early year fund arrangement to ensure that they meet the need of those child i should be happy to meet my hon friend or visit her constituency to understand the issue that her local provider be face 
 martin lewis have long campaign for change in childcare in particular because the way in which it be set up can damage single parent there be an obvious cliff edge the last government propose a consultation on threshold for household be take as but this government seem to have scrap that in the budget will ministers   be speak to the treasury to decide how they will overcome this cliff edge that affect so many single parent 
 i thank the hon member for his question we have a child centre government and early year be a priority for the secretary of state we will focus on reform the childcare system to ensure that it be fit for purpose for the future and of high quality for all young people we be take the sector ’s concern seriously and we want to ensure there be a sustainable system go forward 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the system for support child with special educational need and disability 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the system for support child with special educational need and disability 
 last month the national audit office confirm what many family already know the send system that we inherit from the conservatives be break indeed the number of hon member raise concern on behalf of their constituent show the scale of the challenge that we have inherit we be work as quickly as we can to make the change that family need it be huge complex reform but we be determined to fix the system 
 far too many people in my constituency of hyndburn find the current ehcp process to be adversarial and that fail to assess their child ’s need adequately as the government work to reform the system how can we be sure that the voice of parent and child will remain at the heart of any policy change 
 i recognise what my hon friend be say we engage with child young people parent and carer in the development of policy include through our participation contract next week i will meet our national young people ’s group which be a diverse group of young people from across england who have special educational need and disability they share their view and experience with we and i be look forward to it 
 at the recent send surgery that i organise with send socials birmingham message come through time and again different public body be not work together as the children and families act intend and this be contribute to long delay and distress will the minister agree to receive representation from young people and family in south birmingham so that their negative experience can at least contribute to the important work of reform the send system 
 absolutely we be commit to work with family to deliver an improved send system that work for all we ensure that family have   access to free and impartial information advice and support to enable they to participate as fully as possible in the decision that affect they but i would welcome suggestion from my hon friend and parent in south birmingham on how to improve the system 
 the minister have just agree that there be a crisis of capacity for send provision in the state sector yet the government ’s deeply misguided vat policy on school fee be exaggerate this crisis and the crisis of ehcp assessment surely the right thing to do be grant a vat exemption on send child to ease the crisis 
 we be committed to ensure that pupil whose need necessitate a place at private school be not impact by this policy where a pupil ’s place in private school be fund by a local authority in england scotland and wales because the pupil ’s need can not be meet in the state sector the local authority will be able to reclaim the vat it be charge on fee 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests hertfordshire currently receive the low send funding in the country but since the number of child in the county with educational health and care plan have grow by a staggering do the minister agree that funding should reflect the current need 
 high need funding will increase by almost £ in compare with bring the total high need funding to £ the funding will help local authority and school with the increase cost of support child and young people with special educational need on the distribution of funding the national funding formula will be announce later in november 
 what step she be take to help ensure that young people have the necessary skill to gain employment 
 this government be about fix the foundation to help do this we have launch an independent curriculum and assessment review which aim to enable all young people to access rigorous and high value qualification and training we will also introduce a youth guarantee which will help to year old to access education training and apprenticeship opportunity and to receive employment support 
 the london design and engineering university technical college in my constituency cater for to year old and offer at secondary level the kind of training often only find at further education level do the minister agree that we need to create more opportunity at secondary level for skill base training to ensure that it be embed and last post into the workplace and that it improve employability skill as well 
 i appreciate my hon friend ’s thoughtful question this government absolutely value university technical college for help young people to develop technical skill and with employer support to move into technical career the independent curriculum and assessment review aim to broaden the curriculum ensure that young people do not miss out on vocational subject and that they leave education ready for employment 
 eastbourne as the sunny town in the uk be on a mission to be a solar energy superpower at the heart of that be east sussex college ’s green training hub which be support student young and mature to move into that sector will the minister join i in celebrate the hub ’s birthday and will she come down to eastbourne to visit the hub and its principal rebecca conroy and to soak up some eastbourne sun 
 the sun be obviously shin on eastbourne even though may not be shin everywhere else at the moment because of the weather a visit to eastbourne to celebrate the hub sound delightful but this fall to my noble friend baroness smith of malvern so i will pass on these comment to she 
 i call the shadow minister neil o’brien 
 the sun always shin on chorley mr speaker thing that help young people to gain skill be involvement in the cadet but the department recently confirm a decision to cancel support payment to combined cadet force in state school that payment be something that people involve in the cadet and teacher really value what assessment be make beforehand of the impact that this cut would have will the secretary of state reconsider it 
 we respect all our young people who be in the cadet or any other armed force area the hon gentleman raise this point but after year of the previous government ’s failure and the £ black hole there be difficult choice to be make we be absolutely committed to child and young people and to do the good we can do by they 
 what step her department be take to help tackle persistent school absence among young carer 
 the government be commit to break down barrier to opportunity for all young people include young carer who provide a critical role in care for their love one we now collect specific absence datum for young carer through the school census and our statutory attendance guidance seek to ensure that they receive holistic support to overcome barrier to attendance 
 thing that might be drive absence from school for young carer be long term mental health condition the royal college of paediatrics and child health say that as many as in young carer   could be suffer from long term mental health condition can the minister explain what measure the department be take to ensure that sufficient help be in place for people suffer from those condition 
 we want to ensure that we support young carer in school as well as other child who may be suffer from mental health condition this government be entirely commit to support young people with mental health condition and we be make sure that there will be mental health support in every school up and down the country for young carer who may be experience increase mental health condition we be expand the attendance mentor programme to ensure that around an extra young carer be support especially in the area of mental health.[official report   november vol c. 3wc correction 
 what recent progress the independent curriculum and assessment review have make 
 what progress the independent curriculum and assessment review have make

 research from the university of cambridge show that financial habit be often set by the age of yet financial education for young people be still a postcode lottery it be not part of the primary curriculum and many teacher at secondary level where it be part of the curriculum lack resource and confidence in teach it can the secretary of state confirm whether such foundational life skill which all young people need in order to thrive will be consider at all key stage in the curriculum and assessment review 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for highlight this important area which have be raise by many member in the past i be sure the review will carefully consider what financial education young people need to meet that aim and it will of course consider what support we need to provide to enable teacher to teach the reform curriculum successfully 
 i think parent will be quite alarmed by the answer give to my hon friend   the member for central suffolk and north ipswich patrick spencer as it have very little focus on academic attainment the education secretary appoint becky francis who attack the blair government for their obsession with academic achievement the national education union deny that school accountability should be at the heart of our   assessment system which be wrong so will the secretary of state take this opportunity to rule out scrap sat in year 
 i rather fear that the hon gentleman and his party have learn nothing from the massive defeat inflict upon they by voter in july i can assure this house that the review will be evidence base and will not seek to fix thing that be not break however i remind the hon gentleman that his record be a send system in crisis in child persistently absent from school they can not learn if they be not there fall standard a persistent disadvantage gap and over half of disadvantaged pupil in state primary school not leave with the require standard in english and math he might be proud of that record but i   be not

 the hon gentleman be right to raise his concern as so many have this afternoon about the state of the system for support child with send it be not work and we know it need reform but commit an extra £ into the system at this crucial time be an important step we face choice on how to take this system forward and how to make it less adversarial and more focused on well life chance for our child of the step i take be to refocus the work of the department for education on child with send 
 school be close across inner london and across london more widely for various reason leave premise empty or at risk of   be sell off what strategic oversight be the secretary of state take to ensure that we get the good value for our child from these property 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that important issue about which there be a lack of thinking by the previous government on how we do this properly and seriously challenge come with demographic change but there be opportunity too that be why we have announce more primary base nursery in empty classroom and we can think about do more around additional support and provision for child with special educational need and disability in particular 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 there have be a   lot of discussion about our record in government   under the conservatives england climb international educational league table but what happen to labour- run wales it fall under the conservatives youth unemployment go down and school standard improve that be the record of the conservative government which we be proud to defend do the secretary of state agree that academisation be of the drive force behind that very good school improvement

 as i say to the right hon gentleman during the last education question i believe in the vital importance of freedom of speech and freedom of expression within our university campus university be a place where young people should be expose to view that they might find difficult or challenging however it be important that any legislation in this area be workable 
 the current national guideline on school transport mean that child who live less than mile from school do not get any support in government funding in my constituency that mean that some of the most deprived kid either have to walk an hour and a half a day to and from school or their already struggle family have to find the money for their transport will the minister meet i to talk about this and see whether the mile limit can be change

 carers trust estimate that child in every classroom across the uk be young carer yet of school say that they have no young carer on their roll what step be the department take to address that 
 we have recently require all school to provide that datum so that we can find out where the young carer be and ensure that they gain the support that they need through the child ’s framework they can have an assessment alongside their parent i be happy to speak far on this matter 
 i welcome the budget last week in which the chancellor confirm the recruitment of teacher will the secretary of state please confirm how those extra teacher include specialist teacher will be recruit and how issue such as workload working condition and support for the training and development of new and exist teacher and school support staff will be address

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if he will make a statement on the implication of the budget for farming community 
 i welcome the right hon gentleman to his place he will make an excellent chair of the select committee on environment food and rural affairs and thank he for the opportunity to talk about this important issue 
 as the minister for food security i can assure the house that food security be national security the government ’s commitment to support farmer and rural community be unwavere we have commit £ in the agricultural budget over the next year the big ever budget for sustainable food production and nature recovery in our country ’s history we be also release £ to support farmer whose farm have be devastate by severe flooding and invest £ to protect the nation from potential disease outbreak that threaten our farming industry food security and human health 
 however as we be all only too aware the conservatives leave behind a £ black hole in our nation ’s finances—[interruption yes you do and this government have have to take tough decision on tax welfare and spending to fix the foundation and deliver change include a series of decision on tax to protect the payslip of work people that be possible only by make change to other taxis such as agricultural property relief which be previously available to all agricultural property at a rate of currently small farm can find themselves face the same level of tax bill as much large farm despite have a much small asset per cent of agricultural property relief be claim by the top be claim by the top that be not fair it be not sustainable and sadly it have be use in some case by wealthy landowner to avoid inheritance tax that be why the government have announce plan to reform agricultural property relief 
 the secretary of state meet national farmers union president tom bradshaw this morning we absolutely understand—[interruption 
 order dr mullan i hear you before and i be certainly not put up with it this time if you want to leave do so now because i want to be able to hear other do we understand each other 
 indicate assent 
 thank you carry on minister 
 the secretary of state meet tom bradshaw this morning we completely understand farmer anxiety about the change but rural community need a well nhs affordable housing and public transport and we can provide that if we make the system fairer   the reform to agricultural property relief mean that farmer can access relief for the £ and relief thereafter an effective tax rate that mean that an individual can pass up to £ and a couple up to £ between they to a direct descendant inheritance tax free currently of agricultural property relief claim 
 order i do not know whether you be aware minister but you only have minute how long will you be now be you come to the end at this minute 
 in second 
 marvellous come on then 
 per cent of agricultural property relief claim be for less than £ the vast majority of farmer will not be affect they will be able to pass the family farm down to their child just as previous generation have always do it be a fair and balanced approach that protect family farm while also fix the public service that those same family rely on it be part of a budget that will restore economic stability and begin a decade of national renewal 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 i remind the house of my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 thank you mr speaker for allow this urgent question i also thank the minister for his statement but i fear that it illustrate rather well some of the lack of understanding that have bring we to this point more than any other industry farming relie on stability and long term planning that be why many people in the industry rely on undertaking give by the secretary of state when in opposition that the labour party in government would not change inheritance tax relief for farming 
 every farming business be capital rich but revenue poor those business also trade in a market that have be more heavily influence by government intervention than any other agricultural property relief be not a loophole it have be a deliberate policy of successive government for the past year design to avoid the sale and break up of family farm be that still a goal to which this government adhere as the nfu put it the government have seemingly fail to grasp 
 that family farm be not just small farm and that just because a farm be a valuable asset it do not mean those who work it be wealthy 
 as the minister will be aware some of the figure he have just give the house have be vigorously challenge over the past few day particularly the assertion that only in british farm will be affect will the minister and his treasury colleague publish the datum behind those figure in particular do the figure that of farm will not be affect rely on the inclusion of very small holding 
 these change will have a ripple effect across the whole rural community will the government publish their impact assessment for other rural business can the minister also explain why the treasury have remove   the ringfence around farm support to be spend in scotland wales and northern ireland that ringfence be introduce after the bew review if it need a review to introduce it how can it just be abolish now out of the blue 
 the prime minister have say in the past and the minister have repeat today that food security be national security can the minister point to measure in this budget that make achieve that aim easy rather than hard 
 i thank the right hon member for his question which be serious and important as would expect let i start by point out that until this relief do not exist the system have exist before and people have operate differently although i accept it have be different for the past year 
 turn to the figure i encourage people to reach for the detail to look at the actual figure the only thing we can go on be the claim and the figure come from the treasury on claim for the last year available absolutely reflect that figure the right hon gentleman raise an important point about the ringfence that point be under discussion but i have make assurance that the devolve administration will be closely inform about and involve in what happen these be important point and they should be treat seriously 
 i do not really care for the high profile voice that we have get attack a labour government but i do care about the family farm in my constituency i know that the minister care for those farm as well as do the prime minister i welcome the figure we have be give however those figure do need to be translate to our family farmer they need to see what it be like on the ground i would welcome a meeting with nfu cymru and the minister to discuss what thing be go to look like for farmer especially in gower and the rest of wales where there be a completely different landscape 
 i thank my hon friend for her contribution can i say how much i enjoy visit wales with the welsh minister very early in my tenure it be an important sign from this government that we take farming seriously across the entire united kingdom 
 i share my hon friend ’s very strong point about the importance of the family farm what we be do here be protect the family farm i have visit right around the country over the past year and on almost every visit people have tell i that they be concerned about people come from outside they often say up london or down london”—with a lot of money and buy up local farmland over the head of local people not because they care about farming but to use that farmland for tax evasion purpose this policy can be helpful to family farm and protect they against—[interruption the hon gentleman on the opposition front bench say from a sedentary position that it will not but it be people from his area who have be tell i about these problem they repeat they constantly when we be in opposition and here be a labour government do something about it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 mr speaker 
 lose a farm be not like lose any other business it can not   come back 
 those be not my word but the word of our prime minister at the national farmers union conference just last year over the weekend we have hear gut wrench story from farmer up and down the nation who feel completely and utterly betray by the measure in this budget i ask the minister why do the secretary of state continue to say that he be proud of his family farm tax do the minister realise that the vast majority of farming family be not multimillionaire most be cash poor and many be struggle to break even how do the secretary of state expect farmer in his word to do—[interruption 
 order can i just say to   the hon member for east thanet ms billington   that i do not need any chuntering do we understand 
 how do the secretary of state expect farmer to do more with less why be he happy to hand our next generation of farmer an impossible tax bill 
 next the government claim that small family farmer will be protect yet the country land and business association and the nfu have today dispute the government ’s figure will the minister commit to release a full assessment of his policy include an impact on national food security 
 while the change to inheritance tax relief have be gain the national headline there be many other negative impact on farming business from the budget increase national insurance contribution couple with a low national threshold an accelerated reduction in de link payment rate high taxis on double cab pick up vehicle new taxis on fertiliser i could go on but this all beg the question do   the right hon member for streatham and croydon north steve reed   actually know anything about farming at all more importantly after the secretary of state look british farmer in the eye and specifically promise they that there would be no change to agricultural property relief how on earth can farmer believe a single word that his minister be about to say 
 i be very grateful to the hon gentleman for promote i to secretary of state i hope he have similar success in the come hour 
 the hon gentleman raise a whole series of question he ask again as other have about other element in the budget the figure be absolutely there they be publish by the treasury and be there for all to read they be the fact on the estate that have make claim on agricultural property relief in the last year available interruption they be there for everyone to see it be not difficult it be not complicated they be there 
 something that perhaps have not be say but which should be be that there be many call to reflect the change way in which farming operate by include environmental land management scheme within the scope of agricultural property relief i hear nothing from opposition front benchers about that do they not understand the way in which british farming be change 
 many farmer in my constituency of hastings and rye be feel the impact of year of conservative failure in particular they have face many challenge   with flooding can the minister tell i what step we have take in the budget to protect small family farm and how we will continue to support farmer face flooding 
 i be grateful to my hon friend because she make some important point ahead of the budget there be lot of prediction about what would happen of course what happen be that this government have protect the farming budget indeed raise it and we be absolutely committed to pay out to farmer the £ that they deserve for flooding that be £ of course that be not really budget for by the conservatives as part of their £ black hole the difference between we and they be that we be take a responsible approach which mean that farmer can look forward to a stable future as oppose to the chaos of the last decade 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 farmer across the united kingdom be cop with the linger legacy of betrayal betrayal from the trade deal that happen under the last government which throw they under a bus and betrayal from the transition from the old payment scheme to the new which see many of they go bust or force into make business decision that they would never ever have choose that legacy of betrayal be that hang heavy and it be why farmer in my constituency and elsewhere feel so utterly disappoint by this government ’s budget last week 
 let we look at the agricultural property relief change there be farm in cumbria and in my constituency affect by this have the minister do an investigation into the number of farmer who be live on less than the minimum wage each year in term of income but who have a property that will be affect by these change particularly give the decrease in farm income under the conservative government over the last year will he also assess the impact on tenant farmer some of my farmer be tenant and will be affect by the disruption that this change will create would it not be wise for he to implement the rock review of tenant protection before introduce something like this will he also look again at the £ budget and increase it by £ just as the liberal democrats suggest if we do not feed ourselves we be a fail country
