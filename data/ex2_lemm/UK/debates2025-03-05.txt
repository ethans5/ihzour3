the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the government ’s defence spending plan on scotland 
 i be sure that the whole house will wish to pay tribute to the artist jack vettriano who sadly die this week he be the son of a methil miner who teach himself to paint and our country be a little less colourful for his passing 
 may i express my thank to you mr speaker and to member throughout the house for the many kind word follow the birth of my daughter loïs she be bear at home hour before the midwife could arrive so i suppose it could be say that i be deliver for scotland a number of member have ask i consistently how i be cop with the tear snotter and tantrum but i remind they that i have be on paternity leave so have not have time to keep up with scottish national party selection drama 
 it have be an historic week for our country i know that the people of scotland stand with ukraine and will recognise the importance of the government ’s decision to increase defence spending to of gdp the prime minister ’s leadership on the world stage should be a source of pride for all who value britain ’s role as a defender of democracy and a partner for european peace scotland have never be more ready to play its part in defend the uk and our ally 
 scotland ’s world class defence industry will play a key role in rebuild britain ’s military capability and during my visit to babcock at rosyth i see at hand how defence spending benefit scotland ’s small and medium sized enterprise however investment in scotland ’s defence smes lag far behind that in the rest of the united kingdom account for just of the total spending of the ministry of defence largely owe to the hostile environment create by the scottish national party how be the secretary of state work with the mod and scotland ’s defence industry to unleash scotland ’s sme and enhance our nation ’s defence capability 
 i thank the hon gentleman for the cross party support for the prime minister ’s action on ukraine and indeed defence scotland need all its political leader to stand up proudly for our defence   industry scotland have lead the uk in defence and have be home to its nuclear deterrent since the 1960 i recently host a defence industry roundtable to discuss sector priority and opportunity and as part of our brand scotland programme i have discuss those in norway and south east asia i welcome the prime minister ’s announcement of new sme spend target for defence which will boost access to uk defence investment unlock new job in the process 
 do the secretary of state agree that the snp ’s reckless pledge to scrap our nuclear deterrent at faslane threaten our national security at a time of significant international volatility the minister have say that trident be of 
 no tangible or realistic benefit 
 to our current security challenge do the secretary of state share my view that that stance be fundamentally naive and demonstrate that the snp can not be trust with scotland ’s future 
 indeed the minister be all over the place on defence he have suggest that we should increase the of of gdp by scrap trident but that be already include in the so it would make no difference whatsoever the snp be not credible at all when it come to defence in scotland and i urge every member of every party in the house to get behind the prime minister in our national interest 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to implement the policy in the make work pay plan in scotland 
 the employment rights bill represent the big upgrade of worker right in a generation ban hour contract end unscrupulous fire and rehire practice provide day protection for paternity leave and against unfair dismissal and improve access to statutory sick pay with international women ’s day fast approach we should remember that it be work woman who will benefit disproportionately from this groundbreaking legislation that be what change look like and that be the difference that a labour government make 
 resident throughout my constituency welcome the improvement in worker right but parent be greatly concerned about the impact of the grow gap in attainment in scottish school between the rich and the poor and what it mean for their child ’s ability to find their job this week i have be inundate with comment from parent who be worried about the recent audit scotland report on support for child with additional need it be a disgraceful report can the minister assure i that she will use whatever influence she have to ensure that the scottish government make education a priority 
 my hon friend be right to raise the concern of parent who be worried about how their kid will get good job the snp have say that a zero- hour contract be a positive destination for a school   leaver but this labour government will ban such exploitative contract labour ’s budget deliver an extra £ for scottish public service but after year the snp still do not see scottish kid as a priority it should stand aside and give scotland the chance of the new direction that it deserve 
 i thank the minister for her response but more importantly i thank   the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur   for set the scene he have clearly explain the importance of have child and the importance of their have opportunity with those opportunity in mind have the minister have a chance to discuss with the equivalent minister in the northern ireland assembly how we can well help our child in northern ireland as she wish to do in scotland 
 i have not have that chance but i would be delighted to do so scottish education be of course devolve to the snp government snp members should think long and hard about the fact that they have claim that it be their no priority and yet the attainment gap be grow working class kid education and exam result be explicitly downgrade by the serve minister we would be delighted to partner with anyone across these island who want to increase educational opportunity for our young people 
 what step his department be take to support economic growth in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on support economic growth in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on support economic growth in scotland

 the scotland office be play a key role in drive economic growth in scotland ensure that our new industrial strategy work for scotland and secure harland wolff ’s future to protect hundred of job in arnish and methil and i lead the cross government ministerial taskforce to secure £ from the national wealth fund for grangemouth over the next year the uk government will directly invest £ in local growth project in scotland from the v&a in dundee and the town centre of elgin to a freeport on the forth and local travel in paisley our plan for change will bring growth to every part of scotland 
 the formal redundancy consultation process start last week for laboratory and store at the grangemouth site with emergency response and other share service consultation also about to start the redundancy be due to petroineos serve notice to end share service contract because of the imminent refinery closure the prime minister have announce a    support package guarantee worker income for month will the secretary of state reassure the share service worker who be about to lose their job at the grangemouth site because of the refinery closure that they too will be eligible for the package of income guarantee and for reskille support from forth valley college 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue in the house and for protect worker in his constituency the uk government be fully commit to seek a sustainable industrial future for grangemouth and all its worker follow the work of the scotland office lead taskforce the prime minister announce that the national wealth fund will provide £ of investment for the grangemouth site the uk government work with the scottish government be provide a training guarantee for all staff at the refinery to support they into good job and my hon friend will be pleased to hear that unite the union have welcome the funding and say that the package 
 safeguard scotland ’s energy security and deliver the job of the future 
 the defence sector contribute £ to the scottish economy and scotland ’s contribution keep we all safe the prime minister have announce increase spending in our country which also mean more investment in scotland high industrial production and high income do the secretary of state agree that this show the difference a labour government make both south and north of the border 
 the prime minister be absolutely right when he say that the responsibility of this government be to protect our national security and keep our citizen safe the last time that defence spending be at of gdp be under the last labour government 
 scotland be a leader in the defence industry just this week i have the pleasure of visit jfd in renfrew which work with the royal navy to design manufacture and operate world class submarine rescue system from babcock and bae systems to small business and start up i be determined that scotland lead the way in build our military industrial base 
 give that the defence sector already support more than job in scotland as well as hundred in harlow do the secretary of state agree that the government ’s commitment to increase defence spending will also help to grow scotland ’s economy and create more skilled job 
 for year the defence sector in scotland have be at the forefront of create skilled well pay job despite the snp ’s refusal to stand up and back uk defence this week be scottish apprenticeship week and i hope that those on both side of the house particularly member from scotland will join i in pay tribute to scotland ’s wonderful defence sector apprentice who do a great job at not just keep our country safe but help our economy grow and build the skill base of scotland ’s future 
 a proper industrial strategy be key to economic growth which be why industry have be ask for support for many year my constituent in newcastle under lyme be fail by the tories and the people of   scotland have be fail by the snp since can the minister set out what work the scotland office have do to ensure that a new national industrial strategy deliver for scotland as well as for the good people of newcastle under lyme 
 the scottish government and snp members seem to think that defend the defence industry be do on twitter this government inherit not just a fiscal crisis but an industrial because we have have well over year without a clear industrial strategy i be pleased recently to meet the chair of the industrial strategy advisory council and i welcome my right hon friend the business secretary to scotland last month to meet business leader at the forefront of scotland ’s industrial future this government have already deliver among other thing £ for grangemouth £ for the v&a in dundee and job security for skilled worker at harland wolff ’s shipyard in methil and arnish just this morning we announce £ for the cromarty green freeport to expand its capability for float offshore wind that be the commitment to growth that this government make to the country 
 the snp government continue to be oppose to nuclear energy despite the huge economic benefit it would bring to scotland we can see that in the job and investment that the torness power station generate do the secretary of state agree with i that invest in nuclear would help bring down bill for our consumer help the environment and create many more job 
 i could not agree more with the hon gentleman our nuclear policy in scotland should allow we to have nuclear power to bring down bill and give we energy security of course he be also right that the snp be against nuclear power in scotland but very happy to take the baseload from england 
 the scotch whisky industry be central to the economic growth of scotland and i be very pleased to hear from the dispatch box yesterday that the department for environment food and rural affairs be not move forward with its consultation on single malt however can the secretary of state explain why we be in that position in the place what discussion be have between defra and the scotland office before that consultation be open 
 i agree with the hon lady about the commitment give by the chief secretary to the treasury at the dispatch box yesterday and i reiterate that the only watering down of whisky in scotland will be the little bit of water that some put in to taste 
 the secretary of state will be well aware of the manifold range of family own business in scotland many of which be very large and trade with multimillion pound balance sheet every year the chancellor ’s move to change the rule on business property relief threaten at good these business be sell off to plcs and at bad their be liquidate to pay their liability to his majesty ’s revenue and customs what assessment have   the scotland office make of the potentially catastrophic implication for scottish enterprise of the bpr change in train from the treasury 
 it seem to i that snp members decide when they come back to the house in july to defend the conservative government ’s economic record we inherit a £ black hole and when the chancellor come to the dispatch box for the budget she have to fill that black hole and end austerity it be what we promise and it deliver £ to the scottish budget which the hon gentleman ’s party be intent on spend this be the key point snp members in this house have object to every single measure in that budget but they be very happy to spend the money 
 if the secretary of state want to help economic growth in scotland i suggest he look at oil and gas end the licensing of domestic production which will not make the slight difference to how much we consume will lead to the loss of ten of thousand of jobs—35,000 job and billion of pound in tax revenue and we will then import oil and gas with high embed emission the secretary of state know that that be crazy he can not say so publicly at the dispatch box but can he use his good office to persuade his fellow cabinet member that this be not a sensible course for scotland 
 this government back the oil and gas industry in scotland we have consistently say that oil and gas will be with we for decade to come but that sit beside our national mission to get to clean power by it be a mission we should all be back not just for the job of the future but to bring down people ’s bill 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i add my congratulation to those of many other on the birth of the secretary of state ’s child recently 
 i read with some interest that the leader of the scottish labour party be consider publish a league table to rank the performance of his scottish labour mps i will not ask the secretary of state to say where he think he may sit in that table but i will ask about job and the economy specifically in relation to the energy industry 
 as a direct result of the eco zealotry emanating from the secretary of state for energy security and net the increase in the energy profit levy the ban on new licence and the refusal even to defend the issuing of licence to rosebank and jackdaw there will be a reduction in the total economic value of the oil and gas sector of £ over the next year with direct job at risk can the secretary of state tell the house as scotland ’s man in the cabinet the man on whom we all rely to make scotland ’s case and to act in scotland ’s interest whether he have make any overture to his beleaguered colleague at the department for energy security and net or indeed to the treasury to stop this madness 
 the shadow secretary of state will know that the government be work very hard after the finch decision and the decision around rosebank in term of oil and gas he ask i to answer the question about where scottish labour mps would rank in the table scottish labour mp be in the premier league he be in the sunday league interruption 
 as my right hon friend   the member for central devon mel stride   say there be nothing wrong with sunday league just as the secretary of state and scottish labour be silent on gender recognition and just as he and scottish labour be silent on tax family business and farm out of existence he and scottish labour be silent on the loss of an entire industry and its workforce which will decimate the north east of scotland and impact the entire uk economy if he and his scottish labour colleague be not stand up for scotland ’s interest scottish worker and scottish industry can he tell i just what be the point of scottish labour 
 this government be fully commit to economic growth as i have say the prime minister have say and the chancellor have consistently say oil and gas will be with we for decade to come we support the industry we be work through the issue that have arise from the legal case the shadow secretary of state reference our clean power mission by will create job create economic growth low bill and give we energy security for the future 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 if economic growth in scotland be to succeed our world class university the knowledge the skill and the job they provide will be absolutely vital last week edinburgh university announce that it face a £ deficit which be project to be the large in the uk that be hugely concern for my constituent and i be sure also for the secretary of state the principal cite several issue include the national insurance change this morning visit university tell scottish mp that they also have fund concern they cite the immigration law in this country as a disincentive what be the government go to do to stop further damage to this vital sector inhibit economic growth 
 scottish university punch above their weight internationally they be of the jewel in the crown of the scottish economy and of the scottish and uk education system of course edinburgh university be the good university in the world the house would expect i to say that as the mp in edinburgh and as an alumnus let we not hide from the fact i say this gently to the hon lady that part of the big funding challenge for the university be the lack of funding from the scottish government because high education be devolve i will follow that up by very gently say again that she say she do not want anything in the budget that raise fund but she want to spend it 
 i join other in congratulate the secretary of state on the birth of his daughter that be gain from labour that even the snp can endorse 
 of the most important area that business have identify for growth be a more scotland specific approach to migration that be tout by scottish labour in its manifesto and by its leader but it be shoot down by the uk government in no time at all go the same way as the women against state pension inequality campaign child poverty commitment and the winter fuel payment commitment if the uk government will not listen to scotland ’s labour leader why should anybody else 
 i be very surprised the hon gentleman do not take the opportunity to apologise for his twitter ranting at the weekend on foreign policy with regard to the prime minister he say 
 the uk have leave itself in an utterly isolate position 
 i think the hon gentleman leave himself in an utterly isolate position 
 this government be completely committed to economic growth and to transform life in scotland we be already see the fruit of that in the scottish context i ask the snp either to get behind that or to give scotland a new direction and get out of the way 
 if the secretary of state have bother to read in more depth he would have see that i be say something that he once agree with leave the eu have leave we more isolated he once agree with i about that before he go into government but then he agree with i on other thing before he go into government such as tackle fuel poverty and tackle child poverty be the secretary of state no long worried about those issue and more worried about league table be he more worried about be in the relegation zone do you know what be really interesting mr speaker throughout all of this not once have he stand up for his leader that make i think that we should not listen to his leader because labour members be not listen to their leader any more 
 sorry mr speaker i lose the thread of that question about halfway through but thing i do take from it be that it be absolutely identical to the question from the tory shadow secretary of state that tell you all you need to know 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of change to employer national insurance contribution on level of employment in scotland 
 economic growth be the government ’s no mission these change to national insurance contribution be be make in the context of a resilient labour market with the estimate employment rate up percentage point over the last quarter of we be create job and opportunity through our plan for change and truly make work pay to help raise living standard right across the uk 
 the labour government ’s decision to hike national insurance be a cost on business before they even open their door i have speak to many business across my constituency in recent month and all have say how worried they be about the change in response to my recent business survey large business say   that it be now look to cut up to job because of the nic change and that it be beyond belief that the labour government have decide to do this give that this example will be replicate in constituency across scotland include the minister ’s can she really stand at the dispatch box and say she believe in this policy which so directly hit job employment and growth across scotland 
 i do believe in this policy in the same way i believe in all the announcement we make in the budget as be so often the case with conservative members they will the end of the budget but not the mean if the hon lady want change to the public service that people in both our constituency rely on we need to have the revenue to pay for they that be what this budget be all about clean up the mess we inherit and get the investment into public service that be so desperately require 
 as we know of the good way to grow employment in scotland be through apprenticeship a few week ago this uk labour government announce change to apprenticeship in england that will allow business to work more closely with college and other skill provider to ensure there be a job at the end of apprenticeship in scotland meanwhile all we see be stagnation in skill policy which be reduce opportunity for young people in my constituency and across the country will the minister make every effort to press the scottish government to properly reform apprenticeship in scotland and give young people and other the opportunity they need and deserve 
 i certainly will i pay tribute to my hon friend for all he do to promote apprentice and skill and particularly apprentice in our defence industry who be do so much to keep scotland the uk and indeed the world safe 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the secretary of state say that the question just ask be similar well we do not get an answer on either of our attempt so i might try on farming scotland ’s beef sector be at the heart of scottish agriculture with of the country ’s agricultural land grazing land yet domestic beef production level be set to reduce by with a increase in import expect to meet our forecast demand it be clear that this government ’s tax change could not come at a bad time for scotland ’s farmer will the minister please stand up for scotland ’s farmer and make the case to stop this madness 
 the hon gentleman be perfectly aware that of agricultural property relief claim each year be for less than £ so almost quarter of those claim the relief be expect to be entirely unaffected accord to the late datum from his majesty ’s revenue and customs of apr be claim by just of estate make claim mean that just estate across the uk be claim more than £ in relief in farmer will still be able to pass down their farm to future generation just as they always have do 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of change to employer national insurance contribution on business in scotland 
 properly fund public service and restore economic stability require difficult decision on tax which be why we be ask employer to contribute more stabilise the public finance be the only way to create the long term stability in which business can thrive the government recognise the need to protect the small business which be why we have more than double the employment allowance to £ mean that more than half of small business will either gain or be unaffected 
 a constituent have tell i about of their client which be a care home owner that be face an increase in operating cost of £ a year as a result of the national insurance contribution increase most of the business ’s care staff work part time which suit their family circumstance however for each part time member of staff the business must pay an additional £ a year as a result of the change to the national insurance contribution threshold in the government ’s october budget in mid dunbartonshire and across the uk there be grow demand for social care what will the government do to help business in the care sector that have be hit by these increase staffing cost at a time of significant rise 
 i be sure that the hon member and member across the house will join i in pay tribute to scotland ’s social care worker for the incredible contribution they make social care be of course a devolved matter the scottish government have now receive the large budget settlement in the whole history of devolution as well as support for additional employer national insurance cost the scottish government can choose to deliver that additional support for social care and i very much hope that they do so 
 the impact of net change in the budget be £ more for scotland that be record funding to invest in our nhs protect the success of devolution and fix our local service but the scottish government have squander the latter opportunity by continue to underfund our council leave falkirk council with a £ hole to plug after year of snp control do the minister agree that the £ secure for scotland by the labour government could have be use to fix local government but instead the snp   have choose to leave the people of falkirk to pick up   the bill 
 not only do i agree with my hon friend that the snp government be at risk of squander this historic opportunity for scotland but i stress that the snp government might like to ask their member of parliament why they vote against this historic budget in scotland ’s interest 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday march 
 tomorrow mark year since young british soldier be on patrol in afghanistan when their vehicle be strike by an explosive tragically kill they all sergeant nigel coupe be corporal jake hartley be private anthony frampton be private daniel wade be private daniel wilford be and private christopher kershaw be just a teenager tomorrow also mark the anniversary of the death of benjamin reddy a year old serve with commando royal marines who be kill in helmand province in these man fight and die for their country our country across the war in afghanistan and iraq individual die fight for britain alongside our ally many more be wound we will never forget their bravery and their sacrifice i know that the whole house will join with i in remember they and all those who serve our country hon member hear hear 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 the prime minister have rightly make growth his key mission but can he outline for my constituent in southampton test how our employment rights bill will not only deliver improvement for they but put more money in their pocket as part of our plan for change 
 i thank my hon friend who be do a fantastic job for her constituent the employment rights bill be the big upgrade to worker right in a generation and will benefit more than worker in every corner of the country it will tackle low pay poor condition and poor job security that hold our country back it be pro worker pro business and pro growth 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 division between ukraine and the us only serve vladimir putin president zelensky be right to try to rebuild his relationship with president trump he be keep a cool head under very difficult circumstance and i be glad to see president trump receive his letter positively what be the prime minister do to help rebuild their relationship after a challenging week 
 the right hon member be absolutely right we need to do everything we can to ensure that the us europe and ukraine be work together on last peace i be do everything that i can to play my part in that and i be in regular contact with all of the key player at the moment include talk to president zelensky yesterday afternoon 
 i thank the prime minister for that answer all of we in this house know that the british armed force be a huge source of pride to our country   they put themselves in harm ’s way to defend our value as the opposition we support effort to resolve the conflict but we can not write a blank cheque if british peacekeeping troop in ukraine be attack whether directly or via proxy we could be draw into conflict with russia can the prime minister reassure all those who be concerned about the uk be draw into war 
 yes that be the last thing anybody want to see the whole point of ensure that there be a last peace and that any deal if there be a deal be defend be to avoid conflict so that we do have peace the way to ensure that we have peace be to ensure that there be guarantee for any deal that be in place because the sure risk that there will be conflict be if putin think that he can breach any deal that may be arrive at 
 the prime minister be quite right and we on the opposition side of the house agree with he the objective for his visit to washington be to get that us security guarantee for ukraine and i commend his effort in that very difficult task none the less on monday the united states withdraw military aid for ukraine can he update the house on the step he be take to persuade america that it be also in its national interest to provide a security guarantee 
 i be pleased to inform the house that on thursday of last week we do discuss security guarantee the president make absolutely clear his commitment to article of nato make absolutely clear that he would have our back because of the relationship between our party and agree that our team would sit down together to talk through security guarantee i have speak to he i think time since then on the telephone because it be vitally important that we work with the us with europe and with ukraine and ensure that if there be a deal it have proper security guarantee in place 
 i know that the prime minister be unable to comment on specific intelligence matter and i be certainly not ask he to do that however there be concern report that the united states have instruct britain to suspend intelligence sharing with ukraine and there be other report that eye itself may be at risk we need to ensure that america do not disengage there be some in the house who argue that europe should go it alone but do he agree with i that without this country ’s great ally any peace agreement would place a terrible burden on britain and our taxpayer 
 i agree wholeheartedly that be why as in the debate we have just day ago i have always be clear that we need to ensure that the us the uk europe and ukraine be work together but we must not choose between the us and europe we never have historically and we be not go to do so now 
 i thank the prime minister for his comment on that he will know that it be not just the security situation that worry people they be also concerned about trade war and the economic impact of tariff such as those level on canada and mexico yesterday the good way to avoid america put tariff   on britain be to reach agreement on a trade deal follow the prime minister ’s trip to washington have talk on a uk us trade deal begin 
 i be pleased that in the meeting last week we do discuss an economic deal and agree that our team would indeed sit down rapidly to talk through a deal that be what they be do as the right hon lady rightly say that be far well than get draw into conflict in relation to tariff 
 i be glad that the prime minister have confirm that those talk have start people across our country be worried worried about national security worry about whether we can equip our military fast enough and worry about whether we will deploy troop in ukraine and whether we will be able to keep the peace they be also worried about our economic security can we afford all this 
 the world be change fast and we need an entirely new approach to our economy and our energy security the budget last year halt growth with high taxis and high borrowing yesterday farmer be protest in whitehall again people be hurt will the prime minister now change course so we can have the economic security that we know we need for our national security 
 we be do so well laughter what we inherit be insecurity in our economy we inherit a £ black hole and we have now turn that around we have get the high investment come into our economy we have get wage high than price and interest rate have be cut time that be the difference between stability with labour and instability with the conservative party 
 i commend the prime minister for the decisive leadership that he have show in europe and at home to bolster our collective security the £ increase in defence spending have be very much welcome in my constituency will the prime minister outline how that increase in defence spending will boost job and growth in place such as stevenage and will he join i in visit some of my constituency ’s business 
 our plan for change be build on national security and that have to go hand in hand with economic security as we return to for the time since the last labour government that investment must mean uk skill uk job and uk apprenticeship i be very pleased that on monday we be able to announce a new hub and new spending target to help small and medium sized enterprise access the supply chain which will boost economic growth that will be really important in so many constituency and of course i will consider my hon friend ’s invitation 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 yesterday i visit kingston ’s army reserve centre and meet member of the royal army medical service who have serve bravely in iraq and afghanistan so i associate myself with the prime minister ’s initial remark 
 on monday the prime minister rightly say that a mineral deal only be not a sufficient security guarantee for ukraine the trump administration have since say that a mineral deal be the only guarantee on the table and president trump have remove military aid from ukraine and say that the british can not share american intelligence with kyiv both those decision mean that more brave ukrainians will die while far embolden vladimir putin will the prime minister tell the house whether he still believe that president trump be a reliable ally if ukraine do not get a sufficient security guarantee from the white house what be the prime minister ’s plan b 
 we work very closely with the united states on defence security and intelligence as we have do for many many year we be intertwine and of course they be a reliable ally we be operate on that basis day in day out across the world as the right hon gentleman know 
 in relation to the situation as it develop obviously our only focus be on a last peace in ukraine there be many move part and there be many discussion to be have what i be do be stay focused on what i think be the single most important outcome a last peace in ukraine which be good for ukraine and for europe and of course essential for the united kingdom 
 the prime minister know that we all support he in that effort but may i take he back to president trump ’s reliability british woman have accuse andrew tate of rape and human trafficking british police have issue arrest warrant the tates have try to escape justice to romania and now to the united states i be delighted that florida have thankfully open a criminal investigation do the prime minister agree that people who be want by british police for such appalling crime should stand trial in our country give his assessment that president trump really be a reliable ally will his government request an urgent extradition of the tate brother 
 this be a live issue as the right hon gentleman will appreciate and therefore i will tread carefully the principle be absolutely clear justice must be do in all case include in this case but i will not go into the detail because this be a live case as he know 
 i be support many parent in exeter who be struggle to get the support they need for their child within the special educational need and disability system run by devon county council parent tell i that their child be excel but after undergo major surgery she need additional support to get back into a mainstream school setting that have not be possible due to the disarray of the send system in devon and that child be now miss out i welcome the new money go to the system will the prime minister provide an update on government work that will also reform the send system to ensure that every child in exeter have the good start in life 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this familiar topic we inherit a send system that fail to meet the need of child and family that be why we be invest £ in send   alongside £ for council to improve inclusivity and expertise in mainstream school and to ensure that special school can cater for child with the most complex need we be work closely with partner in devon to deliver an accelerated progress plan and we have deploy send adviser to offer support to the local authority 
 by cosye up to putin trump be make europe less safe we all recognise the need for europe to adapt germany be change its fiscal rule to boost investment in defence and infrastructure and create a € fund to strengthen its future will the prime minister please consider a similar approach focus on strategic investment rather than impose further hardship on the poor through cut to welfare and international aid 
 as the right hon lady know it be important that if we be to increase defence spending as we be and to have that fully cost and fully fund we need to put that plan before the house which be what i do last week she talk about fiscal rule and funding but i have to say that it be highly regrettable that plaid cymru vote against £ to fund public service in wales she need to explain how that help her constituent and the people of wales 
 this year mark year since the swann report expose systemic racism and discrimination in the education system regrettably none of its recommendation be recommend of the most damning injustice in the report be the misclassification of mainly black child as educationally subnormal as identify in steve mcqueen ’s bbc documentary give the historic nature of this and the impact it have on so many will   the prime minister consider a public inquiry to   provide justice and recompense for those who have be affect 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this really important issue all child and young people must be treat fairly and there be no place for hate or prejudice in our education system i will ensure that she get a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss this far 
 this week president trump have end military aid to ukraine reportedly ban the uk from share us intelligence with ukraine and be now seek to lift sanction on russia to appease vladimir putin a murderous lie dictator regrettably it be clear that for now the us can no long be rely upon for security and peace in europe so will the prime minister provide leadership to our ally by urgently make the decision to be the leader to release seize russian state asset to ukraine under the established principle of international law so that putin must pay as the aggressor 
 on the question of asset we be use the interest on the asset to help fund ukraine and we be look with other at whether it be possible to go far obviously i will update the house if that be possible but i have to say that at a time when defence   and security in europe and the uk must be ramp up for all the reason that the hon gentleman readily understand the snp maintain its position of want to get rid of the single most effective deterrent that we have the nuclear deterrent really have to be explain in its historical context 
 labour be roll out free breakfast club in primary school start with school include scapegoat hill junior and infant school in my constituency under the tories only in school have these club labour will make they available for all child that will help to break down barrier to opportunity for every child i know that the prime minister be as determined as i be to tear away the link between background and success so will he update the house on how we will do that through labour ’s plan for change 
 labour promise free breakfast club in every primary school and the will open in april give every child the good start in life through our plan for change it will also put up to £ a year back in the pocket of work family i be delighted to say that of the breakfast club will be open in the constituency of the leader of the opposition in april and i hope she will welcome they when they do

 i do not doubt the aspiration of all parent for their child what we have be able to do be ensure that we release the funding to ensure that our state secondary school have the teacher they need there be no point the conservatives pretend that they be interested in state education when they leave they without the teacher they need

 week ago the northern ireland coroner accuse british soldier of unlawful killing after they engage with ira would be murderer after careful reading as far as i can see that judgment be base on no evidence whatsoever more than special force soldier have be summon before those inquiry not ira leader have be summon in the same way soldier who serve our country with honour heroism and skill be be punish in their decline year for do nothing but carry out their patriotic duty in the face of enormous risk give how the prime minister open his comment with which i associate myself do he not think that he and his government have a duty to protect those soldier from such partisan parody of justice in their decline year 
 on the coroner ’s ruling i have not see the detail i be afraid so i can not comment on the broad point it be right that we should protect those who serve our country wherever they serve our country get the balance right be critical i do not think that the legislation put forward by the conservative government achieve that but i believe none the less that in the interest of everybody in northern ireland of all those who serve and all those who be victim we need to renew our effort to find a way forward on this important issue 
 my constituent in hastings rye and the village be feed up with the constant failure of southern water dump sewage in our sea flooding and leave we without water for day all while take huge bonus we on the environment food and rural affairs committee have be haul in the water boss by and hear about their failure the boss of southern water finally agree to give my constituent million in compensation for a major water outage will the prime minister tell i how the labour government be crack down on the bad behaviour of the water industry 
 i applaud my hon friend for her dedicated work on the environment food and rural affairs committee and in her constituency last week our water special measures act become law it give new power to ban the payment of bonus for pollute water boss and bring criminal charge against lawbreaker we be determined to fix our break water system after year of company pump sewage into our waterway and infrastructure not keep pace with demand 
 i pay tribute to the prime minister for his effort to bring europe together to ensure that we work to restore peace in ukraine the war in ukraine have also demonstrate the need for great food security and strong supply chain but if the government force our farmer to sell their land because of the divisive family farm tax they will undermine that ahead of the spring statement will he think that policy through again and seek to end it national security need food security farming and farmer 
 we put a record amount into farming in the budget—£5 we have set out our road map for farming which have be welcome by the national farmers union as the right hon lady know the vast majority of farm will not be affect by the provision that we be put in place 
 for month my constituent in doncaster east and the isle of axholme have be tell i how feed up they be with not be able to get an appointment because of the am scramble the last thing they need when they be ill be to have to pick up the phone and wait and fight again to be it be great news that the government ’s new gp contract will start to resolve that but can the prime minister reassure my constituent who can not use technology that they will still be able to book an appointment 
 last week for the time in year the british medical association agree the gp contract with the government worth an extra £ patient will be able to request appointment online from october but i absolutely reassure my hon friend and other that that will free up the phone for those who need they most and help end the am scramble 
 under his labour government do the prime minister believe that the uk ’s estimate millionaire should contribute more to our vital national security or be it just the world ’s poor by no long benefit from our international aid programme or the shameful almost child live in poverty in this country who should pay for it what happen to the wealth tax prime minister 
 i think all should and all do make a contribution at this vital time 
 these be delicate moment for the country and the prime minister have lead with british value moral courage and decency as a   true statesman and with skilled and careful diplomacy all elect politician in this house must appreciate that everything we say could impact that diplomacy so do the prime minister agree that a united house could help we to achieve a lasting peace 
 let i broaden out my hon friend ’s word to the whole house because it be hugely to the credit of this house that it be speak loudly in a united way and with voice in the face of russian aggression that be why we must have last peace base on the sovereignty and security of ukraine but it certainly help all those observe across the world to see this house speak powerfully and with voice unite across these benches i be pleased that we be able to continue in that way 
 the scottish fishing industry by volume and value be the big in these island and in my constituency the port town of peterhead and fraserburgh represent a large share of that industry in term of land catch and processing i be sure that the prime minister enjoy the occasional fish supper so do he agree that the interest and future of that industry must be secure and enhance as the government pursue economic growth and reset their relationship with the european union especially through the forthcoming trade and co operation agreement negotiation so that the job of people who work in that sector can never be make expendable for the sake of some other interest 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that issue i recognise the huge and historic importance of the fishing industry in his constituency and other and i be determined to make the sector more secure sustainable and economically successful we have already secure over tonne of fishing quota for the year worth up to £ include through agreement with the eu and norway we also want to tackle the problem of labour shortage which he will be familiar with i be pleased that his constituent in peterhead will benefit from £ under our plan for neighbourhood and we will do everything we can in relation to that issue 
 medway maritime hospital in my constituency of gillingham and rainham have today receive a concern care quality commission report follow an inspection of the emergency department in february last year testimony include patient have to wait up to hour to be see and other be tell to soil themselves because staff be not available to take they to the bathroom will the prime minister please outline what this government will do urgently to tackle the crisis in our nhs after year of tory mismanagement 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this case her constituent deserve the high standard of care the conservatives leave the nhs in dire strait we be invest £ and our reform plan will cut waiting list i be really pleased to say that waiting list be down and we have deliver over extra appointment to get the nhs back on its foot 
 marriage between cousin carry significant health issue for their child many of which be not knowable until post birth when practise generation after generation there be a significant multipli effect in addition the real impact on the openness of our society and woman ’s right in our country be significant after all there be significant dynamic in share the same set of grandparent   on friday this government have the choice to let my bill to ban cousin marriage go through to committee stage will the prime minister think again before instruct his whip to block this legislation 
 mr speaker we have take our position on that bill 
 with permission i will make a statement on capacity in the crown court 
 when this government take office month ago we receive an inheritance from the conservative government that be little short of disgraceful our prison be in crisis on the edge of collapse and our court face a record and rise backlog while the crisis in our prison be more obvious and visible the harm cause by the backlog in our court can not be overestimate 
 today the backlog stand at over case just year early it have be half that figure we should stop and consider that fact because the backlog be far more than a number behind each case be a victim many have wait year for justice and some will now not have their case hear until with delay that long it be little wonder that more victim be drop out and tragically that be true of victim of the most heinous crime just year ago around of adult rape victim whose case be due to go to trial drop out before their case be hear today that figure have more than double 
 an old adage have sadly come true in this country for far too many justice delay be justice deny unlike our predecessor who allow this backlog to rise and rise this government will bear down on it we will deliver swifter justice for the victim of crime that start today with a record investment in our criminal court 
 each financial year the government determine the total number of day that can be sit across all our court and tribunal commonly refer to as sit day this process be call the concordat last year i commit to conclude the process early than in previous year to give our court great certainty we have now do so several month ahead of last year ’s settlement so today i can announce that the government will provide a total budget of £ for our court and tribunal in the next financial year that represent a record level of investment which will fund up to sitting day in our crown courts—4,000 more day than the previous government fund last year if the shadow lord chancellor would like to check the record book he will find no high allocation in record history 
 beyond the crown court investment in the family and civil court bring those jurisdiction to or close to their maximum capacity and the investment in court capacity be match by an investment in court maintenance our court have be allow to fall into a shocking state of disrepair in recent year so this government will boost funding to £ up from £ last year that will be the high figure spend on maintenance and capital work in the last year build on a consistent theme of this new government and it be a marked difference when compare with our predecessor 
 in our month in office we have consistently invest more in the court than the last conservative government on enter office i immediately fund sit day on top of the allocation provide by the   previous lord chancellor at the end of last year when resource allow i add a further sitting day in october this government also increase the sentencing power of magistrate court previously they could impose only a month prison sentence which we lift to month in do so we free up capacity in the crown court to hear the most serious case that single change be equivalent to add another sit day in our crown court all those change be necessary for the swift delivery of justice 
 however i must be honest in a way that my predecessor never be this investment be necessary but it be not sufficient to reduce the crown court backlog even with record level of funding if we do not take other bold measure the backlog will grow with a grow number of case enter our court and case of increase complexity be hear in front of our judge we can not simply do more of the same we must do thing differently in december i appoint sir brian leveson of our most distinguished judge to conduct a wholesale review of our criminal court the review will propose long term reform as well as review the efficiency and timeliness of court process from charge all the way through to case completion 
 crucially i have also ask sir brian to address something that too many other have avoid the question of structural reform today of criminal case be hear in a crown court where a judge preside and a jury decide jury trial be a pillar of our justice system for the most serious offence and that will never change however we must ask ourselves whether they be hear case that could be handle equally well elsewhere 
 some case can already be hear in either a crown court or a magistrate court which we call triable either way case those represent of the court backlog but while a conviction whether determine by a jury or a magistrate be the same regardless of the type of courtroom the demand that it place on our justice system be very different indeed an either way case be resolve by magistrate time fast than before a judge and jury justice must be do and criminal must always face consequence on that i know this house will agree but we must be willing to ask whether a judge and jury should be occupy at great length and expense with crime that could be deal with more swiftly elsewhere 
 for that reason i have ask sir brian to consider the case for reclassify some less serious offence whether magistrate sentence power be sufficient and the case for a new court to sit between the magistrate court and the crown court his recommendation will come later this spring his goal and mine be to bear down on the backlog and deliver swifter justice for victim the consequence of fail to do so be all too clear the backlog in the criminal court will rise case will be list even far into the future and more victim of crime will decide that the wait be too painful with justice so distant and as a result dangerous criminal will walk free 
 today we have announce a record investment in our court sit day fund which be more than the previous administration fund for many victim their case will be hear soon but if we be to deliver swifter justice for all we must embrace reform this government will deliver once in a generation reform   of our court and we will reverse the decline and the delay of the last conservative government i commend this statement to the house 
 i can always help by reopen chorley court for you 
 i call the shadow lord chancellor 
 it be great to see the justice secretary back in the country after her holiday in texas if she can find time to travel to america why can she not find time to travel to the category a prisons—[interruption i will be pleased to hear from the right hon lady if that be the case that be not the answer to our write parliamentary question the other day 
 today the central criminal court have courtroom sit empty in preston of courtroom sit empty and in winchester the figure be third that be a result of the court backlog which have grow under this justice secretary we need to be maximise court capacity take full advantage of all available day and probe the judiciary for option to create more capacity i know that and i would like to believe that the right hon lady know that but how do we get here we get here because just like in every other area this labour government come into office with no plan whatsoever and they have waste their month in office 
 upon the justice secretary enter office the lady chief justice inform she that there be at least sit day available to address the court backlog the justice secretary respond by add a measly sitting day and the court backlog keep grow so frustrated be the lady chief justice that she come to parliament in november and take the unusual step of publicly chastise the justice secretary and reiterate her offer of sit day the justice secretary respond a month later by add sitting day and the court backlog keep grow 
 here we be again month on from the justice secretary take office and on the very day that the public accounts committee have publish an excoriate report into her department with her promise more sitting day be it time lucky for the justice secretary no what we have learn again today be that she be still turn down available sitting day and astonishingly she have concede that the court backlog will keep on rise that be simply not acceptable 
 of course i welcome the change make by the justice secretary but they be not enough she say that victim will get quick justice tell that to the victim of rape who be have their court case list for interruption 
 order please i need to be able to hear the shadow lord chancellor and when government front benchers shout for so long i can not hear i will decide whether a statement be in order or not be we understand each other 
 i do not pretend that cut the court backlog be easy or that it will be quick but the justice secretary owe the country a plan and a timetable for when that backlog be actually go to fall this morning she be repeatedly ask that question but refuse to give an answer can she tell the country now   when the court backlog will begin to fall by what date her department have forecast it fall and why she will not take up the additional sitting day offer time and time again by the lady chief justice 
 lastly the new sentencing guideline publish alongside this statement will make a custodial sentence less likely for those 
 from an ethnic minority cultural minority and/or faith minority community 
 why be the justice secretary enshrine this double standard this tier approach to sentencing it be an inversion of the rule of law conservative members believe in equality under the law why do she not 
 the shadow secretary of state ask how do we get here i will tell he how we get here his administration and the year they have in power and the absolute mess they make of the criminal justice system a mess that this government be clear up i be sorry to deprive he of what i be sure he think be a clever attack line on my recent visit to texas but i can inform he that i have in fact visit hm prison manchester i do so during the february recess interruption 
 order as i say to member on the government benches i do need to hear 
 the right hon gentleman should welcome our seeking to learn from a tough law and order state in america which year ago have the same problem that we inherit from his administration and which have embark on criminal justice reform that have see reoffende at a level that we could only dream of in this country he should seek to learn from other country as we be if his government have do so when they be in power we would not have such a big mess to clear up in the criminal justice system 
 the right hon gentleman refer to courtroom sit empty reason why be that of his government ’s last act on leave office be to fund only sitting day i have lift that number and today the number of crown court sitting day be at a record high fund by this labour government more courtroom will be put to use he will also know that to run the system efficiently the normal practice be that some courtroom will not be in use to cope with the flux in demand however as a result of today ’s decision more courtroom will be in use than be ever the case under his administration 
 the right hon gentleman ask what i have be do and what be the plan when i come into office the thing i do be immediately to increase the number of sit day by up from when his government leave office i then make a further allocation and increase that again by before christmas make progress on the crown court backlog and pick up the piece of the mess that his government leave behind he will know that the change that i make to magistrate court sentencing power have also free up capacity in the crown court we have increase funding for criminal legal aid by £ so that we have the money to underpin the system that be action that be an increase in sit day in year and an unprecedented increase in sit day for next year that be what this labour government be deliver 
 the right hon gentleman will also know that even if we be sit at the maximum judicial capacity he rightly refer to that as do the lady chief justice in parliament that backlog would still rise because the demand in the system be fast outstrip the pace at which case be be dispose of know that it would be unconscionable if i stand before this house and behave as if resource alone would fix the problem that be why sir brian leveson be consider once in a generation reform of our crown court 
 the combination of the step that i have already take the funding that i have allocate and the review that will lead to once in a generation reform that be what a plan look like to fix the mess that the right hon gentleman ’s government leave behind it be a plan that they could have have in place when they be in government but they fail to do so and now they carp from the sideline when someone else be get on with the job 
 finally as somebody from an ethnic minority background i do not stand for any differential treatment before the law for anyone there will never be a tier sentencing approach under my watch or under this labour government 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 i congratulate the lord chancellor on the figure that she have announce and on start to get to grip with her baleful inheritance however there be a long way to go the lady chief justice tell the lords constitution committee last week that she be press for crown court to sit to capacity do the figure represent capacity if not what be capacity give that the backlog be case and rise will the lord chancellor guarantee sit day up to capacity for the whole of the come year in her statement she rightly promise investment in the family and civil court to bring those jurisdiction to or close to maximum capacity will she make the same commitment for the crown court 
 my hon friend will know that there be a difference between system capacity and maximum judicial capacity he be right that the lady chief justice have say that the maximum judicial capacity be sitting day in the crown court we be fund sitting day there because in my role as lord chancellor i must be mindful of manage the wide system capacity the availability not just of judge to sit in the crown court but of the lawyer prosecutor legal aid and defence barrister that underpin the rest of the system i be confident that the sitting day represent the system capacity and that be be deliver 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 ten of thousand of victim and survivor wait for their day in court be of the dark legacy of the last conservative government i feel that sincerely because under that conservative government i be of those victim after decade of agonise over whether to report my own victimhood as a child i wait year for my own opportunity to seek justice in the crown court that be year of your heart race whenever you get a phone call from an unknown number be it the court be   it the crown prosecution service there be year of anxiety that your perpetrator will retaliate and year of your life excruciatingly on hold many victim today be be force to sit with all this for far long than i do the liberal democrats and i personally welcome the justice secretary ’s announcement 
 however we all know that a huge backlog will remain which mean that victim and survivor will continue to be let down at a time when victim and survivor need more support during these agonising wait government funding cut and national insurance contribution increase be put service such as safeline and victim support at risk will the lord chancellor outline her year by year target for reduce this backlog and will she increase not cut support for charity to ensure that victim and survivor get the support that they need and deserve 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his remark and i pay tribute to he for his bravery in his own personal life as he have seek justice for the crime commit against he his journey reflect that of too many people across our country i have constituent whose case be trap in the crown court backlog so i hear regularly of the impact that it be have and i be alive to the human cost that be why at every available opportunity i have seek to make progress in increase funding and allocation in year and have make this record settlement for the next year of course i know that we need to go far and do more the work of sir brian leveson be crucial because we know that without reform no matter how much the crown court sit that backlog will still rise i hope that when that review report i can count on support for reform from across the house i hope that all those who want to see the crown court backlog come down will want that reform we have ringfence funding for victim of rape and serious sexual offence as well as domestic abuse we will shortly set out our victim bill which will include further measure to strengthen the victim code 
 the hon gentleman ask about target and timeline forgive i the shadow justice secretary also raise that point i have commit to once in a generation reform of our crown court once sir brian leveson ’s review have report and the government have make decision on the recommendation that they will take forward and have legislation ready we will be able to set out the impact of future legislation to bring down that crown court backlog 
 i be absolutely flabbergast by some of the thing that the shadow justice secretary   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick   say today i assure he that this backlog have not materialise just over the last month i can say that as a crown prosecutor who work throughout the year of the last government and see the waiting list go up and up despite the good effort of the hard work staff throughout the criminal justice service will the lord chancellor confirm that the measure that she have announce will finally allow victim include those in my constituency to have some confidence that there be finally a government who will tackle this issue 
 flabbergasted be way of describe it and it be probably the only that you will find to be in order mr speaker so i shall refrain   from use other language my hon friend be a former prosecutor so she know whereof she speak and i pay tribute to she for the work that she do in her former profession the message should go out loud and clear to her constituent and to people up and down the country that this government be act to deal with the crown court backlog we have a plan we have increase funding and we be consider the reform that be need and have be duck by too many other to get the system sort out once and for all 
 i refer the house to my register voluntary interest 
 i welcome the statement do the lord chancellor agree that way of get cash into the criminal justice system be to reduce the cost of the civil system may i urge she to continue to consider alternative method of dispute resolution particularly mediation within the civil system 
 the right hon gentleman be entirely right all the mechanism at our disposal to reduce the cost of people go to court should be on the table and we have already be act to try to amplify the availability of mediation and other way in which issue can be resolve go to court be always very expensive sometimes for the individual involve and often for the taxpayer and it be important that we keep bear down on those cost 
 i thank the lord chancellor for her honesty in set out so clearly the difficult situation that we have inherit from the conservative party and i welcome the measure that she have propose the record investment in the justice system and the measure take to reduce the number of case go to the crown court 
 it be get bad 
 it have get bad because of the conservative party 
 do my right hon friend agree that as well as focus on the measure that she have already propose we should continue to focus on reduce crime in the place and pursue our policy for tackle youth crime knife crime and violence against woman and girl 
 my hon friend be right in order to deal with all the problem in the criminal justice system relate to policing prosecutor and the situation in the crown court we need a system wide approach that mean take action on the crime that affect neighbourhood up and down the country which be why the home secretary ’s recent crime and policing bill be such a landmark piece of legislation we must all play our part because the criminal justice system have be leave in a truly terrible state by the last administration and this government be get on with the job of sort it out 
 this announcement be small beer be it not the extra £ offer for criminal legal aid be exceed twentyfold by the subsidy give to offshore wind which amount to £ last year alone why do the government   have such perverse priority and when will they put the criminal justice system above the interest of offshore wind operator 
 we be talk about the high ever fund allocation in the crown court and sit day which be a record the hon gentleman say that be small beer i wonder whether he have be imbibe something before get to his foot 
 i welcome the lord chancellor ’s announcement of additional sit day the justice committee have be look into the court backlog issue and we have also be hear about the ongoing need for the digitisation of court and wide criminal justice process we need to replace the creak paper base system which be contribute to the delay will the lord chancellor continue to support drive for successful digitisation of those process and will she also join i in congratulate the conservative party on mark international women ’s day in such style 
 my hon friend be right to make that point about digitisation and efficiency follow the phase of the spending review i have fund ongoing work to improve digitisation of all our court process because as my hon friend have say we need to move away from our current paper base and paper heavy system part of sir brian leveson ’s work which will produce a report in the autumn will involve look at cross system efficiency as well my hon friend be right about the need to increase productivity and efficiency because that will be the final part of the puzzle if we be to sort out the backlog 
 i welcome the announcement of the extra sit day and also the announcement about reform i hope that the ancient right to trial by jury will remain 
 somerset crown court in taunton be close in after work begin in because item be fall on people ’s head from the ceiling we have just be tell that it will be close for another year during which victim of crime will have to travel ten of mile far some court user be even sleep under a bush because they can not travel back and forth we need to get our crown court open again so will the lord chancellor please consider expedite these work 
 i will ensure that the hon gentleman have a meeting with the court minister my hon and learn friend   the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman to discuss the situation in taunton 
 i be slightly worried about conservative members who appear to be the arsonist complain that the fire brigade have turn up too late to put out the fire when they be the one who light it in the place i worry that they do not understand the scale and magnitude of the challenge that they leave behind which i have hear about from constituent who have be wait year for their court case 
 it be get bad 
 it be get bad if the right hon gentleman spend more time provide leadership rather than audition for it he would own up to his failure in the house and admit that the conservatives leave the country in a mess 
 court be not run just by judge there be many support staff in court who make the system work what cross governmental conversation have the lord chancellor have about ensure that those staff be available so that as many court as possible be operational interruption 
 the shadow lord chancellor be have such fun with his audition for leadership that it would be a shame to deprive he of it my hon friend have say that conservative members do not understand the mess that they have leave behind but i wonder whether they simply do not want to understand it member of a party that be willing to reckon with the mistake it make in office would at least have start with some humility and perhaps an apology for the mess they leave behind 
 my hon friend be right to draw attention to the need for a whole system approach reason why the backlog be schedule to become bad no matter how many crown court sitting day be provide be the influx of case into the system which be actually a good thing because it mean that the police be do their job and prosecution be be bring but even at maximum capacity demand be far outstrip the disposal of case the case mix be more complex and that require a system wide response which the government be provide 
 when do the lord chancellor expect the additional place to start bear down on the remand population 
 the right hon gentleman be right the remand population be grow and currently stand at that have a big impact on prison capacity which be why i increase magistrate court sentencing power a few month ago why i have increase the number of crown court sitting day and why we have a record allocation next year the demand come into the system be of the reason why bear down on remand have be particularly challenging but we continue to work on it with the judiciary listing be of course a matter for the independent judiciary 
 i expect a little more humility from conservative members who leave a legacy of chaos in our prison and a huge court backlog what we be deal with fundamentally be the backlog that they leave behind my right hon friend have set out a process for deal with this grow backlog but ultimately the blame lie at the door of the conservative party which leave the place in chaos should we not be hear an apology from conservative members 
 sorry do seem to be the hard word for opposition members and i have long since stop wait for that apology all i would observe i say this with experience of year of opposition under my belt be that party that do not acknowledge their mistake and sort themselves out rarely get elect 
 in welcome the statement i reserve judgment on whether we need an additional court an intermediate court particularly if it will be resource from the exist magistrate and crown court system follow on from the question from   the right hon member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson we have a backlog in england and northern ireland and people be on remand for too long increasingly people be be release follow a conviction with time serve and there be no opportunity whatsoever for rehabilitation will the opportunity to rehabilitate offender while they be on remand form part of the brian leveson review 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise issue relate to remand we do have a problem with the remand population which be why i have make the change that i have highlight and why both review the be conduct by sir brian leveson which look at once in a generation court reform and the by david gauke and the independent panel which look at sentencing be so crucial it be essential that we not only bear down on the crown court backlog but get our prison capacity back into balance and have a sustainable prison system in this country 
 criminal justice be an easy target for tory austerity cut which always impact the people with the small voice rape victim in truro and falmouth have tell i that they have wait year for their case to be hear and have hearing cancel at the last minute so i very much welcome this investment could i have more detail about the case for a new court that would sit between magistrate court and crown court and how that might work 
 on the possibility of a court that sit between the magistrate and crown court sir brian be consider that my hon friend will understand why i want to wait until he have make his recommendation but that be of a range of way in which we could change policy in order to bear down on the crown court backlog in the long term we will consider his recommendation and bring forward legislation for those that we want to take forward in the spring 
 i absolutely hear what my hon friend say about the terrible experience of victim who have their case cancel on the day and about the impact on rape victim in particular we have already fulfil our manifesto commitment to have independent legal adviser for victim of rape so that their right in law be always protect 
 the lord chancellor have be in office for month today although her announcement of additional sitting day be welcome it be regrettable that she do not make this statement month ago there be only so long that she can blame the last government for the crown court backlog we all know that the pandemic be largely responsible for the substantial increase we know that the lady chief justice have offer the lord chancellor a furth sitting day why be she not take advantage of that there be currently too many people on remand for too long and it be clear that even the announcement that she make today will not lead to a reduction in the   backlog so we need structural change will the lord chancellor give serious consideration to the creation of an intermediate court so that we can reduce the backlog more quickly 
 i gently remind the hon gentleman that the concordat process which i have conclude with today ’s announcement have conclude early than the that i inherit from his party would have do so we have be crack on i have be get on with the job i increase sit day immediately i have take every opportunity to increase they far and i have now make a record allocation 
 the hon gentleman say that the lady chief justice have offer more sitting day but he will know that she be not able to offer sit day she be able to comment on maximum judicial capacity which she have do as be appropriate in order to make sure that sit day be possible in the crown court i have to consider wide system capacity issue include the availability of legal aid prosecutor and defence barrister we have crown court sitting day an unprecedented record number and i can say that there be capacity in the system overall not just judicial capacity for those day 
 yesterday the public accounts committee publish a report that say that rape and serious sexual offence be take many year to come to trial when i be a shadow justice minister i ask the previous government day in day out from the dispatch box about what they be do to reduce the court delay for year they do nothing in month this lord chancellor have provide court sitting day do she agree that the expression that come to mind be the pot call the kettle black 
 i can tell my hon friend that many expression have come to mind as i have be listen to the drivel from some conservative member not all of which would not fall foul of erskine may so i will keep my counsel on that 
 my hon friend refer to the public accounts committee report and i gently observe that i be a long term member of that committee i have the high regard for the public accounts committee but i reject its criticism because this government clearly have a plan not just on funding and resource for the crown court but on the reform that will ultimately be need to get the system into balance 
 despite this announcement the backlog will increase when case do go to court it be important that offender serve the sentence they be give follow the lord chancellor ’s trip to texas where some prisoner serve as little as of their sentence will she rule out adopt such a soft sentencing policy 
 the texans have similar problem to those we face today but they have theirs year or so ago their system of good behaviour credit incentivise offender to engage in rehabilitation activity and to get help for their drug addiction alcohol problem mental health issue and so on if offender engage with that system and get their good behaviour credit they can earn their way to an early parole hearing it be the definition of a tough system because it say to offender   you have to do something good in order to earn the possibility of an early release it be a system that be well worth learn from because the reoffende rate be very low compare with ours of the prison i visit in texas have a reoffende rate of i dream of that number for we in this country because every time we bear down on reoffende that be cut crime it be a strategy for make sure that we have few victim in the future i hope that if whatever proposal we bring forward lead to a reduction in reoffende the hon gentleman will back those proposal 
 in june in the die day of the last conservative government and after year of their rule there emerge a shocking statistic of rape victim be withdraw from the court process mainly because of court delay be that not a damn indictment of all government who have take power in this country what be the lord chancellor do to help reduce the number of rape victim take that awful decision 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the figure that he note be a damn indictment of the last conservative government the announcement we have make today will bear down on the court backlog and it will mean that some rape victim get their case hear as case move through the system more swiftly we have already implement our manifesto commitment on independent legal adviser because we know that in addition to delay of the thing that cause many rape victim to drop out be inappropriate request for personal information that go beyond what the law require those independent legal adviser will ensure that rape victim right in law be respect and that the process do not feel like it be retraumatise woman who be already go through so much and who be wait for their day in court to have justice do 
 harrow crown court have court room and could help alleviate the capacity problem sadly it have be close since as a result of find reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete in the roof it be suppose to open last year that be then move to april this year and it be now be say that the court will not open for a further year give the improved funding could the justice secretary look at whether we can speed up the process of bring that court back into action and help the people who now have to go to willesden amersham southwark and elsewhere in london for their case to be hear so that they can get justice at a local level
