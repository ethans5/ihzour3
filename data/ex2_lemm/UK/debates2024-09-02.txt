 it be very relevant to join in this debate on the role of technology in public service follow several conversation that i have during recess about the challenge of connect devon and in particular the south hams and dartmoor to high speed internet it be something that i will be come back to with the minister if we be go to support rural community small business the self employ and those study online we have to get they connect we must also be aware of the danger of digital exclusion for all those who can not use computer particularly old people we must ensure that there be always a decent work offline alternative to app and qr code 
 i be very proud to say that i be the non conservative mp to be elect in my large rural constituency for over year it have a very short flirtation with liberalism in when henry vivian be elect sadly he last only month before be replace by another conservative vivian be the founder of the co operative housing movement and it be a real shame that he do not last a bit long because we could really do with his legacy in south devon 
 it be a spectacular part of the uk from the art deco hotel sit atop burgh island to the eastern slope of dartmoor the rivers dart and avon that meander south to the sea the headland at berry head where you can spot dolphin play in the water and the roll hill and hedge of the south hams it be the place i make home year ago after leave london i take my small daughter to devon to be near family after the death of my husband from cancer in and it be great that they be both with we today 
 be widow at with very young child be a brutal experience but it teach i many thing the power of community the value of friendship and family the strength of support from kindre spirit here i pay tribute to the widowed and young organisation which i chair for a couple of year hang out with a bunch of widow may not sound like much fun but be with people who understand what you be go through at a difficult time and who can truly empathise be transformational i will always champion community and support group who bring people together 
 leave london for a rural community be a bit of a gamble busy london play park be replace by empty field and i be almost the only single parent in the school i do feel like an outsider we have no internet connection and have to dial in through a satellite dish on the roof which drive i completely insane but we get some battery hen and watch in awe as their feather grow back and they begin lay egg again i learn to manage a septic tank and oil fire central heating i navigate the complete lack of bus and the absence of breakfast and after school club which be not easy for a single work mother 
 rural life pose many extra challenge so year later we move to totnes i meet my lovely husband and this special town become home it be often describe as alternative but i prefer to say that it be a place that know the meaning of the word community it be a place where it be quite normal to question the idea that a planet with finite resource can support infinite growth a place where the seriously wealthy question    why they be not be tax more to support those who have less and a place where radical thinking be see as a really important thing to do 
 my constituency be where agatha christie live by the river dart and far downstream naval recruit be train at britannia royal naval college we have wild camping on dartmoor long may it continue paddleboarde in the bay surf on the south coast and the world ’s big pirate festival in brixham as well as ancient family farm stunning beach and thousand of mile of hedgerow 
 we also have the revival of the cirl bunting a success story champion by my predecessor but sarah wollaston who sit on several benches in this house once near extinction there be now over cirl bunting pair sing from the farmland of south devon and cornwall because of the environmental work do by farmer in my constituency it be proof that farm for food and restore nature can go hand in hand 
 we have of the country ’s large fish market at brixham as well as shell fisherman oyster farm and scallop diver an energetic conversation about sustainability and the long term future of the fishing industry be be have and i will work with fisher and scientist so that we can create policy here that ensure that we can continue to fish while protect stock for the future 
 i pay tribute to my predecessor anthony mangnall who work hard to establish the national independent lifeboat association together with the royal national lifeboat institution it provide an incredible emergency service for all those who work or play on the water on land we have hundred of hospitality business that offer a brilliant experience i recommend hon member all come and try they out but they have take a massive hit over the past few year and they really need our support now to survive 
 however there be so much more to south devon that do not make it on to the postcard or the chocolate box we have britain ’s most expensive seaside town in salcombe where an average house cost £ but not far away we have leave behind neighbourhood where people struggle to make end meet on low pay seasonal work and live in poor quality housing this disparity of wealth can be hard to get your head around i would like we to think really hard and creatively in this place about how we can help even out our society so that no be raise a disabled child in a mould fill home within sight of a millionaire ’s yacht in the harbour below 
 the lack of public transport lead to loneliness and isolation and add to the lack of opportunity for our young people for work and socialise we must invest in it as a public good our school in devon be hugely underfunde compare with school across the uk which impact the life chance of our child we have community that have be hollow out by home to the extent that school be close village shop have long go and the last pub be close family be be evict so that landlord can turn their home into short term holiday let and home register as business be cause our council to lose out on million of pound a year of desperately need resource we must close this loophole 
 we have business struggle to get staff because no can afford to live nearby and there be no social housing yet developer build and build to support the   immigration of wealthy retired people from other area of the country we have more than meet our housing target but we be still in a desperate housing crisis the solution be not just build build build it be about land price what we build and where and who buy those home what we need be social housing more community land trust scheme innovation and idea for break out of the developer lead disaster we be in 
 we be the home of innovation and good idea and i would like to quickly highlight organisation landworks i declare an interest as i work there for month in landworks be an inspirational prisoner rehabilitation charity that i hope the new prison minister will soon visit give the crisis we be in nationally its amazing work have be show to cut reoffende rate and reintegrate prisoner into society 
 we also have a grow cluster of high tech photonic company attract talent from home and abroad and provide highly skilled job that be exactly the kind of modern manufacturing that this country desperately need so it be disappointing to hear last week that these company be miss out on partnership funding and investment because of brexit company be weigh up whether it will move its headquarters out of the uk into the eu member will not be surprised to hear that as a former member of the european parliament for the south west who get involve in politic in june i will continue to try to find way to mitigate and lessen the damage brexit have cause particularly to my shellfish exporter my food and wine importer our musician and all those sector that be struggle to find staff 
 south devon be a constituency of many part and it be right at the top of the list of the most challenging constituency in which to deliver lib dem leaflets—[interruption well maybe my hon friend   the member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone   beat i on that i want to finish by express my heartfelt thank to an incredible group of volunteer who support my campaign many of whom be not liberal democrats and who be lend their vote and their time and their shoe leather because they want to be represent by a different kind of voice i would also like to thank my dad with we today who never tired of campaign to help i get here and i would just like to say that i be really sorry i do n’t campaign hard for you in when you come quite close to sit on these benches i could not have do it without they all and it be the honour of my life to represent they and all the resident of south devon i will work hard every day for they for our environment for our planet and for a different kind of politic 
 thank you madam deputy speaker it be a pleasure to follow   the hon member for glasgow west patricia ferguson i congratulate she on a move maiden speech and i hope to add another place on her bucket list 
 i be honour to have be elect as the liberal democrat mp for north east hampshire a constituency that have have only previous mp james arbuthnot now lord arbuthnot in the other place who be know for his important role in support jo hamilton and other sub postmaster and postmistress and ranil jayawardena who likewise want the good for our community and campaign for well infrastructure locally alongside carry out his ministerial role 
 boundary change mean that those in lychpit and old basing who be warmly welcome into north east hampshire be previously represent by dame maria miller in the basingstoke constituency she be a strong advocate for woman in parliament and encourage those of all party 
 i be only the woman to stand for parliament in north east hampshire and only about have stand before i in any of the constituency now cover by the current boundary so it give i great pride to be in the parliament with the high number of woman ever that achievement would not have be possible without the support of my dad my late mum and my husband and child 
 north east hampshire be a place that people often travel through by train between london and the west country or by road on the a30 or the m3 stop perhaps at fleet service those who live there however enjoy good school good transport link low crime and plenty of countryside all the reason in fact why the place often top the list of the good place to live in the uk and why my family and i choose to move there year ago i encourage members the next time a journey take they that way to stop and visit if they wish to indulge their interest in political history they could choose to stay at the seasons the hotel be situate in the former home of sir henry st john mildmay the baronet of the dogmersfield estate who be also coincidentally a liberal political candidate in or they might choose highfield park where neville chamberlain spend his final month 
 once a visitor have arrive there be plenty to experience history enthusiast should visit odiham castle basing house and the roman city wall at silchester those with a military interest will not be disappoint with a constituency that boast raf odiham stratfield saye house the home of the dukes of wellington and blackbushe airport create as an airfield during the world war 
 for nature lover there be so much to choose from the hazeley heath nature reserve or a sturdy walk up beacon hill to look out over caesar ’s camp if they like their nature by the water there be fleet pond the basingstoke canal and our chalk stream the loddon and the whitewater 
 after all that perhaps they might be in need of refreshment north east hampshire be home to dozen of village pub cafés and bakery from the award win street bakery in old basing to the heron on the lake at fleet pond look out over the water there be something for everyone we even have a local gin distil at upton grey 
 of the joy of the area be that each town and village have its own personality with a high number of independent business that make each unique a walk through bramley be entirely different from a stroll along hartley wintney high street or a meander through yately 
 what unite all of these place be the people each unique town or village have a strong sense of community and the people of north east hampshire be unfailingly generous with their time and energy in pursuit of this goal this community spirit be see most recently   when hook infant school and local home and business be victim to a summer flash flood people rally around help clean up raise fund donate item host friend whose home be damage and offer sympathy it be in this way that all the community within north east hampshire be connect 
 but this place that i love to call home be not without its challenge too connect our town and village take more than good will our road particularly our small road be in a terrible state public transport leave a lot to be desire and bus route be sparse at well it be also surprising that north east hampshire be behind the national average in the adoption of g mobile service especially when we consider the above average employment in the technology sector that will be vital for the modernisation of both government and our public service the investment that be need to ensure join up and efficient public service process be as vital as the investment need in north east hampshire ’s transport 
 the uk have a proud history of research and innovation but when nurse be still take patient note with pen and paper it be clear that action be need indeed the national audit office ’s report only last year state that 
 outdated it system be a key source of inefficiency 
 in government we can not be a country need to catch up and i hope that the government will draw on the expertise of those in the technology sector to quickly implement the good possible solution while ensure that individual personal information be hold with the high possible security 
 i also encourage the government in their review of technology in public service to consider the role that charity play in support the sector the tireless work of organisation such as citizens advice and the trussell trust as well as countless local and regional charity be the bedrock of our community such organisation support the public sector to deliver many vital service across health education housing criminal justice and more in my view it be essential that those organisation be also invest in and integrate into the new system that will be create i look forward to work with those local organisation those business and the people in north east hampshire and i thank they for put their trust in i 
 it be a privilege to make my maiden speech today and to follow   the hon member for south devon caroline voaden   and my hon friend   the member for croydon east natasha irons i congratulate they on their move maiden speech they bring their constituency to life vividly and i hope i can do the same

 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of her department ’s statutory intervention at birmingham city council on the adequacy of public service provide by that council 
 it be a privilege to be appoint as deputy prime minister and secretary of state and to answer question from hon member on the important issue i now have responsibility for at such a challenging time for our community 
 council across the country include those under good value intervention be feel the strain after a decade of financial mismanagement by the previous administration i be determined to work constructively   with both the council and the commissioner to reset our relationship with birmingham and support its recovery to ensure that local public service be fit for purpose 
 i recognise that the secretary of state have inherit a very difficult situation under the conservatives birmingham lose 40p in the pound and of local authority job be lose some of the sharp cut in the country our city be now face cut of more than to some public service budget but new information have come to light and it be clear that part of the basis for the original intervention under her conservative predecessor be wrong can 
 order it be mean to be a question you can not make a speech i think you need an adjournment debate to finish this off 
 let i welcome my hon friend to his place he be right to highlight the cut that birmingham face under the tories unlike previous minister we have no interest in use birmingham and its people as a political football we can not avoid the need to make difficult decision but i want to work with the council leadership as well as the commissioner and of course i be open to any representation they want to make 
 what step she plan to take to help regenerate high street 
 what step she plan to take to help regenerate high street 
 what step she plan to take to help regenerate high street 
 what step she plan to take to help regenerate high street 
 we be committed to support the business and community that make our high street flourish we be fund new partnership model with high street accelerator implement high street rental auction and introduce a strong new right to buy for community asset to empower local community to rejuvenate our high street and address the blight of vacant premise 
 high street up and down the country be the backbone of our community but over the year have be face decline for example gillingham high street in my constituency where only yesterday we launch our love gillingham campaign and initiative face numerous challenge will the minister agree to meet i to discuss some of those challenge as well as the possibility of a compulsory register of property on high street so that council can easily engage with owner to find new us for they when they fall vacant 
 i thank my hon friend for that question i totally agree on the important role that healthy and vibrant high street play for community initiative such as love gillingham be vital in bring local people together to create high street that work for they ensure that local authority and the community they serve have the tool they need to support the high street be a priority with regard to ownership hm land registry be searchable for a variety of information but i welcome the chance to meet my hon friend to discuss that and perhaps love gillingham as well 
 the regeneration and refurbishment of town centre such as mine be be structurally disincentivise by the tax regime which give preferential treatment to new build on out of town retail park instead of renovate our much love historic high street southport ’s town centre be beautiful but have definitely see well day just this weekend our much love independent bookshop broadhurst be close down after over year of trading give the dire economic circumstance we inherit from the former government what can the minister do to incentivise the private sector to invest in our town centre and high street bring life back to they 
 i be grateful for that question with your forbearance mr speaker may i say before i answer that i and my ministerial colleague know my hon friend ’s community have be through a dreadful last few week and that our support be with they i know he will come forward with other way in which we can help we go through something similar in nottingham and i know how dreadful it be for the community we be here to help 
 on the tax regime we be commit to a fair business rate system in our manifesto we pledge to level the play field between the high street and online giant as well as to incentivise investment tackle empty property and support entrepreneurship listen to business and community we will continue to consider how we can go far to support high street while new power such as rental auction and the right to   buy community asset empower those community to address decline 
 the government be rightly focus on bring empty property back into use as part of our commitment to regenerate high street but encourage footfall by support local community to hold event in our town centre be another way we can bring life back to our high street and support local business that be certainly the approach i take when i be the cabinet member on medway council in charge of economic regeneration use the uk share prosperity fund will my hon friend meet i to discuss learning from that experience and what an improved new fund could look like under this government 
 i thank my hon friend for her kind invitation i be keen to understand more about the medway experience i know that the uk share prosperity fund have be use very effectively throughout the country and that there be a great deal of interest in its future decision on funding beyond march be a matter for the budget but in the meantime i be keen to talk to my hon friend about her experience and the lesson that have be learn 
 my constituency be full of great high street bawtry be buzz when i visit it yesterday for the car show and i have also recently visit parkin butchers and tyto law solicitors in crowle these people take huge pride in the service and product that they offer but just down the road shop premise be vacant and in some instance have be vacant for month if not year how do the government intend to stop the buying up of such outlet and deal with the lack of any obvious urgency or indeed potential in respect of their ever be reopen 
 i be grateful for that question we have all be through a major political event or this year as be customary we have be knock on door and we know how frustrated people all over the country feel about the vacancy on their local high street which be bring down their area we have to rebalance this high street rental auction which i have already mention will give council power to require landlord to bring vacant commercial property back into use for their original purpose so that we no long see all those board up unit describe by my hon friend with people just sit on they without provide any social purpose 
 i call mel stride sorry he be not here 
 our high street be undoubtedly change conservative lead walsall council be work hard to secure positive change in area such as brownhills and the regeneration of ravenscourt and we have a new civic square what additional resource will the minister make available to council the regeneration of our high street both residential and commercial be an excellent way of help to protect green belt land by also regenerate important town centre 
 the right hon lady be exactly right the future of the high street be not about return to how thing be there must be a place for leisure a place of course for retail and a place for residential property and council of all political persuasion throughout the country be try to find that perfect alchemy we have   inherit an extremely difficult funding situation but we be work our way through it and future funding decision will be make in the budget on   october 
 i be not sure that mel would be all that flattered actually 
 banking facility be important to our high street trader bedale among other town have no bank and do not even have a work atm give that bank have save about £ a year by closing branch what be the minister do with his counterpart in the treasury to ensure that we have proper banking facility in town such as bedale 
 the hon gentleman know whereof he speak this be another question that we be address up and down the country we know that banking facility bring people into town and village and give rise to a virtuous circle we have commit ourselves to provide new banking hub and as the hon gentleman suggest we be work with treasury colleague on their delivery 
 the outdated business rate system have leave some market town such as wincanton in my constituency with empty premise on the high street damaging community sense of pride and prevent council from benefit on the back of flourish town centre will the minister work with his treasury colleague to boost small business and regenerate high street by reform damaging business rate 
 that be a commitment that we make at the previous election and we intend to deliver on it 
 i congratulate the secretary of state on her recent reappointment and also on her dancing skill 
 the strong town fund have be extremely successful in hereford and the question have arise as to whether any of the fund that may be within that scheme and have not be use elsewhere could be redeploy may i invite the secretary of state and her team to consider whether that might be possible and potentially put in a bid that would pour important new life into a scheme that be already go incredibly well 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question we want to see great flexibility and we want to see more integrated single settlement funding pot so that local community have that flexibility we be deal with a transition from the previous model that we inherit and it will take time to re engineer from to the other initial spending decision will be a matter for   october   but in principle i understand exactly what he be say and the value that community would take from that 
 what step she be take to help tackle islamophobia 
 islamophobia be a scourge on our society that must be root out and i   thank my hon friend for his work on this issue much of last month ’s violent disorder be islamophobic and the targeting of muslims show that we need to go far and fast in tackle this vile hatred which be fuel by fake news we have now provide great security and rapid support for muslim community and our faith minister in the other place lord khan be actively consider further step to crack down on anti muslim hatred monitor islamophobia and engage the community effectively 
 my right hon friend will know the fear and distress that the civil disorder this summer cause to many of my constituent and to muslim community across the country who be target by violent extremist i be sure that she will join i in make it clear that the vast majority of people in our country of all faith and background wish only to live together peacefully and utterly reject those who stir up division what engagement have ministers undertake with muslim community since those event and what be they do to give reassurance for the future 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to underline that the vast majority of people in this country of all faith and background want only to live together peacefully and my department be at the heart of the government ’s work to restore order and unity in all our community follow the appalling disturbance while we continue to make sure that criminal be bring to swift justice the vital work to strengthen the bond between the government and community include our muslim community and those of many other faith and background be central to this government ’s mission to bring the whole country together 
 could the secretary of state please explain to i and the house what the government ’s definition of islamophobia actually be 
 i say to the hon member that a new definition must be give careful consideration so that it comprehensively reflect multiple perspective and consider the potential implication for different community we be actively consider our approach to islamophobia include definition and we will provide further update in due course 
 what step her department be take to help promote community cohesion 
 what step her department be take to help promote community cohesion 
 what step her department be take to help promote community cohesion 
 last month ’s appalling violence expose deep root weakness in our society division and decline combine with rise islamophobia   and racism contribute to the vile scene of hatred i be determined that we should now support the recovery of town and city affect and investment in community cohesion that have start with a comprehensive support offer for southport and i can confirm that i will now lead cross government effort on this issue i will update the house on our plan in due course 
 whatever our belief faith leader and faith group can play an important role in bring we all together will the deputy prime minister join i in commend the many faith leader i have meet across aldershot and farnborough who be work to promote tolerance and understanding across our community can she outline what her department be do to encourage those community leader whose work remind we that we be far more united and have far more in common than that which divide we 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i be proud to serve alongside my good friend jo cox in this house and her word about our common humanity and what unite we ring as true as ever i have meet many local community business and other group affect by the act of deplorable violence that we have see across the country in recent week include in place such as stoke on trent and rotherham i hear powerful story from those who experience appalling violence but i also hear about how those community come together to defend their street and be unite against hatred and thuggery i know that my hon friend have be a leader in her own community and we ministers will support she and her constituent in the spirit that she have set out 
 our community cohesion in cornwall be be undermine by the housing crisis with many local price out or even face homelessness this matter require urgent attention and i be therefore pleased that this government have place build new home at the top of our legislative agenda can the deputy prime minister ensure that we be build the right kind of home in cornwall namely social home 
 absolutely and my hon friend be right we be strengthen housing target and act to ensure that local plan be ambitious enough to support this government ’s commitment to home in this parliament include social home under our new proposal assess housing need across cornwall would increase by around demonstrate our commitment to approve the supply of new home that his constituent desperately need 
 follow the horrific islamophobic attack experience by muslim community around the country the princess street mosque in burton upon trent open its door to the wide community so that everyone could learn more about islam and see their place of worship this be a way to challenge misinformation and promote mutual understanding do the deputy prime minister welcome this as an example of how community can help bring people together 
 i absolutely welcome it and i commend the action such as those take by the burton upon trent mosque i agree with my hon friend that build   understanding among those from different background be vital to foster strong community this government be commit to work with community around the uk to build a culture of cohesion trust and mutual respect and we will outline further action in due course 
 could i ask the secretary of state whether she agree give the commitment to build new home that community cohesion come from a planning system where community infrastructure be front load in development rather than people have to live year on a new build estate without anywhere to come together to celebrate as a community 
 i absolutely agree that it be important that infrastructure be build around our home target that be why we set out the proposal in the consultation on the national planning policy framework to ensure that people see the home they desperately need the right home that they need and the vital infrastructure around that 
 i thank the deputy prime minister for her answer sometimes it be easy to dwell upon the negativity but there be positive as well there be positive in my constituency when people decide to burn down the mosque because they be catch by the police and they will hopefully be imprison and because the community come together which be the issue i want to put over across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland there be many people who want to live together all the people in the baptist church that i go to in newtownards be pray for those people in that church and that be the ards and the strangford that i know sometimes we need to put over the good thing as well 
 it be always a pleasure to hear from the hon member and he be absolutely right when i be visit those community i see they come together i see the way in which they work well and the way in which everybody look out for each other it remind i of why i be in this place and why i do what i do for the great british people and what they do 
 in westmorland we have a story that have underpin cohesion for decade that be the true story of the windermere child in august almost half the child who survive the nazi death camp be rehabilitate on the bank of windermere at troutbeck bridge i wonder if the deputy prime minister would agree to meet i because a group of we include member of the aid society and the local school the lakes school want to build a lasting memorial at troutbeck bridge on the site where the child be house while rebuild the school that be build on that site will she carry on the cross party work that we have before the election and meet i and other from that community to help make that a reality

 the khan review into social cohesion be element of what we need to do to get back to address the issue of community cohesion as oppose to the divisiveness of the way in which the previous government look at community cohesion what i would like to see instead of the language and tone we have see from member on the right hon member ’s benches be the tone that   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   take around how we can bring community together and work together to ensure that people can respect people ’s difference and celebrate what make we british and that be that we all have different place 
 the right hon lady have not read the khan review as she would not have give that answer if she have 
 the review talk about the incident at batley grammar school where a teacher be fail by local police and the local council and have to go into hiding give the fear about the rise be islamist sectarianism in community such as west yorkshire what be the right hon lady ’s plan especially as she have not read the review to ensure that such incident do not happen again 
 i have read the review maybe the right hon lady be busy launch her leadership campaign early today 
 the point i be make be that under the previous administration there be not an element of community cohesion but constant division and stoking of division i try to bring our education system together when i be shadow education secretary across education across my department and across our government i would like to see how we can celebrate our difference and bring community together if the right hon lady be successful in her bid to become leader of the opposition i hope she will work with we on that endeavour

 resident in both hethersett and loddon have fall victim to new home be build to poor standard shatter their dream of home ownership from day do my hon friend agree that on our ambition to deliver new home they must be decently build new home 
 as my hon friend say this government be commit to deliver quality home over this parliament to ensure that people have access to high quality housing new build homebuyer must feel confident that their new home be safe and this government be commit to improve redress for homebuyer when thing go wrong we be consider the recommendation in the competition and markets authority ’s recent market study on house building and will publish our response in due course 
 the hon lady will be well aware of the recent fire in east london and the fact that many high rise building in this country be still not deem safe because developer be refuse to do what they should what action will she take to force developer to make building safe for resident 
 i know the hon gentleman do a great deal of work on this agenda in the last parliament this week more than year after the grenfell tragedy the community will receive the public inquiry ’s final report and i hope its finding will help to provide the truth that the bereaved and survivor deserve the dagenham fire to which the hon gentleman refer must have have a traumatic impact on those people as well as on the affected resident 
 today we have publish a write ministerial statement set out our action in relation to the outstanding phase recommendation of the grenfell inquiry and further work be under way to ensure that we can accelerate the work to make building safe i look forward to work with the hon gentleman on this agenda 
 hundred of my constituent live in leasehold property with problem i should declare for the register that i live in a leasehold property although my developer fund the full cost of clad removal there be still a very long wait for those who be not yet in the queue and brake on delivery be the lack of skilled people in the construction industry what work be my hon friend do with other departments to make sure that we develop the skill we need year after grenfell we still see some building where work have not start so we do need to put our foot on the accelerator 
 this be a very important area and we be absolutely committed to increase the skill and competence within the sector the industry have actively respond to dame judith hackitt ’s challenge but there remain significant work to be do to upskill industry member and prepare for the new regime the department and the building safety regulator will support industry as they identify skill and capacity gap provide relevant training and set up accredit competence scheme i look forward to work with colleague who will all have an interest in speed up remediation work and improve capacity in the sector 
 give the government ’s ambitious house building plan the energy crisis and the climate crisis will the minister bring forward legislation in the forthcoming planning and infrastructure bill to ensure all new house have solar panel on their roof as standard so they can generate    their own power and net building standard be bring forward as soon as possible so that home be well insulate warm and cheap to heat 
 the government have set out very ambitious plan on home building and on green issue the future home building programme will address those issue we look forward to work with colleague on the issue 
 the last government consult at very great length about bring accessibility standard for all new home up to m4(2 level the housing communities and local government committee recommend that be do immediately but the response we get be that more consultation be need will the minister assure we that the issue will now be deal with as a matter of urgency so that all new home be more accessible for people with disability it be a really important issue that seem to have be forget about 
 today in our write ministerial statement we have set out a number of proposal the point my hon friend make about accessibility be extremely important we will do further work build on the statement publish today i look forward to work with he to address the issue 
 people in north norfolk desperately want new home for local people to be build they know those home need to be good quality and support active lifestyle but currently local council lack the tough power they need to make those demand will the minister tell i what she plan to do to give planner such as those at north norfolk district council great power to demand more from developer 
 the national planning framework will set out far how we intend to provide key support to local authority and to work closely with local authority to ensure the issue be address 
 what step she plan to take to reform the leasehold system 
 the government be commit to finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end to do so we will implement the provision of the leasehold and freehold reform act enact the remain law commission recommendation relate to enfranchisement and the right to manage take step to make commonhold the default tenure for new flat and tackle unaffordable   and unregulated ground rent charge as set out in the king ’s speech draft legislation will be publish in   due course 
 many of my constituent in stoke on trent south have contact i in the past few week include those from blythe bridge tell i how the archaic fleecehold system have leave they at the mercy of poor management agent they have be trick into purchase   home that be not cover by right to manage in the same way as flat with service charge more than double and the developer and manage agent renege on promise to upkeep and in some case even build the necessary infrastructure on their development do the government have plan to hold those manage agent and developer to account perhaps with legal requirement of provision or a licensing scheme 
 the distinct set of problem face by residential freeholder that my hon friend describe be well know and understand as we set out in our manifesto the government be commit to bring the injustice of fleecehold private housing estate and unfair maintenance cost to an end we intend to consult publicly on the good way to achieve that in the interim we will move to implement the new protection against unfair charge that be contain in the leasehold and freehold reform act 
 i thank the minister for express the wish of many of we to see this awful system dispose of will he draw his colleague attention to the fact that people like i live in a leasehold block have the experience of win a tier tribunal hearing against a freeholder but still await the refunding of the sum of money that be wrongly take from we in the place the freeholder simply ignore everything and carry on as if nothing have happen 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question he draw attention to of the many failing of the feudal leasehold system which be precisely why we finally intend to end it by the end of this parliament 
 what step her department be take to increase the supply of social housing 
 as my hon friend will be aware the government be commit to deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in a generation in the day that we have be in office we have already propose change to the national planning policy framework to support that objective and confirm a range of new flexibility to help council and housing association make a great contribution to affordable housing supply 
 in their die day the previous government consult on change to the way that social housing be allocate those proposal be describe by the chief executive of shelter as unnecessary unenforceable and unjust the chief executive of the chartered institute of housing warn that they would force many people into homelessness can my hon friend confirm that this government will not be take forward those damaging proposal 
 my hon friend be correct the government have today publish a formal response to that consultation set out precisely why we will not   be take those proposal forward it be important that we allocate social housing fairly and efficiently the proposal put forward by the previous government be deeply flawed as respondent to the consultation make clear they would not only fail to improve how social housing be allocate but cost taxpayer a fortune swell the number of people in expensive temporary accommodation and increase the risk of harm to the public the only way to meet the demand for genuinely affordable social rent home be to build more of they which be precisely what we intend to do 
 obviously social housing be important and we want to see it in the right place across the country i can not understand why this government be now propose   to reduce the number of new home in london by a year and in area all around london include county such as essex by a year surely of the most important thing that we need to do be increase that supply of social housing particularly in london 
 i think the hon gentleman be refer to the change to the national planning policy framework rather than to social housing specifically we have make those change propose to the standard method they will give london a realistic but achievable new target interruption let i explain why the way that the previous government apply the urban uplift unfairly to london give it an unrealistic fantastical target that it could not meet we will ensure that we be push the mayor on a realistic but achievable 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we share the ambition of see a big increase in the supply of housing and of social housing in particular give that there be around new home with planning consent already grant in this country what process lead the government to prioritise the removal of green belt protection rather than build the home for which our council have already give consent 
 what i would say to the hon gentleman be that we be do both we be make change to the national planning policy framework to encourage the release of the right kind of low quality grey belt land within the green belt and we be take action to ensure that those site across the country that have receive consent but which be stall or be not be build at the pace require be move along with additional support from the centre 
 the previous government make new measure available to local authority to encourage borrow against the housing revenue account to enable the creation of new council housing what measure do the government have in mind to increase the take up of this approach by our local authority 
 we be committed to work with council include with the signatory of the recent report on secure the future of council housing to address the many challenge they be face include in connection with the housing revenue account headroom as many of they be feel lot of pressure on that   front as a step we have give council more flexibility to increase the delivery of council home use right to buy receipt and allocate an additional £ to council to secure home for family at risk of homelessness we will set out plan at the next fiscal event to give council and housing association the rent stability they need to borrow and invest in new and exist home 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 recent freedom of information request by the liberal democrats find that out of council that respond have someone on their social housing waiting list for more than a decade and this shocking statistic come all while the stock of social housing have be reduce will the minister consider reform the land conservation act so that local council can buy land at current value rather than hope value and get on with deliver the social housing that we so desperately need 
 i thank the hon lady for draw attention to the appalling record of the previous government on affordable housing in particular social rent housing over the past year the number of social rent home own by register provider fall by over we have to take action to well protect our stock and build new social rent home but she be absolutely right that further reform be need of compulsory purchase order how they be draw and the power available to council we need to enact the change that be introduce by the previous government though the levelling up and regeneration act but we intend to go far and will consult on that in due course 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of council funding 
 what recent assessment she have make of the adequacy of council funding 
 what step she be take with local authority to help ensure that they have adequate resource to fund local service 
 i know at hand how hard council work to deliver essential public service and we want to thank councillor council official and council worker for the hard work that they do all year round the government be under no illusion about the challenge face local authority it be our priority to reset the relationship between local and central government and to end the politic that have see westminster hoard far too much power hold back our town city and village from realise their full potential we will provide more stability for council through multi year funding settlement end the competitive bidding process and reform the broken audit system future local authority funding decision   be of course a matter for the spending review and the local government finance settlement in which we be fully engage 
 can the minister explain how the english devolution bill will reduce local authority budget shortfall ensure that essential council service for the public be protect 
 the english devolution bill be a landmark piece of legislation that will finally address the imbalance of power between this place and community up and down the country but it be not in itself the answer we know that the financial foundation on which it rest be local authority which be struggle that be why we be commit to multi year funding settlement and fair funding 
 i understand that there will be a major review of local government funding next year i represent wokingham whose council be the lowest fund unitary authority per head in the country will the review look at the actual need and cost face by local authority as oppose to the current methodology of allocate funding which be base on historical datum and be disproportionately skew by simplistic measure of deprivation 
 any fair funding formula of course have to address the range of challenge that local authority face whether that be their local tax base and how much they can realistically generate from their local community and business or the cost of service delivery and the demand within a local community we will ensure that the fair funding formula of which multi year settlement be a part be do with that rigour 
 there can be no way of fix the foundation of this country without fix the foundation of local government so i be pleased to hear that this council sorry this government be look to reset the relationship with local council as a local councillor i be stick in the habit will the minister please outline what specific support will be give to council that have have to issue section notice to ensure that they can deliver on this government ’s aim throughout the country 
 local council be central to deliver on this government ’s mission and to change this country for the well but we know that many of they be on a cliff edge financially and many of they will be fearful for their budget go forward we will work in partnership with my hon friend the department ’s door be always open to local authority that need to have conversation 
 council funding in birmingham be inadequate because of a set of sadistic direction base on speculative estimate of equal pay liability no believe those estimate not even the lead commissioner so will the minister revisit those direction quickly and meet with birmingham mps to help we to get they right 
 we need to reset the relationship between the westminster government and local authority i have see far too many example where the secretary   of state and ministers have at this dispatch box hung individual council out to dry that be not a relationship of equal at all i thank the leadership of birmingham for take the tough decision and action that be need this government will work in partnership with they in a constructive way as equal go forward 
 for what reason the propose revise national planning policy framework remove the requirement for new housing to be beautiful 
 beauty be always part of the proposal the hon member if he have read our proposal in the nppf would know that we have not remove all reference to beauty we have simply change additional reference make by the conservatives that the royal institute of british architects say could lead to development be turn down 
 in mid bedfordshire we have a mix of historic town and village as well as new development such as wixams we take more than our fair share of development and my constituent want to see beautiful home with the right service that be sympathetic to the traditional character of our community do the secretary of state agree that people want to see beautiful home throughout england in that case will she reinsert beauty as a house building objective in the revise framework 
 if the hon member have read our proposal regard the inconsistency he would know that the government be not propose to remove all reference to beauty from the nppf i reiterate that the change we be make relate to additional reference to beauty insert by the previous government in december these be subjective in nature difficult to define and may lead to inconsistency in decision making 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 on the subject of the nppf i be grateful for the letter that the right hon lady send to i on saturday i enjoy read it especially her attempt to explain why she reduce sadiq khan ’s london target and even more where she highlight that he have consistently under deliver if other local leader miss their new housing target will she reduce their target too 
 i find that astonishing when the previous government miss their target every single year as the housing minister have already set out our methodology be about realistic expectation that people can meet we will not shy away from the decision that need to be make to make sure that we build the home that people need that be why we be elect and that be what the right hon member need to realise 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i pay tribute to all those involve in support resident in dagenham after the appalling fire last week a sobering reminder of the importance of make building safe ahead of the grenfell inquiry report this week my thought be with the bereaved family the survivor and the community of grenfell affect during this very difficult week as my hon friend the minister for building safety say we have publish an update to the house on work to address build safety issue which we will continue to take swift action to resolve 
 birmingham ’s labour run council be on the verge of sell off some residential unit at a loss to the taxpayer of about £ will the secretary of state intervene to allow the council to retain those property for public ownership and for   use by some of the desperate family on the waiting list 
 the hon member will know that birmingham city council will not be make decision over asset sale lightly i know that it be work with commissioner to ensure that its financing decision deliver value for money and that it can avoid fire sale and i will work constructively with the council and commissioner as that work continue 
 levy funding for internal drainage board be an increase concern for many council in my constituency king ’s lynn and west norfolk borough council now contribute the equivalent of of its council tax income to fund idb levy will the secretary of state update member on any progress determine a more sustainable funding solution for those levy and whether the off grant scheme to support council might be repeat 
 in the final local government finance settlement a £ grant be announce to assist local authority experience significant pressure on their internal drainage board levy i be publish today the allocation of funding for local authority and i can confirm that king ’s lynn and west norfolk will receive an allocation of £ from the levy we be also work closely with our colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs to explore option go forward for future allocation 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 it have be report that the secretary of state be be lobby to increase council tax and remove discount such as the single occupancy discount will she take this opportunity to reassure the house that the government have no plan to increase council tax as they assure we before the election 
 yes 
 my constituent tracy be recently issue with a section notice to quit and at the same time a section rent increase that she can not afford she fear be make homeless with her child so she get in touch with newcastle city council for a council property but the wait be week on average and often much long when will good tenant be protect from unfair eviction and extortionate rent increase 
 i be deeply sadden to hear of the plight of tracy and her child our renter right bill will protect tenant from arbitrary eviction and empower they to challenge unreasonable within tenancy rent rise i can assure my hon friend that tracy and other face similar insecurity will not have long to wait for that bill ’s introduction 
 i call the lib dem spokesperson 
 resident in rural area such as my constituency be see drastic cut to local service despite their council tax have go up this year that be because council be struggle to balance budget when the fair funding review take place will the secretary of state commit to consider the cost of deliver service in vast rural area which be in excess of the same cost in urban area 
 we will absolutely ensure that the true cost of public service delivery be account for in different part of the country and in different local authority that will be part of it however i say gently that although the conservatives be the architect of austerity the liberal democrats be definitely there sharpen the pencil 
 the government have my full support in make housing more affordable for my constituent and those across the uk and create more social rent housing will be important in that will the minister update the house on the government ’s plan to protect exist council stock by review the increase right to buy discount introduce in 
 the government have start to review the increase right to buy discount introduce in as we promise to do in our manifesto we will lay secondary legislation in the autumn and consult on wide reform we recognise the importance of right to buy as a route to home ownership for tenant but we must as my hon friend make clear protect our exist stock and boost the supply of new social rent home 
 manage the need to build new home and to protect our valuable green space will always be a tricky balancing act will the government put in the national planning policy framework anything that will protect the concept of the green belt in area such as esher and walton and will the secretary of state meet i to discuss it 
 the government have make it clear in that very consultation that we do not intend to change the general purpose or extent of the green belt we be committed to make change to ensure that we be release the right part of the green belt to meet housing need the hon lady be more than welcome to submit her own view as part of that consultation 
 among the many people who be concerned about the safety of building understandably give recent event be those who work or live in residential social care home do today ’s announcement include high safety standard include sprinkler system in such home 
 i completely agree with my hon friend that we should ensure that the most vulnerable in society be protect that be why the government have today announce an amendment to the statutory fire safety guidance to make provision for sprinkler system in all new care home 
 over people many of whom be in really desperate condition be on the housing waiting list in taunton and wellington and in somerset as a whole will the secretary of state allow council to borrow at low interest rate to build the council house that we need across the country and support council such as somerset council which be pioneer the council house for a generation in some part of the county 
 as i make clear in response to a previous question we understand very much the pressure that local authority be under and the pressure on their housing revenue account we be review our position and will make further announcement in due course 
 blackpool ’s waterloo road and bond street be once thrive local tourist hotspot that underpin our local economy all year round when the deputy prime minister last visit blackpool with i she see for herself the awful visible decline of those area will she and her department work with i and local business to ensure their successful regeneration 
 i thank my hon friend for his question it be great to visit blackpool during the general election campaign and i visit blackpool on many occasion during my childhood as well my department be work in partnership with blackpool to unlock significant investment i have see that more need to be do to unleash blackpool ’s great potential and i will work with my hon friend on the ongoing regeneration of blackpool to deliver well quality housing and a strong local economy and you never know we might visit the nightlife as well 
 will the secretary of state join i in call on labour control leicester city council to review its proposal in its own local plan to site house traveller    pitch and a waste process centre on the edge of glenfield village in my constituency which be cause considerable concern to my resident 
 we be not go to interfere in the discretion of local council to make such decision what we be emphasise as part of the nppf consultation be the importance of have a local plan in place we have inherit a disastrous situation where only of local authority across the country have an up to date plan in place and we need to do more to drive universal coverage local plan be the good way that local community can shape development in their area 
 worthe west be develop and i be often contact by resident who support new development particularly social rent and for time buyer but be concerned that we must also value our increasingly urban green space what step be be take to balance urban green space provision with our need for housing to ensure all our community be able to thrive and stay healthy 
 the government be commit to ensure that development protect and provides—[interruption 
 order can i just say to the father of the house that that be not really the do thing he should know that well than anybody 
 as i be say the government be commit to ensure that development both protect and provide for green space i be more than happy to discuss the particular challenge that my hon friend face in her part of the country 
 as the deputy prime minister should be aware people in romford be very angry that mayor khan be force we to build high rise block do she agree that the london borough of havering despite be part of greater london be essex and that we should remain a town and country borough 
 as a mancunian i do not think i be in any place to tell londoners what be in essex and what be not 
 my constituency have be hold back by year of conservative cut to the county council and to borough and district council so i hope that the new government ’s devolution agenda will help rebuild and improve our local public service can the secretary of state provide an update on the consultation with hertfordshire county council and our borough and district authority 
 who want it 
 we be well under way in review the consultation that be currently take place and all the devolution agreement that be not table before the election i be very happy to meet with my hon friend outside of this chamber to discuss the matter far 
 will the minister please confirm that where a rural community have take the time and effort to produce a neighbourhood plan that plan will be respect for its lifespan notwithstanding new housing target for the local planning authority 
 the government do not intend to require local planning authority to amend neighbourhood plan in the future community will continue to be able to choose whether they review or update their neighbourhood plan 
 could the minister expand on his early answer relate to devolution and perhaps provide a timeframe for some of the discussion that be take place with local authority about devolution plan that do not go ahead before the last general election my constituent be very keen to move ahead with improvement to transport education and inward investment 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and for her work on the agenda to further devolution in her region we recognise that in some part of the country include hull and east yorkshire and greater lincolnshire local authority work up proposal for the previous government that be not table before the election we be currently work through those proposal at pace to make sure area have clarity about where they be up to and we look forward to report on that as soon as possible and meet with local mps as part of that process 
 when the secretary of state look at the rule around local authority compulsory purchase order and at remove hope value for house building purpose will she look at have the same rule for play field that local authority want to keep as play field and not build on that would allow site such as udney park play field in my constituency which have lie derelict for a decade under private ownership to be bring into community use again 
 it sound as if the hon lady have a response for the nppf consultation that be in development i welcome her view on play field on cpo there be a discretionary power to disapply section of the land compensation act in relation to hope value we need to ensure that that be bring into force then we will take further step to reform cpos as outline in our manifesto 
 the last government make local council compete for pot of money bingley pool in my constituency be due to receive a levelling up award those fund be vital for the regeneration of our town can my hon friend update the house on the review of those award and on the timescale for inform community such as mine who have be let down by the conservatives unfunded promise of the result 
 i share my hon friend ’s anger that promise that do   not have a strong financial backing be make to   community promise that the government be have to work their way through as i say we want to move away from the break competitive model but we know that promise have be make and we be work on they hon member will hear further answer from we before the budget on   october 
 the national planning policy framework clearly militate against build on agricultural land notwithstanding the minister ’s desire not to interfere in local democracy will he write to the leader of thanet district council to remind he that agricultural land be the stuff that we grow food on and can not be for housing if we be to remain sustainable 
 we be maintain the exist strong protection for the good and most versatile agricultural land that be most important for food production the line that we be remove from the nppf be add in december and do not provide clear and meaningful guidance to authority about what they should do in addition to have that strong protection in place 
 on wednesday the phase report of the grenfell inquiry will be publish and i be sure that the whole house will join i in remember the resident who lose their life in an entirely preventable tragedy over year ago recommendation for central government be still outstanding from the phase report include personalise emergency evacuation plan for disabled people will the secretary of state update we on the progress in implement the phase recommendation in full 
 my hon friend be absolutely right this week will be very difficult for the community around grenfell include the survivor and those who lose love one he be also right to say that there be outstanding measure from phase the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government   the hon member for bethnal green and stepney rushanara ali make a write ministerial statement today that will hopefully show where the government intend to go but there be a lot that need to be do on wednesday the whole house will have a moment of reflection and we will think of those at grenfell in the come week 
 i congratulate the secretary of state on her dancing skill her appointment and her outstanding answer to the question from the shadow secretary of state my right hon friend   the member for north west essex mrs badenoch on council tax which i will pursue can she assure the house and guarantee that she will not remove the single person discount which be so important to pensioner who be already lose out because of the absence of the winter fuel allowance that would put gladness into the heart of elderly people across the country who live on small income 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his comment on my dance move that opinion be subjective like beauty of course on a serious note i find it astonish that conservative members after run down the economy in the way that they do   and after the chancellor have have to come to the house and talk about the pound black hole be now try to claim that this government be about raise taxis this government be about make sure that work people be well off and we intend to do that 
 give that winter fuel payment will no long be there for old people who be not entitle to pension credit what step have the secretary of state take to extend the household support fund so that local authority can provide emergency grant as well as warm space 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about people on pension credit and in particular about the household support fund it be incredibly important that the many people who be entitle to those benefit but be not claim they do so and secondly that the household support fund and the work that we can do to support people be well know we work with local authority which administer the fund to make sure that the money be give to the people who need it the most we inherit very difficult circumstance because of the previous conservative government the chancellor have set out how we can expand the fund to help people who desperately need it 
 devonport dockyard in plymouth have a strong future proudly refit the royal navy ’s submarine however for that to happen the city need among other thing more housing the location for this housing be there in the city centre but it will require a national effort to deliver it will the minister meet a cross party delegation from plymouth to take forward these vital plan 
 i be well aware of the case that the hon lady cite and of that city centre location and i be more than happy to meet that delegation 
 i know from my time as chair of the local government association that all council leader regardless of political persuasion need more money for local government but that there be also a commitment from the sector to reform the sector will the minister confirm his willingness to work with council leader regardless of political persuasion to reform the system and also to take a look at population under counting which be cost my council million of pound each year 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for the work he do in local government and as chair of the lga to make sure that the sector speak with voice and work in collaboration with government to try to get a well outcome for local council this government will continue in that spirit 
 the minister for local government may be aware that liberal democrat control eastleigh borough council be subject to a good   value notice due to its unsustainable £ of debt more audits have be undertake that show that more borrowing be take place so will he meet i to discuss this risk to my constituent and their taxpayer money 
 i be very happy to have a meeting probably next week on that issue 
 as the housing crisis worsen under the last government house in multiple occupation become more prevalent in a number of community include in filton stoke park and stoke gifford naturally with more people live in more home than be envisage when the local infrastructure be plan there be an impact on public service and the character of community and route such as permit development be regularly be use to start extension and conversion will the minister meet i as the government shape much need change to the planning framework and regulation to discuss how hmos might be include in an appropriate way 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and i be more than happy to meet she to discuss those issue 
 devolution be a positive thing and we welcome it gloucestershire which have my constituency of cheltenham within it have coterminous boundary for the county council a police force a fire service an economic development function and a health service but there be fear that in a devolution deal it may be group with other area to the north or perhaps make part of an exist devolution deal to the south can the secretary of state or another minister confirm that that will not be the case 
 within the couple of day of this government the deputy prime minister write to local authority leader invite they for discussion on devolution agreement of the found principle be of course geography that make sense and have coterminous boundary for public service and the rest do make sense without go into the specific of individual conversation that be take place i advise the hon member to bring that point into the work on the english devolution bill which will make sure that all of england have a voice and a role in devolution 
 the deputy prime minister have show that her footwork at the dispatch box be as good as her footwork on the dance floor at this year ’s election veteran who bring along their veteran id card to prove their identity be turn away will the minister guarantee that this will change 
 i be grateful for that very important question veteran be turn away at the recent election we have commit to change that and we will introduce the necessary regulation in due course 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the situation in ukraine 
 i be grateful to the right hon member for ask this urgent question on a matter that be so critical as the house be well aware russia ’s illegal invasion of ukraine pose a significant threat to euro atlantic security and have strike at the heart of the international rule base system on which our security and prosperity depend

 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question and may i also thank the minister for her response 
 the whole house condemn and continue to be appal by putin ’s illegal and outrageous attack on a neighbour foreign state we condemn the missile and    drone attack launch by putin against ukraine in recent week which target critical infrastructure ahead of winter and murder ukrainian citizen tragically a missile strike the week before last kill a british national ryan evans who be in ukraine work for reuters he and his friend and family be in our thought today 
 opposition members welcome the fact that negotiation have be initiate on contract under the recently sign defence export support treaty that be a positive step increase britain ’s defence production remain a national priority so that we can provide more weapon to ukraine and build up our own stock in government we make it clear that appoint a defence production envoy with a direct line to the prime minister would be an effective way of help we to realise that aim   i would be grateful if the minister could update the house on whether the government intend to see that plan through above all this government must continue as their predecessor do to press our ally to go far and by work closely with germany and france in particular as well as with the american government to procure the vital supply that ukraine must receive the country support ukraine be able to leverage a collective gdp and a combined defence budget many time large than russia ’s will the minister confirm that we be press ally to follow the uk ’s multi year funding commitment for military aid 
 turn to the situation in the kursk region we agree with the government that under article of the un charter ukraine ’s right to self defence against illegal russian attack do not preclude operation inside russia furthermore together with our ally we must equip ukraine so that it be not hamper in its ability to degrade the russian war effort before it be fully deploy it be our intention as his majesty ’s opposition to help the government as they in turn take all the necessary decision to secure advantage and victory for ukraine but in give that support we expect the government to continue the firm and clear leadership demonstrate by the last conservative government 
 i share in the condemnation of the appalling russian attack that the right hon member mention he talk about the impact on critical infrastructure and indeed on a british national the whole house will want to send our condolence to his family and share in the sorrow it be such a dreadful incident of course we have see other appalling attack include on other form of civilian infrastructure as child be return to school in many part of england today we also see child return to school in ukraine but on friday a year old girl be kill in kharkiv and over the past few day a child ’s rehabilitation centre have be attack through russian aggression we be absolutely determined that we will continue that rejection of russian aggression 
 the right hon member talk in particular about the need to ensure that we have that provision of armament we be seek to ensure that we have a national armament director so that we have that prioritisation he also talk about the need to work with our ally which as i mention in my statement and will underline again the prime minister have prioritise he discuss it in detail with olaf scholz and with president macron and clearly it be critical at the european political community   meeting the agreement that be come to with that call of action against the shadow fleet be incredibly important and it cover the eu and many other european country 
 the right hon member talk about the need for a multi year approach include from our ally and we will continue to advocate for that that multi year support be critical for the uk we have be clear that we will extend it until or as long as be require that be an incredibly important commitment make by the new uk government 
 the right hon member also talk about the action we have see take place in kursk he be right that they be defensive action they would not have take place have we not see the illegal invasion of ukraine the language he use to describe they be therefore completely appropriate when it come to equip ukraine in that defensive activity of course we will continue and indeed have intensify our commitment towards that i be pleased to hear his commitment to cross party work on that my party be determined to ensure cross party work when in opposition so i be pleased to hear he affirm that from his new position on the opposition benches we will ensure that we prioritise our support for ukraine in the future and i hope he will work with we to do so
