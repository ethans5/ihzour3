i sincerely thank my right hon friend   the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers   for secure this adjournment debate and for her powerful speech she really bring the subject to life through the example from her constituency of people ’s experience in hospital they be very difficult story to hear and i be very sorry to hear of time when it sound like the care for people ’s love one have fall short 
 my right hon friend make some powerful point that i want to address start with the fact that as she say there be many thousand of people live with dementia and the number be only expect to increase indeed there will be more than a by many people with dementia will also be live with other health condition at the moment it be estimate that around a quarter of the bed in hospital be be use by patient with dementia so ensure that people receive the right care when they be in hospital with dementia be really important as be do our utmost to avoid unnecessary admission and ensure that people be discharge from hospital on a timely basis 
 it be really worth emphasise the point that my right hon friend make about dignity and the fact that every single person count at whatever stage of their life there be challenge to ensure that people live with dementia have that dignity particularly when they be in hospital i too pay tribute to the many unpaid carer who be look after their love one with dementia i know what a huge burden and challenge that can be however much someone love somebody there be a huge demand on they when they be care for somebody with dementia it can be very difficult very distressing and absolutely relentless however much they love they i pay tribute to all carer who be do that 
 my right hon friend speak about lisa rutter who very sadly lose her mother who be live with dementia during the pandemic in hospital if i hear my right hon friend correctly i thank lisa rutter for the work that she be do as the founder of dementia club uk it be fabulous to be support other people to look after love one with dementia or indeed those with dementia themselves my right hon friend talk about the time lisa ’s mother spend in hospital and how for instance lisa know what her mother need but feel that she be not listen to and that it may have contribute to her mother ’s death my right hon friend also talk about the visit restriction during the pandemic i will talk about those in a moment 
 my right hon friend talk about another constituent whose wife be in hospital she rightly talk about the importance of mobilise somebody with dementia and how her constituent ’s wife be nearly give the wrong medication which could have be fatal she speak about the importance of his intervention she also speak about a constituent who be a carer for their father and the importance of mobilisation and some of the communication challenge for somebody with dementia 
 my right hon friend talk about person who have be scream all night as describe by the staff actually the family member who know they understand that they be call for help as they need to go to the toilet that bring to life how difficult it can be when somebody have dementia and be not necessarily   able to articulate their need and what they want those who know they well will often know what they be try to say or communicate but that can be difficult in hospital when they may be be look after by staff who simply do not know they well enough to know what they mean 
 my right hon friend talk about food be leave uneaten if somebody be not eat in hospital clearly they be likely to lose weight and their condition may deteriorate she also talk about medication be stop and she talk particularly about somebody whose partner have early onset dementia and have be cop fairly well at home he walk into a&e and that be very sadly the last time he walk that emphasise the challenge of keep people move and maintain their ability to be mobile during a hospital stay she also describe the fight to visit outside visit hour 
 i very much hear my right hon friend ’s ask on visitor access volunteer be train in dementia care as well as staff training and avoid discharge delay among other thing i will pick up on some of those 
 on the challenge of care for people with dementia when in hospital many hospital have work hard to do well for patient with dementia for example create dementia friendly environment by change the colour and lie out ensure that staff be train in dementia and have dementia lead and dementia lead nurse as well as have training for volunteer standard training in care for people with dementia be available through nhs england for staff and volunteer 
 clearly my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet describe example where care fall short i have no doubt that across the nhs with the work already take place we can go far i will raise the point that she make about secondary care with my colleague the minister for health and secondary care so that we can work together on ensure that care be right in hospital he also have oversight of workforce and we should focus on whether the training that i know be available be be take up by enough staff consider the number of people in hospital with dementia 
 on visit my right hon friend speak about a subject that be close to my heart have be involve in some of the decision about social care visit restriction during the pandemic and know how hard those decision be weigh up the infection control concern and ensure people could spend time with love one we have be put in place change to care quality commission regulation to make visit a fundamental right a fundamental part of care and a fundamental standard of care to ensure well access for love one to their family member in care home and in hospital i know in particular how important that be for people with dementia among other the cqc be consult on the implementation of the regulatory change which will be live shortly i believe we have take a significant step to address concern express about visit 
 another thing my right hon friend speak about be fast discharge i be very alert to the risk of patient deconditione in hospital particularly patient with dementia that be why over the past year or so we have work hard with the nhs to get well at identify patient at great risk of deconditione in particular   those with dementia on their admission to hospital we have do early discharge planning and have be get care transfer hub establish all across the country which will do the work on more complex discharge often someone with dementia may need more access to social care we may need to increase the access to availability and supply of social care so that it be there for those who will need it when they leave hospital we have make some real progress on that over the past year 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the financial settlement for scotland 
 last weekend scotland once again show the world that we can host fantastic sporting event with the world athletics indoor championships hold in glasgow i offer my congratulation to everyone involve and especially to medal winner jemma reekie from ayrshire and josh kerr from edinburgh who be the scottish man to win a gold medal in those championship in over year i also congratulate the scottish rugby team who thank to their recent victory over england have now win the calcutta cup time in a row it would have be in a row but covid get in the way laughter 
 contrary to what we hear from the scottish national party the scottish government be well fund this uk government have provide a record block grant average £ a year with an additional £ across the last fiscal event scotland also continue to benefit from the barnett formula under which the scottish government receive around more funding per person than equivalent spending across the united kingdom 
 will the secretary of state explain how his government ’s £ cut to scotland ’s capital budget over the next year will impact the provision of infrastructure include road hospital school new home digital connectivity and the economic growth we need to escape the recession into which the tories have drag we 
 it be nice to see that the hon lady and her colleague have turn up for work today even if that be in defiance of the deputy leader of the snp who think they should not bother come let i be clear on resource spending and the capital budget the scottish government be able to divert their resource spending for capital infrastructure investment and they can also borrow to enhance capital investment if they so choose 
 the secretary of state be correct that the block grant from the uk conservative government to scotland be the high it have ever be   despite that just last week the snp green government push through their tax and axe budget in scotland do my right hon friend agree that the nationalist have get the wrong priority for scotland by cut service while increase income tax rate for anyone earn more than £ 
 i agree with my hon friend and i add far that the scottish government ’s tax band as oppose to the uk government ’s tax band be really hold scotland back 
 i call the shadow minister 
 while the snp and the tories argue about the financial settlement between the government they do agree on thing that work people should pay the price of this economic mess by raise tax to sky high level and secondly at least until today that oil and gas giant earn record profit should not face a proper windfall tax although it now seem as if the snp might be the only people hold out on that position who do the secretary of state support the scottish tory leader who be stand up in holyrood today attack an extension of the windfall tax or the chancellor who we understand be about to announce exactly that 
 my position have always be clear i believe that the energy profit levy on the excess profit cause by putin ’s illegal war in ukraine be the right thing for the government to do to give support to people in the cost of living crisis 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 it start so well and i agree with the secretary of state about the calcutta cup i be there to witness an historic occasion and about the world athletics indoor championships in glasgow i play rugby with jemma reekie ’s cousin for many year and i send my congratulation to they however everything from that point on from both side of the house have be absolute nonsense 
 at a time when many scot be struggle to pay their energy or shopping bill due to the rapid inflation that the secretary of state ’s government have preside over and with inflation in the public sector run even higher his government have cut the scottish government ’s funding in real term again commons library research show that the scottish block grant will be at its low level of uk government spending since the start of devolution as the secretary of state count down the week to his departure be he proud of his legacy 
 that be an easy to answer mr speaker as i be very proud of my legacy rather like win calcutta cup i have win in court with the scottish government time and there be any number of thing i would like to list for my legacy importantly the scottish government receive a record block of £ and record barnett consequential on top of that spend in scotland be high per person than the uk average so that equate to an extra £ 
 i have no idea we should all just be very grateful for the largesse of the secretary of state but do that largesse extend to capital funding capital funding to the scottish parliament have not just be cut but slash by on his watch that money could have be use to invest in hospital school and infrastructure and it be about to be fritter away by the chancellor on a sickening pre election bribe that precisely no will buy will he finally accept that it be his government ’s bust or bust austerity that be drive public service to the edge and do he support tax cut at a time when even tory voter know that increase public investment be require 
 this be nonsense austerity be not a thing under this government not a thing at all laughter no absolutely not departmental spending this be the point that the snp do not acknowledge throughout this parliament have grow by on average that be the simple truth 
 what discussion he have have with a the scottish government and b cabinet colleague on the scottish government ’s international relation policy 
 i have have frequent and recent discussion with the foreign secretary on the scottish government ’s international relation policy foreign affair be reserve to the united kingdom government we have be clear to the scottish government that they must respect that 
 may i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s comment about the scottish victory in the calcutta cup 
 do the right hon gentleman share my concern that these recent foray into international relation by the snp be not only inappropriate because it be a reserved matter but potentially damaging both to important relationship between scotland ’s government and critically to uk foreign policy at a time when international tension be at a height we have not see since the cold war 
 i agree with the hon lady it be important that the united kingdom government speak with voice and the united kingdom be see to speak with voice on foreign affair i note that angus robertson have produce another independence document this week on foreign affair and defence and there be a lot of nonsense in there the scottish government want to join the nato nuclear alliance but they want to get rid of the nuclear deterrent they want to join the eu but not the euro they want to have a scottish spy agency some be refer to it as the sleekit service with agent head across europe in their bulletproof motorhome it be all nonsense and a complete waste of taxpayer money 
 whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague on promote trade between scotland and northern ireland 
 i be pleased to say that i have have discussion with the secretary of state for northern ireland about maximise trade link now that the northern ireland executive have be restore what be more the uk government have commit to establish the east west council which will identify opportunity for deepen connection between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom include the scope for extend the northern ireland investment zone benefit to stranraer and cairnryan 
 will the minister ensure that business body in scotland be fully aware of for example the new intertrade uk body so that business can prosper between northern ireland and scotland importantly will he ensure that people can see the improvement in business trade flow between scotland and northern ireland in month time as compare with month ago 
 as set out in the command paper the uk government be work to establish intertrade uk which will fulfil our pledge to grow the economy by ensure that business large and small can make the most of the east west trading opportunity implement the windsor framework and the command paper be the government ’s priority and we will provide an update in close time 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in scotland 
 we prioritise bring inflation down which be the key to reduce cost of living pressure we deliver on the prime minister ’s promise by more than halve it in addition the uk government support household with a package worth £ or on average £ per household across the united kingdom include in scotland 
 family in my homeland be reel from the cost of living crisis as both the tory uk government and the snp scottish government have jointly load they with the high tax burden in year do the minister agree that it be time both government stop go round in circle leave the dance and clear the floor for labour government to sort out their sorry mess 
 i do not agree with the hon gentleman ’s conclusion thank to this government worker in scotland benefit from £ back in their pocket thank to the national insurance cut in january however i do agree with he in not agree with the snp government ’s approach to tax make scotland the highest tax part of the united kingdom 
 scottish rail fare be set to rise by next month this eye water fare hike will hit scots hard during a cost of live crisis and push scotland ’s rail service into a spiral of decline do the minister agree that we need affordable fare to help people through the cost of live crisis and encourage more people to travel by train 
 i certainly agree that we should do all we can to encourage people to travel by train the scottish government ’s approach to scotrail might discourage that i be happy to meet the hon member to discuss that far 
 recent finding from the trussell trust have reveal that of people claim universal credit in scotland have fall into debt because they could not pay essential bill do the minister agree that the people of scotland and the people of britain should not be make to pay for snp and tory failure 
 in there be few people in absolute poverty after housing cost than there be in include few child this government be certainly take lot of action to address poverty and particularly in work poverty but i agree that make scotland the highest tax part of the uk do not help with that 
 do the minister agree that put up taxis as the snp be do at present will do nothing to help with the cost of living do he far agree that if it continue on that trajectory more and more scot will want to leave and come to place such as carlisle where of course they will be very welcome 
 due to the snp ’s tax rise in scotland anyone earn more than £ will pay more income tax than those live in england from my own experience represent a borders constituency i see increase evidence of people choose to live south of the border rather than in the high tax scottish jurisdiction in my discussion with science technology engineering and math business i find that they be find it increasingly difficult to recruit in scotland because of the aggressive high tax policy of the snp 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 regardless of what the chancellor announce today we be in the high tax raise parliament in history which be a consequence of the minister ’s government ’s failure over year ordinary hard work scots do not cause this economic crisis the government do but they be be make to pay for it there have be tory tax rise since the last election and the average family be much bad off as a result do the minister agree with the institute for fiscal studies that even after today ’s budget the overall tax burden on work people will still reach record level 
 clearly i will not speculate on what the chancellor will announce shortly i remind the hon gentleman that worker in scotland have benefit from £ go back into their pocket thank to the change to national insurance that have already be announce 
 in relation to the hon member ’s wide point about the tax burden we should not forget the huge intervention that the government make to support worker family community and business during the pandemic as a consequence we be have to repay that but that save job and many business from go under during the covid pandemic 
 regardless of what the chancellor say today work people will still be pay a much high tax burden at the end of this parliament and it will reach record level shockingly the tax burden in scotland be even high anyone in scotland earn more than £ a year will pay more income tax after the snp vote for yet another tax rise on work people that mean we be in the absurd position in scotland of the snp raise taxis on nurse and teacher while oppose labour ’s plan for an extended windfall tax on the oil and gas giant we even hear that the leader of the scottish conservatives threaten to resign last night on potentially another u turn from the chancellor on the windfall tax do the minister accept that the good thing to happen now would be for this circus to be bring for an end and for the prime minister to call the election 
 as i say i will not speculate on the content of the budget but when the election come scotland ’s voter will have a clear choice a party who will stand up for scotland ’s place in a strong united kingdom or the scottish national party who want another referendum i be unclear what the labour party have to offer 
 whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague on farm gate price for farmer and crofter in scotland 
 we want all farmer to get a fair price for their product the government have commit to tackle contractual unfairness in the agrifood supply chain we will use the power in the agriculture act whenever necessary at the national farmers union conference the prime minister announce that the uk farm to fork summit will be an annual event that will help to strengthen joint working by government and external partner to support a prosperous agrifood sector 
 the minister should be aware that his colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs have recently conclude a consultation on contractual relationship in the fresh produce industry at a time when of dairy farmer doubt that they will continue in business into will he impress on his colleague in defra and the department for business and trade that urgent action be need in relation to that consultation 
 as the son of a borders farmer i completely understand the invaluable work that farmer and crofter do to put food on table across scotland and the united kingdom this government will continue to support the agriculture and food production sector   scotland office ministers regularly attend the inter ministerial group for environment food and rural affair along with representative from the devolved administration this group oversee how change to price supply and trade affect our market we will continue to take whatever action be necessary support that important sector 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication of allegation of impropriety in public life for his department 's work on strengthen the union 
 our union be strong interruption yes it be scotland ’s contribution to our united kingdom be beyond doubt and this government ’s commitment to scotland be without question from freeport and investment zone to the record block grant and £ for the city and region growth deal we deliver for scotland 
 snp mp have be disengage from westminster for year do the secretary of state agree that it be a disgrace that its deputy leader have say that its mps will not engage should the party win seat at the next general election do he also agree that member elect to this house should turn up and do their job 
 i agree with the hon lady 
 year ago on   march we have a debate in this house on precisely the subject of this question at the time i be concern that nicola sturgeon ’s government be cover up interference in the complaint process against the minister since then in defiance of the information commissioner and of a court order they have continue to cover up will the cabinet secretary look at whether the ministerial code and the civil service code have be break 
 my right hon friend should write to the cabinet secretary and ask he to do that very thing 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of support for the marine energy sector in scotland 
 the government be firmly committed to support scotland ’s marine energy sector to grow around of tidal stream contract award through contract for difference in the last round will be deploy in scotland in addition horizon europe select scottish base uk tidal stream developer to deliver project in orkney they will lead construction on £ project fund by the uk government ’s financial guarantee 
 the minister know that successive energy ministers have hugely help the development of the marine energy sector in scotland as elsewhere in the united kingdom do my hon friend agree that there be an opportunity in the next round of the renewable auction to allow for wave technology alongside tidal   stream technology will he encourage the scottish government to speed up approval of site to get great green energy project start as soon as possible in scotland as elsewhere 
 i be grateful for that important question the government be undertake analysis of the technology pipeline available for contract for difference auction round against our legal obligation to ensure that the auction round be competitive we be consider the appropriate parameter for all technology include tidal stream and wave energy the final parameter will be publish in the budget notice this month ahead of the auction round opening 
 the seastar tidal farm off the coast of orkney be set to be the large tidal energy farm anywhere in the world and it be support by eu funding through the european marine energy centre this come after edinburgh university ’s report find that the uk government could save hundred of million of pound by bring forward the development of tidal by year if it work more closely with its eu partner it be clear that the eu ’s role in this in europe and around scotland be very important so if scotland be well together with anyone be it not well together with the eu and its investment in tidal 
 what a load of nonsense scotland be much well serve by be part of the united kingdom and we will continue to support all renewable energy sector include tidal 
 whether he have have recent discussion with a cabinet colleague and b the scottish government on wait time for cross border nhs provision 
 the government recognise the invaluable job that all nhs worker do i see that every day of the week in my constituency in the scottish borders that be why the secretary of state for health and social care have write to the scottish government about work together to reduce patient waiting time we continue to be open to explore that far 
 i have a lady constituent who suffer from a rare and dangerous condition call subglottic stenosis only clinic have the expertise to treat the condition and it be in london yet our local health board be refuse to refer she it say that it can offer another treatment but it be think to be less safe and possibly not very effective what step be the government take to ensure that patient regardless of which side of the border they live on get the good possible treatment 
 i be regularly remind particularly as an mp for the borders of the need for healthcare to benefit people on either side of the border particularly through cross border work with the nhs local people in the borders often get treatment fast and more easily because of that sadly the hon member have highlight a real problem with scotland ’s nhs   thank to the mismanagement by the snp government in edinburgh particularly in rural health service he have identify a very distressing case for his constituent and i be very happy to write to the scottish government along with he to raise the case with they 
 what step he be take to promote scotland ’s food export 
 scotland office ministers have bang the drum tirelessly to promote the scottish food and drink industry overseas include on trade mission in europe india the united states of america and vietnam in vietnam sale of scotch whisky have increase fourfold and be still grow i be delighted to discuss what more can be do to improve trade link and market access with the vietnamese government during my recent visit 
 scotland ’s farming and fish sector produce some of the fine produce in the world will the secretary of state do all he can to promote the sale of scottish smoke salmon abroad as a premium product know the world over 
 i think i hear smoke salmon but this be not just about smoke salmon the most recent figure show that scotland ’s world lead food and drink sector account for of all uk food and drink export to help the sector to continue to flourish the government have secure trade agreement with non eu country and the eu total uk trade with those partner be worth £ 
 i thank the minister for that answer scotland ’s food export—[interruption 
 order mr cunningham sit down 
 some of scotland ’s food export company have be prevent from trade with northern ireland the intertrade uk body have be set up as a result of discussion that have take place what be the minister and his department do to ensure that the company that have stop trade with northern ireland be encourage to start do so again 
 in the uk command paper we say that we be set up the east west council which will work to bring about the solution 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the uk ’s departure from the eu on scotland 
 the uk government be work tirelessly to maximise opportunity follow our departure from the european union scotland continue to punch above its weight both in export of good and service and in foreign direct investment and i be delighted to be able to say that trade be now well above pre brexit level 
 scotland have be hammer by westminster ’s imposition of a hard brexit with the scottish salmon industry alone suffer an additional £ of brexit red tape cost across every sector of scotland ’s economy brexit have add red tape cost limited access to vital worker and limited market be the secretary of state proud of his legacy which include a deliberate and avoidable undermining of scotland ’s economy 
 as the right hon gentleman will appreciate our departure from the eu have allow we to forge new relationship consequently scotland ’s export be perform well they be up by 
 will my right hon friend join i in welcome the completion of fishery negotiation with the faroe islands which have result in tonne of fishing quota mostly for the scottish fleet do he agree that since the uk become an independent coastal state the scottish fleet and those who negotiate on its behalf include snp scottish government ministers and their official have a far strong voice in these annual negotiation than if the snp have its way and we go back into the eu common fishery policy 
 my hon friend be a great champion of the fishing industry and i completely agree with he 
 we now come to prime minister ’s question we be join today in the gallery by the speaker of the supreme council of the kyrgyz republic 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday march 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house include listen to the chancellor ’s budget statement i shall have further such meeting later today 
 the uk use to be a world leader in psilocybin research but despite the call of the home affairs committee lead researcher charity veteran organisation and the royal college of psychiatrists we have shamefully fall behind on breakthrough treatment for condition such as post traumatic stress disorder and depression cause misery to million of people in our country can the prime minister explain why this policy remain the responsibility of a home office that can not give it the attention it deserve and why it be okay that american canadian and australian patient can access treatment that british patient can not 
 i completely sympathise and understand why people suffer from distressing condition will want to seek the good possible treatment available and i thank the hon lady for raise the issue we be committed to ensure that the uk be a world lead   jurisdiction for pharmaceutical clinical and other medical research and we have ask the advisory council on the misuse of drugs to review barrier to legitimate medical research involve control drug such as psilocybin i be pleased to tell the hon lady that our response to the council ’s recommendation will be publish as soon as possible 
 my constituency have a long and proud history of farming with generation of the same family help to feed our nation not since world war have we be so aware of how important food security be to our national security so will the prime minister update the house on what his government be do to support our fantastic farmer 
 as i set out at the nfu conference just a couple of week ago we will always back british farmer for continue to produce fantastic food we be accelerate that plan with the large package of grant ever indeed of the new scheme open just today support farmer with up to £ towards the purchase of new equipment and technology our scheme in england be all about more choice not less unlike labour in wales we will never introduce top down arbitrary target that damage farm income damage our food security and take farmer back to square 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 year ago sarah everard be walk home when she be abduct and murder by a serve police officer who should have be trust to keep she safe as a father i can not imagine the pain her parent her family and her friend be go through in this difficult anniversary week lady angiolini ’s report expose the appalling failure in police vet and in misconduct process and i be very troubled by its conclusion that there be 
 nothing to stop another couzens operate in plain sight 
 how can that be the case year on from this horrendous crime 
 can i say that i be sure all member of the house will have be think about sarah everard in recent week it be as the right hon and learn gentleman say an absolutely shocking case and the abuse of power in particular be appalling that be why we take action quickly to strengthen police vetting and strengthen the rule for root out officer who be not fit to serve and conduct the large ever screening of all serve officer and staff we be now ensure that any officer who have be charge with a crime will be suspend from duty automatically until their case be conclude and we will thoroughly consider all the report ’s recommendation and respond in full 
 the prime minister mention vet and i just want to press he on that because serious failure in police vetting be raise in independent report as long ago as and that be why labour have be argue for mandatory national vetting standard that would stop anybody with a history of domestic abuse or sexual offending be allow to join the police in the place why be mandatory national vetting standard not already in place 
 it be vital for public confidence that those who be not fit to wear the badge be root out of the police and not able to join in the place that be why the college of policing update its statutory code on vetting and that happen quickly in addition the police inspectorate carry out a rapid inspection of all force progress against the previous finding and in addition to that an entire check against the national police database be carry out for all serve officer and staff 
 i be obviously very familiar with code in criminal justice system but—[interruption this be too serious for that there be a world of difference between a code and bind mandatory standard which do not have legal effect and that should trouble member across the house 
 couzens history of sexual offending stretch back many year on occasion despite allegation of indecent exposure he be not sack we know that indecent exposure be a gateway to more horrific crime as be tragically show to be the case not only in sarah everard ’s case but in that of libby squire but it be not treat with the seriousness require the angiolini report recommend review all indecent exposure allegation against serve officer in order to identify investigate and remove those officer from service give the obvious urgency of this recommendation can the prime minister give a categorical assurance that it will be implement immediately 
 the home secretary address this specifically when he make his statement indecent exposure just like any other kind of sexually motivated crime be abhorrent and we expect police chief to take it extremely seriously we fully expect police chief to suspend an officer charge with any kind of sexually motivated crime it be worth point out that in addition to the new power that the home secretary outline about automatic suspension chief constable have exist power to suspend any officer in their force when allegation be make and we fully expect they to use those power 
 i do think the recommendation that i refer to should be implement urgently and i ask the prime minister to look again at that because every day that go past when it be not implement carry risk for victim in these case 
 sarah everard ’s murder should have be a watershed moment for police reform for the criminal justice system and for violence against woman and girl but the sad reality be that victim of rape who have the courage and bravery to come forward have just a chance of their perpetrator be catch and charge within the year how do the prime minister expect woman to have confidence in the criminal justice system when almost all rapist do not see the inside of a courtroom 
 as we acknowledge a couple of year ago of course we need to do more to improve rape outcome in the criminal justice system and the rape review action plan be show considerable progress we have already increase the average sentence for rape by a since labour be last in office by the way use a power that the labour party vote against in this house thank to our action plan we have see police referral double and charge double and last   year there be a increase in rape conviction and now rapist will serve every single day of their sentence behind bar 
 the right hon and learn gentleman raise his time at the crown prosecution service but he have not acknowledge that under his tenure rape conviction actually drop 
 the prime minister know that be go to be fact check he also know that i support tough sentence i really think that victim of violence against woman and girl deserve well than this nonsense from the prime minister it need to be take seriously it be not a game 
 we all want more victim to come forward but we have to be honest that unless thing change the criminal justice system will continue to fail they that be why we be committed to introduce specialist rape and sexual offence team in every force to give victim specialist support and confidence that their experience will be investigate properly when will the prime minister commit to do the same 
 we have already implement the rape review action plan the leader of the opposition say that we need to take this seriously and here be the thing that we have do we have end the appalling digital strip search of victim mobile phone we have ensure that there be well use of pre recorded cross examination we have roll out operation soteria with incredible success across all the nation ’s police force we have significantly increase the number of independent sexual and domestic violence and abuse adviser to up to and there be more specialist training in all police force for these prosecution that be the plan we have already put in place and it be a plan that be work to ensure that we keep the woman and girl of this country safe 
 the problem be that the rosy picture the prime minister try to paint of the current criminal justice system be completely at odd with the confidence that many woman currently have in it with the publication of the angiolini report the country deserve to know that we be do all we can to make our country safe for woman that start with what should be the most basic task create a safe workplace here in westminster at the moment as everyone in this house know we be fail in that endeavour and we all have a duty to change that when will the prime minister make time for the vote on ban from parliament those mp who face allegation of sex offence 
 it be absolutely right that we ensure our community be safe for woman and girl which be why we pass the landmark domestic abuse act why we set up a new victim support line why we quadruple funding for victim support and why we be invest in practical thing like cctv and well streetlighting for safe community up and down the country of course there be always more we can do but this government have a strong track record on ensure that woman across this country feel safe 
 i want the prime minister to know that the people of romford be struggle with ever increase energy price yet provider be make huge profit that run into the   hundred of million do he agree that reduction in wholesale price should be pass on to consumer and that stand charge should be bring down will the government hold utility company to account for their action 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the challenge that high energy bill have pose not just to his constituent in romford but to constituent across the country that be why we step in with a significant package of support that pay around half of a typical household energy bill when price be at their high 
 i know my hon friend will join i in welcome the fact that the energy price cap be set to fall by almost £ in april which will bring relief to many family but we must hold company to account that be why we introduce the energy profit levy on the windfall profit cause by an unexpected increase in energy price we be go far to cut people ’s cost by cut their taxis and put more money into their family bank account 
 i call the scottish national party leader 
 much to my surprise this morning it have be widely report that the conservative party in scotland be absolutely furious that westminster be about to tax scotland ’s natural resource in order to pay for a tax cut in england be the prime minister in danger of turn his colleague into nationalist 
 obviously i would not comment on the budget but i will say that when i be in scotland last week it be crystal clear that there have only ever be party consistently stand up for the north sea energy industry and it be the scottish conservatives 
 the prime minister know that not to be the case but there be a serious point to be make here the conservative party want to use scotland ’s natural resource to pay for tax cut in england and the labour party want to use scotland ’s natural resource to pay for nuclear power station in england the cost of that be up to job scotland ’s wealth resource and job be all a game to westminster with the tories on just in the poll in scotland now will the prime minister do we all a favour and call a general election 
 the hon gentleman claim to be supportive of the north sea energy industry but why have he oppose all the measure that we have take to protect those job in scotland over the past couple of year he talk about tax in scotland and england i gently point out to he that thank to the action of the chancellor and this uk government everyone in scotland have receive a significant tax cut from january this year in contrast to the chancellor ’s last budget the snp ’s budget put taxis up for work scot scotland be now the high tax capital of the uk but this conservative government be go to keep cut taxis for hard work scot 
 the government be rightly act to compensate properly the horizon victim who be highlight by alan bates ’s legal challenge however there be thousand   more sub postmaster across the country who be not prosecute but face financial penalty for bogus shortfall cause they enormous financial and personal distress do the prime minister agree that we should now be do everything possible to do right by all the victim of a gross miscarriage of justice clear their name and at last properly financial compensate they 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the appalling impact that this miscarriage of justice have have on people ’s mental health as he acknowledge our focus be on deliver justice for the postmaster and that be why we will introduce legislation to overturn conviction and pave the way for the swift payment of compensation i thank he for his long stand campaign on mental health on this issue and i assure he that the postal minister be closely examine the issue he raise be consider next step and will keep my right hon friend closely informed 
 the prime minister will be aware that the government ’s proposal to deal with the legacy of our troubled past in northern ireland continue to be the subject of scrutiny most recently in the high court ruling in relation to compatibility with our human right obligation many family of victim in northern ireland be deeply disappointed with the lack of co operation by the irish government in relation to murder commit in their jurisdiction or from their jurisdiction in relation to the omagh bomb inquiry for example the irish government have decline to conduct a public inquiry on this bad atrocity in our troubled past despite the court urge they to do so will the prime minister continue to press the irish government on the need for they to make available facility to enable the family of innocent victim include in omagh to pursue justice for their love one 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question on this important topic which i know will be of great interest not only to his constituent but to many other across northern ireland the government have set forward their plan to deal with the legacy of the past and will continue to engage with everyone in northern ireland whatever their view to set out the good way forward i can confirm to he that the secretary of state for northern ireland have raise these specific issue directly with the irish government and will continue to do so i too speak to the taoiseach about this very matter we would hope to see further co operation on omagh and many other outstanding case that involve irish jurisdiction because like my right hon friend i want to give family as much information as possible 
 putin have put the russian economy on a total war footing he have increase military spending by to of gdp he claim this month that over new job have be create in the arm industry which now employ an estimate russians on my recent visit to ukraine i have meet government ministers and senior military figure who have express great frustration to i about the length of time it be take to develop collaboration in build a defence manufacturing capability jointly with uk   defence company in ukraine will my right hon friend meet i to discuss how we can unblock the bureaucracy and as our ukrainian friend say 
 build the arsenal of the free world together 
 i reassure my hon friend that we remain steadfast in our support for ukraine and we will not allow putin to achieve his aim of eradicate ukrainian freedom and democracy our cross government taskforce be work diligently to support the armed force of ukraine and lead uk and ukrainian defence industrial co operation i be pleased to say that in december last year we conduct our successful trade mission to ukraine alongside the uk defence industry the government and uk industry will continue to work hand in glove with our ukrainian ally seize the opportunity for collaboration and bolster our joint defence industry 
 last week the institute for public policy research publish a paper state of the north that paper predict that wealth inequality already too large between the north and the south east would increase to nearly £ per head by the end of this decade do the prime minister accept that his levelling up agenda have fail or do he never want it to succeed 
 on the contrary inequality in our country have actually decline under this conservative government when it come to level up in the north the north have receive some of the high amount of per capita levelling up funding of any region in the country after the hon gentleman last pop up to ask i a question about our investment in the north do he manage to get an answer about what exactly be the labour party ’s position on hs2 i would still like to know because we be take that money and reinveste every penny of it across the north in form of transportation that people use every day deliver benefit to community more quickly not just in his constituency but across the entire north that have be warmly welcome everywhere that i have be 
 do my right hon friend agree that the performance of the labour party in vote down our rwanda bill in the house of lords be a disgrace it be only the conservative government and the conservatives who have a plan for deal with illegal immigration and the people smuggler action on illegal immigration be a top priority in my constituency and labour have no policy or plan on this at all 
 my right hon friend make an excellent point he know as i know that if we want fully to stop the boat we need to have a work deterrent so if someone come here illegally we must be able to remove they to a safe country alternative that be why the rwanda scheme be so important and why we be determined to see it through just in the past week an independent report be publish that talk about the labour party ’s policy in this area it make it crystal clear that labour do not have a plan to stop the boat in fact its idea would see the uk accept hundred of thousand more migrant 
 which part of his economic legacy be the prime minister most proud of be it preside over the high tax burden since the world war or be it deliver the slow real wage growth since the napoleonic war 
 save job in the pandemic with the furlough scheme 
 the prime minister will know that there be consensus across this house on the need to build new house where that consensus break down be where those house should be build do the prime minister agree with i that wherever possible new house should be build on brownfield site not on green space not on green field and certainly not on prime farmland 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right sustainable planning must be at the heart of our planning system that be why we be commit to meet the need of community by build home in the right place and as he say make good use of brownfield land we have make it clear that that be what the priority should be and we have put extra funding aside to unlock those site our recent change to the national planning policy framework provide clear protection for the green belt make it clear how future housing supply should be assess that be the clear difference between our party the conservatives will protect the green belt and labour will concrete all over it 
 in some jurisdiction minister routinely publish their tax return the prime minister voluntarily publish his uk tax return last year do he agree that ministers of the crown should publish their tax return as a matter of course and have he ever file any return in the usa that have not be publish 
 i do not think that would be proportionate or appropriate hon member oh no i do not think it would be proportionate for all minister to publish their tax return in keep with long stand tradition i voluntarily publish my tax return as do the chancellor that be the right balance and i have be completely transparent about that as i have do it 
 last year a number of we be on the transatlantic flight power by sustainable aviation fuel this week the international airlines group make its major purchase of that fuel but that fuel be come from the united states and it be important that we have a saf industry in this country will the prime minister tell the treasury and the department for transport to accelerate the work that they be do to put in place the right framework and the right support mechanism to ensure that we have a saf industry for our aviation sector for the future 
 i thank my right hon friend for champion this cause which be absolutely right and reassure he that we be committed to ensure that the saf mandate be in place in that will require about of jet fuel to be make from sustainable    feedstock by i be pleased to tell he that to get there we have provide £ to different uk sustainable aviation fuel project to kickstart our domestic industry and importantly as he also know we have commit to introduce a revenue certainty mechanism to support saf production in the uk as soon as practically possible 
 as our year old roman wall be an important historic monument of world renown will the prime minister join i in chester to walk the wall and explore how the government can support the upkeep of these important structure which unlike the conservative party be stable solid and in no danger of imminent collapse 
 more 
 i join the hon lady in pay tribute to the history of her local community i be pleased that the city of chester be benefit from so much investment from the conservative government so that it can maintain its local infrastructure 
 week ago conservative mp from across south east london and kent write to transport for london and the labour mayor of london to call on they to do the right thing follow the botched implementation of a temporary mph speed limit on the a20 near sidcup which have see thousand of driver unfairly issue with fine and point on their licence it have leave many driver include carer emergency service worker and teacher at risk of lose their licence and job despite travel less than mile an hour in the zone do he agree that tfl the met police and sadiq khan must come clean about the number of fine and cancel these issue point 
 i thank my hon friend for the question i understand the concern that local driver have over this ongoing tfl issue although we be do everything we can to back motorist across the country it be disappointing that the labour mayor and indeed labour run wales be hammer driver at every opportunity whether that be with temporary speed limit blanket mph zone or the ultra low emission zone expansion i will make sure my hon friend have a meeting with the responsible minister to discuss his concern 
 to strengthen current spiking legislation forensic evidence be essential the nhs do not have uniform policy for the screening of suspect victim of spike at a&e. we can pass all the law we want in this place but to achieve justice that forensic evidence be vital will the prime minister commit to ensure that hospital emergency department have a statutory obligation to take forensic sample from these victim 
 i agree with the hon lady that spike be an appalling violate crime which seriously undermine public safety particularly the safety of woman and girl and we want to ensure that the exist law recognise the threat that spike pose that be why at   the end of last year we announce a raft of new measure to confront spiking and support victim include change the law to make it clear without any doubt that spiking be illegal as well as other measure such as an online reporting tool invest in research and rapid testing kit and training for bar staff i will ensure that we look into the issue that she raise and write back to she 
 this winter there have be significant flood and storm damage to the infrastructure in and around my constituency of mansfield include our road drain and flood infrastructure it be among the high concern that resident raise with i on a regular basis i be really grateful that from next   year in particular very significant infrastructure funding be come our way but what can my right hon friend do to help fix this for my constituent now 
 i be pleased that in we announce that we would double our flood investment to a record £ in nottinghamshire since we have invest over £ to protect property i know that currently there be a programme in mansfield that be look at surface water and drainage improvement but i will ensure that i talk to the chancellor and that we have a strong economy to keep invest in local infrastructure in my hon friend ’s area that be exactly what we be about to hear from my right hon friend in just a 
 before i call the chancellor of the exchequer i remind hon member that copy of the budget resolution will be available to they from the vote office in member lobby and online at the end of the chancellor ’s statement i also remind hon member that intervention be not take during the chancellor ’s statement or during the reply of the leader of the opposition and the spokesman for the scottish national party i hope that the hubbub on my right will die down and some politeness will prevail before i call the chancellor of the exchequer 
 as we mourn the tragic loss of life in israel and gaza the prime minister remind we last week of the need to fight extremism and heal division so i start today by remember the muslims who die in world war in the service of freedom and democracy we need a memorial to honour they so follow representation from my right hon friend   the member for bromsgrove sir sajid javid   and other i have decide to allocate £ towards the cost of build whatever your faith colour or class this country will never forget the sacrifice make for our future 
 in recent time the uk and the uk economy have deal with a financial crisis a pandemic and an energy shock cause by war in europe yet despite the most challenging economic headwind in modern history under conservative government since growth have be high than in every large european economy unemployment have halve absolute poverty have go down and there be more people in job for every single day that we have be in office interruption of course interest rate remain high as we bring down inflation but because of the progress we have make because we be deliver the prime minister ’s economic priority we can now help family not just with temporary cost of living support but with permanent cut in taxation we do that to give much need help in challenge time and because conservative know that low tax mean high growth and high growth mean more opportunity more prosperity and more funding for our precious public service interruption 
 order the chancellor have hardly say anything—[interruption order you can not get excited yet other people want to hear what the chancellor have to say it matter so we will have a bit of good behaviour please 
 thank you madam deputy speaker 
 if we want that growth to lead to high wage and high living standard for every family in every corner of the country it can not come from unlimited migration it can only come by build a high wage high skill economy not just high gdp but high gdp per head 
 that be the difference the labour party ’s plan would destroy job reduce opportunity and risk family finance with spending that push up taxis instead of go    back to square the policy i announce today mean more investment more job well public service and low taxis in a budget for long term growth 
 i start with the update forecast from the office for budget responsibility for which i thank richard hughes and his team inflation when the prime minister and i come into office it be the late figure show—[interruption 
 order this be not amuse any more we need to hear what the chancellor have to say i can tell who be make the noise and you simply will not get a chance to speak later that be the end of it 
 when the prime minister and i come into office inflation be but the late figure show it be now 4%—more than meet our pledge last year to halve it today ’s forecast from the obr show it fall below the target in just a few month time nearly a whole year early than forecast in the autumn statement 
 that do not happen by accident whatever the pressure and whatever the politic a conservative government work with the bank of england will always put sound money we also understand that tackle inflation while necessary be painful it mean high interest rate and a period of low growth so we have give the average household £ in cost of live support over the past year do so make economic as well as moral sense the obr predict real household disposable income per person would fall by in the past year instead after that support it be on track to rise by 
 today i take further step to help family with cost of living pressure start with measure to help the poor family we have already abolish high charge for electricity pay by those on prepayment meter increase the local housing allowance and raise benefit by double the expected inflation today i focus on those fall into debt nearly household on universal credit take out budgeting advance loan to pay for more expensive emergency such as boiler repair or help get a job to help make such loan more affordable i have decide to increase the repayment period for new loan from month to month 
 for some people—[interruption i think labour members care about people on the low income but trust they not to want to hear about debt for some people the good way to resolve debt be through a debt relief order but get cost £ which can deter the very people who need they most so have listen carefully to representation from citizens advice i today relieve pressure on around family every year by abolish that £ charge completely 
 next the household support fund it be set up on a temporary basis and due to conclude at the end of this month have listen carefully to representation from the joseph rowntree foundation the trussell trust   the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   and my hon friend the members for colchester will quince and for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds among other i have decide that with the battle against inflation still not over now be not the time to stop the target help that it offer we will therefore continue it at current level for another month 
 next i turn to a measure that will help business and household more broadly in the autumn statement i freeze alcohol duty until august of this year without any action today it would have be due to rise by however i have listen carefully to my right hon friend for altrincham and sale west sir graham brady and for vale of glamorgan alun cairns and to my hon friend   the member for moray douglas ross who be a formidable champion of the scottish whisky industry i also listen to councillor john tonks from ash a strong supporter of the wonderful admiral pub who point out the pressure face the industry today i have decide to extend the alcohol duty freeze until february that will benefit pub across the uk on top of the £ saving that a typical pub will get from the business rate discount that i announce in the autumn we value our hospitality industry we be back the great british pub 
 another cost that family and business worry about be fuel the shadow chancellor complain about the freeze on fuel duty labour have oppose it at every opportunity the labour mayor of london want to punish motorist even more with his ultra low emission zone plan however lot of family and sole trader depend on their car if i do nothing fuel duty would increase by this month so instead i have listen to my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel my hon friend the members for stoke on trent north jonathan gullis and for dudley north marco longhi and other as well as to the sun newspaper ’s keep it down campaign i have as a result decide to maintain the 5p cut and freeze fuel duty for another month that will save the average car driver £ next year and bring total saving since the 5p cut be introduce to around £ take together with the alcohol duty freeze that decision also reduce headline inflation by percentage point in allow we to make fast progress towards the bank of england ’s target 
 there can be no solid growth without solid finance an economy base on sound money do not pass its bill to the next generation when it come to borrowing some believe that there be a trade off between compassion and fiscal responsibility they be wrong it be only because we responsibly reduce the deficit by between and that we could provide £ to help business and family in the pandemic labour oppose our plan to reduce the deficit every single step of the way but to be fair they be consistent in coalition the lib dems support control spending but now they say that they would prop up a party that will turn on the spending tap it be the difference between no plan and no principle and i be delighted that for once   the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey   be here to hear that 
 today we say something different there be nothing compassionate about run out of money with the pandemic behind we we must once again be responsible and build up our resilience to future shock that mean bring down borrowing so we can start to reduce our debt and today ’s figure confirm that be happen ahead of my autumn statement in the obr forecast that headline debt would rise to above of gdp today it say that it will fall in   every year to just by accord to the obr underlie debt which exclude bank of england debt will be in then and before fall to in with final year headroom against debt fall of £ our underlie debt be therefore on track to fall as a share of gdp meet our fiscal rule and we continue to have the low level of government debt in the g7 low than that of japan france or the united states 
 we also meet our fiscal rule for public sector borrowing to be below of gdp year early borrowing fall from of gdp in to then and in by the end of the forecast borrowing be at its low level of gdp since none of that of course would be possible if labour implement its pledge to decarbonise the grid year early by by its own calculation that cost £ a year to do last month after flip flopping for month labour say that it be not go to spend the £ after all but will somehow meet its pledge somehow can only mean thing tax rise on work family same old labour 
 today in contrast a conservative government bring down taxis with borrow broadly unchanged in fact borrowing be slightly low than in the autumn statement the fact that we be bring borrow down be of particular importance to very special person sir robert stheeman be the outgoing chief executive of the government ’s debt management office and after year of exceptional public service he be in the gallery thank you sir robert 
 i now turn to growth just after i become chancellor the obr expect gdp to fall by in the following year in fact it grow albeit slowly now the obr expect the economy to grow by this year and next year which be high than its autumn forecast after that growth rise to and in interruption opposition member do not want to hear this but these be the fact since we have grow fast than germany france or italy the large european economy and accord to the international monetary fund we will continue to grow fast than all of they in the year ahead survey by lloyds and deloitte show that business confidence be return in other word because we have turn the corner on inflation we will soon turn the corner on growth 
 today ’s obr forecast also show that we have make good progress on the prime minister ’s economic priority compare to when the pledge be make inflation have halve debt be fall in line with our fiscal rule and growth be fully percentage point high than predict interruption labour member do not have a growth plan so they might as well listen to ours as growth return our plan be for economic growth not growth sustain through migration but growth that raise wage and living standard for family not just high gdp but high gdp per head that mean stick to our plan with a budget for long term growth more investment more job well public service and low taxis 
 i start with investment economist say that stimulate investment be the most effective way to raise productivity and therefore wage and living standard since we have be do just that business—[interruption labour member might want to listen to what i be   about to say because business investment have rise from an average of of gdp under labour to under the conservatives this year it will be of gdp that be £ more business investment than if it have continue at labour level and it be still go up 
 in the short period since the autumn statement nissan have announce that it will build new electric car model in the uk microsoft and google have announce data centre worth over £ thank to my right hon friend the business secretary the global investment summit unlock £ of investment in fact since greenfield foreign direct investment have be high here than anywhere else in europe and for the last year the uk have have the high level in the world after the united states and china and we be not stop there 
 in the autumn statement i announce that we would introduce permanent full expensing a £ tax cut for business that give the uk the most attractive investment tax regime of any large european or g7 country it be welcome by over business leader with the cbi say it be a game changer and the single most transformational thing we could do to fire up the british economy today i take further step to boost investment have listen to call from the cbi make uk and the british chambers of commerce we will shortly publish draft legislation for full expensing to apply to lease asset a change i intend to bring in as soon as it be affordable 
 we will also help small business which be something close to my heart as well as the business rate support and the work on prompt payment that i announce in the autumn i will provide £ of funding to extend the recovery loan scheme as it transition to the growth guarantee scheme help small and medium sized enterprise access the finance they need follow representation from the federation of small businesses as well as my hon friend the members for loughborough jane hunt for southend west anna firth and for rother valley alexander stafford i will reduce the administrative and financial impact of vat by increase the vat registration threshold from £ to £ from   april the increase in year that will bring ten of thousand of business out of pay vat altogether and encourage many more to invest and grow

 we will make sure that there be vehicle to make it easy for pension fund to invest in uk growth opportunity so i be today publish the name of the winner of the lifts long term investment for technology and science competition but i remain concerned that other market such as australia generate well return for pension saver with more effective investment strategy and more investment in high quality domestic growth stock so i will introduce new requirement for define contribution and local government pension fund to disclose publicly their level of international and uk equity investment i will then consider what further action should be take if we be not on a positive trajectory towards international good practice

 i suspect that the new theatre relief may be of particular interest to the shadow chancellor who seem to fancy her thespian skill when it come to act like a tory the trouble be that we all know how her show end high taxis like every labour government in history—[interruption i be delighted that labour members be cheer the fact that labour government always put up taxis they be right 
 i want to mention our life science sector where we will support research by medical charity into disease such as cancer dementia and epilepsy with an additional £ include £ for cancer research uk but i have long believe that we should be manufacture medicine as well as develop they so i can today also announce a brand new investment by of our great life science company astrazeneca lead by mon ami the irrepressible sir pascal soriot astrazeneca make its covid vaccine available to develop country at cost as a result save over life today because of the government ’s support for the life science sector it have announce plan to invest £ in the uk to expand its footprint on the cambridge biomedical campus and fund the building of a vaccine manufacture hub in speke in liverpool that be more investment and well job in every corner of the country in a long term budget for growth from a conservative government

 good public service need a strong economy to pay for they but a strong economy also need good public service in school in the uk be behind germany france and sweden in the oecd ’s pisa programme   for international student assessment education ranking for reading and math now after conservative reform we be ahead of they burglary and violent crime have halve in the last year after we invest in more police officer our armed force remain the most professional and well fund in europe with defence spending already more than of gdp we be provide more military support to ukraine than nearly any other country and our spending will rise to as soon as economic condition allow the nhs be still recover from the pandemic but have more doctor and more nurse than it do under labour that be more doctor and more nurse for every single month that we have be in office 
 resource matter of course which be why despite all the economic shock we have face overall spending on public service have go up since in the case of the nhs by more than a in real term although spending have continue to rise every year public sector productivity still remain below pre pandemic level by nearly this demonstrate that the way to improve public service be not always more money or more people we also need to run they more efficiently we need a more productive state not a big state 
 in autumn i set day to day spending to increase by a year in real term over the next parliament some say that be not enough and we should raise spending by more and other say it be too much and we should cut it to improve efficiency neither be right it be not fair to ask taxpayer to pay for more when public service productivity have fall nor would it be wise to reduce that funding give the pressure that public service face so i be keep the plan growth in day to day spending at in real term but we be go to spend it well interruption the opposition do not have a plan for public service as with everything else so why not listen to our 
 today i be announce a landmark public sector productivity plan that restart public service reform and change the treasury ’s traditional approach to public spending i start with our big and most important public service the nhs of my great privilege be to be health secretary thank to the nhs i have gorgeous child the old of whom have be patiently listen in the gallery the nhs be rightly the big reason most of we be proud to be british but the system that support its staff be often antiquated doctor nurse and ward staff spend hour every day fill out form when they could be look after patient interruption 
 order i do not like to interrupt the chancellor but mr streeting you be too close to i to be shout that loudly if you want to shout that loudly you should go away and sit up there i apologise for interrupt the chancellor 
 when patient do not show up or member of a team be ill operating theatre be leave empty despite long waiting list when we publish the nhs long term workforce plan i ask the nhs to put together a plan to transform its efficiency and productivity i want well care for patient more job satisfaction for staff and well value for taxpayer make change on the scale we need be not cheap the investment need to modernise nhs it system so they be as   good as the good in the world cost £ but it help unlock £ of saving time that amount so in today ’s budget for long term growth i have decide to fund the nhs productivity plan in full 
 with that new investment we will slash the hour lose by doctor and nurse every year to outdated it system we will cut down and potentially halve form fill by doctor by use artificial intelligence we will digitise operate theatre process allow the same number of consultant to do an extra operation a year we will fund improvement to help doctor read mri and ct scan more accurately and quickly speed up result for patient every year and save thousand of life something that i know would have delight my brother charlie who i recently lose to cancer 
 we will improve the nhs app so that it can be use to confirm and modify all appointment reduce up to half a miss appointment annually and improve patient choice we will set up a new nhs staff app to make it easy to roster electronically and end the use of expensive off framework agency as a result of this funding all hospital will use electronic patient record make the nhs the large digitally integrate healthcare system in the world today ’s announcement double the amount the nhs be invest on digital transformation over year 
 on top of this long term transformation we will also help the nhs meet pressure in the come year with an additional £ that will allow the nhs to continue its focus on reduce waiting time and bring the total increase in nhs funding since the start of the parliament to in real term the nhs be there for we in the pandemic and today with nearly £ of additional funding a conservative government be there for the nhs
