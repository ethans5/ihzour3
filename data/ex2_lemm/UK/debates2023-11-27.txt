 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to help reduce level of organised crime 
 what step he be take to help reduce level of organised crime 
 what step he be take to help reduce level of organised crime 
 we will continue to break the business model of organise crime gang to keep the people of this country safe we be disrupt their activity both domestically in the uk and internationally include disrupt the work of the gang behind the illegal small boat crossing and it be why the criminal justice bill create new power to target organise criminal gang we will also publish a new serious and organised crime strategy soon 
 criminal gang do not care about the people they be smuggle into our country and they must be stop we must stop the boat in way that be consistent with our international obligation and end the dangerous journey that risk human life do my right hon friend agree that we must focus on break the business model of these criminal gang 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the people who be be smuggle be see as just product they be expendable in the eye of the people smuggler and we must and will do everything we can to break their business model i commend the work of my right hon friend the minister for immigration who have recently be to bulgaria where in close co operation with our international partner there we have seize boat and engine we be break the business model and we will continue to drive down those illegal small boat crossing until we have stop the boat 
 serious organise acquisitive crime be hit rural community hard with high value agricultural equipment target for theft the national rural crime unit have recently recover over £ of steal equipment nearly £ of which be recover abroad the construction plant hire association nfu mutual and the construction equipment association have put significant fund into the nrcu but what more can my right hon friend do to ensure that it have the resource it need to tackle these serious organise criminal gang 
 i thank my hon friend for the work he have do in this area include with his private member bill he be absolutely right that the rural community of this country need to be support and they will be drive down rural crime be an important area of work and we have provide £ of funding to help set up the nrcu my hon friend and i and other in this house understand the terrible impact this have and we will continue to work with the rural police force to drive down rural crime 
 in burnley and right across lancashire county line continue to be a problem with organise group peddle drug and exploit young people with no regard for the harm they be do not just to the community but to the young people they be exploit lancashire police be make very good inroad with an enhance rural policing unit and neighbourhood taskforce but what more can lancashire constabulary do to tackle the county line issue and bring order back to our street 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight this vile type of criminality which target the young and the most vulnerable as part of our fight against county line we be invest up to £ in our county line programme and since it be launch in police activity have result in over county line be close over arrest and over safeguard referral we will keep our focus on this evil criminality 
 give that shockingly the average time it take for a crime to be charge have treble since will the secretary of state embrace the police federation ’s simplify dg6 campaign and scrap the redaction rule his government introduce in in order to cut bureaucracy get case to the crown prosecution service quick and free up officer time to be out fight crime 
 we be actively work with the cps to simplify and speed up this process i will of course look at the proposal put forward because we want police officer out in their community on the beat and tackle crime rather than do paperwork important though that be 
 the police report a increase in shoplift in recent month there be much evidence as the home secretary will be aware that organise criminal gang go into shop to try to steal as much as they can and target shop worker as we approach christmas what assurance can the home secretary provide to shop worker not just at christmas but across the year that he will start deal with these gang and start realise that all retail crime be a problem in this country that need tackle 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to highlight this issue it be that we take seriously through operation pegasus we be work through the leadership of the police and crime commissioner for sussex on this very issue no doubt either the policing minister my right hon friend   the member for croydon south chris philp   or i will have the opportunity to update the house on this work as it progress 
 i call the shadow minister 
 this autumn the government pledge to treat retail crime as organised crime but with their criminal justice bill they have fall at the hurdle there be no consolidated offence to protect retail worker no strong signal on the £ limit on investigation and a denial of reality on their hollowing out of neighbourhood policing from the answer we have hear the home secretary want we to believe that we have never have it so good but the one who be thrive be organise criminal will the government accept our amendment to add the protection of shop worker into the legislation 
 the hon gentleman will know that attack shop worker be already a statutory aggravating factor we will look at what more we can do to protect shop worker the retail action plan be in place include the use of cctv and facial recognition software we will continue to explore all avenue to protect shopworker because they like everyone else deserve our protection 
 what progress he have make on stop small boat transport migrant across the english channel 
 what progress he have make on stop small boat transport migrant across the english channel 
 so far this year we have reduce the number of these dangerous illegal and completely unnecessary crossing by more than a compare with last year despite increase of nearly a in europe nevertheless the number of illegal arrival remain unacceptably high we remain focused on deliver our comprehensive plan to stop the boat by break the business model of the people smuggler and we will shortly be pilot emergency legislation through this house to ensure that flight to rwanda take off as a matter of urgency 
 figure on thursday reveal that immigration to the uk be skyrocket be it not time to realise that those well intentione international treaty and convention agree year ago be no long fit for purpose we simply can not accommodate all those who would qualify for asylum under exist rule the world be face troubled time and more mass migration will my right hon friend assure i that he will do all he can to raise the bar for those migrating or seek asylum here and look at other solution to stop people leave their homeland so that those country can   make well future for themselves without the loss of so many of their young much of europe be in a dire state because of mass immigration we can not let the united kingdom go the same way 
 my hon friend make a strong point while some of those come here to claim asylum have genuine ground for asylum many be economic migrant make spurious claim to game the system for some nationality our grant rate be out of sync with european country and that be why we have undertake extensive work to lower they for example the grant rate for albanians reduce from in june last year to in june this year and it have fall far since as that remain unacceptably high last month we add india and georgia to the list of safe state to speed up the process of return people who have travel from those country to the united kingdom illegally clearly there be more work to be do and we do not want to create any additional pull factor to the united kingdom 
 in relation to the rwanda policy the home secretary be quote as say 
 my frustration be that we have allow the narrative to be create that this be the be all and end all 
 of government policy do the minister agree with the home secretary if he do what be the government ’s policy on combat the boat and resist illegal migration and what be our policy 
 when my right hon friend the prime minister and i set out our comprehensive plan this time last year it have many facet of which an extremely important component of which be our rwanda plan but that be not its only element and we have work intensively over the last month on each and every other facet of that plan opposition members jeer but be that plan work yes it be we can see that from the fact that we be almost the only country in europe where the number of illegal entrant be fall it have fall by more than a compare to a increase in the rest of europe and almost a increase in italy 
 none of that negate the importance of interject a further critical deterrent that be the crucial element of the rwanda scheme the difference between those of we on the government benches and the opposition be that frankly they do not want to stop the boat and they do not have the stomach to do a policy like rwanda 
 i call the shadow minister 
 since the previous home secretary be remove from her post i think it be fair to say that the immigration minister have become a law unto himself he brief the medium that he have be instruct the prime minister to tear up all our legal obligation to fix the unfixable rwanda policy then he set himself on a collision course with his new home secretary by appear to bet the house on the rwanda flight take off to add insult to injury he go behind his new boss ’ back to present his laundry list to the prime minister include a cap on social care visa and abolish the shortage occupation list do the immigration minister have any respect whatsoever for the authority of the new home secretary give that he be say to be on resignation watch will he confirm that he will resign if his proposal be reject 
 once again we hear absolutely nothing from the opposition about what they would actually do the sad truth be that they have complete disdain for the british public they do not appreciate that the public that we be send here to represent demand that we reduce the level of both legal and illegal migration the home secretary and i will do absolutely everything in our power to achieve that we be work closely with the prime minister and we will set out further plan in due course but the public watch the debate should be very clear if they share our determination to tackle small boat or to reduce the number arrive in this country legally they have only the conservative party to support 
 i call the snp spokesman 
 last week a woman and a man die while attempt to cross the channel in a small boat other in their group be hospitalise for hypothermia despite the clear risk over people in boat be detect cross the channel in the past day they clearly feel there be no other choice the lack of safe and legal route be put people at risk will the immigration minister consider a humanitarian visa as the red cross have recommend 
 all of we across the house abhor the death of individual in the channel and we be work closely with the french authority to investigate the circumstance of those individual death but those individual like anyone seek to cross the channel be come from a place of evident safety they be depart from france they be in absolutely no danger they be in a country with a fully function asylum system of its own there be no excuse for those people break into our country put themselves in the hand of people smuggler we should be unite in try to deter that 
 on the hon lady ’s question about safe and legal route to the uk she know that we have issue more than half a humanitarian visa since more than at any time in the history of this country if she want to do more after the debate she should go straight back to the snp government and ask they to pull their weight and provide more safe space for asylum seeker and refugee back in scotland 
 the minister be deflect quite a lot interruption government members would do well to listen because their system be not work they be fail people every single day in the month of a mere afghans arrive in the uk by safe and legal route for each afghans come across on small boat today the independent have lay out the story of a mother of an afghan special force soldier who serve in a unit set up by britain train and pay for by the british armed service whose application under the afghan relocation and assistance policy be deny along with many other from commando force and afghan territorial force why be the minister fail so many afghans 
 we do not encourage anyone whatever their circumstance to come across illegally in a small boat that be a criminal offence and it should not be encourage we have support nearly people to come from afghanistan since the end of the war which   compare extremely favourably to other european country we have issue more than half a humanitarian visa which be a record we should all be proud of the scottish national party always want to make the uk out to be a small country but that be not correct the united kingdom be a big hearted country and of the world lead country for resettlement 
 order we have be here minute and have cover only question we have a huge amount of business to get through so can we please go fast i would like brief question and brief answer 
 what assessment his department have make of the effectiveness of the defending democracy taskforce in prevent foreign interference in the uk ’s democratic integrity 
 it be a great pleasure to tell the hon lady that the defending democracy taskforce which be set up under the national security council have be operate for about a year and be work closely with parliamentary authority devolve administrations and local authority around the country alongside intelligence agency the police and opposite number from various party it have already update many individual across the house on different way in which we can improve our own security and make sure that this country ’s democracy be safe the fundamental way to protect our democracy be to get involve so i urge anyone watch to join a party any party but particularly the conservative party and get involve in politic to keep the united kingdom government work for the people of the united kingdom 
 give the huge importance of prevent foreign interference in our democracy do the minister agree that for the purpose of transparency lord cameron should declare all previous contact with and money earn from foreign government after he leave the office of prime minister and before he be appoint foreign secretary 
 the hon lady raise an interesting point on how we keep our politic accountable rule be set out by this house the other place the independent parliamentary standards authority and various other people on how we account for expense money raise and various form of connection she be right that those record must be keep up to date the prime minister expect every minister to do that and i be very confident that the new foreign secretary whom i congratulate have do so 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the defend democracy taskforce have an important remit to defend our country and protect our sovereignty give the threat we face it be vital that rapid progress be make however some matter require immediate attention can the minister give an assurance that both the vodafone merger and the future ownership of the daily telegraph will be look at not just through the economic prism of competition but in accordance with the national security and investment act 
 this be the time that i have face the hon gentleman across the dispatch box last time we be side by side so this be a bit of change he raise some interesting and important point the national security and investment act be pass a little over a year ago and the deputy prime minister himself chair the body that advise on it that be incredibly important because as we know foreign ownership and control be a vital area of foreign influence in our government and society that be why we be look not just at that but at how the foreign medium today be not just traditional medium some of whom we see represent up in the press gallery some of they be even wave social medium be now so important too it be worth note the recent ofcom report that about a of under-25s get their news from tiktok which as we know have its algorithm write by individual under the control of a foreign state that be not always friendly 
 what assessment he have make of the potential merit of provide temporary visa to the dependant of visit student and academic when the dependant be live in conflict zone 
 there be a number of route in the immigration rule allow dependant to join family member in the united kingdom where possible people seek to flee conflict zone should use those exist route in the past month we have allow over people to arrive under safe and legal route include over family reunion case 
 my constituent be on a student visa at st andrews university on   october her year old daughter be in northern gaza stay with her grandmother they have since have to flee south we have have good engagement from the student policy team but will the minister meet i to discuss how we can reunify the family 
 i be very happy to look into the case with the hon lady as a general rule we believe migration should not be the lever we pull in the event of humanitarian crisis we should be use the uk ’s diplomatic muscle our overseas development aid as the primary way in which the uk can have the great impact in the world but there be always case where we make exception 
 last week ’s net migration figure be completely unacceptable to the people of stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke which be why the new conservatives helpfully have a point plan that the minister for immigration could copy and paste to ensure we get those figure down will he extend the closure of the student dependant route to student enrol on a year research master ’s degree 
 we believe that the level of legal migration into this country be far too high that have very profound impact on access to public service the productivity of our economy and the ability of the uk to be a socially cohesive and united country that be why we need to take action we have already announce a   specific policy with respect to dependant which come into force at the beginning of next year we think it will have a substantive impact on the level of net migration but as the prime minister say we be keep all option under review and will take further action as require 
 what progress his department have make on move asylum seeker from hotel into less costly accommodation 
 for the time since the small boat crisis begin we be now close asylum hotel thank to the good work do to reduce arrival by more than a to the delivery of more appropriate form of accommodation such as on large disuse military site and to well management of the exist permanent estate i be pleased to report that the home office be make good progress on the hotel which will exit by the end of january we will be bring forward a further tranche shortly 
 i thank my right hon friend for his reply on behalf of constituent who have ask i can he please go far and give a more definite date for the start and completion of the decant of asylum seeker at the newton park hotel in south derbyshire 
 when i take this job i be clear that the use of asylum hotel be completely unacceptable and that i would work with all in government to ensure that we close each and every of they as quickly as possible we be now in the process of close those hotel as i say in my opening remark the be close seamlessly so i expect to be in a position to announce the next set of hotel closure very soon 
 surely if asylum seeker have the right to work they would be able to pay for their own accommodation at little or no cost to the taxpayer 
 no i completely disagree with the hon gentleman it be extremely important that we reduce the pull factor to the united kingdom there be already plenty of reason why economic migrant would want to make a life in the uk enable they to work as soon as they arrive here would only exacerbate those problem 
 i be really pleased that the government have be able to reduce the number of asylum seeker in hotel the use of the atlantic hotel in chelmsford for family be put considerable pressure on our school place especially as chelmsford be already very short of school place due to the large number of people who have arrive from ukraine and elsewhere will the minister look again at the policy and ensure that when people with child of school age be place in hotel they be put in place where there be school that have place 
 my right hon friend and i have discuss this many time and i want to ensure that that particular hotel be close as quickly as possible because it be have such an impact on her local community the home office be work with her local authority and we have make a commitment that we will not place further young people or family with young people in that hotel if school place be not readily available however i hope that the hotel itself will close very soon 
 when asylum seeker require medical care be move to a new location out of area they go to the bottom of the waiting list and as a result their health requirement be not meet in a timely way how will the minister ensure that they do not slip back from receive medical care that they urgently require 
 when move asylum seeker from form of accommodation to another we make provision to ensure that there be support for those with the most serious medical condition but it be important that we be able to move individual around the estate and we be currently in the process of closing hotel that be our no priority because the public want we to close they as quickly as possible 
 what step he be take to tackle illegal migration 
 what step he be take to tackle illegal migration 
 the government have a plan to tackle illegal migration by mean of a number of method and that plan be work small boat crossing be down compare with those in other country across europe where they be up we be work closely with our international partner include our near geographical neighbour france we be dismantle the organise criminal gang who be smuggle people and we be take action to reform the asylum system 
 follow the supreme court ruling the government announce emergency legislation to address the issue mention in the judgment i welcome the propose new treaty with rwanda but do my right hon friend agree that the new legislation promise by the prime minister must be clear and unambiguous in establish that the sovereign will of this parliament as express in primary legislation take legal precedence over the interpretation of international treaty and principle 
 i can assure my hon friend that the excellent work relationship we have with rwanda on which i work in my former role will give we the opportunity to have a treaty that address the issue in the supreme court judgment however she be right to say that the legislation that will accompany that treaty must make it absolutely clear that the will of the british people as exemplify by the action of this government   mean we will work to get flight to rwanda to make it plain that if people come here illegally they will not stay here i can give she my commitment that we will do everything we can to make that happen 
 far to those point will my right hon friend give i a categorical assurance that he will do everything he can to enable we to deliver the rwanda policy and will introduce all the necessary legal exemption so that we can get on with those flight as soon as possible and provide the necessary deterrence to illegal migration 
 the rwanda scheme be an extremely important part of our basket of response i will do everything to ensure that we drive down small boat arrival that be the promise we have make to the british people and that be the commitment i will deliver 
 of the way of deal with illegal migration be to look at the number of case can the home secretary say how many legacy backlog case there be if they have yet be triaged and how many of those result from illegal migration 
 the historic backlog have be reduce by it have fall by more than case since the end of november we have recruit asylum decision maker and we have increase tenfold the pace at which these decision be make 
 the secretary of state be well aware that under international law an asylum seeker can not be describe as an illegal immigrant they be here legally unless and until they be find to have no valid claim to asylum after due process be it the policy of the home office and this government to act within international law or to act outwith it 
 the hon gentleman make reference to the refugee convention but his definition be only accurate if they come directly from a place of danger i have visit france and it be a wonderful country i can assure the house that it be not a dangerous country 
 what step he be take to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 in the last year we have pass comprehensive new law cover everything from domestic abuse and street harassment to online safety last year the government add violence against woman to the strategic policing requirement place it on equivalent footing to terrorism and the home office ’s award win enough campaign be now enter its final phase with a firm focus on tackle perpetrator behaviour be roll out across college and university 
 i welcome my hon friend to her place i pay tribute to sandra conte and her team at future live in hertford for everything they do to support victim of domestic abuse as a magistrate i specialise in domestic abuse court and i be utterly convinced of   their value both for justice and for victim will my hon friend share her assessment of the initiative to increase specialisation in court process for sexual offending and sexual violence 
 the specialist sexual violence support project be now under way in crown court in leeds newcastle and snaresbrook it be at an early stage but be due to report in early however my hon friend should be aware that any victim of rape or sexual assault may now take advantage of section procedure which have be roll out nationwide to allow people to give their evidence privately and ahead of trial we be also engage close to independent sexual violence adviser in the system to accompany victim every step of the way through the criminal justice system as a result rape prosecution be high today than they be in and sentence be approximately long 
 can the minister tell i how many force be still not provide domestic abuse training to their officer 
 i do not have that answer i will have to go back to the home office and write to the hon member 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be a privilege to take on this important role i pass on my thank to my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips   for her dedication and commitment i be look forward to get to work 
 a shocking new study have find that domestic abuser be control the finance of more than woman in the uk this can not be allow to continue the government have turn a blind eye to this issue for more than a decade so what step be the minister take today to tackle economic abuse 
 the hon lady and i have work together a lot on domestic abuse since we be elect she will know that economic abuse be basically a derivative of coercive control which clare wade kc in her review of domestic homicide say underpin almost all domestic abuse tomorrow the criminal justice bill have its reading in the house the bill will see serious coercive control offence place under the multi agency public protection arrangement and offender place on the violent sexual and terrorist offender register 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the supreme court judgment of november on the rwanda relocation scheme 
 the rwanda scheme remain an important part of our response to illegal migration and people smuggle we will continue to negotiate with the government of rwanda on a treaty that will be   underpin by domestic law so that the rwanda scheme will join the other effective part of our response in stop the boat 
 the prime minister have indicate his intention to override the supreme court by introduce emergency law and a new treaty with rwanda to save his unlawful deportation plan so far the uk have pay the rwanda government £ and the home office have spend £ on fail legal challenge with no asylum seeker be send there as of yet how much have the home office spend in total on the rwanda scheme can the secretary of state give we a figure please 
 the funding from the home office will be report in the usual appropriate way i do not have the figure to hand but i will make sure the house be update on the cost 
 the hon gentleman seem to misunderstand how respond to a legal judgment he describe it as overriding but i suggest that when the government address the issue set down by the supreme court they will not be override but respect the voice of the supreme court 
 i would make the point that we be committed to deal with illegal migrant i hear no such commitment from the opposition until they come up with clear plan for how they will deal with this issue they should support the action the government be actually take 
 have the home secretary be strike as i have by the very small number of opposition members stand to contribute to question on migration do he agree that if democracy both within the eu and like ourselves outside the eu can not find a solution to this problem we will see the increase emergence of far right politician in position of power that ought to frighten we all 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right this government be criticise by the opposition and by voice across the continent when we start to take action to address the significant increase in the volume of illegal migration country across the continent be now look at we in order to emulate the action we be take illegal migration have go from something that the labour party believe be a non issue to be a core issue for government across europe and north america if the good people do not grip this issue the bad people will attempt to do so and i will never let that happen 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 the home affairs committee have take a particular interest in small boat crossing we produce a report last year that i suggest the new home secretary might want to look at we have also visit france and belgium this year owe to our interest and expertise in this area will the home secretary consider give the home affairs committee and the joint committee on human rights the opportunity to carry out pre legislative scrutiny of any emergency legislation that he plan to bring forward 
 there be an urgency to the legislation that we seek to put forward and although pre legislative scrutiny have a part to play i will not do anything that delay the implementation of this incredibly important legislation 
 it be imperative if we be to crack the business model of the evil people smuggler that we operationalise the rwanda scheme may i register my profound conviction that the disapplication of element of the european convention on human right and the refugee convention will be necessary the court of appeal cite human right and the supreme court cite refoulement what will it be next time in the absence of parliament expressly assert the will of this house 
 my right hon friend make an incredibly important point although i do not want to prejudge the content of the bill i listen carefully to his point and he and the rest of the house should understand that we will do everything we can to ensure that we break the business model of the evil people smuggler he highlight and drive down the small boat arrival he be absolutely right that the deterrent effect of the rwanda scheme be a key element of that multi strand approach 
 what progress his department have make on review the police funding formula 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he be a tireless campaigner on this issue i completely accept the need for a new police funding formula we have be work on it extremely hard with colleague across government i hope to have something furth to say on the topic shortly but in the meantime we be get as much money as we can to frontline policing this year we have an extra £ go to frontline policing and £ go to support the police pay rise which make £ extra for police this year 
 i be most grateful to my right hon friend for that answer nevertheless it be concern that suffolk police be promise draft proposal for the review back in january i urge he to get those to our local force as quickly as possible and in the meantime to work with it to improve the number of out of court disposal where well delivery will relieve pressure on those in the force who be work incredibly hard 
 they be indeed work incredibly hard i be delighted to tell the house that suffolk police currently have officer which be more than at any time in their history and they have that in common with england and wales as a whole i support what my hon friend say about out of court disposal which have an important role to play particularly in treat drug and alcohol addiction and mental health issue i will work with suffolk and other force to make sure that those be widely use 
 since neighbourhood policing where officer be embed in local community have be decimate despite its huge advantage we therefore desperately need the repeatedly promise reform of the police funding formula however of the quick way in which the government can get cash to police force for neighbourhood policing be by reform the proceed of crime act rule so that more of the money be hand to the police force that confiscate it will the minister meet i to discuss the matter far 
 i would be happy to discuss poca with the hon gentleman and other colleague however there be something of a definitional confusion on this question about neighbourhood policing because there be local police officer who work on response team and should be count as well in the year the opposition keep refer to there be officer in local policing role whereas there be now that be a much high number and overall we have a record number of officer across england and wales—149,566 that be more than there ever be under the last labour government 
 rise 
 we must move now to topical question 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 my mission and that of this government on behalf of all people in this country be to secure our border and keep people safe from crime and terrorism good progress have be make in drive down crime and stop illegal small boat arrival but there be of course more to do the home office have be consider further measure to mitigate migration include by prevent the exploitation and manipulation of our visa system and clamp down on those who take unwarranted advantage of the flexibility we provide we will announce further detail on these measure in due course tomorrow we have reading of the criminal justice bill which will give police the power they need for long sentence for those who would harm other and will increase the trust in police 
 in my constituency the antisocial and illegal use of firework continue to affect law abide citizen and our pet will the secretary of state commit to reduce the legal limit for commercial firework from db to db or less 
 i have not yet have the opportunity to read into that issue it be not the angle i be expect in this question but the proposal seem a thoughtful i will give it due consideration but i can not make a commitment at this point 
 off road bike be a grow plague across hartlepool and my constituent face the danger of young man in balaclavas   drive recklessly along our street will my right hon friend commit to increase the support for cleveland police to tackle this nuisance beyond the anonymous tip off system will he also perhaps come to visit some of the excellent conservative mp in our region 
 i would be delighted to do that and i support her call to achieve precisely the objective my hon friend describe from april next year in just a few month every police force in the country will receive substantial funding commitment to conduct antisocial behaviour hotspot patrol include against the scourge of off road biking that she mention in force where pilot scheme have be try include those in essex lancashire and staffordshire we have see reduction in antisocial behaviour of up to 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 the home secretary have be in post for week during which time he have use the same language to pick a fight with stockton and show what he think of his own rwanda policy he have be attack by his back benchers and downing street have already be force to confirm it still have full confidence in he day ago he say the number of asylum hotel bed space be down but day ago home office figure show they be up to a record 56,000—10,000 more than at the beginning of the year do he even know what be go on 
 yes i do let i expand that answer be a by product of the right hon lady ask a closed question at the dispatch box i have be in this job for day and i be conscious that my counterpart around europe and the world be grapple with many of the same issue i would love nothing more than to be able to resolve they all in day i be good but i be not a magician 
 perhaps that mean an end to the magical thinking that the right hon gentleman ’s predecessor call for we still have more bed space than when the prime minister promise to end hotel use the home secretary owe the house the fact there be still no sign of anything on the fail rwanda plan because he know it will not work and nothing on the trebling of net migration to tackle the skill gap that be drive work visa the government have be in power for year and all we have be chaos and briefing war his back benchers be already call he colonel calamity and he have corporal chaos next to he on the front bench give the mess he have inherit and his penchant for profanity do he accept that he be now up a certain kind of creek without a paddle 
 the right hon lady be someone i admire hugely and of the thing i admire most be how she have manage to be at the dispatch box twice but have fail to ask anything resemble a sensible question about the issue we be discuss when her party be in government it address the volume of migration by simply redefine people wipe the slate clean and pretend there be never a problem 
 i have say this about the right hon lady ’s party in broadcast and i say it from the dispatch box there be a gap vacuum where the labour party ’s policy on migration whether it be legal or illegal should be unless and until labour members come up with something approach a policy i will continue to do what we know to be right drive down small boat arrival and reduce the number of hotel room need we have close hotel and we will do more 
 be the home secretary do enough to reassure jews that the united kingdom be safe 
 my right hon friend ask an incredibly important question i have make it very clear to the police force of the uk that when member of a minority group in this country tell we that they be live in fear we must take action i be pleased that the police response this weekend be more robust than on previous weekend the police be clearly listen to the conversation we be have with they and i commend they for do so i have speak with representative of the community security trust and the board of deputies of british jews and i will be have a meeting with the chief rabbi to make it absolutely clear that the jewish community in the uk have the right to feel safe and this government will take action to ensure it be safe 
 many of my constituent have face significant delay when apply for biometric residence permit card because of technical error constituent whose application be approve in july do not receive their brp until january because of printing issue what action be be take to address the technical problem contribute to delay in process brp application i hope the home secretary can answer that question 
 i be pleased to report to the hon lady that that part of our visas and immigration service be now operate within its service standard so there be a good service be offer to member of the public but if she have any specific case she can bring they to my attention 
 as a local authority closely tie to heathrow airport the london borough of hillingdon have be do great work to manage the impact of those currently in the asylum process that be despite a funding imbalance in national rate give the local population and the number of asylum seeker will my right hon friend commit to work with i to look at how we can ensure that those authority such as hillingdon council link with major port of entry be give the resource to cope with such demand 
 my hon friend raise an important matter for his constituent as they live in the local authority beside heathrow airport it be true that his constituent bear a particular burden with respect to asylum seeker we do provide £ per asylum seeker to a local authority to help meet those cost but a local authority such as hillingdon do need our support and i would be delighted to work with he in that regard 
 the home secretary will be familiar with the invasive surveillance system that authoritarian state such as russia and china impose on their citizen be he comfortable with the policing minister ’s push for similar live facial recognition system to be use on innocent brits at a time when our colleague in the european parliament be legislate to abandon this technology 
 we should be clear that retrospective facial recognition put hundred if not thousand of criminal in prison for example it be use to catch a murderer who have kill somebody in a coventry nightclub who be then identify use an image take on a mobile phone that be a murderer who would not be in prison but for the use of retrospective facial recognition 
 live facial recognition have be use extensively by police force and experimentally by other include by south wales which have an excellent labour police and crime commissioner alun michael who have lead the way in this area in a way that be safe and that respect privacy critically if someone ’s face be scan and they be not on the wanted list their detail be delete immediately which i hope provide reassurance on the question of privacy where it have be use want people include a want rapist and a want sex offender have be apprehend who otherwise would have go free i would hope that the entire house can agree that catch wanted rapist be something that we can all get behind 
 during the recent protest we have see politician hound out of their office and even need a police escort at a train station what more can we do to ensure that people who make decision be do it fairly and not from intimidation 
 my hon friend make an excellent point that be exactly why we be have an emergency meeting of the defending democracy taskforce tomorrow to assess these issue the incident that we have see in this country since   october absolutely hateful incident have leave some people feel unable to make the argument that their constituent would expect they to make because they feel vulnerable or they feel threatened that be why i have be engage on a protective security review not just for the government but for all member of this house and for other elect official around our country it be completely wrong for our democracy to be silence by anyone and it certainly should not be silence by coward 
 my constituent dr lubna hadoura have give almost year of service in a specialised role to our nhs today all she can think about be her year old mum and other member of her family who be stick in gaza with no hope of escape will the secretary of state agree to meet urgently with i and dr hadoura so that she can set out to he more powerfully than i ever could the urgent humanitarian and moral imperative to get the family of uk citizen out of gaza before it be too late 
 the government have a duty to british national which we take very seriously i recognise the plight of many non british national in gaza which be why in my previous role and now support the current foreign secretary we have long push for a humanitarian pause i be pleased that that be in place we will continue to work with the international community and the country in the region to ensure that support be give to the people in gaza who need it and that action be take to end this conflict so that israelis as well as the palestinian people can live in peace and security 
 as we seek to reduce the backlog of asylum claim there be a temptation to grant more economic migrant the right to remain here will my right hon friend assure the house that there will be no slackening of the rule to root out economic migrant so that they can be return to where they come from 
 the whole point of have border control be that we can ensure that our migration system support our economy and our social cohesion both those thing be important we want to ensure that we be choose the right people in the right number at the right pace i give the house a categoric assurance that that will always underpin our thinking with regard to what future change we might make to the legal migration process 
 it be not simply the decibel level of firework that be cause an issue police officer in scotland have be come under attack with firework use as weapon the scottish parliament have control over the sale of firework but not their manufacture as they be classify as explosive will the minister guarantee that step will be take to tighten thing up in order to reduce the use of these weapon fail that will he simply devolve the power so that the scottish parliament can act as it have do on air weapon and drink driving 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that important point the control of product be often a matter for the department for business and trade but since he have raise it at home office question i will happily take his point away and look into it carefully 
 as be reference early there be grow concern in the retail trade about increase in shoplifting and in particular violence against shop worker do the minister agree that we need custodial sentence for persistent offender 
 persistent offender should certainly get send to prison there be no question about that of course it be now a statutory aggravate factor if the victim of an assault be a retail worker we be concern though about retail crime we do not want to end up   in the same place as some american city such as   san francisco with out of control looting we want a tolerance approach that be why just a few week ago we launch with police a retail crime action plan which will see police always follow up evidence include cctv evidence and the use of facial recognition technology always attend where necessary to investigate or where someone have be assault and particularly target prolific offender and criminal gang 
 give the revelation in recent week that the home secretary ’s predecessor strike a deal with the prime minister before she take up the post and give that it be well know that the home secretary be very much enjoy his role as foreign secretary will he tell the house what deal he might have strike with the prime minister before take on this role 
 a fantastic question well worth ask the contract that all minister have be with the british people to work hard on their behalf and to focus relentlessly on their priority that be something that every government minister take seriously and something totally lack in the narrative come from the opposition benches include the liberal democrat benches 
 the award win cotswold canals trust volunteer have have enough of antisocial behaviour such as graffiti dog mess and worry drug paraphernalia everywhere it be ruin their hard work on the canal network and be put they at risk part of our successful approach to try to tackle it be get cctv down the canal will my right hon friend let we know what be happen with the safe street fund police and crime commissioner chris nelson and i have make an application and we be wait to hear about it 
 a round of safe street funding be distribute for the current financial year and we will make an announcement shortly about the follow    financial year more money will be available and it will be up to police and crime commissioner to decide how they spend that money we will also confirm shortly the roll out of antisocial behaviour hotspot patrol across the entire country across all police force in england and wales where those have be trialle so far in essex staffordshire lancashire and elsewhere we have see decrease in asb pretty soon that will be available in gloucestershire as well 
 that conclude proceeding on question 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker 
 order i will take point of order after the urgent question unless they be directly relevant to what have just be say 
 it be directly associate with the home secretary 
 it be not directly relevant to a question that have just be answer well i be guess it be not interruption order we be move on to a very important matter and i expect the house to be quiet to listen to the urgent question from mr david lammy 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the israel gaza situation and the humanitarian pause 
 i thank the shadow foreign secretary for his question 
 a tragedy be unfold in the middle east israel have suffer the bad terror attack in its history and palestinian civilian be experience a devastating and grow humanitarian crisis as the foreign secretary make clear last week ’s agreement be a crucial step towards provide relief to the family of the hostage and address the humanitarian emergency in gaza this pause have provide an important opportunity to ensure that much great volume of food fuel and other life save aid can enter gaza 
 on   november   the british government announce a furth £ of humanitarian assistance triple our exist aid budget for the occupied palestinian territories this financial year during the pause the uk aircraft carry tonne of humanitarian aid for gaza arrive in egypt bring the total amount of uk humanitarian aid provide via british aircraft to tonne that aid be now be disperse to the united nations to support critical food water health shelter and protection need in gaza and to pre position emergency supply in the region 
 today be the and final day of the agreement the british government be supportive of the current pause in hostility continue but that be for the israelis and other in the region to agree we be clear that this pause should not be a off the increase flow of fuel and relief supply over the rafah crossing accompany the pause be welcome and must be sustain this pause should act as a confidence building mechanism for future pause include those solely on humanitarian ground 
 we welcome the intensive international co operation include effort from qatar and the usa that lead to this agreement and we thank partner for their continue work we remain committed to make progress towards a state solution britain ’s long stand position on the middle east peace process be clear we support a negotiate settlement lead to a safe and secure israel live alongside a viable and sovereign palestinian state the uk will continue to work with all partner in the region to reach a long term political solution that enable both israelis and palestinians to live in peace 
 i be grateful for the granting of this urgent question 
 hold the government to account be a sacred duty of this house but with lord cameron of chipping norton not here this feel more like a game of where ’s wally i start by ask the minister what progress be be make with mr speaker to ensure that all member can question the foreign secretary 
 the past hour have bring much need relief to israel and gaza i pay tribute to the work of qatar egypt the united states and the red cross the image   of hostage who have be release and reunite with their family have move we all but the situation remain bittersweet with many more still captive and their family in agony 
 in gaza the past few week have be an unimaginable nightmare for innocent palestinians the civilian death toll which include thousand of woman and child be shocking and intolerable the increase flow of aid and fuel remain a fraction of what be require more time be need we must urgently support the party to reach an agreement to extend the cessation of hostility to secure the release of remain hostage to deliver more aid to ease the unacceptable humanitarian catastrophe and crucially to provide a stepping stone towards an endure cessation of hostility ensure that what follow the war be a durable political solution 
 the danger be that the fighting will resume in mere hour do the right hon gentleman agree that if the vital effort to extend the cessation of hostility fail we can not return to the situation of before the pause we can not go back to hamas continue rocket attack on israel we can not go back to unacceptable siege condition in gaza and we can not go back to the scene of thousand of innocent palestinians be kill 
 the state solution remain the only credible basis for a lasting peace a future in which israel be secure from the threat of hamas terrorist in which gaza be not occupy and its people be no long displace and in which palestinians and israelis can enjoy security dignity and human right 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for most of his comment and in particular his desire to ensure an extension of the cessation of hostility on what he say about the broad situation the opposition front benchers and the government be in complete agreement 
 the right hon gentleman ask what progress have be make in ensure that the foreign office and the government ’s foreign policy be subject to proper scrutiny in this house i completely agree with he that there be a sacred duty i think that be the term that he use to ensure that all that scrutiny be make available i just point out to he the extraordinary authority that a former prime minister can bring to bear in carry out those task as he will have see from lord cameron ’s recent visit to the middle east lord cameron be the most senior foreign minister in europe and indeed in the region and i think that both side of the house will see the benefit of that in the day and month to come 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 this be a serious matter the uk ’s priority in the region be security and stability for the whole of the middle east yet today netanyahu plan to push forward with a special budget that will fund expansion of the settlement by over $ as a friend we have a duty to say to israel do not proceed with this plan it take we far away from peace and frankly it will risk not only the truce but the ability to get home hostage who be still hold by their terrorist kidnapper what be my right hon friend do to ensure that we speak plainly to our friend 
 i thank the chair of the foreign affairs committee for her comment she be entirely right that israel must comply with international humanitarian law and must not only prosecute but punish those who have be involve in settler violence the government be deliver tough message to all side in this dreadful conflict and we will continue to do so 
 i call the snp spokesman 
 i be grateful to the minister for his statement and i commend   the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns   for the integrity and courage with which she raise her concern 
 do the minister agree that the only way we will see a lasting and just peace in the middle east be through the establishment of a state solution in which israel and palestine be recognise as equal sovereign state with equal right and equal responsibility to uphold international law give that there be now credible accusation of war crime against both side in this conflict will the government confirm that they will give full support to the international criminal court to investigate without fear or favour all allegation of war crime regardless of who be accuse of they so that any perpetrator of a war crime regardless of whose friend or foe they may be be bring to justice before the international court give that it be an offence in international law to supply weapon where they may be use in the commission of a war crime what recent reassessment have the government make of the legality of their arm sale to the middle east 
 finally i do not know whether the minister be in the chamber to hear my plea on behalf of my constituent dr lubna hadoura i have write to the foreign secretary specifically about she but will he agree to meet urgently with i and she and with the home secretary so that we can find an effective way to get the family of uk national who be still stick in gaza out while the peace last if we do not get they out during a ceasefire we might not get they out at all 
 both the lord chancellor and i have make clear the position in respect of the international criminal court i set it out in the house it be not for government ministers and politician to address these matter but for the prosecutor and the administration of the international criminal court 
 the hon gentleman rightly identify future thinking as critical at this time he will recall that the progress that be make at oslo be on the back of the intifada that should give we some confidence in these dreadful set of circumstance that we need to focus on the future and a lot of thinking be go on in that respect to address his point about the arm regime he will know that the british government have the tough arm export regime in the world and we adhere absolutely to that 
 during this lull in fighting the whole house want to see as many hostage as possible release and as much aid as possible get in but both side be commit to recommence fighting do my right hon friend think it be time to call for a demilitarisation of gaza in the   long term and to consider future governance security and humanitarian plan will he consider a joint summit with the united states bring together all the stakeholder to look at the long term implication of this conflict 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of look to the medium and the long term and of do all that be necessary to bring together people of good will to make progress on the state solution we want to see all hostage release as swiftly as possible and we also want to see great volume of food fuel medicine and life save supply get into gaza principally through rafah but also through any other plausible mean 
 be it the government ’s contention that further hostility the destruction of the south of gaza in the way we have see the north destroy with ten of thousand more kill will lead easily to a permanent ceasefire or will it simply embolden the militant 
 the hon gentleman be right about the very worrying position that exist in the south of gaza at the moment he will have see that the united nations and other be consider island of deconfliction particularly around khan yunis include safe zone in order to dispense aid but like i he will be very aware of the danger experience in other safe zone in the past and the risk for civilian who be involve in they 
 how can a state solution which everybody say they want everybody in this chamber at any rate ever come to pass while hamas remain in control of the gaza strip 
 i do not think that anybody think that hamas be go to remain in charge of the gaza strip in the medium term or anything long than that 
 it be great when the minister give very quick answer which be what i ask he to do 
 the prospect of the carnage simply resume at the end of this pause be a really dreadful what be the minister ’s assessment of the likelihood that the ceasefire might be make permanent if over a period of some further day all the hostage be release 
 the right hon gentleman will have see the statement by the israeli government about the number of hostage to be release and the possibility of extend the pause in that respect the view of the british government be that we should do everything we can to ensure the hostage be release as speedily as possible the long that this pause continue the great chance there be for humanitarian aid to get into gaza and for progress to be make 
 do my right hon friend agree that any ceasefire continue should be link to the release of more hostage be he concerned that hamas be break the agreement in several way include by separate parent and their   child when release but not the other they have not even allow the red cross to visit all remain hostage which have be a rule in conflict for over year be he not concerned about these breach 
 i be immensely concerned about the fate of all the hostage as my right hon and learn friend will know there be originally about hostage and as of midnight last night hostage have manage to get out at the same time prisoner have be release by the israeli government the soon that all the hostage be out the well 
 like other i feel a real sense of relief watch some of the hostage who emerge and be reunite with their family yesterday the minister say that this pause could turn into a off it need not i know the issue be incredibly complicated and i know it be only through international intervention that we will make progress but could he tell we what step be be take not to get to a state solution at this point but to start a peace process between the war faction that will eventually would hope lead to a state solution what step be be take now by international body 
 i thank the right hon lady for her question she speak with great wisdom on these matter i can tell she that the discussion to which she refer be go on throughout the region and internationally britain be play a proper part not least by the visit last week of the foreign secretary to the region 
 i very much hope we can extend the humanitarian pause the minister as a former serviceman like i will know that the united kingdom armed force make extraordinary effort to avoid civilian casualty even when target terrorist embed in civilian area a point that have be make very forcefully to i by veteran in recent day so will the united kingdom carry on very clearly call on israel to follow similar standard operating procedure 
 yes and the foreign secretary during his visit to israel make precisely that point 
 the pause be obviously welcome because it will save life the horror of   october   have not go away the disaster of the killing of people in gaza have not go away there have to be a recognition as antónio guterres have point out of the underlying issue which be the occupation of the west bank and the settlement policy and the violence that so many palestinians have have to put up with for decade and decade do the minister believe there be a role now for the united nations to do more to try to bring about not just a ceasefire but a long term peace that will involve the withdrawal of israeli force from palestine 
 the right hon gentleman will know that there be always a role for the united nations but it have to be adapt to the circumstance what he say about a ceasefire which i have hear he say before be fetter by the fact that hamas have make it perfectly clear that they do not want a ceasefire they want to   repeat what they do on   october the day of those terrible event to have a ceasefire we have to have side that want a ceasefire and that be clearly not available on this occasion 
 the conflict in the middle east be tragic complex and sadly protract while the house be broadly align on the need to defeat hamas could the minister please reassure i of the effort be undertake to urge restraint among all protagonist in the protection of civilian and non combatant in gaza 
 britain have be very clear about the importance of respect international humanitarian law in all circumstance 
 the minister must be concern by those who seek to play down what have actually happen to innocent israelis in the middle east he must be gutte and alarm that leo varadkar the prime minister of a neighbouring state of our describe of the victim an year old girl who be kidnap and abuse as lose that be unbelievable be the minister concern by the ever increase extremism and the anti nato and antisemitic attitude emanate now from the republic of ireland be he go to have a word with that country about its attitude 
 the government have be absolutely clear on where we stand on antisemitism and islamophobia we condemn both without qualification and will continue to do so 
 as the minister know there have be no pause in violence in the west bank whose largely defenceless population have be subject over a number of month now to a campaign of what the americans and french have refer to as terror the minister say he be ask tough question and deliver tough message to both side but when will those tough message turn into tough action the americans have already say they will institute visa ban against those settler who be perpetrate violence but we have be talk about this for year to little or no effect give the centrality of achieve a state solution be there not a strong case for we to take firm action against settler those who arm they and those who support they 
 on his visit last week the foreign secretary deliver very strong message when he be in ramallah and when he see the israeli government about the importance of stop settler violence and ensure that people be put before the court and punish that if the perpetrator of settler violence be identify they could be put before the court 
 the release of hostage and the increase in humanitarian aid be very much to be welcome but i be sure the minister and the house agree that only a political solution can bring about a last peace in that spirit will he support labour ’s call for a new middle east envoy also i be not quite clear from his answer to the chair of the select committee on foreign affairs so will he say that the uk state condemn and be utterly oppose to the settlement 
 the position of the british government on the illegal settlement be absolutely clear on the possibility of have an envoy a whole range of different envoy be engage in this but if it be appropriate for we to deploy an envoy on behalf of the government either a humanitarian or political envoy around the region we would have no hesitation in do so 
 despite the pause over the last few day the humanitarian situation in gaza remain catastrophic and be likely to continue to be catastrophic while no doubt the right of israel to defend itself the fact be that it be an occupy power and as such have clear legal obligation to the civilian of gaza so when my right hon friend next speak to his israeli opposite number will he remind he of those obligation and ensure that even after the pause end sufficient aid be allow to get through to the population of gaza 
 we be do everything we can through the united nations and other contact in the region to ensure that aid and support get through to those who need it so desperately in gaza and my right hon friend may rest assure that we will continue to do that 
 the massacre by hamas on   october   be completely indefensible but the minister will be aware that since then no few than gaza child have die and there be hundred more missing probably under rubble the secretary general of the un say gaza be a graveyard for child and most recently the executive director of unicef have say that pause be not enough and only a ceasefire will save child when be the government go to use their good office to press both side for a ceasefire 
 regardless of whether the right hon lady ’s figure be correct we know that there have be appal loss of civilian life in gaza in respect of what she say about the relative merit of a pause or ceasefire we can build on pause but i point out that it be the policy of those on the opposition front bench and the government to press for humanitarian pause and that be what the british government will continue to do 
 the release of some hostage be incredibly welcome but the price for that be that israel have take the difficult decision to release many palestinian prisoner hold for terror offence include bombing and stabbing attack in exchange for its civilian hold in gaza in unimaginable condition history show we that previous security prisoner release by israel have go on to commit further terror offence do my right hon friend agree that this should be of concern to the whole world and that we must continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with israel to support it to combat terror 
 the point that my hon friend make particularly about prisoner reoffende underline the importance of our pursue every possible way of get on to a political track when this ghastly violence finish or be significantly diminish everyone must bend every conceivable sinew to drive forward a new political process for peace 
 few of we can imagine the trauma of be permanently displace from our home and never allow to return can the minister reassure the house that israel will not take land in gaza as some israeli ministers have threaten to do and that palestinians will be allow back to their home and land particularly give that out of people live in gaza have be displace 
 the hon and learn lady be right to talk about the deeply contentious issue of land but what she say be as i have understand it absolutely in accordance with the policy of the british government 
 do my right hon friend agree that the pogrom that take place on   october follow by the horrific level of antisemitism that we have see across our own country let alone across the western world with people feel frightened to leave their home for no other reason than their religion show why the state of israel have a right to exist and must always be allow to defend itself 
 my right hon friend be entirely correct what happen on   october   be a pogrom and it be the bad loss of life by jewish citizen on any single day since the holocaust and 
 i thank the minister for his assistance in get some of our constituent from birmingham out of gaza on his answer to   the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry for clarity can he state explicitly that uk government policy be that every displace gazan currently must be allow to return to their land 
 i thank the hon lady for her kind remark and i remind member from all part of the house to use the hotline to communicate with the emergency centre in the foreign office on behalf of constituent in term of the gazans who have be displace by the terrible event start by hamas on   october it be the british government ’s policy that those displace should be able to return to the area from which they be drive 
 the mayor of gaza city tell al jazeera that not litre of fuel have reach the gaza municipality likely due to the fuel be misappropriate why do the minister think that the international community should trust hamas to distribute any aid 
 as my hon friend will be aware we be extremely careful about how british aid be distribute and do it only through trust partner of whom we have long and detailed experience this be perhaps the most observed and scrutinise aid programme of any that the british taxpayer and british government pursue anywhere in the world 
 in home office question i raise the case of a constituent on a student visa whose year old daughter be in southern gaza and i be hop for a similarly positive response from this minister be that visa to be grant would   that young girl be allow to travel with her grandmother into egypt with the fcdo ’s support so that they can be reunite 
 it be unwise and difficult for i to give granular advice on that specific situation from the dispatch box but i will happily speak to the hon lady immediately afterwards and ensure that we do the good we can 
 i strongly welcome my right hon friend ’s remark about increase aid to gaza and the palestinian people at this time and i note what he say about the care take to ensure that british aid reach its intended target but give what we now know about the industrial scale of theft and misappropriation of aid in gaza over the year who be make sure on the ground right now that british aid be not be take by hamas terrorist 
 for aid in gaza we have not deal with either the palestinian authority or the hamas civil administration for many year and we do everything we can to ensure that it get through to the people who need it he will have see that i think yesterday a british aircraft deliver blanket and sleep mat to al arish in egypt that be the planeload we will continue to ensure not only that we supply as much aid as we possibly can to meet the need but that it get to the right place as speedily as possible 
 do the minister share my grave concern about what prime minister netanyahu ’s recent chilling comment that nothing will stop we and that he will fight until the end”—will mean for palestine and the further massacring of innocent civilian we need an urgent ceasefire to prevent the further loss of life how many more palestinian child must die before the government will call for a permanent ceasefire 
 israel absolutely have the right to defend itself follow the appalling event of   october of course civilian as well as hospital must be protect under international humanitarian law but the hon member should be in no doubt that the israeli government have the absolute right to defend themselves under international law 
 the recent discovery of a tunnel from the shifa hospital to a residential property be yet more clear evidence that hamas be use civilian as human shield in this conflict will the minister therefore join i in clearly condemn that activity and will he confirm that the government will continue to support israel in its fight to eradicate hamas from the region 
 yes 
 i too call for the pause to transition into a ceasefire what discussion have the minister and the foreign secretary have about open up corridor for humanitarian aid to cross between israel and gaza in the light of the poor infrastructure in gaza for move humanitarian aid from the south to the north 
 we be in those discussion as the hon member will know the access through rafah be fetter by physical and non physical circumstance when the foreign secretary be in the region last week he have specific discussion about other mean of access into gaza and we be do everything we possibly can together with our humanitarian partner to achieve a far great degree of access for humanitarian supply 
 from the perspective of my constituent in bolton we be watch the bad horror movie conceivable and hit pause will only delay the suffering boltonian be ask when can all side simply hit the stop button and bring about a ceasefire if a ceasefire be not possible what discussion be we have with israeli and other counterpart about extend the pause after today 
 my hon friend will have see the discussion go on and the offer that apparently the israeli government have make if extra hostage be release all those discussion be continue clearly the long the pause the more support and humanitarian supply can get into gaza the british government be do everything they can to progress both those thing 
 i welcome the minister ’s word that the foreign secretary be explore other crossing be open to get aid into the south it be essential that that happen if the hostility resume as most people expect what representation be the british government make to try to stop they move south where almost be displace and there be nowhere else to go 
 i refer the hon lady to the reply i give a little early about the south we be conscious of the fact that very large number of people be kettle into the south which make the supply of aid even more dangerous unless there be a comprehensive agreement that there will be no hostility around the area where aid be be distribute we be very conscious of that and we be work with our partner to make it as safe as possible for aid to be distribute 
 it be extremely good news that some hostage have be free however polling suggest that of the palestinian people support the atrocity by hamas and refuse to even consider the coexistence of a palestinian state with the state of israel at the moment palestinian prisoner be be release to the west bank and hamas be get the credit so do the minister accept that there be a risk that hamas not only dominate gaza but end up dominate the west bank as well 
 my hon friend ’s comment underline the importance of a political track emerge and be pursue with great vigour as soon as possible 
 i want to talk about the plight of woman in gaza which a constituent raise with i every day woman in gaza give birth most without water painkiller anaesthesia for caesarean section medical supply or as we know electricity for incubator with more than woman expect to give birth in gaza next month will the minister join labour in call for israel to protect   hospital in gaza and allow continue access to medicine food water and electricity to protect those woman and newborn during birth 
 the hon lady be right to draw attention to the very large number of woman who be seek to give birth in extraordinarily difficult circumstance we be conscious of that in the aid and humanitarian supply that we be make available i completely understand the importance of the humanitarian support worker who be in gaza extremely brave people who be put themselves in harm ’s way to support their fellow citizen with humanitarian supply nowhere be that more true than in the area that she describe 
 it have be extremely move to see hostage start to come out and aid start to flow in i hope that the truce will hold but if the hostility start again please can the uk government make every representation to israel that in its legitimate effort to stop the terrorism it must do more to prevent mass loss of civilian life especially child 
 my right hon friend speak with experience and wisdom and the answer be yes 
 my constituent adam abu warda have close family in gaza and be extremely anxious that they should have the opportunity to get out and come to the uk as other mp have say what be the government ’s policy on our constituent wish to get their very close family out of gaza to bring they to the uk 
 we be seek within the rule the hon gentleman will be aware of to facilitate in every way we can those people leave gaza as i say to of our colleague it would not be sensible for i to look at the granular detail of the specific case he raise on the floor of the house but if he have contact the emergency consular support team in the foreign commonwealth and development office and have any concern about the response he be get i be of course very happy to look at it myself 
 week ago today my hon friend   the member for hendon dr offord   and i be at kibbutz kfar aza where we see and hear thing we will never forget and where the smell of rot blood and flesh be still pungent in the air such be the butchery not only of hamas but palestinian islamic jihad and the thousand of gazan civilian who stream into the kibbutzim afterwards there be some in this place who seem to give the impression that the only barrier to peace be the action of the israeli government the fact be that it be hamas who be responsible for every death that occur it be the palestinian authority whose textbook preach hate against jews not just in israel but around the world it be palestinian authority school that be close in a day of celebration after   october   and as we hear from my hon friend   the member for harrow east bob blackman hold such appalling view about coexistence will the minister in his dealing with the palestinian authority encourage they to deal with their issue of extremism 
 i can tell my hon friend that the british government be do everything they can to address the issue behind what he say i have no doubt have be at that terrible location so recently that that be something he will never forget 
 what be the minister ’s understanding and assessment of the netanyahu government ’s medium and long term strategy for the gaza strip 
 the right hon gentleman who be extremely experienced in these matter will draw his conclusion from what the israeli government be say just as the british government do 
 now that the welcome temporary pause be under way what step be the uk government take to press to ensure that it become an endure ceasefire as soon as possible lead to a political process for peace be the uk government be clear with the israeli government that as they seek to continue in their legitimate aim of destroy hamas a return to the relentless bombardment the razing of gaza and the indiscriminate killing of civilian be not acceptable proportionate or within international law 
 as the hon lady will know israel have an absolute right to self defence it have be make clear around the world that that be the right position but it must abide by international humanitarian law 
 nobody can help but be move by the sight of hostage be release this weekend the minister for immigration   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick on a public platform say that the uk government 
 will not rest until each and every of they be back in the love embrace of their family 
 it be now more than a month since anybody at all from the uk government have have any contact at all with the uk citizen who have family member as hostage not a single phone call the minister will know that i have come to this place and plead with he to help arrange just minute of lord cameron ’s time with the hostage family to tell they what the government be actually do to help get their family member release it have be other government who have help to identify that their family member be alive please finally can the minister listen to those uk citizen ask their government what be you do to help get my family release and arrange that meeting as an urgent matter 
 my understanding be not the same as the hon lady ’s in respect of the british hostage she will know that over british national and their dependant have so far leave gaza and we be work around the clock to get the rest of those out who want to leave in term of the hostage my understanding be not the same as she have say 
 do the minister agree that we can not accept civilian be order to flee into area that be then subject to bombardment do he share the concern of the un and the world health organisation about the proposal for a safe zone with no infrastructure which will cause more problem down the line 
 there be very serious problem with safe zone we have learn about they the hard way from the event that take place in srebrenica in indeed rwanda and in northern iraq it be an absolute preoccupation of humanitarian include those in the united nations who be neuralgic about safe zone to ensure that if we be to distribute very large amount of aid we have the capacity to do so before too much long and we all hope that we be able to do it in the safe possible way 
 i welcome the pause with hostage release and aid deliver and i hope that it continue i thank the right hon gentleman for the role that he have play to date but if this drip drip of hostage release be to continue surely more must be do to ratchet up the pressure and ensure that the red cross and the red crescent gain access to the hostage about whom we have no information be that not a priority now 
 the hon gentleman be of course right it be a priority there be some suggestion that while i have be on my foot in the chamber qatar have announce that the truce will be extend by day obviously we all hope that that be true and that as a result more hostage will be able to leave 
 the minister be know for his humanitarian instinct do he agree that it be unthinkable now to resume the indiscriminate destruction of gaza and the life of palestinian civilian be he urge on the israeli government the need to find a means of remove the threat from hamas that do not cost the life of thousand of woman child and other non combatant 
 the hon gentleman speak with wisdom about the position of civilian all of we hope that the loss of life among innocent civilian can be minimise but i would point out to he that the israeli government have an absolute right to go after the murderous terrorist of hamas who perpetrate the dreadful event of   october 
 i have hear from a number of constituent in glasgow north who be concerned that weapon either manufacture in the uk or sell by uk company be be use in this conflict can the minister say how regularly the uk be assess its obligation under the arm trade treaty to ensure that arm be not be transfer when there be a risk of their be use to commit or facilitate breach of international humanitarian law 
 as the hon gentleman will know the british rule for the export of arm scrutinise by the committees on arms export controls provide for the tough regulation anywhere in the world if he ever believe that those rule have be infract in any way he should of course inform the requisite authority 
 despite the day truce there remain a humanitarian emergency in gaza we can not return to the indiscriminate and unprecedented killing that we have see take place on such a horrific scale over the last week we need to see a last permanent ceasefire as i have be   repeatedly urge the minister will the government use the uk ’s influence at this crucial moment to secure the ceasefire so that we can see an end to the bloodshed and the war crime allow desperately need aid to reach all part of gaza and create space for the immediate return of all hostage and meaningful negotiation on a lasting peace 
 the hon gentleman will know that we be do everything we can to ensure that the aid and support to which he have refer reach those who need it of course if we build on a humanitarian pause the long the pause go on and the long there be meaningful negotiation in qatar or through qatar the well the hon gentleman will also be aware however that it be the policy of his own front bench as well as the british government not to call for a ceasefire which for the reason i have give would be impractical in any event but to pursue the pause that be desperately need for humanitarian relief to arrive 
 do the minister agree that to prevent a catastrophic outbreak of waterborne disease such as cholera we need to see fresh water flow and sanitation and hygiene supply be deliver on a large scale alongside key public health and medical support 
 those be indeed the supply that be necessary to stop the situation that the hon lady describe develop far there be a very real risk of waterborne disease and cholera break out in gaza and that be why we be diligently pursue the humanitarian policy i have set out in every way we can 
 no would wish to withhold the aid that have be give to the innocent civilian who let ’s face it be only suffer because of a war instigate by hamas terrorist but do the minister agree that this cynical drip feed release of hostage be a further act of terror by hamas and that the pause in the fighting will be use by they to regroup and rearm will he give i a reassurance that our government will not fall into the trap of accede to hamas ’s incessant demand for indefinite pause rather than allow the israeli government to do what they need to do which be to engage in security action to destroy hamas in their own den 
 the right hon gentleman underline the fact that israel have every right to exercise its self defence in root out the hamas terrorist and murderer the british government be very clear that what he have say about that be absolutely right 
 give that hamas have be crystal clear that they have no intention of ever want a permanent ceasefire what discussion have be have with the palestinian authority to build its capacity and competence to ensure the transition to a state solution 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his comment about hamas and the ceasefire with which i completely agree in respect of build palestinian capacity he will know that lord cameron be in ramallah   last week discuss that and many other associate matter with president abbas the prime minister and the foreign minister there 
 i be incredibly relieved to get my constituent ’s family of they across the border and home through egypt i pay tribute to the staff in the consular section who support they but the support be patchy and the cost of they return be over £ on commercial flight what more can the minister do to supercharge that consular support and to reimburse those family who have to come home on commercial flight would he consider meet my constituent ’s family to learn the lesson that they have experience of have to flee in the middle of a bombardment
