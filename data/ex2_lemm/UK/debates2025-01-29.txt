i be pleased to see the opposition spokesman give i a willing eye of encouragement for which i be duly grateful 
 i start at the beginning clause will make it much simple to determine what law apply to an arbitration agreement currently the rule for identify the governing law be find in the common law and a recent supreme court decision that decision show both immense learning and the complexity of the current approach the supreme court be split in its judgment and its approach be different from that of the court of appeal which use an approach different from that at instance 
 instead to make the law clear and more predictable clause provide that the govern law will align with the legal location that is the seat of the arbitration by default this will ensure that arbitration where seat in england and wales and northern ireland will be fully support by our law which be among the most supportive of arbitration globally 
 clause codify a duty for arbitrator to disclose circumstance that may cause doubt as to their impartiality this will codify the common law and align domestic law with international good practice such as the united nations commission on international trade law model law which our expert lawyer have a major hand in draft the model law ’s influence can be find in other jurisdiction as far apart as scotland and switzerland it will promote trust in arbitration by promote trust in the integrity and impartiality of arbitrator 
 clause and in the interest of briskness clause will support arbitrator in make impartial and proper decision by extend their immunity against liability when they resign for good reason or be remove for no fault of their own this will support arbitrator to make robust and impartial decision without fear 
 clause clarify the pathway for a party that want to challenge the jurisdiction of the arbitrator that want to question whether the dispute should be arbitrate at all the party can either apply to the court for an early ruling or it can wait until the award be issue and then go to court clause clarifie that it can not do both it be either or 
 clause ensure that where arbitrator agree that they should not be hear a dispute after all they can still award the cost incur up to that point against the party that generate those cost 
 clause will allow arbitrator to adopt expedite procedure to dispense with issue that have no real prospect of success this align with summary judgment available in court proceeding and will make arbitration more efficient 
 we move seamlessly to clause which will help emergency arbitrator emergency arbitrator be appoint on a temporary basis while a full tribunal be be   establish that process can sometimes take week they be therefore very important to arbitration they be often task with vital preliminary matter such as preserve evidence or asset and be important to ensure that arbitration can proceed smoothly as the practice of emergency arbitrator post date the act our framework do not make explicit provision for they so look again give we an opportunity to examine their role 
 clause empower emergency arbitrator to handle urgent matter well and ensure compliance with their direction by equip they with final order and court enforcement that will give emergency arbitrator the same pathway to enforce their order as other arbitrator and will enhance their effectiveness 
 clause provide that court order make in support of arbitral proceeding can be make against party which align with the position in court proceeding for example it would enable a party to arbitration to get an order freeze asset hold by a party such as a bank 
 clause ensure that when a party challenge an arbitral award at court the court have the full range of remedy available regardless of the pathway this clause iron out discrepancy that court and practitioner have otherwise seek to work around 
 clause provide more efficient court challenge to the tribunal jurisdiction through rule of court that would prohibit repeat evidence and argument already debate in front of the tribunal that will avoid such challenge become full re hearing reduce cost and delay 
 i can deal with clause pretty quickly you will be pleased to know madam deputy speaker clause ensure that the time limit for challenge award be consistent across the act 
 clause correct a rare example of a drafting error what the act mean to say be that court order could be appeal but in some case there would be restriction what it actually say be that court order could be appeal only where there be restriction to its credit the judicial committee of the house of lords spot this error and interpret the statute as it be mean to be read we have take this opportunity to correct the drafting to reflect the judicial ruling as a useful bit of tidying up 
 clause streamline the requirement for apply to court to obtain preliminary ruling from the court on question of law or on whether the arbitrator have jurisdiction to hear the dispute early ruling such as those from expert judge can save time and cost 
 i be get towards the end of go through the clause in fact i have come to the last and final clause that i wish to comment upon clause as you have probably work out madam deputy speaker because that usually come after clause laughter there be no clause so clause be the final clause clause repeal provision that be never bring into force simply to tidy up the act those provision would have mean slight difference in approach between domestic arbitration and international arbitration in the event they be never use or need never bring into force and there remain no demand for they our   arbitration law be class and apply equally to domestic and international arbitration so remove the provision be a helpful way to tidy thing up 
 in sum the bill will greatly approve the arbitral process in our jurisdiction and far cement our position as a top global business destination where legal dispute can be resolve fairly and quickly the bill have already go through the other place where it receive considerable examination and support from noble and learn member include many experienced arbitrator there be apparently a lot of experienced arbitrator in the other place and they bring their knowledge experience and expertise to the debate for which we be very grateful 
 indeed i emphasise that the bill have be review by member of the other place not once but twice the time scrutiny be provide by a committee lead by the noble and learn lord thomas of cwmgiedd that take further evidence from expert stakeholder the several technical improvement make to the previous bill because of that work be retain in this bill this time the bill be review on the floor of the other place where the government amend clause to fix a long stand error in our framework on arbitral appeal 
 i have be quite thorough in cover the ground i hope all member feel they have get a good understanding of the issue behind the bill and why we need to take the step that i be urge the whole house to take 
 to conclude i the remark make by lord thomas on reading 
 we must find a mean of do this very rapidly as we must keep english law i say english law deliberately attractive and at the forefront of use internationally for the benefit of our whole economy 
 official report house of lords   november vol c. 
 i hope the house agree and will give the bill a reading 
 before this government be elect we say that we would change this country and we will to get change do any government have to stand on firm foundation which be why as we have just hear from the chief secretary to the treasury we promise to be responsible with the public ’s money we know that every penny count in this mission because if we fail to protect the public purse we fail to protect the purse of the public family finance can never withstand fantasy economic 
 that be suppose to be the whole point of the welfare cap it be design to help well control public spending count the cost of the rise price of failure i will come to some of the failure we be now see and the people throw on the scrapheap as a result of the failure of year of economic policy particularly on the labour market 
 the welfare cap be intend to ensure that the cost of important part of the social security system such as universal credit though not count those actively look for work the personal independence payment and pension credit remain predictable and affordable only the state pension and benefit for unemployed household be exclude 
 what be the result of a decade of conservative welfare cap repeat breach of the cap with ever high limit the late cap be now on course to be breach by an £ overspend this be not tolerable give the state of our economy and the public finance 
 worse still there be the human cost for every single person who could be enjoy the benefit of work but have be deny the choice and chance they deserve i regularly meet people in that position there be the young person who have not recover from the dreadful legacy of the pandemic not in college not start their job barely even able to go out with friend and bear the burden of the mental health crisis that our young people face i believe the pandemic generation be completely let down 
 there be our old relative who have be push out of work before their time with hip or knee pain the nhs be just not able to help they at the moment and they be not even get advice about how to make end meet that be the legacy we inherit and it be not   good enough for anybody it be also the legacy of low growth the high cost of living and high inactivity with employment and social security system ill equip to meet the requirement of an old sicker nation that be the conservative party ’s record 
 unfortunately this breach forecast as far back as march but ignore be now wholly unavoidable in this fiscal year give the scale of failure we have inherit we will not duck the difficult decision need to restore economic stability and we will deal with the failure we see before we 
 before i say how we will do that i want to reflect on exactly how we end up in this situation the sad truth be that in way too many part of the country too many people be deny the opportunity to have a good job so that they can support themselves and put a roof over their family ’s head 
 the benefit bill only reflect that failure with people lock out of the workforce due to poor health and more working age people report a long term health condition than year ago we have large number of people turn up to a social security system that be not gear up to meet what have become the great unemployment challenge of a generation 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 whether she have have discussion with the welsh government on the potential impact of the propose visitor levy on the economy in wales 
 whether she have have discussion with the welsh government on the potential impact of the propose visitor levy on the economy in wales 
 whether she have have discussion with the welsh government on the potential impact of the propose visitor levy on the economy in wales 
 ahead of the opening game of this year ’s nations in paris on friday evening i know member right across the house will want to join i in wish the wales team good luck in their campaign 
 wales have join a long list of other country that have introduce a visitor levy include germany spain and france the welsh government ’s bill will enable local authority to decide whether to implement a small levy locally the money raise will be use to invest in wales ’s thrive tourist sector and develop and maintain attraction for resident and visitor alike 
 hospitality business in my constituency of bridlington and the wolds be rightly concerned about labour ’s plan for a tourist tax in wales so will the secretary of state confirm to the house today whether it be her government ’s policy to roll out such a tax across the united kingdom 
 as the hon member may know tourism be devolve and we work closely with the devolved government the department for culture media and sport my right hon friend the secretary of state for that department be here will carefully monitor the proposal by the welsh government there be currently no plan to introduce a similar tax in england 
 i welcome the government ’s ambition to welcome visitor per year to the uk by but do the secretary of state share my concern that a visitor levy combine with ever more expensive electronic travel authorisation will make it much more expensive for people to visit wales and indeed my constituency of mid bedfordshire starve hard work people of income at a time when they have to pay labour ’s job tax 
 as far as i be aware mid bedfordshire be not in wales the hon member raise objection to the welsh government ’s policy but he should perhaps check his own rank because conservative run great yarmouth borough council have support a form of tourist levy for year 
 like many of my constituent in romford i have always enjoy visit wales however for many this visitor levy will be a step too far it be bind to deter tourism to the principality do the secretary of state agree with i that we should be encouraging and champion british domestic tourism not inhibit it 
 there be a number of assumption in the hon member ’s question as i say more than country and holiday destination around the world have introduce a form of visitor levy and many of we have pay levy when visit other country as i say of the conservatives own council be champion a tourist levy they need to do their research well

 we have hear this week that it be growth for heathrow but decline for welsh university cardiff university in the secretary of state ’s home city be ax full time job due to a funding crisis with nursing music and modern language degree on the chop block this be an education disaster play out in real time will the government scrap their national insurance hike to ease the strain on university 
 the potential job loss at cardiff university be deeply concern and will come as a significant blow to university staff and their family i hope that there will be sufficient volunteer for a voluntary redundancy programme so that we avoid compulsory redundancy and that support will be provide to those impact the right hon lady will know that the last year of conservative policy have see the university sector decimate across the united kingdom 
 on conservative policy the secretary of state will know that university be also be hammer by brexit the number of eu student start full time undergraduate course in the uk fall by between and to the low level in year surely she agree that our rejoin the single market would help university to attract more student as well as boost economic growth 
 this government have make economic growth their no mission the prime minister be lead from the front in reset the uk ’s relationship with the eu however the right hon lady ’s question highlight the stark risk associate with separatism those risk be why i will always be a strong and passionate advocate for a wales that thrive as part of the united kingdom

 rural crime be a scourge across the entirety of the united kingdom what discussion have the secretary of state have with her cabinet colleague on ensure a consistent approach to tackle rural crime across the uk 
 we be elect on a manifesto that include a mission for safe street across every nation of the united kingdom we will put police back on the beat ensure there be a name officer for every neighbourhood and provide additional officer police community support officer and special constable in neighbourhood role in england and wales the provisional police funding settlement have be increase this year by up to £ 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 an itv wales investigation last year discover prevention of future death report over a month period relate to the north wales betsi cadwaladr university health board the welsh secretary ’s predecessor call for an inquiry into these tragedy meanwhile answer be rightly be seek as there be clear evidence of groom gang sexually exploit young child in wales will the secretary of state commit to building on her predecessor ’s action and push the welsh government to use the inquiries act to launch vital wales wide inquiry to give victim and their love one justice 
 the hon lady will be aware that unlike the previous government we be determined to give the victim of child sexual exploitation the long overdue justice that they deserve by enact the recommendation of the jay review on   january the home secretary announce that victim will be give more power to have their case re examined we have also unveil a rapid national audit to be lead by baroness louise casey to uncover the scale and profile include ethnicity of group base offending in the uk today 
 it be clear from the secretary of state ’s weak response that the labour party have a woman problem and a justice problem in a nation cymru report a survivor say that she believe the abuse be still happen and that young victim be not get the help they need a refusal to create a process for listen to victim in wales and hold inquiry mean that justice will not prevail and community remain at risk this house will be as concerned as i be about the number of domestic abuse case in south wales increase last year there be almost victim what step be she take directly to support victim and survivor 
 that be a bit rich come from the hon lady previous conservative government her government decimate the ministry of justice budget crown court delay victim wait year for crown   court trial that all happen under their watch we be protect woman and girl in wales where the tories fail to do so 
 what recent discussion she have have with the welsh government on nhs reform in wales 
 the budget provide the welsh government with an additional £ to invest in public service such as the nhs the welsh government announce £ of funding for the nhs in wales this year and more than £ extra in their draft budget to fund health and social care and drive down waiting list 
 the labour party have be run the nhs for year in wales where waiting list be through the roof compare with those in england do the secretary of state agree with mr mark drakeford that what wales really need be few hospital 
 the welsh government have no plan to close any hospital i will not be take any lecture from the conservatives with their fictitious plan to build new hospital in england the hospital do not exist the money do not exist they be not happen 
 will the secretary of state outline how she and her colleague be work with the welsh government to improve health outcome for people in wales 
 we be work in a spirit of genuine collaboration with the welsh government to do everything possible to cut waiting list and build an nhs fit for the future in both england and wales a marked change from previous uk governments who be obstructive and hostile to the welsh government we be share good practice and the welsh government have establish a ministerial advisory group to plan nhs reform that will improve performance and reduce waiting list the group will draw on expertise from the nhs in both wales and england 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 labour have be run the nhs badly in wales since tony blair be prime minister with waiting time constantly at record level ever since the government can not just devolve and forget the people of wales need to see and feel proactivity from the wales office 
 everybody know somebody wait in pain in wales last week on any questions the minister speak without much detail of an injection of money that will bring down waiting list can the secretary of state explain if there be a plan or if it be just another blank piece of paper 
 the £ that the welsh government be to invest in the welsh nhs can happen only if the hon lady ’s colleague in the senedd vote for the budget if they do not vote for it the money will not happen 
 what step she be take to strengthen the union 
 through our new council of nations and regions and regular engagement between the secretary of state and the minister our government be collaborate more closely than ever before this mean that we can deliver for wales in new way on the nhs and on rail as well as create new job opportunity by deliver freeport establish investment zone and develop our industrial strategy to attract investment in critical area such as offshore wind 
 do the minister agree that the close collaboration by the uk and welsh governments to deliver the industrial strategy be an essential element of this government ’s plan to deliver strong economic growth throughout the uk and will she explain how this joint work by both government will help welsh industry do she far agree that the snp government in scotland should take a similar approach to reap the full benefit of our great partnership of nation which be so badly undermine by the reckless action of the previous government 
 i do indeed agree the snp could learn a thing or from our collaborative approach to secure economic growth in wales our new industrial strategy be central to our growth mission and our plan for change the secretary of state have establish an innovative economic advisory group to enable the uk and welsh governments business leader trade union and expert to work together to pursue opportunity for growth and job and to attract investment 
 far to that answer i see from recent press coverage that the snp government be once again bang on about another independence referendum despite the supreme court ’s ruling will the government make it crystal clear to devolve government that they do not have the power to arbitrarily instigate independence referendum 
 i can confirm that the hon gentleman be absolutely right

 i thank the minister for her response i be incredibly passionate about animal welfare i have a dog and a cat and for the most part we be an animal love country that be why i find it so shocking that we still have practice such as greyhound race that treat animal as disposable if they do not run fast enough or if they get injure they get bin off some of they be still spend of their life in kennel will the minister meet i to discuss this issue far

 let i be absolutely clear there will be no means testing of the state pension under this labour government we be commit both to the triple lock and to the principle that people should receive pension base on their contribution regardless of their wealth my hon friend be right pensioner will receive a £ increase in april when people such as the leader of the opposition say that they want mean testing that mean a cut the difference between we be that they would cut pension and we be increase they 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 may i take this opportunity to solemnly commemorate the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz we remember the jewish man woman and child who be murder the holocaust stand as a unique evil in human history 
 yesterday the prime minister set his growth test he say that if a policy be 
 good for growth the answer be yes if it ’s not then the answer be no 
 this morning the chancellor embrace a series of conservative policy although many be welcome they will take year to deliver when the conservatives leave office we have the fast economic growth in the g7 but what be the government do for growth now they be destroy it let we look at the employment bill the government ’s own figure say it will cost business £ a year it clearly fail the prime minister ’s growth test will he drop it 
 i think the proposition that the conservatives leave a golden inheritance be test on   july which be why they be stand over there 
 the leader of the opposition ask what we be do the office for national statistics say that we have the high investment for year pwc say that this be the good place to invest in the world the international monetary fund have upgrade our growth predict that the uk will be the fast grow major economy in europe wage be up and inflation be down however there be more to do we be reform planning and regulation build the new home that we need and support a runway at heathrow as the leader of the opposition admit to the cbi in november 
 there be no point in i just complain about labour when it be obvious that we conservative lose the confidence of business 
 we be not take lecture from they 
 the prime minister do not want to talk about the employment bill because he do not know about it last week he mislead the house he be not on top of his own education bill 
 order we can not accuse the prime minister of mislead the house interruption we can not do it i be sure there be word that the leader of the opposition would prefer to use 
 last week the prime minister claim to have lay down an amendment that he have not make he do not know what be go on in here or out there last week i speak to a woman run a business in exeter she be terrify of take on new staff she be struggle to keep her head above water dread what this government will do next she be not alone the federation of small businesses say of small employer be concerned about the employment bill clause to make it hard for business to hire new employee often young people look for their job this be not an employment bill it be an unemployment bill give these clause will he drop his bill and show that he be not anti growth 
 we believe in give people proper dignity and protection at work that be why we be proud of our record on support worker the conservative consistently vote against any protection for work people and the leader of the opposition ’s consistent refrain be that there should be less but we be drive growth on behalf of work people good work right be consistent with growth every good business know that on top of planning reform the building of house and support aviation the chancellor this morning speak of the oxford cambridge growth corridor redevelop old trafford and manufacturing at east midlands airport we want to grow the economy the only policy the leader of the opposition have get be to shrink pension 
 all the prime minister ’s idea be the one that we think up he need to make sure that we deliver growth now as well as in the future to grow our economy we must get more people off sickness and welfare and into work clause and of the unemployment bill take we in the opposite direction by increase entitlement the government themselves his government estimate that these change will increase business cost from £ to £ a year in sick pay that will mean high price few job and less growth will he drop these measure from the bill 
 no i think they be good for worker and good for growth this be the same argument that the conservatives make against the minimum wage and every protection for worker the leader of the opposition say that they be their idea she say she support a runway at heathrow her shadow transport secretary say that it would be calamitous the shadow business secretary be busy write letter oppose airport expansion in his own back yard the shadow chief secretary to the treasury say the oxford cambridge idea be flawed and he be against it we be the coalition of builder they be the coalition of blocker 
 the prime minister forget that his own chancellor block an airport in her constituency they be hypocrite 
 let we talk about the employment bill part of the bill mean that a new employee could start a job in the morning and take their employer to a tribunal that afternoon it be no wonder that this bill have be call an adventure playground for lawyer this bill be terrible for business but it be great employment for lawyer i know the prime minister love the legal profession but he need to stop be a lawyer and start   be a leader this be another measure in the bill that fail his growth test will he show some leadership and drop it 
 i understand that the leader of the opposition like straight talk she be talk absolute nonsense she know and anybody who understand anything about the bill or any employment law will know that you can not start in the morning and go to a tribunal in the afternoon we know she be not a lawyer she be clearly not a leader and if she keep on like this she be go to be the next lettuce 
 the prime minister do not know what his bill be do he should listen to business which be terrify of this bill the only worker he care about be lawyer but it be not just lawyer benefit from this bill who else benefit it be not taxpayer they will be pay for even more welfare it be not young worker they will not get their break it be definitely not business they be be hammer with yet more burden who benefit it be the trade union part of the unemployment bill—[interruption labour members have not read it part of the unemployment bill be the big expansion of trade union power for a generation—[interruption exactly thank you the public will have hear they cheer rather than deregulate for business which create growth he be deregulate for the union clause alone reduce the notice period for strike to just week give that strike be catastrophic for growth will he drop part of the bill 
 it be good for work people and it be good for the economy the right hon lady should keep up the cbi have welcome our positive step this morning the chancellor have give a brilliant speech on the economy fix the mess the conservatives leave and grow our economy and the cbi have say it celebrate this 
 positive leadership and a clear vision to kickstart the economy 
 that be the difference we be grow the economy the conservatives leave it in a complete mess 
 the arrogance of the prime minister be that he think that it be his government who create growth he be wrong it be business that create growth our economy be build by entrepreneur risk taker and the hard graft of work people they know that you can not tax your way to growth you can not borrow your way to growth you can not legislate your way to growth other country be serious about free business from red tape president trump be do it in america argentina be take a chainsaw to regulation even the eu be not go as far as this left wing government this bill will put we at the bottom of the pack add to the job tax and the family business tax it be no wonder that wealth creator be flee britain in drove the chancellor be desperately try to save her reputation she know labour have damage growth this bill manifestly fail the prime minister ’s own growth test if he will not drop the unemployment bill what be the point of his growth test 
 the right hon lady have get a nerve the conservatives break the economy and completely destroy it they break the health service and completely destroy it they ruin the prison and everything   else you can mention they fail on every front they be in no position to give we lecture on anything she say that she accept they fail and they be change but they have learn absolutely nothing 
 i welcome the government ’s action last week to tackle rogue trader who install faulty home insulation affect many of my constituent do the prime minister agree that labour ’s warm home plan will tackle fuel poverty and bring down bill for family as part of our plan for change 
 the conservatives have a lot to answer for in the fail system that they leave behind we have take immediate action to ensure that consumer insulate their home be not let down again we be invest £ in our warm home plan to upgrade home

 we have see progress on that already with huge private sector investment into our country since this government come into service but now we must go fast and far we must help business and place to achieve their potential we do that by be an active and strategic state that work in true partnership with business investor and local leader to deliver for the british people in every corner of the country that principle be at the heart of the chancellor ’s speech early today in oxfordshire where she announce the late step that the government be take to drive growth across the country i be pleased to update the house on those announcement now 
 the economic growth we be pursue must reach into every town city and community across the united kingdom inclusive growth for everyone not just those at the top because there be untapped talent and unrealised opportunity throughout the country and we can not let that go to waste any long if we can raise the productivity of major city like manchester birmingham and leeds just to the national average we will deliver an extra £ in economic output so i can confirm that our plan for regional growth will be hardwire into the spending review the infrastructure strategy the industrial strategy and our approach to trade and investment 
 we be already provide £ of funding to support the development of a new mass transit system in west yorkshire and at the autumn budget we secure improved connection between town and city from manchester through to york we be also develop our plan to far improve connectivity in the north and across the country through our year infrastructure strategy which will set out our long term vision for social and economic infrastructure across the country 
 today we be progress with the wrexham and flintshire investment zone focus on the area ’s incredible strength in advanced manufacturing to leverage in £ of private investment and create up to new job as the chancellor announce at davos last week the office for investment will work hand in hand with local area to develop opportunity for international inward investment start with the liverpool city region and the north east combine authority while the national wealth fund will build on its strength and combine authority engagement to build a pipeline of investable proposition with mayor start with strategic partnership in the glasgow city region west yorkshire   the west midland and greater manchester stick with manchester we be give our support to the mayor of greater manchester ’s plan for the redevelopment of old trafford create new housing new commercial development and a new stadium but i be advise to inform the house not necessarily government wide support for the team that play there 
 i be pleased to update the house on our new approach to the oxford cambridge growth corridor a hugely exciting opportunity for the uk and the british economy for century these city have be synonymous with inspiration invention and innovation economic analysis suggest that with the right support the region could bring a gdp boost of £ by yet time and again government have fail to capitalise on this remarkable area most recently in when the last government drop their commitment to what they call the ox cam arc project 
 through under investment poor transport connection and a lack of affordable housing the incredible growth potential of the area have be squander as people and business have be force to move and invest elsewhere no long lord vallance will act as our champion for the growth corridor utilise his impressive experience in life science academia and government to unlock growth opportunity across the region and promote its potential to investor across the world we will establish a new growth commission for oxford to recognise and capitalise on the growth potential of this historic city 
 we already know of course that transportation be a huge factor in the success of the country heathrow be the uk ’s only hub airport and our large air freight hub by volume connect we to emerge market around the world open up new opportunity for trade and investment but its growth have be constrain for decade today we be announce that the government support and be invite proposal for a runway at heathrow airport to be bring forward by the summer this be an important infrastructure project expect to have positive growth impact across the united kingdom and it have the backing of business and business group include the cbi the federation of small businesses and british chambers of commerce as well as trade union such as the gmb and unite 
 accord to a recent study from frontier economics a runway could increase gdp by over the next year with over half—60%—of that boost go to area outside london and the south east it could create over job in the local area and maintain heathrow ’s status both as a global passenger hub and as the uk ’s large air freight hub by volume 
 reform this government have introduce to speed up the planning system will ensure the delivery of the project and set it up for success once proposal have be receive the government will take forward a full assessment through the airport national policy statement to ensure that any scheme be deliver in line with our legal environmental and climate obligation we want the scheme to be value for money and our clear expectation be that any surface transport cost associate with the project will be finance by private capital and should be sustainable and low carbon the secretary of state for transport will also set out planning decision for further airport expansion at gatwick and luton shortly 
 crucially i be pleased to announce that we be take further step in our transition to greener clean aviation at the start of the month the sustainable aviation fuel mandate become law sustainable aviation fuel reduce carbon dioxide emission compare with fossil jet fuel by around today we be announce an additional £ for the advanced fuel fund over the next year and we have set out the detail of how we will deliver a revenue certainty mechanism those measure will support investment and high skill green job in plant across the united kingdom deliver sustainable aviation fuel here in the uk for uk consumption 
 transportation be equally important on a local level and that be as true for the oxford cambridge growth corridor as it be for anywhere else this government have confirm that they will provide crucial funding for transport link include upgrade to the a428 to reduce journey time between milton keynes bedford and cambridge as well as for east west rail with new service between oxford and milton keynes start this year we have already receive submission to the new town taskforce to build new development along the new railway at tempsford we will accelerate delivery of a mainline station on the east coast main line so that traveller can get to london in under an hour and to cambridge in under minute once east west rail have be deliver 
 we will ensure that the pioneer work that have long be a hallmark of the area will continue we be today commit to a new ai growth zone in culham we welcome the university of cambridge ’s plan for a new flagship innovation hub in the centre of cambridge and a new cambridge cancer research hospital will be deliver as part of wave of the new hospital programme just yesterday moderna complete the build for its new vaccine production and research and development site in harwell while commit to invest £ in the united kingdom proof that when we create the condition for success business can lead the way

 this government have come in with a purpose to bring growth and with it opportunity to the country in just month we have take the tough decision to make that possible we be take on the responsibility of a government who deliver real change for people no long the hollow promise of the conservative party but change deliver under this labour government work with business and local leader to drive the growth that will lift up this country now we must go far and fast so that the next generation and the generation after will have the opportunity they deserve to ensure that britain be strong and successful once   again in a fast change world and so that everybody in this country can have the chance to succeed today ’s announcement will help make that a reality and show how our plan for change will build a well britain i commend the statement to the house 
 i call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer 
 the chief secretary tell we that growth be the no mission of this government and add now we must go fast which i have to tell he suggest a certain lack of ambition what we do not need be some hasty mañana moment of unquantified vague promise of a well tomorrow we need action now to reverse the grievous damage that this chancellor have work in just her month in office why do the government deliver a budget that the independent office for budget responsibility say would lead to low growth high inflation and high interest rate and would cost job i have to tell the right hon gentleman that go for growth in the 2030 mean nothing to the business that have already stop hire shed worker and put up price thank to labour ’s ruinous policy 
 it be hard to escape the conclusion that these announcement have be hastily cobble together by a government who be under increase pressure to change course but be seemingly incapable of do so why have these announcement come only now the labour party have year in opposition and month in government lead up to its budget if the government really want to unleash investment innovation and the private sector they should not have decide in the autumn to increase substantially the tax burden and the size of the state by do so far from encourage private investment they be actively squeeze it out will the chief secretary to the treasury reassure business right now that there will be no further growth destroy fiscal measure in the spring statement include tax rise 
 be the truth not that the damage be already be do even before labour ’s tax rise bite in april the economy be flatline right now so will any of the announcement have an impact within this parliament and what if any impact be they likely to have on the obr ’s forecast in march 
 incredibly the chancellor say in her speech that business be what drive growth and that the government should support they yet this be a government who have drive business confidence off a cliff they have tax business to the hilt and through their upcoming employment legislation will be hit they still far with ever more job destroy red tape can the chief secretary to the treasury set out what the overall impact of government policy decision since july have be on regulatory cost for business do he agree with the business secretary ’s extraordinary utterance on the medium this morning that the government have not hammer business 
 the chancellor claim this morning that she have see no alternative suggestion from the opposition so let i give she now last year the conservative manifesto include £ in welfare saving at the time the labour party say that the money simply be not there now we be tell that the government will shortly be come forward with plan for welfare reform   another damascene conversion if they have grasp this issue when they come into office they could have tackle the rise welfare bill rather than tax job and kill growth the government ’s failure to act mean that business and million of people be pay the price so can the chief secretary to the treasury commit today to match that £ or can he at least tell we the scale of saving that we can expect from his promise reform 
 some of the announcement make today be of course welcome the role of the opposition be not to oppose for opposition ’s sake not least because many of the measure announce be reheat from the previous conservative government the plan on pension investment for example seem oddly familiar to we probably because they be simply to continue the reform that i be bring in when i be secretary of state for work and pension even in this area though we must wait and see before pass judgment because this government have show that we simply can not trust their word they promise not to raise taxis but they do they promise not to cut winter fuel payment but they do they promise not to borrow more but they do we need to see action not just word 
 the chancellor talk about remove barrier to growth oh yes she talk about it but that talk come from the same person whose budget kill the economy and growth stone dead if we be look to remove the great barrier to growth in this country perhaps we should start with the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer 
 the house be indebted to the shadow chancellor mr melmentum himself for his lecture on the need for speed from this government let i tell he that we have do more in the last or month than that lot do in the last year 
 the shadow chancellor ask i about our plan to work with business the comment today from business leader and investor speak for themselves our plan be welcome by business and we will be work in partnership with they to deliver for this country he also ask i about work those of we in the labour party make no secret of the fact that we like to support people into work strong secure work with workplace right and secure income to help make people ’s family finance add up that be why our party be create in the place the real truth from the data be that under the last government too many people be wait at home sick unable to get nhs appointment or access to mental health service so that they could be help back into work too many people be wait at home wait for training and unable to seize the opportunity advertise in front of they this labour government will not treat those thing as a luxury but will work at speed to give people the work they deserve 
 at the heart of the shadow chancellor ’s statement be a truth for the country to consider under the last administration it be promise cancel under this administration it be promise be deliver 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 i welcome this government ’s commitment to infrastructure investment and to tell the world that britain be open for business but to achieve all of this we will need a really skilled workforce to deliver on   those major construction project may i ask my right hon friend to set out how the government will ensure that we have the skill to deliver what he have promise 
 i thank the chair of the treasury committee for her question this be an important test of turn policy into real world delivery through our infrastructure and industrial strategy we be engage right now with business and investor across the country so that as we bring forward our plan we have a skill and training system that create opportunity for people to take up the job that we need they to do in order to help get britain building that will be a crucial part of our approach to infrastructure so that every person across the country can seize the benefit of this government ’s plan 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the government be absolutely right to focus on economic growth but their blinker approach on europe be hold back british business and stifle the very growth that we need to fund our public service by rule out negotiation with the eu on a bespoke customs union and a youth mobility scheme the chancellor ’s dash for growth will be more like a slow crawl in a car with the handbrake on in order to turbocharge economic growth will the government start negotiate those initiative now 
 to unleash growth through our small business the chancellor should scrap her national insurance contribution rise and instead seek to raise the same amount of money through the measure that we liberal democrats have suggest reverse the tax cut on the big bank increase taxis on the big tech and gaming company and reform capital gain tax in a way that would be fair and raise more money will the government look again at those alternative revenue raiser and lift the burden that the government have place on small business 
 on airport the chancellor have voice her support for heathrow expansion and have suggest that expansion will be forthcoming for other airport we liberal democrats oppose this because it will deliver minimal growth at a huge cost to the climate can the government confirm whether they intend to abide by the advice of their own climate change adviser that no airport expansion should proceed until a uk wide capacity management framework be in place in the midst of a climate emergency can the government give a cast iron guarantee that the so call refresh carbon budget that the chancellor refer to will not water down climate target and what do they have to say to those expert who say that sustainable aviation fuel be not realistic or scalable 
 turn to the oxford cambridge growth corridor we really welcome plan that far boost the uk ’s position as a european and global science leader can the government confirm that there will be enough money for the whole of the route to be construct on the east west rail route and that they will work hand in glove with local authority to minimise the environmental impact introduce infrastructure before or alongside housing and maximise local community benefit 
 as the hon lady know this government commit in their manifesto to not rejoin the single market or the custom union we will honour that promise but the trade deal that the previous government   put together be clearly not good enough there be room for we to improve our trading energy and security relationship with our friend in the european union and my ministerial colleague be in active discussion with their counterpart to take that work forward 
 the hon lady invite i to speculate on any future budgets that be above my pay grade but i be sure the chancellor hear her suggestion on airport as i say in my statement all our plan will be in line with our legal obligation of course we recognise the need for more sustainable fuel and sustainable transport as part of those expansion plan 
 lastly the hon lady ask i about something that i can not read 
 east west rail 
 thank you i think it be eu again i could not read my own handwriting 
 the whole premise of the growth corridor be that we will have a transport spine through that corridor that allow for all the development housing lab space or community around it that be a crucial part of our plan and we will make sure that it be deliver 
 i congratulate the chief secretary to the treasury and the chancellor of the exchequer on a plan for growth that be both concrete shovel in the ground now and forward look build on our scientific and skill base to drive long term job and high living standard heathrow expansion will help business in the north east but for the sake of those of we who be not manchester united fan will the chief secretary to the treasury make it clear that much of the investment in the man u development will be private sector base will he also set out how that will help the rest of the north particularly newcastle united fan such as myself 
 i thank the chair of the science innovation and technology committee for her question she and her committee know the huge advantage we have in the uk with our brilliant university and research and development ecosystem which be why we be support they and put rocket booster underneath their activity to develop world lead and frontier research and innovation and stimulate economic growth across the country
