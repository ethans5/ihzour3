 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to help tackle hyper prolific offender 
 what step her department be take to help tackle hyper prolific offender 
 we know that prolific offender represent only of offender but account for nearly of all sentence that clearly can not continue which be why i have specifically ask david gauke to look at this issue in the independent sentencing review to ensure that we have few crime commit by prolific criminal 
 i be grateful to the lord chancellor for her answer can she tell the house what data her department hold on the nationality of prolific offender and what step she will take to deport those who be non british 
 the hon member will know that we retain datum on foreign national offender and this government be on track to remove more foreign national offender this year than in the previous year i obviously want to make further progress on this issue and i hope that there will be consensus across the house so that we remove those who commit crime in this country and who have no right to be here 
 the government ’s early release scheme have an impact assessment for it to run for year for however long it do run will the government confirm that no prolific offender will be release early 
 the impact assessment be do over the usual period of time but i have commit to review the policy month from the moment it be bring in which be a commitment that we will keep i recognise that we have a problem with prolific offending   it have go up over the last decade or so which be why i have specifically ask the sentencing review panel to consider the intervention that we should make to cut the cycle of prolific offending 
 retail worker in my constituency tell i that they can predict almost to the week when somebody will arrive at their store to begin shoplift again after their oftentime all too short sentence do my right hon friend agree with they that the solution to hyper prolific offending must be long sentence in certain case 
 the length of sentence and how to deal with the problem of prolific offending will be look at specifically by the independent sentencing review panel my hon friend will understand why i can not pre empt the finding of that review but he will note that this government be commit to scrap the effective immunity for some shoplifting which be introduce by the previous conservative government by remove the £ threshold that show that we be determined to clamp down on the sort of shoplifting he describe 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we know that of the key way in which we manage prolific offender be through tagging both gp tag and home detention tagging the secretary of state have assure we that the problem with early release tagging have now be resolve but i understand that problem persist for thousand of other prisoner who be due to be tag can she assure the public that everyone who be be release and who should be get a tag be be tag on time 
 yes the specific problem that the hon gentleman refer to which relate to serco ’s performance and the tranche of sds40 release have now be resolve the backlog have be clear and serco ’s performance be now back to where it should be of course we will continue to monitor serco ’s overall performance and keep the contract under regular review 
 the house will have hear that the secretary of state do not answer my question i acknowledge that the problem with the early release scheme have be tackle but i be tell by many people work in the criminal justice sector that there be many other delay with the thousand of other prisoner who be due to be tag again can she assure the house that the thousand of prisoner who be due to be tag be be tag on time 
 yes there be no additional issue in relation to tag or the process by which the tagging take place with serco but where there be contract failure by serco we will not hesitate to take action we have already impose financial penalty for the thing that go wrong with the sds40 release and we will keep this issue under regular review the prisons minister in the other place discuss these matter directly with serco on a regular basis as do my official and we will continue to monitor the situation 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the condition of prison 
 the prison estate condition survey programme be a live assessment of the condition of our estate but there be still much to do approximately cell be lose to dilapidation under the last government that be why we be invest £ in prison and probation service maintenance in and up to £ in 
 a constituent who be now a prisoner of hmp coldingley write to i recently about the appalling condition in his prison he speak about the prevalence of drug violence discrimination and denial of access to healthcare in his most recent letter to i he say that the condition have get so bad that he make an attempt on his life another report on coldingley have describe the condition as inhumane can the minister tell i what urgent work be be do to ensure that all our prison have humane condition for prisoner 
 this government be determined to ensure the good possible condition in our prison we have inherit a crisis in our prison i be afraid but if the hon member wish to write to i about that particular issue i will be happy to write back to he 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 the condition of our victorian prison in particular be not conducive to rehabilitation or preparation for life on release the government be press ahead with the construction of new prison place which their predecessor fail to honour what thought have be give in the design and operation of these major new prison to the training education addiction and mental health need of inmate for whom prison be currently little more than a human warehouse 
 these new prison will be build with all the thing my hon friend mention take fully into account the government be determined to put in place more prison place 
 what step her department be take through the criminal justice system to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 last week this government introduce domestic abuse protection order in select area this will improve protection for victim of domestic abuse include non physical abuse and coercive and control behaviour we have also commit to fast track rape case through the court in order to deliver swift justice for victim of this abhorrent offence 
 i recently visit south ayrshire women ’s aid in my constituency as part of the day of activism against gender base violence will the minister join i in praise the hard work of woman ’s aid in support woman and girl who have suffer violence do she agree that we need more support for these organisation up and down the country particularly in respect of reliable funding 
 i wholeheartedly echo my hon friend ’s word about the vital work of organisation such as women ’s aid who do such brilliant work in empower woman and child to rebuild their life after experience domestic abuse this government be commit to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade that be why i have decide to protect violence against woman and girl victim spend in the ministry of justice by maintain the current funding level for sexual violence and domestic abuse support for the next financial year 
 in august alan jermey brutally murder kirsty wilson strangle she and set her body on fire while their young daughter sleep upstairs he have now be recommend for transfer to an open prison which could allow he unchaperoned access to the community within month his daughter now and be my constituent and they be terrify by the thought of encounter he or bad of he come to their home as he know their address will the lord chancellor meet i and these young woman to discuss their fear and ensure that this transfer be stop 
 i would be delighted to meet the hon gentleman and his constituent to discuss the case 
 the minister will be aware of increase report of internet image abuse and the rise of deepfake pornography what be her department do to ensure that woman and girl be safe online and that this modern form of abuse can be prevent 
 this government share the concern that more need to be do to protect woman from this appalling form of abuse that be why we make a clear commitment in our manifesto to criminalise the creation of sexually explicit deepfake image of adult and i look forward to set out our position on this in more detail soon 
 schoolgirl suffer sexual abuse by their headteacher neil foden who be sentence in july to year with a third tariff the crown prosecution service now tell i that foden will instead spend half his sentence in prison because the most serious of his crime can only be sentence to year will the minister meet i to discuss how to safeguard the victim whose abuser be in a position of trust because they live in fear of his early release 
 i be aware of the appalling case that the right hon lady mention it be horrific and all my thought be with the victim of those crime if she want to write to i with more detail i will happily look at the case as she know sentencing be a matter for the independent judiciary but i will look at the case and meet she to discuss it far 
 what step she be take to equip prisoner with the skill they need to support their rehabilitation 
 what step she be take to help ensure that prisoner be prepare for life outside of prison before they be release 
 we be mandate career advice in prison and introduce a life skill curriculum all release prisoner have access to an employment advisory board that can connect prisoner with work and banking and id administrator be prepare prisoner for life after prison 
 the uk face a major labour shortage that be cost billion of pound annually lacking prospect many ex prisoner return to a life of crime enhance prisoner literacy and numeracy and provide vocational training can help equip they with skill for employment lead to a reduction in reoffende rate i welcome the get britain working white paper which will address the issue do the minister agree that fail to tackle the issue will not only cause a lifelong challenge for individual but create a significant problem for the state include lose opportunity and increase crime 
 i agree with my hon friend we know that have a job and a home be the good way to reduce reoffende that be why we have employment hub in all resettlement prison where prisoner can access job vacancy and support with their application 
 the minister will know that prison governor have a statutory duty to ensure that prisoner be prepare for life outside prison before their release of the main issue for release prisoner be find a secure home so that they can have somewhere secure to live rather than go back to the place where they be probably involve in gang or with particular individual now that prisoner be be release from their sentence early what action be the minister take to ensure that they be fully prepared for life outside prison and there be no risk that they will reoffend 
 we know that accommodation be key to reduce reoffende that be why we be expand our transitional accommodation service and work closely with the ministry of housing communities and local government to develop a long term strategy to put we back on track to end homelessness and ensure this issue be tackle correctly 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of legislation on funeral 
 the government recognise that there be serious concern about the funeral director sector and that the legislation that govern what happen    after we die be outdate we be consider how to ensure that appropriate standard be introduce include through the potential for some form of regulation we have ask the law commission to create a future proof legal framework to address what happen to our body after we die 
 as the minister know we have be in correspondence about that sector she kindly write back to i to say that the fuller inquiry ’s phase interim report have be release my constituent joseph barsby run g. seller the big independent funeral director he be passionate about how we can bring forward a compassionate way of look at people who have die while ensure that standard be keep high will the minister consider meet i and he to far discuss way that we can bring the sector into the century 
 as the hon gentleman will know the vast majority of funeral director treat people in their care with the utmost respect as that business in his constituency will do nevertheless there be some serious issue of concern in the sector as i mention the government be currently consider the full range of possible next step include meet with sector director i would be happy to inform the hon gentleman when that meeting be take place so that he and his constituent can take part 
 order before we come to question i notice that it be group but to be honest i can not see a relationship between the question or why they be group together i hope a message can be pass back to the department to say that we need to have relevance in the way question be group 
 what step her department be take through the criminal justice system to help support victim of ecocide 
 the victim code set out the service and support that victim of crime be entitle to receive from the criminal justice system in england and wales that include the right to access support which apply regardless of whether they decide to report the crime directly to the police we provide police and crime commissioner with annual grant funding to commission local practical emotional and therapeutic support service for all victim of crime 
 england be home to of the world ’s chalk stream which be very rare habitat in winchester we be lucky to have the rivers itchen and meon run through the constituency we know that they be struggle with only of chalk stream rat as have good ecological health that be partly because of over abstraction partly because of pollution and partly because of water company dump sewage in they we know that that not only destroy biodiversity but make people who swim in it sick will the minister in addition to come down hard on water company commit to implement a sewage victim compensation scheme for that particular problem 
 i will ensure that the hon member ’s comment be pass to the department for environment food and rural affairs and the minister responsible for water quality i can confirm that we be committed to deliver for nature take action to meet our target in the environment act and that we work in partnership with civil society community and business to restore and protect our natural world 
 what step her department be take to help reduce reoffende 
 what step her department be take to help reduce reoffende 
 we will expand our transitional accommodation service and launch employment council to strengthen the relationship between employer and hm prison and probation service 
 people who commit crime should be prosecute and put in prison as quickly as possible it be also clear that we need to do more to reduce reoffende rate in order to keep the public safe to keep up with the current demand for prison place we need to build mega jail a year cost the taxpayer million give those fact do the minister agree that we need to invest in technology to bring reoffende rate down so that we can help those people turn their life around and crucially keep the public safe 
 absolutely public safety be our no priority and new technology give we every advantage to do thing differently that be of the thing that the independent sentencing review under david gauke will be look at 
 provide quality education and training for offender be of the most effective way of reduce reoffende weston college in weston super mare run a transformational prison education programme across the south west of england which support successful rehabilitation resettlement and employment of offender on release can the minister advise what step the department be take to ensure that more offender can develop the skill they need to successfully gain employment and reintegrate into society 
 i very much welcome the work that weston college do in prison we be also develop our training offer for employer in area such as rail track and construction and hmpps ’s create future opportunity programme be work to improve the employability of offender in both prison and the community 
 i declare an interest as the founder and chairman of a prison rehabilitation charity the minister have helpfully set out what the government be do about reduce reoffending which i welcome be he aware though of the enormous pressure put on prisoner who be approach the end   of their release give the pressure that the prison service be under that be partly because of early release itself which be release prisoner before they finish programme provide by charity or the prison but also because of the churn of prisoner be ship around the prison system because of the pressure on that system be there anything he can tell we about what the government be do to ensure that prisoner approach the end of their sentence have some stability in the prison they be serve in so that they can get support as they approach release 
 several of the thing that i have mention already be design to do exactly that and we recognise exactly what the hon gentleman say on the sds40 scheme prison and probation officer have do an outstanding job in support prisoner through that journey 
 a constituent of mine report a rape and sexual offence case well over year ago but like many victim be still wait for her case to be process by the crown court leave her pessimistic about the criminal justice system ’s ability properly to tackle violence against woman and girl what be the ministry of justice do to tackle the backlog and support victim of vawg through the criminal justice system 
 order that be not relevant to the question that have be ask 
 what step her department be take to increase prison capacity 
 we take immediate action to prevent the collapse of the prison system by change the automatic release point for standard determinate sentence we be build new prison place and we will publish our year capacity strategy shortly which will set out exactly where and by when we will get the place that we need the previous government leave prison in crisis we will fix they for good with that capacity strategy and the independent review of sentencing 
 i welcome what this government be do to increase prison capacity but what will the secretary of state do on tough sentencing if she go to my constituency of central suffolk and north ipswich she will be meet with a tough gruff east anglian accent that say what ’s the point of build prison place if you be not go to use they 
 i be sure the hon member ’s constituent will also recognise that even with the new supply that we be build we will still run out of prison place as the demand in the system be much great than the building plan we simply can not build our way out of this problem so to make sure that there be always a prison place for the people who need to be lock up and that we never run out of prison place again we need an independent review of sentencing 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the lady chief justice have say that the court be not operate at full capacity perpetuate the record number in prison on remand await trial there could be an extra sit day if the government allow they case such as rape and sexual assault be be push into baroness carr warn the justice secretary that failure to maximise judicial capacity would actually cost the government more in costly and limited prison place yet the justice secretary fail to agree to her request why be the government let out criminal rather than hear more case 
 i be tempt to remind the shadow minister about his own government ’s track record he ought to know that it be my predecessor his colleague the former lord chancellor who agree the allocation of sit day with the lady chief justice and that that concordat agreement be conclude during the election period when the tories be still conduct business when the right hon gentleman respond perhaps he would like to explain why the allocation be make for only sitting day what i have do be increase sit day by a further and increase magistrate court sentencing power which be the equivalent of an additional crown court sitting day in order to start crack down on that backlog 
 instead of increase sit hour the justice secretary ’s define intervention in her month in office have be to accidentally let out dangerous criminal from our prison just last week she rush to parliament to close loophole that she create for stalk for disclose private sexual image and for murder she could be sign deal with other country to get new prisoner transport agreement she could be use visa sanction with foreign country to force they to take back the foreign criminal in our prison she be not do so meanwhile criminal be be release and be reoffende already will the justice secretary commit now to end her dangerous and unnecessary early release scheme 
 the shadow minister could at least have apologise to the country for be part of a government and a party that run out of prison place it be the tory party that run the system at boil hot at over capacity i hate to remind he but for month before the previous election the tory party operate its own emergency release scheme which do not have any exclusion for offence connect to domestic abuse i will take no lesson from he as it be this government who be clean up the mess that his party leave behind 
 what step her department be take to reduce the backlog of crown court case 
 the crown court backlog that we inherit from the conservatives be dire instead of cut the number of case wait to be hear as they promise   the backlog of case explode under their watch this government be get a grip of the problem we have take important step we have fund crown court sit day this year and we have increase magistrate sentence power to free up more sitting day in the crown court to hear the most serious case but we know that there be more to do 
 i be campaign to put more police on our street but that be only part of the picture this backlog in our court mean that the entire criminal justice system be creak and justice be be delay this time last year there be a backlog in my region of more than case will the minister ensure that this conservative court chaos be deal with and offender be bring to justice 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to describe the situation as conservative court chaos indeed the full picture of the last government ’s terrible inheritance will become clear when we publish crown court datum later this week demand on the criminal court be increase at a fast rate than the action we be able to take and we must therefore go far this government understand the scale of the problem and be ready to confront it with the fundamental reform that will be necessary 
 the minister refer to court chaos a tribunal judge and a court worker from my taunton and wellington constituency write to i the tribunal judge say 
 tribunal be be cancel every day as they say there be not enough judge to cover the case this be absolutely not the case 
 and 
 people be wait month for their benefit appeal in appal poverty and again we can not deal with the case because of this limit 
 on sit day what will the minister do to increase sit day in taunton and somerset court 
 we be invest in increase court capacity and in the recruitment of judge and tribunal member as the lord chancellor say we have increase the number of crown court sitting day by but it be not simply enough to increase court sitting day we have to look at fundamental reform to address the serious backlog we have inherit from the conservative government 
 what step her department be take through the criminal justice system to help support victim of gambling relate crime 
 the government be determined to provide support for all victim of crime that include publicly consult on a new revise victim code in the new year i remind the hon member that the minister for gambling in the other place recently announce a legally mandate levy on gambling company to address gambling harm and to introduce nhs lead treatment and support 
 i welcome that response from the minister gambling addiction destroy life in fact on average gambling relate suicide occur every year it be not just the life of the gambler that get destroy there be an invisible group of victim the family who have to pick up the piece a local charity in my constituency spinney hill drug alcohol and addiction support tell i of a talented young man from a deprive socioeconomic background whose family save every single penny to send he to university he spend that and more on gambling because of his addiction the family be now in spiral debt and the whole family unit have be destroy do the minister agree that gambling company should pay a levy to help compensate family especially when child be become addict 
 the government recently announce a mandatory levy on the company directly to provide support and nhs lead service i will pass his comment to the department for culture media and sport to give he an answer 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the backlog of court case on victim of crime 
 bear down on the outstanding caseload in the crown court and bring down waiting time be a priority for the government we want to ensure that every victim have the swift access to justice that they deserve we know rape victim be wait a disproportionately long time for their trial and that be why we have commit to work with the judiciary to fast track those case through the court 
 recently truro crown court which serve my constituency of south west devon have be force to shut day a week due to recent budget cut and the judicial sitting day reduction some case have already be postpone until late include lengthy case that involve victim of violence and it be prompt those victim to consider withdraw their case give the maxim justice delay be justice deny what additional step be be take to support victim to continue with their case across devon and cornwall 
 as the hon lady know rape be an abhorrent crime and case be usually complex that mean despite judge prioritise case involve vulnerable complainant and witness rape victim can wait disproportionately long than victim of other case for their trial to come to court i remind she that the government have increase the number of court sitting date by day this year and the lord chancellor agree to increase capacity in the magistrate court so that we can get through case more quickly we be also introduce independent legal advocate in the new year to advise rape victim from report to trial which will ensure they stay in the system long feel supported and get to trial 
 in the last year the number of magistrate cover telford and wide shropshire fall from to in of the court session go unused at the crown court victim be   wait an average of month with some sexual offence take up to year to be deal with telford vote for change will the minister ensure that victim of crime get justice and that criminal be punish 
 absolutely the minister with responsibility for court my hon and learn friend   the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman have already outline the step that the government be take to increase sentencing in our court we will of course consider what other action we can take we know that the budgetary position that the government face be incredibly tight because of the inheritance that we receive however it be vital that we make fiscally responsible decision 
 what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the early release scheme 
 sds40 the standard determinate sentence early release scheme be an emergency measure that we have to take to avert the complete collapse of the criminal justice system follow the shocking inheritance leave to we by the previous government the emergency measure be not of course the solution to the crisis that we inherit that be why we will build the prison place that we need and have launch the independent review of sentencing 
 what concern i be not the past but the future and how to protect the public will the secretary of state assure i that the screening process be sufficiently robust to ensure that violent and dangerous criminal be not release into the community 
 i gently say to the right hon gentleman that the past be relevant in so far as it set the context for the crisis that we have inherit which need resolve give that we all but run out of prison place number have fall to few than in the summer it be important that we recognise that the prison system be and have be on the point of collapse that be why we have to take emergency measure we have make exclusion to the sds40 scheme that should take account of his concern it be of course important that offender be monitor and supervise effectively when they be not in prison and that be what we be try to do now tech can play a big role there and i have ask the independent review into sentencing to look into that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 there be no specific domestic abuse offence in law so abuser hide behind conviction such as actual bodily harm be be let out early under the sds40 early release scheme that be not right so i have introduce the domestic abuse aggravated offences bill to create a specific set of domestic abuse aggravate offence a bit like racially aggravate offence that could be exclude from early release scheme woman ’s aid be back my bill will the secretary of state back it too 
 the hon gentleman be right to note that under current legislation it be possible to exclude only offence rather than class of offender i be sure that his bill will gain some interest across the house if any such change be to be make they would be for the future as they do not help we with the current crisis i will ensure to discuss the detail of his bill with the home secretary 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer i hope to have the chance to meet she to discuss it in more detail the liberal democrats be deeply concerned about survivor who have be tell that as it stand their abuser be set to be release early such survivor be elizabeth hudson who i meet on the set of good morning britain today when launch this campaign she have write to ministers about her concern but say that she have not receive a response will the secretary of state meet elizabeth and i to discuss her case and how survivor can be respect and protect 
 i believe that all who have write have receive a response from the ministry but i will chase down that specific case the way we implement the policy mean that we be able to give the probation service time to prepare which be not available to it under the previous tory government ’s end of custody supervise licence scheme that mean that all victim who be suppose to be notify under the victim contact scheme have be notify 
 what discussion she have have with the chief coroner on report sudden unexpected death in epilepsy 
 i recently meet the chief coroner we do not discuss the specific of this issue but coroner have a statutory duty to investigate death that be not report to they if they suspect that the cause be unknown violent or unnatural or that the death occur in custody or other state detention 
 the charity sudep action which be base in my oxfordshire constituency of didcot and wantage provide specialist support for bereaved family improvement to the coroner service would help to reduce trauma improve understanding of the cause of death and enable more research to aid prevention of future death will the minister press for more investment in and support for the coroner service 
 the government recognise the impact of delay and the other issue face coroner at the moment and the impact that that be have on bereaved family and the wide system we welcome the recent justice committee report on the coroner service and i look forward to work closely with the chief coroner local authority and key partner to devise and deliver a wide strategy for those service 
 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of insource all prison maintenance 
 my hon friend be right to ask this question under the previous government a process be already under way to put in place new contract for prison maintenance we need to make sure that those contract deliver good value for the public purse 
 i thank the minister for that response the prison maintenance contract be set to be retendere to the private sector next year prison such as walton in my home city of liverpool a crumble victorian prison struggle to get the small repair undertake and there be £ worth of unreported repair within the prison system we know that privatisation lead to high cost and increase squalor so can the minister or the secretary of state call time on this fail experiment and bring prison maintenance back in house where it belong 
 the previous government pause work on essential maintenance which have add to the problem we be now deal with my hon friend be right to say that all option need to be look at in order to ensure we get the good possible value for money for the public purse from any new contract or arrangement 
 i thank the minister very much for that response story that have be quite prevalent in the press over the past month have be the amount of mould growth in prison which will obviously lead to health issue will the new prison maintenance service that the minister have refer to be able to deal with that specific issue if it be not deal with it will lead to ill health among those who be in prison 
 clearly issue such as that need to be deal with staff at his majesty ’s prison and probation service be do their utmost to try to tackle those issue but we will redouble our effort after the hon gentleman ’s encouragement 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 last week the national audit office release a damn report on the previous government ’s record on prison building show that their promise of prison place by the mid-2020 be hollow unwilling to face down opposition on their own back benches the last government dither and delay ultimately build less than a of the cell they promise as a result they leave our prison overcrowded and at the point of collapse later this week i will set out in my year capacity strategy a realistic plan for build the prison place that we need and i will ensure that our prison be never leave at the point of collapse again 
 i thank the justice secretary for that answer in common with many member of the house i have hear horrific story of perpetrator breach order to which they be subject give they further opportunity to terrorise injure or in some case kill woman protect by those order may harshita brella and so many other rest in peace what action be the justice secretary take to assess and improve the effectiveness of civil order in safeguard survivor of domestic abuse 
 my hon friend will know that this government have launch a pilot of domestic abuse protection order in a number of area which will bring together the strong possible protection for victim in other exist protective order into a single order breach such order will be a criminal offence punishable by up to year in prison and unlike other order there will be no maximum duration 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in london there be a phone theft epidemic and this time it be not the former transport secretary on the loose last year more than mobile phone be report to the police as steal in the capital alone the small number of individual responsible should be lock up for a long time yet last month a criminal who use a motorbike to steal phone an hour be jail for just year enough be enough so will the justice secretary commit to dramatically increase sentence for career criminal get they off our street and slash crime 
 where be the shadow secretary of state over the past year when the theft epidemic begin again give the scale of his party ’s general election defeat some humility be usually require perhaps even an apology to the british public before he and other can earn the right to be hear again he be right about the issue with mobile phone theft and the home office and the home secretary in particular be meet with tech company to talk about how we can break the business model of those criminal 
 cousin marriage have absolutely no place in britain the medical evidence be overwhelming that it significantly increase the risk of birth defect and the moral case be clear in that we see hundred of exploitative marriage that ruin life frankly it should have be stamp out a long time ago will the justice secretary commit to end this medieval practice which be rear its head once again in modern britain 
 the right hon member will know that there have be a recent law commission report on marriage law more generally the government be go to consult on broad reform of marriage law and we will certainly consider the issue that he have raise before set out a public position 
 many of my constituent work at hmp swinfen hall in staffordshire although the boundary change take it out of my constituency recently many of the prison officer i speak to there be concerned about retention at the start of their career get into more experienced   role and ensure that such experience be retain can the minister reassure i about the step be take to encourage retention of experienced member of staff 
 of the very action of the government be to accept the prison service pay review body ’s independent recommendation in full deliver a pay increase of for prison officer in addition we monitor exit interview datum and use it to help design intervention to improve retention 
 in people of work age in the uk have a criminal record for a variety of reason most of these people no long pose a threat to society but be still tie to their past by their criminal record and face a lifetime of barrier with employer what step be the minister take to ensure that the criminal record implication of a sentence do not impact on an individual disproportionately 
 the hon member raise an important issue which be always under review but that be where we be at the moment 
 what be the government do to ensure that offender be manage effectively in the community and how will the secretary of state use offender monitor technology to improve the efficiency of the probation service in keep the public safe i particularly welcome the step take with technology on exclusion zone and monitor alcohol and drug in the human body 
 i thank my hon friend tagging technology can monitor offender effectively in the community we have tag that monitor curfew and exclusion zone tag to impose home detention in effect the equivalent of house arrest and sobriety tag with a compliance rate we be currently look at expand the use of technology to improve productivity in the probation service we will also fund an additional new tag to expand the use of tech outside prison 
 in albanians in britain be in jail and foreign national such as jamaicans iraqis and somalis be also disproportionately likely to be criminal we need well datum to inform immigration asylum and criminal justice policy will the government publish the nationality visa and asylum status of all offender in prison if yes can we have a timeline and if not can we have a good reason why not 
 we be currently use a data collection and publication approach inherit from the previous conservative government probably from the hon member ’s time as an adviser to the former home secretary and prime minister but i will continue to monitor the datum that we collect and publish we be committed to ensure that we deport foreign national offender and be on track to deport more this year than be deport in the previous year we will make more progress in that respect

 there be no girl currently in wetherby we have not change and will not be change the policy we inherit from the previous government in relation to single sex space and the prison system that policy will remain as it have be the woman ’s justice board will consider the issue that relate to female offender across the woman ’s estate 
 the criminal injury compensation scheme be a vitally important part of the justice system but among the gap in the framework we inherit be interim support for victim of crime under before they can access their award this be profoundly affect of my young constituent who be victim of rape and their family in deal with the consequence will the secretary of state meet i to discuss how we can do more for child victim of the most serious offending and ensure the criminal injuries compensation authority be fit for purpose 
 my hon friend raise an important point about the criminal injuries compensation authority the previous government undertake a review of the scheme it run consultation respectively when the election be call in may no response to those consultation have be publish we be consider the support we provide to victim include child victim and we be advise on a new victim code in the new year specifically to look at that issue include any response to the review and we will set out our plan in due course 
 since the beginning of this year inmate have die at hmp parc it have be under the control of g4s since open in what consideration have the lord chancellor make of return the prison to the ministry of justice 
 as i say in answer to an early question from my hon friend   the member for newport east jessica morden hmp parc be receive a lot of attention at the moment the minister for prison in the other place lord timpson will be answer question tomorrow in thorough detail and the hon member might wish to attend that meeting 
 week ago i visit currys in farnborough gate after its staff suffer yet another horrify steam attack a gang of man storm into the store destroy and steal product and terrified customer how will the sentencing review contribute towards crack down on this appalling behaviour trend 
 the independent sentencing review will be make recommendation to ensure that our sentencing legislation and framework be fit for purpose and that we always have prison place for those who need to be lock up so that our prison create well citizen out of criminal and we can expand the use of punishment outside prison i will not get ahead of what that review might recommend but it will look at all those issue in the round 
 the smuggling of illegal drug into prison have be a problem for many year the last government spend over £ try to deal with the issue what plan do the current government have to try to comprehensively deal with it 
 the hon gentleman be right drug be rife in too many of our prison and that problem have be very difficult to challenge both for the previous government and no doubt for we as well we have to crack down on the supply of drug into our prison which be why we be expand the use of no fly zone the hon gentleman will know that scanner have already be use but harden criminal be increasingly move on to use drone instead we will crack down on supply but we also need to look at demand and get more of our prisoner off drug while they be in prison 
 the current court backlog across england be an indictment of the previous government with almost case in nottinghamshire alone rape victim be wait on average over a year to have their case bring to trial if it get that far what be the department do to prioritise these case and restore faith in the criminal justice system for victim of rape and serious sexual offence 
 my hon friend be right that justice delay be justice deny and our heart break for victim wait too long for trial to come that be why we must tackle the crown court backlog which we be do by keep   open nightingale court through the recruitment of more judge as i say previously we need fundamental reform and that be what we will bring about 
 to boost public confidence in the criminal justice system can the minister confirm that the government will not resort to increase dependency on community sentence many of which be unserve 
 as the hon gentleman will have hear i say many time we have bring forward an independent sentencing review to look at the issue of sentencing in the round to ensure that we be never again in the position where we be about to run out of prison place and can not lock up those who must be lock up for reason of public protection the review will also make recommendation on how prisoner rehabilitation can help people turn their life around and more importantly cut the number of victim that would result from reoffende 
 last month in basingstoke woman be victim of spike while on night out that appalling crime rob individual of their autonomy put life at risk and leave woman feel unsafe victim include skylar laura and jade have highlight serious gap in the awareness of and response to spiking so i welcome the government ’s pledge to make spike a specific criminal offence and to train thousand of night time economy staff will the minister update the house on how the propose measure will be implement to prevent further incident in town such as basingstoke 
 this government be commit to bring forward a specific new offence of spike we be commit to modernise the exist legislation in this session so that no other victim like skylar laura and jade suffer these abhorrent crime 
 nearly prisoner be still incarcerate under imprisonment for public protection sentence which be abolish more than year ago many for offence not intend to be cover by such sentence will the justice secretary commit to expedite the government plan to re sentence all prisoner still stick on indefinite ipp sentence to free up limited prison capacity 
 the last conservative government be right to abolish the ipp sentencing regime but that have leave we with a cohort within our prison system who be still serve these sentence i be determined to make more progress in ensure that when safe to do so more of those individual can come out of prison but i will not do so in a way that compromise public protection as some of these individual pose a real risk to the public i will not conduct a re sentencing exercise because that would have the effect of release everyone immediately but we will make progress on get more people properly rehabilitate and out of prison 
 section of the criminal justice and public order act ban prison officer from take industrial   action and limit trade union ability to protect prison officer from attack on their term and condition and wage thankfully these fundamental trade union right have be reinstate for prison officer in scotland do the secretary of state agree that it be time for section to change so that worker right be fully restore for prison officer in the rest of the uk 
 i do not think now be the time to consider that 
 avon and somerset police be do an excellent job at bath christmas market challenge any individual see behave inappropriately towards a woman or young female what more can the ministry of justice do to tackle street harassment 
 we be work closely with our colleague in the home office to tackle violence against woman and girl this government be elect with a landmark mission to halve violence against woman and girl over the course of a decade that include all crime against woman and girl particularly harassment and we be work together to ensure that that happen 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s approach in recognise that we can not continue as we have do she will know that county line be have an impact in town and city across the country with a particularly devastating impact on child can she outline the option that the sentencing review might explore to effectively disrupt the criminal network and protect vulnerable young people 
 the sentencing review will primarily look at the sentencing framework and how we treat different cohort of offender within that it will consider drug crime too but on the specific issue of county line i will ensure that my hon friend get a response from the home office 
 only a couple of day ago a prisoner be let out under the government ’s early release scheme he be want for remove his gps tag what assessment have be make on the reoffende rate so far since the start of the scheme 
 anybody who breach their licence condition can be recall immediately to prison if somebody remove their tag they can and will be recall we have not see high than normal rate of recall under the sds40 scheme and we have not change our projection on prison capacity 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 last month the justice committee visit central london county court which be of the busy in england and meet the exceptional and resilient people who run it both judicial and administrative they need to be resilient as their work be contain in thousand of paper file that be store transport and update in a way that dickens would have recognise when will we digitise civil justice 
 the modernisation of the court and the digitisation programme be a priority clearly that can increase efficiency in the progress of case and improve the working of case management we be   look at that and work in close co operation with our colleague in the judiciary to ensure that we make progress in that area 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if he will make a statement on the government ’s response to storm darragh 
 i would like to say how sorry the government be to hear that people lose their life during storm darragh i extend my sympathy to their family and friend 
 late last week the met office issue a red weather warn for wind cover england and wales with wide part of the uk cover by amber and yellow warning the government immediately take action to prepare for the arrival of storm darragh ahead of the storm we issue an emergency alert to over people in affected region under a red weather warning urge they to stay indoor that be the large use of the early warning system outside of a test scenario impact although widespread be manage effectively and local response mechanism work to mitigate impact 
 for the household and business affect by disruption it would have be a very distressing few day over customer have have their power restore since the storm make landfall as of this morning just under customer remain without power reconnection be continue at pace and operator expect to have all remain customer reconnecte by tomorrow 
 i be grateful for the response from colleague in devolved administrations and local resilience forum around the country i praise our emergency responder and utility worker who have work and indeed be continue to work so hard in difficult condition to help the public manage the impact of the storm 
 thank you for grant the urgent question mr speaker i thank the minister for her reply and join she in express my condolence to the family of those individual who have tragically lose their life the storm leave hundred of thousand of home without power and disrupt critical infrastructure we be all grateful to the engineer who be work tirelessly to restore power under challenging condition i pay tribute to the emergency service and local authority who have also work hard to clear road and offer support to household where possible 
 however i be deeply concerned about the thousand of people still without electricity the storm have bring into sharp relief just how dependent other key utility be on electricity from heat to water supply and mobile phone network the latter concern be compound in rural area by the fact that many have lose their copper landline in the recent digital switchover and now use a system dependent on main power village such as blaenffos pont rhyd y groe and ponterwyd in my constituency to name just a few have therefore not only be without power but have period without water heat and any mean of communicate for help and support 
 the increase frequency of extreme weather event such as storm darragh due to climate change underscore the need for robust civil protection measure encompass both our immediate response and long term resilience planning in that regard our experience with storm darragh highlight a need to review the adequacy of current arrangement for example if rural area such as mine be without mobile signal and no long have copper landline how can they receive important emergency information let alone call for assistance 
 will the minister therefore commit to review arrangement in the light of the storm include whether the priority service register be adequate to address the need of vulnerable resident during widespread power outage will she ensure that key utility be equip to mitigate the impact of future extreme weather event finally will she outline the government ’s immediate action to work with the welsh government and local authority in wales to support community who be still without power and their long term strategy to strengthen national resilience in the face of extreme weather event 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and for his effort over the weekend to provide advice and support to constituent as he mention many household across north and mid wales have be particularly affect by the damage and disruption cause by storm darragh again i extend my sympathy to all those who have be affect by power cut flooding and other disruption which i know will have be distress again i pay tribute to the emergency service and utility worker in north and mid wales who be continue to work hard to support the household affect 
 the uk government have be work closely with our counterpart in the welsh government the hon member raise concern about that my right hon friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster speak to the minister on friday and we be continue to work closely together i hope that reassure the hon member on that aspect in my response i set out how work be under way to resolve the situation of property without power and affect by flooding which the hon gentleman rightly point out 
 more broadly we be continue to work with partner to ensure that the disruption be address as soon as possible and that support be provide to those affect i hope that the hon gentleman feel reassure that we be constantly monitor the work that we have do to see how to improve for future flood and storm the government be take this seriously and i hope the whole house support these effort 
 i echo the sentiment of my hon friend and   the hon member for ceredigion preseli ben lake   about the people who lose their life and all those who have be affect by flood those of we in community that have be flood know how desperate the impact be not just in the immediate aftermath but for month afterwards flood victim often say that they have receive false warning on so many occasion that when the warning come they often do not have faith in they what be the government do to improve the reliability of those warning so that we be well inform what   be they do to ensure that the public be well educate about the limitation of the warning that we get from the environment agency 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important point and talk about the impact on his constituent and those across the country the met office warning be base on judgment make by highly train staff who have carefully collaborate to provide instructive advice to people business transport operator and emergency responder on a storm ’s impact on customer disruption in this particular situation the emergency alert be send to approximately people across wales and the south west on   friday december it reach the people who need to be reach really effectively 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i applaud   the hon member for ceredigion preseli ben lake   for ask this urgent question he ask some very detailed question about communication and connectivity that be vital for rural area can the minister commit to write to he and to put that letter in the library there be important information that need to be put on the public record 
 storm darragh have have and continue to have terrible impact across the uk our thought be very much with the love one of those who tragically lose their life in recent day and with the people whose home and business have be devastate and those who continue to feel the effect of the storm we must not forget that for at risk community the mental health consequence can remain long after the storm and flood have abate and the blue light have leave the opposition pay tribute to the emergency service the environment agency local authority and volunteer group for their effort to help people in these challenging and dangerous circumstance 
 in the come hour and day the government need to focus on quickly reconnecte those without power and give help to those who have be drive out of their home on the repair and reopening of building and school and on the process for insurance claim so that resident can return home as soon as possible what conversation be be have across government to ensure that all that happen 
 what discussion do the minister have with ministerial colleague across government and with the environment agency and the met office before the late storm hit the government ’s flood resilience taskforce be set up to improve flood preparedness it have meet once and its next meeting be next year should it not be stand up more frequently and meet more regularly 
 the previous conservative government commit a record £ from to to provide significantly improve flood defence across the country will the new labour government continue that investment the farm recovery fund initiate by the previous conservative government to support farmer be vital will this government provide new money now after recent storm like bert and darragh finally can the government confirm their ongoing commitment to the community hit by these increasingly common extreme weather event 
 i want to reassure the hon gentleman that the government be work closely with devolved administrations and organisation to address these issue as i mention already the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster speak to the minister on friday and we continue to work together work be be do to strengthen the resilience review which the hon gentleman mention and the emergency alert work effectively to reach those who have be directly affect i assure the hon gentleman that we will respond to the hon member for ceredigion preseli on the issue he have raise to ensure that his question be answer 
 i thank the minister for the statement and express my sympathy for those affect and my thank to emergency and utility worker for all their effort over the weekend the storm be of great significance in constituency such as mine i appreciate what the minister have say on the effort and conversation between the uk government and the welsh government can she say any more on that and assure we that the lesson to be learn from this storm on resilience and deal with any future storm will be share with all of we in this house as well as our colleague in wales 
 like my hon friend i recognise the impact the storm have have on individual we have be work closely with the welsh government on the civil contingency response structure in response to storm darragh and have convene an all wales civil contingency committee.[official report   january vol c. 3wc correction official in the uk government regularly engage with the welsh government on this matter and ensure that local responder be work effectively we will be look to see what else we can learn from this situation 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank   the hon member for ceredigion preseli ben lake who ask an excellent question and raise this important issue today my thought also be with those who tragically lose their life this weekend and with their family and with all the community who have be so terribly affect by the storm i have immense gratitude as i be sure we all do for our emergency service utility company staff and local community who have respond with such effectiveness and compassion 
 we be affect in westmorland although not as badly as the constituent of many welsh members present last week be the anniversary of storm desmond which we remember and still bear the scar from and we stand in solidarity with all those deeply affected right now 
 the storm remind we of our duty to protect home community farmland and business in the budget the government agree to funding for flood defence up to march with the potential threat of reduce funding thereafter will the minister take this opportunity to guarantee as a minimum the current level of funding for flood defence beyond march 
 so much farmland have be affect by the storm yet farm be key to successful flood management store water and slow the flow to protect village and town downstream such as appleby and kendal in   my constituency will the minister now agree to increase the environmental land management scheme budget to help our farmer be our and good defence against flooding 
 finally will the minister confirm that the government will expand eligibility for the farming recovery fund will they publish an up to date water management strategy to set out a plan for urgent maintenance and upgrade to flood defence to protect home farmland and business at risk 
 the government be work at pace to step up further preparation for winter we be invest £ up to march to improve flood resilience and well protect community across the country we be also look at lesson from the flood which be be feed directly in to the flood resilience taskforce that be set up under this new government that will look at flood defence and bolster the nation ’s resilience to extreme weather i have the opportunity to attend the flood resilience taskforce with a wide range of stakeholder and it be a positive way to address future issue we recognise the significant impact flooding have on farmer and rural community which be why we be provide up to £ for internal drainage board and an additional £ through the farming recovery fund 
 i thank the minister for come to the house to explain what have be go on in relation to storm darragh like everyone i thank the emergency service and i also thank monmouthshire county council for all the work it do this weekend over household lose power this weekend include a group of constituent in llangybi of whom be extremely vulnerable will the minister share with we how many household have be reconnecte 
 as my hon friend mention up to customer lose power during the storm as of this morning as i mention just under customer be without power the government have be reassure that the operator be due to reconnect they all by tomorrow 
 i join the house in pay tribute to the emergency service include mid and west wales fire and rescue service and dyfed powys police as well as powys county council in my constituency which have be work tirelessly to keep people safe over the past few day community across wales include in my constituency have be batter by this storm only a few week after already take significant damage from storm bert many of my constituent in the swansea valley be leave without power for over hour and some may not have power restore until thursday likewise many water supply have be disrupt and town such as builth wells have experience significant flooding what support be the uk government provide to wales to ensure that power be restore as soon as possible to those household 
 i send my sympathy to the hon gentleman ’s constituent who be still directly affect our priority be to ensure that everyone without power be reconnecte as quickly as possible our colleague in the department for energy security and net have be receive regular update from the energy networks association on electricity outage work be be do swiftly to ensure that those who be directly affect get their power back as soon as possible 
 i thank my neighbour   the hon member for ceredigion preseli ben lake   for ask the urgent question let i add my voice to the chorus of voice thank the emergency service and also pay tribute to community and local business such as the hand in llanarmon dyffryn ceiriog in my constituency the storm bring out the good in society which be what the bad weather sometimes do will my hon friend join i in pay tribute to local business and civic society for all their work in help those most affect by the storm 
 local business local resilience forum and emergency service have play a powerful role and it have be great to see community and business come together to address these problem so i echo my hon friend ’s thank 
 these storm be become more frequent and we in scotland probably have more experience of they than most but there be a prevailing sense that we be lurch from storm to the next in the case of storm bert for example it be feel that the met office do not issue enough warning early enough to what extent be the minister bring the nation together to share what they have learn from the various storm so that we can respond to they well 
 the government have be work closely with devolved administration and the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster organise a call on friday to see what work could be do with they collaboratively a meeting be hold to establish which area be directly affect and where there be threat to life and an alert be issue as quickly as possible to those area in particular however we recognise that there be some delay in the conveying of information so we be work with operator to see how they can get the message out as speedily as possible in the event of another storm of this kind 
 will the minister please give we an update om the extent of the flood that result from the storm rural constituency such as mine experience a double whammy we be batter by the storm and then we be deluge once again by flooding that double problem be also much more sustained 
 a lot of work have be do in this regard but if my hon friend write to i i shall be able to respond to she directly and adequately 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for ceredigion preseli ben lake   for secure the urgent question 
 electricity supply have yet to be restore to some gwynedd community more than hour after the red weather warn the switch from copper to digital technology mean that all landline telephone will need electricity to work in the future as do mobile phone mast these matter be reserve to westminster they be not devolve so will the minister speak to her colleague in the department for culture media and sport and commit to a government assessment of the resilience of mobile and landline communication in wales and the adequacy of the support give by bt and ee to elderly and vulnerable people during the switchover process 
 engineer have be work tirelessly with national grid ’s electricity distributor and with other network to ensure that step be take to reconnect vulnerable customer in particular but if the right hon member write to i we can look into this in more detail 
 will the minister join i in pay tribute to our fantastic volunteer who work around the clock in difficult circumstance play a critical role in protect people and home will she visit my constituency to meet some of those volunteer include some from lowdham rainworth and hucknall who continue to face the threat of flooding 
 i too thank the volunteer who have work so hard to provide support i always try to visit area around the country and if my hon friend write to i i will see whether if i can visit her constituency with the flood minister my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy to see the hard work that those volunteer have be do 
 this morning people in my constituency be still without power that be down from yesterday morning and i be grateful to all the engineer who have work so hard to get those people back online water booster pump also lose power on sunday so those in a large area of the constituency experience low water pressure in the sizeable town of wem there be large area with no water at all despite there have be only a yellow weather warn it seem that that the resilience of the utility company be not where it need to be to respond to an event of this nature can the minister reassure i about what she be do with those company to ensure that we be more resilient in future give that these event will be increasingly frequent as the impact of climate change worsen 
 we and our colleague in the department for energy security and net be work closely together and as i say early they be receive update from the energy networks association if any of the hon member ’s constituent be directly affect i urge they to call the network operator directly by dialling or to visit the power cut website however she be right that we should be explore the impact that this could have on we in the future 
 in ironbridge gorge a world heritage site in my constituency the river fill up with water from wales in the day after these storm will the minister commit to ensure that the government pay attention to secondary area such as mine and will government departments ensure that the economic hammer blow that flood cause in community such as mine be consider in any future grant application by the local authority 
 we be currently review the flooding funding formula which will address some of the issue that my hon friend have raise 
 i be incredibly concerned about the news that fund for organisation that co ordinate multi agency response in the event of emergency such as the sussex resilience forum be set to end in april next year will the minister commit to long term statutory funding for crucial organisation that plan emergency response 
 there be already a long stand relationship between central government and responder underpin by the civil contingencies act the ministry of housing communities and local government already work with local resilience forum on prepare for and act during response to emergency and provide a direct line of communication for they to central government the met office be our statutory responder under the civil contingencies act which strengthen its role at the heart of uk resilience i recognise the contribution of resilience forum and in particular the role that they play during the storm 
 northumberland have be batter by storm in recent year most dramatically and devastatingly by storm arwen can the minister assure i that she and her colleague be take proactive step to protect community in some of the most isolated place in my constituency from the devastating impact of these storm 
 the flood resilience taskforce set up by the department for environment food and rural affairs be look into exactly those issue 
 storm darragh bring mph wind flooding and power outage and it come hot on the heel of storm bert which bring severe rainfall and terrible flooding give the strong evidence that link increase frequency and severity of storm with climate change may i ask for the minister ’s response to the comment of emma pinchbeck the new chief executive of the climate change committee who say at the weekend that the uk be not ready for these increasingly severe impact of climate change what be the government do and what will they do to make adaptation an urgent national priority 
 as the hon member know we have only just come into office but we have already set up a flood resilience taskforce and be carry out a resilience review so we do recognise these issue just a few month in we be already look into they proactively 
 as the minister and members from across the house have do i commend our local authority and our emergency service for the hard work that they do to make people safe the storm cause so much damage community in my constituency such as northop be without power for several day sadly many of we have to change our plan to go out on small business saturday and support our local high street which be struggle there be a palpable commitment in this chamber to preparedness what conversation be have with the welsh government prior to the storm to ensure that we be ready to tackle it 
 the government regularly meet official to look at how we can work with the devolved administration on preparedness as i mention we be do work on the resilience review i have have a huge amount of engagement with various stakeholder and the devolved administration so that no be leave behind when it come to make sure that we be prepare 
 let i thank the emergency service carmarthenshire county council which be the local authority and national grid engineer for work tirelessly to help resident who be without power in caerfyrddin i also want to give a shout out to the farmer who help clear the road with their chainsaw 
 give that many area be on their day without electricity most have not be promise a connection until thursday and some do not have water or connectivity either it be clear that we need additional help the line be not work it be not its fault it be just overwhelm by the number of call what advice do the minister have for people live in rural community such as trelech brechfa blaenwaun and llanarthne who be in desperate need of generator for their village hall and community centre so that they can provide hot water hot meal and a place to charge a mobile phone can we do something about that 
 i thank the hon member for her question and express sympathy with what her constituent be go through i be disappointed to hear that constituent face difficulty in connect to network we be try our good to work with network on the wide lesson for the future if she write to i directly about these matter we can certainly explore the issue far 
 in harpenden and berkhamste much of the impact of storm darragh be wholly preventable such as flamstead village be cut off because trowley bottom and chequer lane be flood as well as the flooding on station road in harpenden and in puttenham next to the hospice of st francis be shootersway which have repeatedly flood and there be worry about ambulance access what be the government do to work with local authority and what be the long term strategy to prevent repeat damage from storm such as darragh 
 we be work with local resilience forum and we be also carry out a flood review as i mention a flood taskforce have be set up and be explore the issue raise by the hon lady 
 while the damage from storm darragh be thankfully limited in north norfolk a number of property in my constituency suffer power cut which last well into monday that have once again highlight the problem cause by poor mobile phone signal in rural part of north norfolk as hon member have mention many people do not receive update and can not access real time sms information what discussion have the minister have with colleague in the department for science innovation and technology about ensure that we fix the notspot and keep my constituent safe and connect when the next big storm hit 
 dsit be look into this matter to see how the issue that the hon member raise can be address i recognise that there be issue especially with access to mobile network which make it a real challenge to reach people particularly vulnerable individual the situation be be review by my colleague in dsit 
 storm damage in holyhead have lead to severe disruption to the busy roll on roll off port in the uk with ferry to ireland be cancel this weekend also see the closure of the britannia bridge to all vehicle the vulnerability of ynys môn ’s connection to the mainland have be of concern for several year with access to our main hospital at risk what assurance can the minister give i that island community such my constituency of ynys môn will be safeguard from extreme weather in the future 
 i have be very concerned about this issue particularly as part of our work on resilience look at who may be affect include vulnerable people and those who may become vulnerable as a result of extreme weather local resilience forum have also be look into this issue we be work closely with welsh local authority and the welsh government on how these issue can be address 
 storm darragh be the serious storm to hit my thornbury and yate constituency in recent week it come soon after storm bert which cause serious flooding disruption i thank everyone involve in the response these storm be not go away owe to the impact of climate change they be likely to get bad we need a clear framework for local authority so that they know when they will get support and what that support will be can the minister please provide some clarity on that 
 we work very closely with the devolved administration local authority and emergency responder regularly on how we can address this issue the uk resilience academy will be launch in april next year and it will be a great way for we to look at the lesson learn and at how we can strengthen our response to such issue 
 my resident in bersted in pagham and across my constituency of chichester live in constant fear of storm such as darragh they cause severe localise flooding which often isolate community and close business often for month on end funding be available for local community to improve   their flood resilience but west sussex county council cut that funding by a this year even though the problem in my patch be only get bad how do the minister expect community to be resilient to flood if local council be erode the funding 
 we do not have authority over what west sussex county council do but we have be advise council which be under a lot of pressure on how they could look at their flood resilience this issue be really important but it have not always be champion hopefully we can have that conversation and encourage people to play a role 
 hurley and cookham in my constituency have be hit time and again by storm what work be the government do to protect village along the thames which often get flood several day after a storm have pass 
 as i mention we have set up a flood resilience taskforce which look at constituency such as the hon member ’s to make sure that they be not affected.[official report   january vol c. 3wc correction the government will invest £ until march in improve flood resilience and well protect community across the country dsit be also look at uk power network to see what role they could play on the emergency alert that be issue on friday we be look at the lesson learn to see how they could be use effectively if we roll they out in the future 
 i thank the minister for her positivity and for her helpful answer it be very clear that she be do she good to make thing well i put on the record my thank to all emergency service worker across this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland for their sterling effort
