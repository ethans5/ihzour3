as someone who be an academic until about am on   july   last year i thank the secretary of state for her statement and for the leadership she have show on this issue i will ask a question in the context of my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 i be proud of all the university in edinburgh and how they attract student from all over the world but last year when i visit the edinburgh hebrew congregation which be the main synagogue in edinburgh i be ashamed to hear of the intimidation that jewish student be face in university i be pleased to hear that university be take that seriously and i know that the edinburgh faith forum be too freedom of speech be an important right but that should never extend to bigotry and hate do the secretary of state agree that student should be free to practise their faith always and able to display their faith publicly no matter what it be without fear of intimidation 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to support the aerospace sector in northern ireland 
 what progress his department have make on secure the future of spirit aerosystems in northern ireland 
 the government be work with the northern ireland executive to help to ensure the good outcome for spirit ’s aerospace production and its skilled and hard work staff in the current commercial negotiation 
 it be welcome that the secretary of state have visit the spirit aerosystems site a number of time he will know of its importance to advanced manufacturing and of its aeronautical history in northern ireland it originate in as short brothers and he will also know that at this stage there be a purchaser for about a of the facility and a of the staff the current plan fail to recognise not only the integration of the unit within spirit aerosystems but its importance to the northern ireland supply chain will the secretary of state join unite and gmb in their call for the government to support a sale solution so that the integration of staff work flow and supply chain continue to benefit for decade to come 
 i agree with everything the right hon gentleman have say about the importance of the site and its history but in the end there will be a commercial outcome airbus want to buy the bit that make the a220 wing because it want the site to produce more of they and boeing be seek a buyer for the rest of the production the right hon gentleman will be well aware of what else be produce on site i continue to engage with all those involve but as i have say in the end this will be a commercial decision we do of course want to see the production and the job remain 
 the secretary of state will know that the facility would not be there have it not be for government investment and support guarantee be give not just to the people of belfast but to the staff    directly employ at spirit aerosystems the government have also engage in discussion about harland and wolff and navantia and the fleet solid support ship 
 the secretary of state will share the concern that i feel yesterday about the news that the harland and woolf shipyard across the united kingdom would be go into administration and he will know of the countless business throughout the uk that be owe ten of million of pound in respect of the work on those fleet solid support ship we want their viability to continue and we know of individual business that have be family own for generation and have succeed can the secretary of state indicate his endeavour to ensure that that viability will be at the forefront of his mind so that we can deliver the fleet solid support ship in belfast and devon 
 the administration announcement which involve the other side of the runway be part of a process to ensure that the takeover by navantia go ahead because it be very good news the right hon gentleman and i be present to celebrate that announcement which provide security for the future ultimately the question of how to relate to those supplier be a commercial matter for navantia but i be sure that it want to build a good relationship with firm that will help harland and wolff to build the fleet solid support ship 
 while the contract with airbus be welcome there be concern about the split of the spirit plant in belfast can the secretary of state reassure i that wide defence and aerospace contract with company such as skyrora in my constituency that be hold in belfast by the non airbus part of spirit will not be put at risk because of that 
 i understand my hon friend ’s concern we will know the answer to these question when the commercial negotiation be conclude but i will draw the attention of my right hon friend the secretary of state for scotland to the specific issue that she have raise in relation to her constituency 
 i call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee 
 the government have a visibly strong relationship with airbus in respect of its presence in north wales what representation be the secretary of state make to ensure that there be equivalent investment for the spirit aerosystems worker in belfast 
 the fact that airbus want to acquire the a220 wing production and want more a220 wing to be build in belfast be i think a sign of its willingness to invest and to see that production grow and prosper 
 what recent discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on improve public service 
 public service in northern ireland continue to fall behind and the people of northern ireland deserve well i raise this regularly   with northern ireland ministers include the education and health ministers and the government be fully commit to help the executive to make the urgent reform that be need 
 integrated education be an essential part of reconciliation so do the minister share my disappointment at the northern ireland education minister ’s decision last week to reject the bid by bangor academy and rathmore primary to become integrated school which have the support of a majority of parent at both school 
 yes i do integrated education be a devolved matter for the executive but this government be unapologetically supportive of integrated education i have speak to the headteacher of bangor academy and rathmore primary school this week and they as well as parent and pupil at the school be shock by the decision i hope that the education minister will work with they to resolve his concern and listen to parent who overwhelmingly want their child to benefit from integrated education 
 the minister talk of transformation when the executive be restore at this time last year the government put a pot of £ into transformation a senior northern ireland office official sit on the board to date not penny have be spend on support the transformation of either the health service or the education service can the minister update the house on what the hold up be in regard to spend that money 
 i thank the hon member for raise the issue of the public service transformation board as he say the interim board have a £ budget for transformation several major project on health special educational need and justice be now be send to the northern ireland minister of finance for agreement and i have push for the full board to be set up by the end of this financial year i agree that it need to move ahead and get those project do 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the executive have warn of very serious pressure face the nhs in northern ireland which have the bad waiting time in the united kingdom more than year for some surgery labour ’s manifesto commit to improve public service in northern ireland and it be clear that money alone be unlikely to solve the problem what other tangible support will the government offer the executive to reduce waiting time for people in northern ireland or will they just devolve and forget 
 the hon member be correct to raise the issue of public service especially health service the winter pressure on hospital care and other area have be shocking to see and i be grateful to health worker for their work on the frontline at the moment this week i meet the uk government ’s health minister to talk about how we can provide tangible support and we have already do so as the hon member say funding be not the only answer it be also about share good practice and expertise this government have commit to do that through the public service   transformation board but there be other practical way in which we can work together on the good way to reform 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 a&e wait time in northern ireland now exceed hour in some hospital patient be be treat in the back of ambulance because of a lack of bed and dr alan stout the chair of the british medical association ’s northern ireland council have tell the northern ireland committee today that northern ireland be in a particularly bad place when it come to health service what conversation have the secretary of state and minister have with the northern ireland executive to ensure that they have the resource that they need to cope with this immediate crisis be ministers convince that the fiscal floor be adequate for address this issue in the long term 
 i have meet the minister for health and i have be round and visit many of the healthcare provision service all of which be feel pressure at this time as a result of successive executive not tackle reform and be absent along the way that be why we set up the public service transformation board the executive face huge challenge and this government ’s priority be to work with they the funding be there the executive be commit and they need to work together to deliver change urgently 
 what progress his department have make on reform the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery 
 what discussion he have have with stakeholder group on northern ireland 's legacy 
 as i set out on   december the government have now begin the process of repeal and replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act through a propose remedial order and we will bring forward primary legislation include to reform the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery in prepare for that i will continue to talk to all interested party 
 nobel laureate seamus heaney describe sean brown as a man of goodwill and integrity who represent something well than we have grow use to we meet the day before his family be force back to court and in the week of the anniversary of the kingsmill massacre the sole survivor brave alan black be wait for a long overdue ombudsman report those incident be among the most nakedly sectarian in a squalid conflict but decade on those in and out of uniform who create victim rather than the victim themselves who have live with the consequence for decade be still drive the process will the secretary of state commit to ensure that his forthcoming proposal which i know he be work on intensively remove the nio veto under the guise of national security will he commit to root and branch reform of icrir and to   expose collusive behaviour and will he hold to the standard agree by all party in both government at stormont house 
 i have meet both the brown family and alan black the sole survivor of the kingsmill massacre the trauma they have be through be hard for anyone else to appreciate we all look forward to the publication of the ombudsman ’s report on the kingsmill massacre i want to see a full investigation into the murder of sean brown but there be an appeal on wide matter and i can not comment far i be commit to fundamental reform of the independent commission 
 my full time job in the early 2000 be set up and run a peacemaking programme for young people in northern ireland so i be pleased that the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery be salvage from the remain of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act however i be concerned that in the discussion around legacy the goal of cross community reconciliation be be treat as secondary to information recovery for individual important as that be how will my right hon friend ensure that icrir work with key stakeholder to foster cross community reconciliation in northern ireland 
 my hon friend raise a really important point enable family who have suffer for so long and who have not find answer to what happen be a fundamental part of facilitate the process of reconciliation in northern ireland the truth be that we have to work on both aspect 
 the secretary of state know that i agree with many aspect of the repeal of the legacy act but the policy exchange report this week as the newspaper have report this morning raise significant concern about the repeal of section and may i urge he to return to the previous cross party position that we have to block compensation payment to terrorist such as gerry adams 
 i have indeed see that report the problem be that the approach set out in the legacy act have be find in that respect and many other to be unlawful of course we will continue as the previous government do to see whether we can find a lawful way of deal with the issue that the right hon gentleman have identify that work will continue 
 do the secretary of state agree that the job of the commission in help people to deal with the past be make much more difficult when we have reprehensible incident such as sinn féin minister michelle o’neill attend and speak at a commemoration of ira terrorist who die when the bomb they be transport through county londonderry in explode prematurely kill they rather than the innocent people they intend to murder and when we now have the possibility that the former sinn féin leader and terrorist gerry adams may be about to receive compensation 
 as i say a moment ago the process of reconciliation and come to term with the past be a difficult and itself a troubled process lot of people have be on a journey and we need to continue to see that journey follow people will express their view about the stance that different people have take but since the hon gentleman have mention the minister i welcome the fact that for the time she attend the remembrance sunday commemoration 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i would like to return to the question that have just be raise by the former secretary of state for northern ireland my right hon friend   the member for skipton and ripon sir julian smith when the previous government pass their legislation the labour party be in favour of the amendment make in another place that rule out compensation to people such as gerry adams and other similarly detain in the 1970 why have the government now change their position 
 the court have find those clause to be unlawful the last government pass legislation to enable terrorist to get immunity the last government pass legislation to deny people in northern ireland the right to bring civil claim include against terrorist the conservative party have never apologise for do both of those thing it be about time that it do 
 let we return to the matter of gerry adams i be sorry to say that i must correct the secretary of state the high court find that those provision of the legacy act be unlawful but it be well within the secretary of state ’s power to appeal that judgment he have drop that appeal i do not wish to teach the secretary of state to suck constitutional egg but he will know full well that it be also within the sovereign power of this parliament to give legal basis to the carltona doctrine which have be in place since the 1940 or would he rather pay compensation to gerry adams and people like he 
 nobody want to see that the supreme court judgment that rule that the interim custody order follow internment be not lawfully put in place in which the carltona principle be much discuss be in the last government do nothing about that for year until they belatedly accept an amendment in the house of lords that have now be find to be unlawful it be a complex and difficult question the last government find it difficult but we will continue to follow the same path to see whether it be possible to discover a legal mean of deal with the problem that the hon gentleman have identify 
 what step his department be take to help grow the economy in northern ireland 
 what step his department be take to help grow the economy in northern ireland

 northern ireland ’s economy have strong and dynamic sector from agrifood to aerospace and from shipbuilde to cyber security do the secretary of state agree that northern ireland have a vital part to play in the industrial strategy 
 it certainly do my hon friend allude to a number of the great strength of the northern ireland economy the deal with harland and wolff which i mention early be another sign of the government ’s commitment of course the northern ireland economy have access to both the eu and the uk market 
 do the secretary of state share my optimism that uk government funding for all of northern ireland ’s city and growth deal confirm in the autumn provide a great basis for all of northern ireland to generate growth and opportunity 
 i certainly do and i have be greatly impress by the commitment of those involve in develop the growth deal to invest in boost economic growth in their area 
 could the secretary of state update the house on what recent discussion he have have with the executive about step to increase revenue in order to help to deliver long term financial sustainability and grow the economy in northern ireland 
 i have have a number of discussion with the executive on that subject and i be pleased to see that the draft budget for next year contain a plan to raise further revenue to meet the £ requirement that be part of the budget restoration agreement it be really important that the executive raise additional fund to meet the challenge of improve public service 
 there be many dynamic tech and digital company at the vanguard of the mission for economic growth in northern ireland do the secretary of state agree that these industry be critical to northern ireland ’s economic future what step be the government take to support these industry in grow to their full potential 
 there have already be discussion with business in northern ireland about the part they can play in the industrial strategy cyber security be a really good example of the huge strength of the northern   ireland economy many company include from the united states of america be invest in northern ireland because of the skill and expertise to be find 
 i thank the secretary of state and the minister for their response so far response highlight northern ireland as have dual market access on that basis do they agree that initiative such as the dublin belfast economic corridor in my constituency need support so that we can make the most of our economic opportunity 
 i do indeed think that the belfast economic corridor be a really good thing we support it and i look forward to see it develop and succeed 
 agriculture be really important to the economy of northern ireland in scotland we breed excellent bull but it be very hard to sell they and get they into northern ireland because of the regulation and red tape and vice versa for irish bull come to scotland will the secretary of state see if we can make it easy for farmer on both side 
 i will look into the matter that the hon gentleman raise and i will come back to he 
 this week the prime minister have speak of the unbridled economic opportunity from develop artificial intelligence it be not an unbridled opportunity for northern ireland because instead of live under british regulation on ai we live under much more restrictive eu regulation when will the secretary of state move to release northern ireland from the restriction under the eu of foreign jurisdiction 
 the substantive provision of the eu ai act do not currently apply in northern ireland and they would apply only follow agreement by the withdrawal agreement joint committee any decision would be subject to the democratic safeguard mechanism in schedule 6b to the northern ireland act 
 in his union connectivity review lord hendy now a minister in the government identify that upgrade the a75 would have significant economic benefit not just for northern ireland but for the whole of the united kingdom there be another fatal accident on that road in my constituency last week will the secretary of state join the secretary of state for scotland in put pressure on the scottish government to finally move on upgrade that vital economic route 
 it be indeed a vital economic route and like the hon member i look forward to see it improve not least in the interest of safety as quickly as possible 
 what step he have take with cabinet colleague to prevent disruption to the supply of good to northern ireland from great britain since the introduction of the eu general product safety regulation 
 the update eu general product safety regulation largely formalise how business already operate in the uk and the majority of business have adapt to continue trade within the uk and with the eu in december the government publish guidance for business on the application of the regulation in northern ireland the secretary of state have this week meet ministerial colleague and will keep this under review 
 as a result of those eu regulation thousand of consumer in northern ireland be deny good from great britain and rather than adapt business in gb have simply abandon the northern ireland market at the same time this week the department for environment food and rural affairs have ban the import of meat from germany where there have be a foot and mouth disease outbreak but have not extend that ban to northern ireland because of the northern ireland protocol while the eu protect its market the uk appear to have abandon the internal market of its own country what will the minister do to redress that 
 the government be absolutely committed to ensure a smooth flow of good across the uk internal market we understand that many company have adapt easily to gpsr while for some it be more difficult the secretary of state have meet the minister for business this week to discuss further guidance and assurance and will continue to have such discussion 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of propose increase in employer national insurance contribution on job creation in northern ireland 
 there be many pressure on business that we be constantly assess and talk to business about the hon member be right to raise the subject of job creation in northern ireland it be a priority for this government we be support business in many way include through invest northern ireland ’s fund for small business and by directly support jobseeker through our funding for employment support scheme 
 i call sir ashley fox interruption 
 i be grateful for the warm welcome how do the minister expect business in northern ireland to grow and invest in their community give that they have to pay the enormous tax increase impose by the chancellor 
 even after account for employer national insurance contribution impact the office for budget responsibility expect real wage to rise by raise the revenue to fill the £ black hole require we to take difficult decision but they will result in improved public service which be good for all people in northern ireland 
 what progress his department have make on secure the future of harland and wolff in northern ireland 
 i welcome the industry lead deal that will see navantia uk purchase harland and wolff ’s shipyard in the uk include that in belfast the government have work closely with navantia uk to secure the future of the yard the fleet solid support ship programme and around job across the uk 
 do my right hon friend share my optimism that now that the future of the harland and wolff yard have be secure the yard will be able to secure future order 
 i certainly do that be of the great benefit of the commercial agreement that have be reach with navantia on buy harland and wolff and the adjustment make to the contract to ensure that the fleet solid support ship could go ahead this be a great facility and it be open for business include for other order 
 a company in my constituency of strangford be among those that will suffer because of harland and wolff be in administration this small family firm i will not put its name in hansard will lose half a pound the impact on that company and other be quite catastrophic what can be do to help those company that through harland and wolff be in administration will either not be able to trade or risk lose out entirely 
 i recognise the hon gentleman ’s concern this be a product of the failure of the old harland and wolff it now fall to navantia to decide which of the invoice it wish to pay but it will want to secure a relationship with supplier contribute to the fleet solid support ship programme 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question may i welcome the speaker of the assembly of the republic of albania elisa spiropali who be in the public gallery

 with almost entry and exit over the past year maidenhead train station be a busy transport hub but with crowd gateline flood underpass and a drop off facility that be not fit for purpose the station need major upgrade to give maidenhead commuter what they deserve do the prime minister understand what maidenhead resident face at the station and will he commit his government to fix these issue in this parliament 
 i thank the hon member for his question i be pleased that his constituent be benefit from upgrade at the station include i think new lift to make the station fully accessible the issue that he raise be face by passenger right across the country that be why we be bring rail service back into public ownership set up great british railways and make ticket simple and fair to ensure a well service for all passenger include those in his constituency 
 i recently visit midkent college which serve my constituency of gillingham and rainham it teach valuable construction skill to young people but i have be inform that it face significant challenge in recruit teacher to deliver those course do the prime minister agree that proper skill training and have the teacher necessary to deliver it be absolutely vital to grow our economy and build the home that we need for the future will he agree to set up a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss the recruitment challenge that some college face 
 skille up the next generation be vital to kick start economic growth our plan for change will rebuild britain by deliver new home that be why we have establish skills england and be reform our planning system and train the workforce i will ensure that my hon friend get the meeting that she want with the relevant minister 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 on friday while borrowing cost hit level not see since labour be last in government i meet business owner and their employee in chesterfield of they tell i that his business will not exist in year time because of this government ’s policy it might not even exist next year the prime minister may try to blame his inheritance or blame global factor but why should anyone trust a word he say over what business be say again and again that his budget mean few job low growth and high borrowing cost 
 as the leader of the opposition know the global economy be experience volatility and high borrowing cost that be why it be vital that we take the tough and right decision in the budget to get our finance back in order we have to deal with the £ black hole that the conservatives leave we make difficult cut and raise taxis to invest in health public service and housing vital to stability and vital to growth we have an iron clothe commitment to our fiscal rule and she will no doubt welcome the inflation figure this morning 
 contrast that with the conservatives they be not brave enough in government to take those difficult decision they have oppose all our measure to stabilise the economy and promote growth they be back to the magic money tree the leader of the opposition want all the benefit of the budget but can not say how she would pay for they they have not change they be still economic vandal and fantasist imagine where we would be if they be still in charge 
 just today the british retail consortium have say that third of business will have to raise price to cope with the prime minister ’s tax hike his chancellor ignore all the warning and plough ahead with an unprecedented borrowing spree leave all of we more vulnerable now we have business say that they will raise price to cover his job tax we have an energy policy that will drive up bill and all the while we be spend more day to day on debt interest than we do on school and university the prime minister refuse to repeat his chancellor ’s promise that she would not come back for more will he now rule out any new tax rise this year 
 we take the right and difficult decision in the budget decision that the conservatives do not have the courage to take which leave we in the mess in the place when it come to tax the leader of the opposition know very well the limit of what i can say from this dispatch box but we have an iron clothe commitment to our fiscal rule we can not just tax our way out of the problem that they leave we which be why we have put in place tough—[interruption they be howl at the spending decision they would not take they but we will stick to those spending decision our focus be absolutely on growth but their record—[interruption they flatline the economy their record be a mini budget that crash the economy the bad cost of live crisis in live memory and leave a £ black hole i be not take lesson from they on the economy 
 the prime minister know very well that the office for budget responsibility find no such black hole he talk about a mini budget year ago borrowing cost last week be at a year high for year gilt the chancellor be apparently promise to be ruthless in reduce spending let i suggest something that he should cut there be no way that we should be give up british territory in chagos he be rush a deal that will be disastrous and that will land taxpayer with a multibillion pound bill why do the prime minister think that british people should pay to surrender something that be already ours 
 we inherit a situation where the long term operation of a vital military base be under threat because of legal challenge the negotiation be start under the last government the then foreign secretary come to this house to say why he be start negotiation and what he want to achieve he say that the aim be to 
 ensure the continue effective operation”—[official report   december vol c. 
 of the base that be precisely what this deal have deliver 
 there be no the prime minister can blame for this dud deal except himself at the budget labour be congratulate itself for have the female chancellor instead of ensure that the country have someone actually qualified to do the job interruption 
 order i want to hear the leader of the opposition 
 the prime minister claim he have full confidence in the chancellor but the market clearly do not yesterday the chancellor repeat her promise to have just budget per year to provide business with certainty the talk in the city be that she can not meet her fiscal rule and that there will need to be an emergency budget do the prime minister stand by the chancellor ’s commitment that there will be only budget this year 
 the leader of the opposition will be pleased to know that the chancellor will be in place for many many year to come she will outstrip they if we all think that politic be about cheap point i could criticise their chancellor but i do not have enough time to go through all the chancellors they have we have budget that be what we be commit to we have strong fiscal rule and we will stick to they unlike the conservatives 
 at a time of turmoil in the market the prime minister be distract by the crisis around the former city minister   the hon member for hampstead and highgate tulip siddiq what do it tell we about his judgment that yesterday he say he be sadden that his close friend have resign this be an anti corruption minister under criminal investigation for corruption muhammad yunus the nobel prize winner advise bangladesh say that london property gift to the former city minister may be the proceed of robbery will the prime minister offer bangladesh the full support of our national crime agency in ensure that any property buy with steal fund be properly investigate 
 the former city minister refer herself to the independent adviser he find as the leader of the opposition well know that there be no breach of the code she know that he find there be no wrongdoing and the former minister fully co operated she refer herself a week ago on monday i get the report yesterday and she resign yesterday afternoon compare that with the shadow foreign secretary   the right hon member for witham priti patel who breach the ministerial code the leader of the opposition ’s predecessor but ignore it it be the adviser who   then have to resign because he be not take seriously and the right hon member be now serve the leader of the opposition what a contrast thank god the british public chuck they out 
 the prime minister do not answer the question about the national crime agency no answer on investigate dodgy labour ministers just as last week he do not want an inquiry that might expose dodgy labour council he knowingly appoint a convict fraudster as his transport secretary the anti corruption minister who he have full confidence in only day ago resign yesterday in disgrace he be negotiate a secret deal to surrender british territory and taxpayer in this country will pay for the humiliation now it turn out that his government may write a cheque to compensate gerry adams that be shameful 
 we leave the prime minister the fast grow economy in the g7 in just month under his leadership it have be taxis up borrow up and mortgage rate up and that be not all business confidence be down job be down and growth be down can the country afford more year of his terrible judgment 
 among that barrage of complete nonsense there be point that i need to address the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act which will have be of real interest across the house that act be unfit not least because it give immunity to hundred of terrorist and be not support by victim in northern ireland nor i believe by any of the political party in northern ireland the court find it unlawful we will put in place—[interruption this be a serious point we will put in place a well framework we be work on a draft remedial order and replacement legislation and we will look at every conceivable way to prevent these type of case from claim damage it be important that i say that on the record 
 as for the leader of the opposition ’s claim and her nonsense the conservatives crash the economy i get a letter this week from a tory voter in a labour seat i hope that they do not mind i say who it be it be liz truss it be not write in green ink but it might as well have be she be complain that say she have crash the economy be damage her reputation it be actually crash the economy that damage her reputation what have we hear all the tories have be complain they have no defence for their sorry record they do not even acknowledge it they have no idea no policy they be like a blank piece of paper blow hopelessly in the wind no wonder the country put they in the bin 
 patient in kent be experience a winter crisis as a result of year of under investment in our nhs many be have to be treat on trollie in corridor for case of winter flu and other virus create a significant challenge for local health service what assurance can the prime minister offer resident in dartford that the reform and extra investment set out by the secretary of state for health and social care will make that inadequate care a thing of the past and will he visit dare nt valley hospital in dartford with i 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that matter and i be deeply sorry for those receive inadequate care in his constituency the previous government leave the nhs in a critical condition we can not deliver growth with record waiting list and economically inactive people through our plan for change we will invest in nhs diagnostic centre i will of course consider his invitation 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 may i echo the word of the prime minister about president biden i hope that his team and the team of president elect trump can work together to bring the peace in gaza that we so desperately need so that the hostage can be release we can get aid in and the killing can stop 
 as   the hon member for dartford jim dickson   just say patient be suffer through the bad nhs winter crisis on record last month alone people wait more than hour in a&e. over be stick in ambulance for over an hour before they could even get into hospital there be no doubt that the flu season have make the winter crisis bad but we see these winter crisis year after year follow year of neglect of the nhs by the conservatives nhs leader say that we will never put an end to these winter crisis unless we fix the crisis in social care i ask the prime minister this question last week and i be disappoint by his reply so i will try again will he scrap the year timetable that he have give the casey commission so that we can fix social care this year implement reform by the end of this year at the late 
 we be encourage by the talk towards a ceasefire i think the whole house would urge all to come to an agreement and have the hostage release we all understand the absolute torture that their family be go through every single minute of every single day that this continue we hope that there can be progress there 
 in relation to the nhs the right hon gentleman be absolutely right the conservative party leave it on its knees—[interruption there be no point groaning it be absolutely disgraceful that the nhs be leave in the state that it be absolutely disgraceful we be invest to turn that around we be reform to turn that around we be within that reform deal with social care i set out the timetable to he last week and he know how it be set out 
 i continue to be disappoint by the prime minister ’s position on social care and i be go to keep come back to this issue because unless we fix it we will not fix the nhs 
 turn to the economy though i have an idea for the chancellor to grow the economy as president elect trump prepare to take office next week there be report that a number of wealthy high skilled americans be look to come to the uk for fear of what he will do to their country however because the conservatives so break the immigration system many of they be find that there be no visa they can apply for i know that the prime minister be rightly seek to reduce immigration from the record high of the conservatives but do he agree that if people like this want to come to   our country to bring their money and their skill so that we can grow our economy and pay for our public service they should be able to 
 we welcome all investment into the united kingdom i be very pleased to have have record investment in the time we have be in office and continue to welcome investor and investment to this country the right hon member be absolutely right that the last government lose control of immigration as they lose control of health the economy the border and everything else of course it be the leader of the opposition who be champion the driving up of the number we will bring those number down get immigration back under control and encourage investment

 finally i pay tribute to the chief vet and the veterinary and animal officer and scientist and official at the animal and plant health agency who do so much to keep our country biosecure this foot and mouth disease wake up call be yet more evidence that the government must now commit to fully fund the redevelopment of the apha hq in weybridge i urge the government from the bottom of my heart to fully fund that redevelopment to make sure that the burn pyre of slaughter animal as well as the economic and mental health devastation of foot and mouth disease remain resolutely confine to the history book 
 i fully appreciate the expertise and passion the hon gentleman bring to this subject he know of what he speak i hope i make it clear in my initial reply just how seriously the government take these issue i speak to he early this morning ahead of a delegated legislation committee to make it clear that we would work on a cross party basis to tackle this should it come to our shore 
 i will try to address the hon member ’s question particularly those around vaccination because that be always raise and be always of concern 
 we be absolutely ready in case that be a control that we need to implement accord to the general advice with regard to control measure if an outbreak be to occur in the uk vaccination be a control option that would be consider by defra and devolve administration at the outset in addition to cull and immediate movement control i can assure the shadow minister that the uk vaccine bank hold vaccine for a range of foot and mouth disease serotype i can also assure he that there be good close work with the devolved administration on this matter and that we be work in harmony 
 on the movement of personally carry good i remind the shadow minister that this government strengthen those control at the border i be confident that we be do everything possible at the moment to ensure that we be follow the right procedure give the risk assessment that have be carry out our sincere hope be obviously that this do not extend beyond the brandenburg area but we be absolutely ready to deal with those issue 
 on the investment at weybridge as i have say we have commit an initial £ this be a debate we have be have for some time and i be afraid that we be work with the resource we have now however i be confident that we have a very good set of procedure in place to tackle any potential incursion 
 i thank   the hon member for epping forest dr hudson   for his concern and passion on this subject like he i know only too well the devastation that be cause in of course he previously have the privilege of represent a large part of what be now the carlisle constituency 
 cumbria be the worst affected part of the country in with of the culled cattle be from cumbrian farm will the minister elaborate on the step that be be take to ensure that our farmer and their livestock be protect ahead god forbid of any potential outbreak 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and for the concern she have rightly show as i say at the outset we be well aware of the concern that people feel however they should be reassure that we have very good trace facility these day the technology have improve what be particularly important be that we be in close contact with our german colleague who be share advice regularly everything that can be do be be do but i absolutely recognise people ’s concern 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i confess that all of we in westmorland and across rural britain feel a sense of terror at this news as we recall the devastation and horror of the outbreak i will never forget the loom sense of dread and threat as the disease get close to our farm or the dread when the disease be diagnose and whole herd and flock be slaughter by those who have care for they nor will i forget the burn fire on the hillside of the body of slaughter animal or the deep trauma that affect all our community but especially our child we must do everything to avoid a repeat 
 can the minister explain why this outbreak be notify on friday yet defra issue instruction to prevent import from the affected area only yesterday when country such as mexico and south korea be able to act over the weekend do he now acknowledge the urgent need to invest in the apha and the new laboratory and undo the delay of the previous government do he accept that the failure of the previous government and so far of his government to sign a veterinary and phytosanitary agreement with the eu increase the risk to biosecurity and to british farmer and will he act swiftly to put that right finally will he meet urgently the noble lord curry who head the inquiry after the outbreak so that we be ready and have learn all the lesson of previous failure and so that our farm rural community and animal welfare be protect at all cost 
 order this matter be very important my area have the case of foot and mouth detect in that year so i know all about it however we must stick to the time that have be allocate 
 i be always happy to speak to lord curry who bring huge expertise and knowledge 
 i will just say to the hon gentleman that there be no delay essentially as soon as we be inform we put the appropriate process in place and staff at border control point be issue instruction to hold good at the border everything be do as quickly as possible 
 i hear the hon gentleman ’s point about our relationship with the german government i know the german minister personally and i speak to he yesterday i can assure the hon gentleman that we be get every co operation need from the german government 
 in i live in north cumbria and i will never ever forget the sight of burn livestock in my friend field can the minister assure i that my farmer in morecambe and lunesdale who by and large be livestock farmer will never have to face that terrible scene again and that we will do everything we possibly can to ensure that foot and mouth do not spread to our country 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her comment and for her account of the effect the disease have on her constituent the purpose of my response to the question today be to give reassurance to people that we have very very high quality official work very very hard to make sure we do everything we can to prevent such an outbreak happen again 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 as well as note my own entry in the register of members financial interests i should tell the house that my wife be a practise veterinary surgeon who be occasionally contract to provide local veterinary official service to the apha 
 i too remember the event of and i remember have just be elect the debate we have in this house we say that we must always learn the lesson and never forget but in truth frankly we have the   extent to which we be expose today be something for which responsibility be share across the party the state of the apha headquarters in weybridge be a disgrace and it be now an urgent disgrace hopefully this be a bullet that we will dodge but if we do we know there be also the risk of african swine fever bluetongue and avian influenza all come be this the point where across the house we can all agree on the importance of biosecurity and the importance of fund it 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for his point i think we all know how important biosecurity be and that be why the government commit a furth £ for that very important facility in weybridge 
 will the minister confirm what mitigation funding have be make available for farm that may be affect will he commit to look urgently at the provision of an abattoir on the isle of wight because we do not currently have 
 i thank my hon friend for his question good try at the moment we be talk about an outbreak in germany should there be obviously we be do everything we can to prevent it an outbreak in the uk we will come back with further proposal but at the moment we be work hard to make sure that that do not happen 
 could the minister confirm give the seriousness of the issue that when in doubt the precautionary principle will come to the fore there will be urgency and the proper decision will be take he mention work with the devolved administration give the share land border on the island of ireland and the trade there can he confirm what conversation he have have or may be plan to have with the government in dublin 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right we will of course take every precaution and apply the precautionary principle we treat northern ireland in the same way as the other devolve administration the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for coventry east mary creagh   will be have conversation later today 
 i welcome the urgent question as the news be a worry to farmer in my constituency be the minister able to share with the house more detail about the funding available from his department to help prevent new animal disease 
 i thank my hon friend for her point and her concern we have an extensive set of facility and agency who be task with protect our country on these issue i have every confidence in the chief veterinary officer and her official in the apha subject to the issue that have be raise around long term funding we have good protection in place and people should have confidence in they 
 yet again we rely on the fantastic people at the animal and plant health agency which be base in new haw in my constituency despite its slightly confusing name   will the minister join i in thank the people who work there and do he agree that it urgently need investment to improve the facility i do not think he have visit the apha will he join i on a tour as soon as we can arrange it to see for himself the state it be in and what improvement be urgently need 
 i be always grateful for invitation from hon member and feel that i be permanently on tour but the hon gentleman be right that i have not yet have the opportunity to visit although the secretary of state have last week when i be at a conference in york very senior official from the apha give i a very detailed briefing on the work they do i share in the thank to those people who play a huge role in keep our country safe 
 as a child i distinctly remember the creep fear on my family ’s farm as foot and mouth move ever close i realise that even as a child and i feel sick just think that we could ever go back there many farmer in my constituency have repeatedly raise their concern over infectious disease enter the uk please can the minister assure i and they that we be do everything to take this very seriously and that we have contingency plan in place 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for reflect on the awful experience of year ago i assure she that we have excellent people to whom i have just refer who be work extremely hard to minimise the risk of any further outbreak we be do everything we can to prevent that from happen 
 do the minister not agree that it be preposterous that northern ireland have be exclude from the uk ban on import from germany because of the outbreak of foot and mouth do he agree that that be the tip of the iceberg in respect of the impact the windsor framework and the protocol continue to have on our agrifood industry in northern ireland since he think and rightly so that it be essential to protect gb farm from potentially devastating impact why do he believe that northern ireland farm be not as important 
 northern ireland farm be just as important in northern ireland the control will apply to meat and live animal move from a km protection zone and a km surveillance zone surround the affected premise in germany those product can not be move to northern ireland 
 will the minister outline what measure be be take to ensure that no animal infect in the outbreak in germany end up in this country 
 this be an unusual outbreak in a sense it be a very small herd of water buffalo what be unknown to the german authority at the moment be how they get infect in the place extensive work be go on in germany to try to understand that the difference from year ago be that we now have much well science to be able to trace where it may have come from extensive work be go on across europe because   it be a threat to the entire continent i can assure my hon friend that every avenue be be explore to try to make sure that we understand how this have happen and that it go no far 
 as a farmer ’s daughter i fully remember the sicken impact of the last foot and mouth outbreak across somerset and dorset particularly on farmer mental health the cull restriction result in of farmer experience depression and anxiety follow the last outbreak now almost half of the farming community be already experience anxiety what plan do the government have to support farmer who may be impact by this disease or any other biosecurity risk 
 i thank the hon lady for her question i know she take these issue very seriously and we have discuss they before let i be clear this be an outbreak in germany at the moment we be do everything we can to ensure it do not extend into our country of course people be concerned and worried should it develop far which we be absolutely determined to make sure do not happen then we will look at further measure to help and support people but we be not at that stage 
 i thank the minister for his response it be very reassuring that the seriousness of the situation be feel across the house and across the country he talk about work with the devolved administration will he say more about how he will work with the welsh government in particular to address this issue 
 i can assure my hon friend that we have an extremely close relationship with the welsh government the rural affairs minister huw irranca davies and i speak frequently indeed we speak to each other only a few day ago at the oxford farming conference and we be in regular contact to discuss issue such as these in anything that we do we will be work together on an entire united kingdom basis 
 with some of the most productive grassland in the uk dumfries and galloway be not worried but terrify by this outbreak i be reassure to know that we be do what we can but it be a very difficult problem to solve can the minister reassure i that the republic of ireland will not be the unlocked back door through which this dread disease return to this country 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s appreciation of the complexity that we face but it be in everyone ’s interest to ensure that we stop this and we be all co operate closely the veterinary official have a very good network and they be work closely together no want this to extend far 
 as the son of a farmer i remember only too well wake up in the early morning and go downstairs to listen to radio in silence with my family as we hear about more and more animal be cull during the crisis in the early   2000s what step be be take to engage the national farmers union and other trade body to prepare for any outbreak here in the uk 
 i thank my hon friend for his concern and his recollection yesterday we hold a roundtable to discuss the threat pose by bluetongue and we be in constant dialogue with all those who have direct interest and expertise we will be work in lockstep 
 in his initial answer the minister talk about protect the uk and speak about our nation ’s farmer he also advise farmer to consult gov.uk which give advice to scottish english and welsh farmer but not to northern ireland farmer may i ask he why he have abandon they give that the last outbreak in cost the northern ireland economy £ small region in germany can not export to northern ireland do the minister not agree that there should be a complete ban on the import of german product to northern ireland as well as the rest of the united kingdom 
 we stand with farmer throughout the united kingdom the circumstance be slightly different for reason that the hon gentleman will understand which be why we have to provide appropriate advice but we be work in tandem and lockstep with colleague across europe to beat this horrible disease 
 it be the critical work of the animal and plant health agency in weybridge which i visit recently that will prevent foot and mouth from reach our shore the £ for the agency that the government have announce be welcome but will my hon friend commit himself to review its funding particularly in the event of multiple concurrent disease 
 we constantly keep under review the resource that be available to enable we to tackle all these issue on the basis of a number of question today i shall be happy to visit weybridge at the early opportunity 
 unfortunately as the minister will know foot and mouth disease loom large in the memory of many shropshire farmer talk of visit this be a genuine point i wonder whether the minister and indeed the secretary of state would consider visit harper adams university in my constituency which as he will also know be the top agricultural university in europe i mention that because it have veterinary expert with specific expertise in this disease and other 
 as we hear from the shadow minister my hon friend   the member for epping forest dr hudson more than pig cattle and sheep be lose in and the minister mention biodiversity can he update the house on illegal meat import and check at the border and the implementation of the border target operating model 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his invitation i shall add he to my list the border check involve a complicated set of issue but of the brexit   benefit if you like be the existence of those check and i be satisfied that they be provide a level of security that should give people confidence as i say in an early answer we have strengthen the control on personal import it be always a challenge to protect any area but we be in a well position than colleague in mainland europe 
 it be good to see cross party support for increase investment in weybridge which have long be need but my right hon friend   the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael   mention biosecurity and we know that a great deal of illegally import meat be come through our port that be a huge biosecurity risk and an even great risk if there be foot and mouth on the continent as well as invest in weybridge and improve those facility can we look at how we can resource the port authority properly to catch all this illegally import meat 
 that be an important point we will try to do all that we can to ensure that illegal import be intercept and stop i be delighted to observe the outbreak of cross party consensus on the need for more investment and i hope there will also be an outbreak of consensus on how to fund it 
 my constituency be of the most significantly impact by the outbreak virtually every hoof animal in dumfriesshire be slaughter and the smoke from the pyre hang over the annan valley in particular for day a large part of the market in livestock in my constituency come from longtown market in the constituency of   the hon member for carlisle ms minns which be a source of the previous outbreak will the minister ensure that we work closely with the scottish government give that there be a significant amount of cross border movement of animal that need to be properly identify and regulate 
 the right hon gentleman speak with passion and paint a vivid picture of that dismal period which sadly i remember well i can give he an absolute assurance that as he will know from his time in government the veterinary officer work very closely together particularly on an official level this be an entirely share endeavour and we will do everything we can to ensure that that there be the close co operation that be need 
 i be a dairy farmer and the devastating outbreak of foot and mouth more than year ago be on my doorstep we be lucky as a family farm but sadly other within my farming community in wales be not the outbreak be also a food security issue as it be understand to have derive from food waste feed to pig what lesson have the uk government learn from that outbreak to enable they to secure our food chain well and keep our livestock and food supply safe 
 i recognise the hurt that the hon lady recollect from that dreadful time a great deal of work be do in the light of those event and lesson have be learn for instance technology have change   and improve i will not go into all those lesson which be probably worthy of a long debate but it be important for we to act on they because we do not want a repeat of what happen in 
 like many other member i clearly remember the event of not least because all the cattle and sheep on our family farm my father ’s farm in berwickshire be slaughter the emotional trauma will stay with farming community for many year to come i be reassure that this government be engage with the scottish government but be the minister also speak to nfu scotland and to local authority to ensure that they be able to support farming community in the good way possible 
 the hon gentleman have speak with passion and conviction about that dreadful time and i fully respect that we be notify of the outbreak on friday today be wednesday of course we be ready to move to the next stage should it be necessary but at this point the key priority must be ensure that we keep the disease out of our country and that be where the attention be currently focus in the dismal eventuality that we have to move to measure within our country we will of course work very closely with everyone who need to be involve 
 i be sure that my farmer like i will be hugely grateful to know that the ban will operate with cross party support our farmer be more important than party politic back in i be the liberal democrat candidate for the totnes constituency the amount of communication with farmer before the outbreak be the only thing that make it easy for they to understand what be go on because could not go on a farm once it have start may i encourage the minister to communicate with farmer as much as he can during this very difficult time 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her recollection of that time i reiterate that we be try to ensure that foot and mouth disease do not arrive on our shore should that happen we will move to another phase we be not at that point yet and it be important to reassure people that we have excellent measure and excellent people in place they be work very hard to ensure that we do not get to that point 
 i welcome the government ’s effort in bring we up to speed today but also in impose the import ban i recognise that the ban apply to product from germany but do it capture product that may originate there but for which the point of import be outside germany what step be the government take to proactively increase spot testing or screening across the country so that we can get ahead of any possible outbreak 
 we be apply all the rule that we can to ensure that we exclude german product at the moment but there be quite a complex set of supply chain within the european union the key priority be live animal there be nothing fortuitous about bluetongue but there have be restriction on movement for some   time so we be probably well protect than we might have be we can not say for sure that nothing will move across the continent and come into the country which be why it be very important that people be vigilant should foot and mouth disease cross the channel speed will be of the essence to ensure that we shut it down however from talk to the chief vet and her official and my conversation with german colleague i be confident that everything that can be do be be do i hope that reassure the hon lady 
 i be sure that nobody in devon will forget the horror of when half the farm in the county be affect by foot and mouth do the situation in germany provide an impetus for the minister to move forward with secure a veterinary deal with the european union 
 we do not need any extra impetus the government have commit to get a well deal what i can say to the hon lady be that the relationship with our german colleague be excellent at the moment and they be give we the full co operation that we need 
 the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in germany be a timely reminder of the livestock disease that threaten the uk every day the minister have say that he will take every precaution available to he so will he use this opportunity to permanently ban all personal import of meat and to ensure that both the public health authority and border force be resource to tackle illegal meat importation 
 the hon gentleman and i speak frequently when he be in his previous role and i be in opposition and he know of what he speak we have strong measure in place we strengthen they a few month ago and i be confident that they be at the right level at the moment of course there be always a case for further investment and i be sure that the hon gentleman will support any measure that we bring forward 
 do the minister accept that the reason why he can not provide national protection for northern ireland be that this house have surrender the right to make such regulation they can not even be make in stormont because only a foreign parliament be now entitle to make they therefore we in northern ireland do not have the same protection for our farmer and their livelihood that be afford elsewhere the ban be restrict to product come from the affect area in germany give that context will we see the absurdity that we have see in response to bluetongue whereby cattle and livestock from mainland europe can transit through gb to northern ireland and indeed anywhere in the island of ireland despite the ban be that same loophole go to apply in this case 
 i be grateful to the hon and learn gentleman for continue our dialogue on this issue i do not recognise that loophole and i can assure he that northern ireland will be fully protect because that be what we be determined to do 
 farmer in my constituency be very concerned by this news as powys be of the hard hit region in the outbreak and the trauma remain for the livestock farmer affect can the minister provide we with some further detail on the conversation that he have have with the welsh government and will he confirm that the welsh government will commit to work with local authority 
 i thank the hon gentleman not just for his question but for the concern he express about his constituent who suffer so grievously the detailed conversation on these issue be conduct between the veterinary officer who have a very close network however any political decision that need to be make will be make by ministers and i have a very close relationship with minister irranca davies if further action be need we will work together to stop any further incursion 
 in shropshire dairy and other livestock farmer have be have a torrid time recently and they will have read this news with a sense of dread i be also an officer of the all party parliamentary group on food security and we recently hear some eye water evidence from the border authority at dover about illegal meat import and the threat that they pose to uk biosecurity can the minister explain to the house what assessment he have make of the problem with that process and what he intend to do to ensure that disease such as foot and mouth do not arrive in the uk 
 i thank the hon lady for express her concern i reiterate the point i make early about the border control that we have in place i be afraid this have be a long run issue but we have much strong border control in place than we would have do in previous time we be work hard with the port health authority to make sure that we crack down on illegal import of meat 
 i declare an interest as a member of the ulster farmers union indeed i live on a farm on the ards peninsula where dairy farming and sheepman surround i and the impact on they would be great for that reason i want to ask the minister a question i can well remember the pile of dead animal and the traumatise farmer who be all concern as they always be about their animal that be over year ago in the lesson be hard and well learn other northern ireland mp have ask similar question and i be the we need to clarify for farmer my neighbour in northern ireland and all those who farm that there will be tolerance of product from germany will the minister confirm that a full uk wide report include on northern ireland will come to this house before any ban be lift 
 the hon gentleman speak with passion on these issue i can absolutely assure he that the measure in place to protect farmer in northern ireland be strong and will be good enough to make sure that we can protect people properly clearly there be a slightly different set of arrangement in northern ireland as he will be well aware we have to respect   that but we be get absolute and total co operation from our german colleague there will be no meat come from affected part of germany to northern ireland 
 urgent question to ask the minister to make a statement on plan for local government reorganisation 
 the english devolution white paper set out how this government plan to deliver on our manifesto pledge to transfer power out of westminster through devolution and to fix the foundation of local government this government ’s long term vision be for simple structure make it clear for resident who they should look to on local issue with more strategic decision to unlock growth and to deliver well service for local community
