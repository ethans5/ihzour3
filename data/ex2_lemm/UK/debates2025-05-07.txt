 the government have set out an unprecedented mission to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade and we have already set out a number of transformative measure to overhaul the police response to these terrible crime this include announce a £ investment in the new national centre for violence against woman and girl and public protection and we will publish the new violence against woman and girl strategy before the summer recess 
 recent figure show that sexual offence record by greater manchester police have quadruple since with the wigan borough see the most domestic abuse call out although the domestic abuse protection order trial in wigan be welcome more must be do to ensure that woman and girl be safe do the minister agree that broad societal action be need and can she outline how the government will work across department public service and local authority to address this crisis 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend the victims minister and i chair the violence against woman and girl cross government board which meet very regularly it have lead to our violence against woman and girl strategy which sit within that it be an expert group that help we on policy it include local government the voluntary sector the police and other member of civil society she be absolutely right to say that this policy will involve everybody 
 in november a report by the child safeguard practice review panel find that a focus on child sexual abuse in the home have be lose in the past year its key finding be that there be systematic failing across the board in identify and respond to sign of child sexual abuse that there be an over reliance on the criminal justice system and crucially that child ’s voice be not be hear how will the minister ensure that a focus on in home child sexual abuse be build into the government ’s violence against woman and girl strategy and that it will have child ’s voice at its heart 
 we be work with cabinet office colleague and other across government on the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse it be vital to ensure that any strategy include therapeutic and other support for child victim so that they can take action and we can ensure justice

 i pay tribute to the hon lady ’s constituent and to the many other who come forward during the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse but what i would like to tell he be that when i come to office there be absolutely no plan on this issue other than a sentence to say that something would be do around the redress scheme i have update the house fully on the iicsa recommendation and can tell the hon lady that the plan be still in train 
 will the minister meet i to discuss the issue face by woman with no recourse to public fund who be flee domestic violence as they may not be eligible for support with housing they may struggle to find refuge place i would appreciate a meeting to discuss this issue 
 i will absolutely meet the hon lady to discuss those issue the migrant victim of domestic abuse concession apply to all migrant victim regardless   of the type of visa that they be on and it should be provide that support but i be more than happy to meet she 
 the minister be do sterling work on this issue she will know that my passion be for northern ireland to be utterly in step with the rest of the uk when it come to protect woman and girl against violence do she agree that northern ireland its authority organisation and employer should implement the recent supreme court ruling and will she join i in call on the irish football association to be in step with the english and scottish football associations when it come to the protection of woman on and off the pitch 
 i thank the hon lady and absolutely pay tribute to her work on this issue which i have see directly in northern ireland what i would say as i be sure anyone would at this dispatch box be that i would always encourage everybody to follow the law in our country in step 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 year after baroness kennedy ’s groundbreake review on tackle misogyny in law late on friday the snp say that it would scrap its plan bill to tackle widespread misogyny and hatred against woman plan to tackle misogynistic harassment the stirring up of hatred and send threaten or abusive communication to woman and an aggravated offence of misogyny all scrap in favour of a water down amendment to the hate crime and public order scotland act woman across the united kingdom need action and reassurance that politician will root out the attitude that lead to hatred against woman in public life if the snp will not do it will this government act to give woman the support that they need 
 the hon lady make an impassioned point it will be a fundamental part of the violence against woman and girl strategy to get to the exact reason why we have end up with an epidemic of violence against woman and girl in all the nation of the united kingdom and to root it out for too long we have seek to put ever big plaster on the problem rather than find the reason for it and prevent it from happen 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to promote equality as part of the government mission entitle break down barrier to opportunity 
 this government be clear that equality and opportunity be at the heart of our programme of national renewal and economic growth the opportunity mission be all about create a fairer britain give every child the good start in life through our plan for change building skill for the future and ultimately drive up household income just last month we roll out the new free breakfast club to give child the good start to their school day and family more choice at work 
 under the previous government there be an increase in inequality and in the attainment gap and low performance in core subject such as math and science dyslexic student and student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in my constituency of broxtowe have be far disadvantage by delay and misdiagnosis what step be the minister take to support young people with dyslexia and adhd to ensure that they succeed 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that important issue which i know will be of concern to member across the house the government know that all too often child with special educational need and disability do not have the good educational outcome that we would all want for they it be really important that we do more to support neurodivergent child and young people include those with dyslexia and adhd that be why we have establish a neuro divergence taskforce an expert group that will support we to deliver well mainstream inclusion while ensure that we have more specialist provision for child who need it in order to strengthen the evidence base we have commission work from university college london on the most effective tool and strategy to support child with a wide range of need 
 my constituent repeatedly raise with i the lack of affordable childcare as a key factor drive the gender pay gap to give family real choice in those crucial early month will the government consider increase paternity pay to of earning with a cap for high earner 
 the hon lady will recognise that this government have expand worker right and be make sure that new mum and dad can spend more precious time with their young family as she say it be important that high quality early year education and childcare be available for parent so that they have good work choice that be why we have expand childcare provision and more than double the early year pupil premium we be also roll out new primary base nursery in school across the country 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 we all want to break down barrier to opportunity however it seem that sizable part of our workforce be be ignore and that be woman woman miss work due to endometriosis ovarian cyst and other complication cost the economy £ a year fix this would save more than double the amount that be to be spend on the unpalatable propose welfare cut for disabled people do the minister agree that improve woman ’s health will break down a huge barrier to work and if so how be she work with other departments to fix this 
 i agree with my hon friend the chair of the select committee and i pay tribute to she for all her campaign work in the important area of woman ’s health the government recognise the terrible impact that these condition can have on woman ’s ability to work and live their life as they should that be why we be commit to implement a woman ’s health strategy as part of the year plan and i know that the   health secretary be determined to bring down waiting list which have all too often affected woman include those with condition such as endometriosis we be make progress but there be much more to do 
 east sussex hearing be a charity in eastbourne that support people with hear disability to break barrier to opportunity through provision of life change hearing equipment and support it be keen to work with the local hospital trust and integrate care board to take its service to more people will the minister back its effort to engage with the trust and icb to help bring its charitable service to more people with hear disability in eastbourne and beyond 
 that sound like a sensible and constructive suggestion i will ensure that the view of the hon gentleman ’s constituent be share with colleague in the department of health and social care so that they can provide further advice on how that might well be take forward 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help protect girl from sex base violence by groom gang 
 the government be take unprecedented action to improve the response to these heinous crime so that we get more perpetrator behind bar and get justice for victim and survivor we be increase investment in the taskforce and every police force have be ask to review case that be close with no further action take arrest be increase we be expand victim right to review crucially we be introduce the new long overdue mandatory reporting duty and the new statutory aggravating factor for groom offence 
 in previous parliaments the housing communities and local government committee hold inquiry on rochdale rotherham and other town where sex grooming be take place we now know that this be a nationwide problem we hear from baroness casey then dame louise casey that there be a problem with pakistani man and their culture and that the victim be predominantly white girl in council care we have evidence that council staff councillor social worker and possibly the police have be complicit or have at least turn a blind eye to the issue so local inquiry will not be good enough will the minister call for a national judge lead inquiry in which witness be require to give evidence under oath so that those who turn a blind eye can be bring to justice 
 to answer the hon gentleman ’s final point to be clear national statutory inquiry do not send anyone to prison he rightly mention baroness casey and her work in rotherham and other work in rochdale the reason why we know about some of the terrible behaviour be because of the brilliant local inquiry undertake in those town louise casey be undertake a national audit that will report shortly 
 i call the shadow minister 
 despite what the prime minister say speak out for rape victim be not jump on a far right bandwagon yesterday it be report that no ’s interim spokesperson say it be obviously disappointing to see people weaponise rape gang for political point scoring how do that square with the harrowing personal testimony from jade chantelle scarlett erin and steph in anna hall ’s channel documentary air last week where concern question continue to arise about council police school social worker and child ’s home it be report that in up to community vulnerable girl who be under age exploit child be unbelievably label as promiscuous or child prostitute 
 the hon lady point out the terrible thing that have go on historically and that continue to be a concern across our country that be exactly why the government be invest in the taskforce which be work across the country with police force to ensure that people can be arrest and girl can be keep safe arrest have go up absolutely everybody think this issue be terrible i remind the hon lady that she gladly serve as women and equalities minister under a prime minister who say that look into these historical case be 
 spaffe money up the wall 
 as a child jade get a criminal record during her abuse and exploitation and now she can not attend her child ’s school trip chantelle rightly say 
 we be not the problem the man be the problem 
 although there be plenty of good woman on the front bench i have to ask be this government simply more interested in protect their own than stay true to their manifesto pledge that pledge say 
 we will use every tool to target perpetrator 
 yet labour be turn its back on that once again you can hear it the leader of the house call this dog whistle politic on national radio why will the minister and her front bench colleague not commit to deliver a proper national statutory public inquiry and finally put victim 
 i will absolutely protect my own in this my own be the woman in our country who for the last year have see no effort make people say terrible thing and the leader of the house be right to apologise i wonder how many of those on the opposition front bench ask the former prime minister to apologise for say that look into the life of the girl we be talk about through a statutory inquiry that have already happen be spaffe money up the wall where be the outrage 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on access to venture capital for woman 
 a £ boost could be add to the uk economy if woman be give the same opportunity as man to start and scale their business that be why it be a priority   for this government to increase access to capital for woman lead business and to continue to work as the chancellor have also outline with the women ’s business council and the invest in woman taskforce and on support the ftse women leaders programme we have back the invest in woman taskforce which launch an initial £ fund and there be a £ commitment from the british business bank to investment via female investor in woman lead business 
 for every £ of equity funding only 2p go to fully female fund business a figure that have barely shift in recent year close that gap could unlock up to £ for the uk economy will the minister outline what far step the department will take in collaboration with the treasury and the department for business and trade to address that persistent inequality and support female entrepreneur in scale their business 
 my hon friend be right for too long innovative woman lead start up have be hold back due to a lack of finance with the proportion of equity capital investment go to all female found firm stick at around in the uk for the last decade alongside the invest in woman taskforce the department for business and trade be lead on the investing in woman code and work with finance provider to increase access to finance resource and network for woman lead business i want to see we use the talent of all business leader to support female entrepreneur which be right not just for woman but for the whole economy 
 in my constituency of strangford many woman have start their own business but there have be a problem in get access to the finance to make that happen venture capital will make that happen to ensure that lady and woman have the same opportunity as man just because they be a different sex do not mean that they be any less able to do the job will the minister ensure that venture capital will be available in northern ireland for lady and woman in strangford and in northern ireland 
 the funding will be available to woman lead business in the hon gentleman ’s constituency it be right that we continue to support the work of the women ’s business council and other and look at all we can do to support woman in business and those who be come forward to start their own enterprise 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 the government be take decisive action to deliver our plan to make work pay put more money back into people ’s pocket the office for equality and opportunity recently launch a public consultation on mandatory ethnicity and disability pay gap reporting and a call for evidence on other measure to improve security at work for everyone and tackle unequal pay we will work in partnership with business to deliver this government ’s plan for change 
 many constituent have write to i to express their concern on the recent uk supreme court ruling relate to the legal definition of a woman it have leave the already vulnerable member of the trans community feel uncertain about how they will be able to go about their day to day life what step be the minister take to work with her colleague in other departments to provide further guidance and clarity on what the judgment mean in practice 
 you will know mr speaker that i make a statement to the house set out the government ’s position where we welcome the clarity of the supreme court ruling i should also stress that of course everyone within our country deserve to be treat with dignity respect and compassion and tran people continue to enjoy protection from harassment and discrimination under the law we be work with the equality and human rights commission on its code of practice which it will set out in due course follow consultation 
 my right hon friend will know of the grow concern around social medium algorithm increasingly promote misogynistic and harmful content to child particularly use the hook of dangerous online influencer what step be she take work with cabinet colleague to protect young people from such destructive influence 
 my hon friend raise a concern share by many across the house and it be crucial that we root out misogyny whether it be online or offline i be work with colleague across government to tackle those dangerous attitude for example through the department for education we be look at bring forward update relationship health and sex education guidance to ensure that it prevent and tackle misogyny alongside that i know the science innovation and technology secretary be determined to go far and fast to ensure that child be protect online 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be a great believer in britain be of the great meritocracy in the world where at least in our party people can rise to the very top irrespective of race religion or gender the government ’s consultation on reform equality law be a litany of activist demand and bureaucratic burden with no proof that any of the measure would reduce inequality why be the government so determine to put people into box on the basis of race instead of promote equality of opportunity for all 
 this labour government be determined to break the link between background and success so that where someone be from do not determine what they can go on to achieve and so everyone have the chance to get as far as their hard work and talent will take they it be important that we tackle the unacceptable gap we see around access to employment and pay for people from minority ethnic community and disabled people too that be why we be consult on this work with business and we want to get this right 
 the tories shamefully leave the gender pay gap persistently high do the secretary of state agree that labour ’s childcare expansion free breakfast club and new nursery will drive up woman ’s income and work choice   who be disproportionately more affected by care responsibility 
 i agree with my hon friend this labour government be determined to ensure that all woman have choice when it come to balance work and family life that be why we be expand access to childcare through new free breakfast club and new primary base nursery and i be delighted that my hon friend ’s constituent will benefit from of those new free breakfast club 
 perpetrator hang around school malicious contact with customer and rat poison be send to my constituent home be all frightening experience face by victim of domestic abuse but police response   be inconsistent even when perpetrator be on bail what be the secretary of state do to work with other departments to ensure that everyone in the system from call handler to crown prosecution service worker have training on form of non violent abuse to ensure that child and woman be protect 
 the hon lady raise some incredibly important point and shin a light on the experience of victim in her constituency this government be determined to halve violence against woman and girl that be why as my hon friend the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girl set out early we be take a range of action right across government we be of course always happy to consider further area where action be need so that all woman and girl be able to live free from abuse and intimidation within our society 
 this week we celebrate the international day of midwives midwife be an essential part of end inequity in maternal health deliver lifesave community base care will the minister please commit to work with the minister for health to ensure that our year health strategy and the nhs workforce plan put adequate resource into the overstretch maternity unit in many often deprive part of our country 
 yes i be happy to give my hon friend that commitment i know how seriously the health secretary take this issue because he know as i do that too many woman have be fail by poor maternal care and during traumatic experience and that all woman deserve safe compassionate care in those often quite difficult time that they can experience that be why we be commit to training thousand more midwife and through our nhs year plan we will ensure that there be equitable access right across the country for all woman as they experience pregnancy and childbirth 
 the prime minister be ask

 britain will fall silent tomorrow to mark the anniversary of ve day it be a day to remember our great generation whose courage and selflessness win a victory over tyranny and evil past and present the service of our armed force defend our freedom protect the value that we stand for and make this country so proud 
 the landmark deal we have secure with india be a huge win for work people in this country after year of negotiation this government have deliver in month slash tariff boost wage and unleash opportunity for uk business it be the big trade deal the uk have deliver since we leave the eu 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 in my constituent richard wellington be diagnose with a glioblastoma and give just month to live against the odd he be still with we today he know his time be limited however and be determined to leave a legacy by improve brain cancer treatment for other his courage be inspiring and he show extraordinary resilience but patient with brain tumour fall through the crack in our healthcare system under the conservatives and this must end will the prime minister set out how labour will speed up cancer diagnosis and improve treatment time for brain tumour patient such as richard as we go far with our plan for change 
 i send my good wish and i be sure those of the house to richard and to every family live with cancer for their courage and fortitude i also pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh   for her work to raise awareness of the devastating impact of brain cancer i be really proud that our plan for change have already deliver fast diagnosis for more than cancer patient we be roll out cancer which have groundbreake new technology that will slash treatment delay across the nhs as well as invest in more scanner surgical hub and radiotherapy machine it be important work that be only happen because of our decision to make a record investment in the nhs oppose by every other party 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 can i echo the prime minister ’s comment it be an honour to meet veteran at the ve day parade on monday   and to commemorate the sacrifice of that generation i look forward to mark ve day at westminster abbey tomorrow 
 do the prime minister now admit that he be wrong to remove the winter fuel payment from million of pensioner 
 the no job of this government be to put our finance back in order after the last government lose control and to deal with the £ black hole that they leave because of our action we have stabilise the economy invest record amount in the nhs make a payment out to the lowest pay and of course we be commit to the triple lock which improve pension by £ last year because of the work that we have do we be a country that country such as india want to do deal with because of the message and the work that we have do 
 the only black hole be the the prime minister be dig this issue affect some of the poor and most vulnerable pensioner his mayor in doncaster say it be wrong his minister in wales say it be wrong even his own mps be say it be wrong he have refuse to listen to i on this so will he at least listen to his own party and change course 
 let i spell this out all the opposition party would take this country back to where it be a few year ago break public finance interest rate through the roof and nhs waiting list at an all time high no other party in this house be prepared to say how they would put the finance straight no other party be say how they would invest in our nhs and public service no other party be focus on the long term prosperity of britain no on the labour benches be deny how big be the challenge that we face but no on the opposition benches be even prepared to take those challenge on 
 we would not balance it on the back of pensioner pensioner be poor and colder because of his decision all the while energy have get more expensive for everyone why have the prime minister break his promise to cut energy bill by £ 
 the way to bring energy bill down for good be to deliver cheap clean home grow energy in the meantime we have extend the warm home discount to household in family and that be £ off their bill next winter what will not bring energy bill down be the leader of the opposition ’s policy leave we hooked on fossil fuel and at the mercy of dictator like putin i will tell you what else will not bring bill down the conservatives block every piece of infrastructure that be need in their own backyard they balance the book and crash the economy on the back of million of work people in this country that be why those people deliver the verdict that they do at the last general election 
 the prime minister talk about clean energy we have the high amount of renewable on the grid in europe and yet we still have the high energy bill this be not about clean energy the prime minister have break another promise he will not admit it but be the truth not that he can not cut energy bill because of his net policy 
 energy bill base on fossil fuel have fluctuate massively in the last year because we be expose to the international market the only   way to get bill down be to go to renewable energy which be something that the leader of the opposition use to believe in in the word of the shadow chancellor   the right hon member for central devon sir mel stride the shift to net 
 must now happen as a matter of urgency it be no long simply an environmental issue energy independence should be view as part of our national security 
 he must have our line mr speaker 
 what about the leader of the opposition herself this be what she say 
 we believe that green trade and investment will be the future proof force that will help we create a well tomorrow 
 she go on to say 
 it ’ long term investment in nuclear and renewable that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuel and keep down consumer cost 
 she have a reputation apparently for straight talking she be right then be n’t she 
 this approach to net be irrational it be doom to fail those be n’t my word they be tony blair ’s if the prime minister want to throw word about he should speak to he the truth be that the prime minister be on another planet his net plan mean ever more expensive energy across this country job be disappear last week a ceramics factory in stoke close because of energy cost this morning more job loss have be announce in the north sea and yet the amount of gas the uk be import be double so why be he shut down the north sea rather than get our oil and gas out of the ground and make energy cheap 
 as i have say many time oil and gas will be part of the mix for many decade to come but net be an opportunity to be seize we have have over £ invest in clean energy since july of last year which be good for the economy for business for job for apprentice and for growth the global race be on for the job of the future and i believe britain can win that race i do not think that the leader of the opposition be yet a climate denier but she be a climate defeatist she do not believe in britain ’s ability to win the race for our economy business and job they have never back britain and there be nothing patriotic about that 
 the prime minister have get no answer he could not even bring himself to say something to the people who find out this morning that they have lose their job the fact be that pensioner be poor and people be be lay off from winter fuel to net his energy policy be a disaster and everyone know it we know it the public know it the union know it his mp know it and even tony blair know it the prime minister ’s only answer be to go far and fast in the wrong direction why should we all suffer because he will not admit he have get this wrong 
 of course nobody want to see job loss but the leader of the opposition should address her comment to the ten of thousand of man and woman in this country who be work on renewable for the future of our country and tell they that she do not want they that be anti growth anti job and   anti working people every week she come along to talk the country down and carp from the sideline she can not even bring herself to celebrate the deal we have do with india the conservatives spend year fiddle around and get absolutely nothing we have deliver the good deal since we leave the eu the most ambitious deal for india which will be measure in billion of pound into our economy and thousand of job in this country the leader of the opposition should be welcome that 
 the uk automotive sector face major challenge and trump ’s tariff be the late crisis to hit the industry investment and job be now on the line from mini to mclaren aston martin jaguar land rover and many other will the prime minister continue to make those company case in his talk with the us regime and remain a champion for this vital sector unlike the hon member for clacton nigel farage who believe that jaguar deserve to go bust 
 my hon friend make a very good point we be back british car company such as jlr and our india trade deal will see tariff slash for car sale which be good for british job the criticism of the double taxation be incoherent nonsense it be a benefit to work people it be in the agreement that we already have with other country if   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   or the leader of the opposition be seriously suggest that they be go to tear up agreement with other country create a massive hole in our economy they should get up and say so 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 as we celebrate year since britain lead our ally to victory over fascism i pay tribute on behalf of the liberal democrats to all those who struggle and sacrifice so much for our freedom today i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark about the conflict in kashmir and with he urge restraint and de escalation on both side 
 among the message that voter send to ministers last week stand out bring back the winter fuel payment for million of struggle pensioner people will therefore be disappoint that the prime minister fail to do so today he say that he want to go far and fast to clean up the mess leave by the conservatives but on social care which be so crucial for our nhs he be go slow and slow not only will the casey commission take year we learn on friday that the government plan to take an extra year to implement it it will not be implement until will the prime minister rip up that timetable make sure that he do not repeat the mess make by   the conservatives and get on with fix social care   this year 
 as the right hon gentleman know we be take this in stage we be already take measure to increase support for social care quite right too while do the long work to reform it and make sure we put a system in place however i say to the right hon gentleman once again that he come to the chamber every week say that we should spend   more money while at the same time say that he do not want to pay for any of the measure to raise that money that be nonsense 
 i be disappoint by that answer and i will keep come back to hold the prime minister to account 
 people also want a government who will stand up for our country against donald trump he come for our steelworker and our car maker with his outrageous tariff now donald trump be come for our world lead british film industry will the prime minister work with our ally in europe and the commonwealth and make it clear to president trump that if he pick a fight with james bond bridget jones and paddington bear he will lose 
 the right hon gentleman really should listen to the sector that he think he be champion they do not want we to abandon the work we be do to try to get an agreement with america they want that agreement to reduce tariff that be the sensible pragmatic way to protect our national interest it be not sensible or pragmatic to choose between the us and the eu to abandon the work we be do on trade with the us and to leave the tariff exactly where they be that be the most damaging thing that could possibly be do 
 i refer the house to my declaration in the register of members financial interests for young people in ipswich there be no shortage of ambition just a need for great opportunity that be why last autumn i be proud to sign an agreement with sizewell c to guarantee job for people in my town alongside additional investment for suffolk new college ’s course on welding engineering and fabrication so that kid in my town can access the well pay secure skilled job on offer may i therefore urge the prime minister to support a final investment decision for sizewell c not just for our country ’s energy security but for the once in a generation opportunity for young people in ipswich and suffolk 
 it be good to see a local labour mp fighting for job in his constituency and achieve excellent result we will make our final investment decision at the spending review it be something that the conservatives fail to deliver in year we be unashamedly pro nuclear pro growth and pro job that be why we be make it easy to build small modular reactor and scrap absurd rule that leave vital project tangle up in needless paperwork we be do the work that they fail to do in year 
 prior to the election the prime minister promise that energy bill would come down they continue to rise he promise that he would save the refinery at grangemouth it be shut he promise that he would unleash a generation of secure energy job in my city of aberdeen today harbour energy the large independent player in the north sea have announce that it be about to shed of its workforce that be job in my constituency go in the blink of his eye do you know who they    blame mr speaker they blame the policy of thelabour party may i ask the prime minister in fact may i invite he to come to aberdeen and explain to my constituent why he be willing to move heaven and earth to save job in scunthorpe while destroy job in scotland 
 nobody want to see job loss but i remind the right hon member that before we come into office month ago the scottish national party government in holyrood alongside the conservative government do absolutely nothing for project such as grangemouth we have commit £ to secure the future of the site we have deliver a £ deal and we be help with the training guarantee that be need like his minister the right hon gentleman will raise anything to distract from the snp ’s disastrous record with almost in scot stick on an nhs waiting list poor standard and violence in scottish school and more than £ cut from local government we give the scottish government the big settlement since devolution they have be in power for nearly decade they have absolutely nowhere to hide their appalling record 
 i thank the prime minister for recently visit the now royal port of barrow in my constituency to lay the keel for the new dreadnought class submarine he will have see how proud we be to build our nuclear deterrent which keep we safe as we move forward with our plan for change do he agree that barrow and furness could provide a blueprint for the whole country with defence investment create job growth and prosperity in community across the uk 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the royal port of barrow provide a model for how defence can be a catalyst for skilled well pay job throughout the united kingdom i be proud and humble to be able to thank the crew of the vanguard submarine that be return home after month away with of those on board return to their newborn child that be the change that will come from our spending of gdp on defence for the time since the last labour government extra investment in barrow have be make possible by my hon friend and this government those in the conservative party make promise but as usual they never ever set the money aside 
 ahead of the anniversary of ve day may i thank the prime minister for his government ’s recognition of the highly dangerous and clandestine work of the pilot and navigator who form the raf ’s photographic reconnaissance squadron and the buckinghamshire base photographic interpreter often forget whose service will be mark with a national memorial near the churchill war room they have a death rate of nearly and a life expectancy of only and a half month but they nevertheless capture image of enemy operation provide daily up to date intelligence via the interpreter analysis to the strategist in the cabinet war room for all our armed force 
 may i ask the prime minister to join i when that national memorial be unveil so that we can pay our respect to the like of the late captain wilfred bruce tilley dfc of axbridge in my constituency and the other amazing young man and woman whose work be so critical to the safety of million of people in this country and elsewhere

 the london borough of hackney spend £ a year and rise on temporary accommodation not only be that cost the taxpayer dear but it be wrench family apart community be be rent asunder school be close and family be live in hostel in overcrowded room or in far fling area outside london i welcome our pledge to build new home but will the prime minister reassure my constituent that social housing be a priority for he 
 my hon friend be right family be desperate for the security of their own home and we be deliver the big boost to affordable and social housing in a generation back by £ of additional investment that and our reform will fulfil our ambition to build new home in area across london include my hon friend ’s constituency at the same time we be tackle the root cause of homelessness and of course scrap section eviction 
 under the conservatives inequality have surge more than people include child in my constituency now live in poverty while the rich see their income soar of the develop country our be now the most unequal will the prime minister listen to the liberal democrats the public and many of his own back benchers and commit himself to reverse change involve for instance the personal independence payment the winter fuel allowance and the child benefit cap and will he introduce clear poverty reduction target to ensure that any economic growth benefit those who need it most 
 the hon lady be right to mention the appalling record of the last government which see more child in poverty we be already deliver free breakfast club and boost the minimum wage for more than people the lowest pay worker in our country and the child poverty taskforce be look at every lever that can be pull i be proud of the last labour government ’s record on tackle poverty and we will continue to do that in this government 
 last month ’s datum show that nhs waiting list in wales fall for month in a row in england the waiting list have fall for month in a row in scotland after nearly year in charge the snp government have leave our nhs on its knee instead remarkable act of charity from rock legend rod stewart be help people to get the care they need do the prime minister agree that scotland need a new direction so that my constituent in ayr carrick and cumnock do not rely on charity for their healthcare 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue the contrast as she point out be stark in england and wales waiting list be fall with over extra appointment already deliver in scotland the snp government have just introduce their nhs recovery plan in just year they have have the big budget settlement since devolution and nearly decade in power they still have no idea how to fix the nhs and they have run out of excuse

 crewe in my constituency have a proud rail heritage with crewe station boasting unrivalle ° connectivity to all corner of our country when the conservative government take the decision to cancel the leg of hs2 it be a great betrayal of my constituent take a sledgehammer to our town ’s prospect for regeneration and prosperity will the prime minister look kindly upon proposal to extend high speed rail north of birmingham which would utilise crewe ’s unique strategic value to the rail network and bring opportunity and prosperity to the north of england 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of strong and more reliable rail connection in improve journey and drive economic growth the conservative party utterly fail to grip delivery on hs2 cost go through the roof and timeline be shred there be false promise and a total failure we be review the position that we inherit and we be commit to improve rail connectivity across the north we have already announce £ extra for the key trans pennine route upgrade which will slash journey time and deliver growth and more reliable modern service for passenger 
 this week the israeli government approve a plan to officially conquer gaza just yesterday minister smotrich vow that gaza will be entirely destroy and that the palestinians will have to 
 leave in great number to country 
 this follow the extermination of over palestinian man woman and child and the simultaneous expansion of illegal settlement in the west bank something i witness with my own eye last week will the prime minister now finally acknowledge that ethnic cleansing be under way and end all uk military co operation with israel especially the illegal provision of f-35 fighter jet part or will he risk make britain complicit in war crime and be the prime minister to see britain answer at the hague for its role in this atrocity 
 most of what the hon gentleman say be simply not right but i want to address the position in gaza and the west bank because it be increasingly intolerable i be deeply concerned particularly with the lack of aid get in and the impact that that be have on hundred of thousand of individual that concern be something i recently reaffirm to the prime minister of the palestinian authority where i assert again that a state solution be the only viable approach for peace our focus be on deliver peace for palestinians and israelis return to the ceasefire get the hostage out and get in the humanitarian aid that be desperately need in great number and more quickly 
 as a result of a relationship breakdown my constituent martin and his child end up homeless they have go from live in a hotel to temporary accommodation martin feel abandon because glasgow city council have not be in contact for month the month of uncertainty have disrupt all their life but martin be especially worried about the impact on his child ’s education like any father he want stability for his family but the lack of social housing mean they be stick in complete limbo do the prime minister agree with i that every child no matter where they live deserve a safe home and access to a good education and that in every part of the uk we need to build more social housing in order to end homelessness 
 i be deeply sorry to hear about martin ’s case and i absolutely agree with my hon friend ’s comment about every family deserve a safe and a secure home in england that be why we be invest an additional £ to help deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in a generation but in scotland it be frankly disgraceful that over child have no fixed home to call their own after nearly year of an snp government that be the high level ever and show why scotland desperately need a new direction 
 last week i be talk to jason a pub landlord and he tell i that he have hear a rumour about the prime minister ooh not that not that he have hear that there be a reason why the prime minister hat britain ’s pub landlord such as jason be be batter by labour ’s job tax and the   slashing of small business rate relief mean that as many as half of britain ’s pub could be close by why do he hate britain ’s pub and if he do not why be he tax they into extinction 
 nobody like pub well than i and we support they this be the same old nonsense the opposition say they do not want the rise in national insurance contribution but they do not have the courage to say they would reverse it because they know that if they do say that they would be unable to say where the money be come from that be how we get into the problem in the place 
 few thing be more harrowing than a parent ’s desperate and repeat attempt to access the mental health support their child need organisation such as smile a counselling service support young people in my constituency be step into the breach while young people languish on waiting list without the help they need over the past decade smile have be a lifeline for thousand will the prime minister join i in wish declan and the team at smile a very happy birthday and thank they for their invaluable work in support our young people and family 
 i join my hon friend and commend all the staff at smile for their vital work far too many young people be leave without the support they need and that be why we be recruit an additional mental health worker provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school and funding talk therapy across the country to bring down waiting time and get people the care they need 
 with the so call eu uk reset summit less than week away will the prime minister reassure the house that he will not hand over any british sovereign power particularly the hard win control over our uk fishing water in backroom deal with brussels 
 as the hon member know we have commit to reset the relationship with the eu we think there be a well deal that can be have i be    not go to provide a running commentary what i can say be this we will act only as we always do in the national interest we have secure a very good deal with india we be talk to the us and we be go for a reset with the eu to boost our economy 
 as you know mr speaker i be alarm by news that the press association which assiduously cover our exchange here may cut back its dawn to dusk coverage through redundancy hansard faithfully record our word but it be reporter in the press gallery who bear witness to the human drama here and no amount of ai will replace the human eye in the press gallery will the prime minister join i and my hon friend   the member for rochdale paul waugh   in call on the newspaper and medium outlet that fund the press association to hold the front page and reconsider these rash move 
 my hon friend raise a really important point we enjoy a free press and independent journalism in this country across the world journalist risk their life and lose their life do what they do well independently pursue the truth on many occasion i have be at award ceremony usually on a yearly basis where the name of those journalist who have lose either their life or their freedom be read out and it be always a humbling reminder of the really important work that they do 
 as you know mr speaker parliament have ban the charging of electric vehicle in its underground car park because of safety concern yet local authority around the country often feel powerless to stop the construction of battery energy storage system near people ’s home and near our river and canal despite fire already this year will the prime minister look again at his planning and infrastructure bill to make it easy rather than hard for local community to have a meaningful say 
 i be really proud that on planning and infrastructure we be take the action that have not be take for year to drive our economy and i remind the hon gentleman that that be signal by the office for budget responsibility as the single big driver of growth over the come year 
 pm 
 urgent question to ask the minister if he will make a statement on the potential implication for the uk film industry of the united states ’s propose tariff on foreign produce film 
 as the house will be aware president trump announce on sunday that he have authorise the department of commerce to initiate tariff on all movie produce in foreign land he have make other comment since this be a very fluid situation and we will continue to take a calm and steady approach i spend most of monday talk to uk and us film maker and the general secretary of bectu among other and i can tell the house that we be already in active discussion with the top of the us administration on this subject 
 we be work hard to establish what might be propose if anything and to make sure our world beat creative industry be protect we be absolutely committed to ensure that the film industry can continue to thrive and create good job right across the uk uk film and high end television generate production spend of £ in and we want to work with our domestic industry and international partner to continue to build on that success 
 we be absolutely clear that the deep tie between the us and uk film industry provide mutual benefit to both country production be by their very nature international partnership which be often develop and create across different country and location indeed us movie be often multinational precisely because us movie earn far more overseas than they do domestically in the united states the uk and the us both benefit when the like of star wars and mission impossible be film in the uk just as we both benefit from the close work relationship between our producer talent and crew 
 our country have a long history of work together to drive the growth and creative success of our film and television sector from cary grant to hugh grant and from alfred hitchcock to christopher nolan british talent have often be at the forefront of the us sector and i be absolutely sure this will continue in the year ahead i be once tell by a film producer never judge a film by the minute i think we can say the same of this 
 i thank the minister for his answer as he rightly say we learn over the weekend that the president ’s administration intend to impose a tariff on all film produce outside the us it be understand that he have direct the us government to begin implement the policy immediately 
 i welcome the fact that the minister recognise the film industry in this country as a jewel in our crown of world lead creative industry i also point out that the sector alone be worth £ here and support job up and down the country it show off our great british culture and value the talent we have and some of the most amazing setting for so many film of different genre 
 i be glad that the government be work to ensure that all be do to give confidence to our director actor screenwriter and producer that they be think about they because for both independent film maker and major studio this action could result in cancel project lose investment and a significant decline in uk film export which be especially hard give that they be still recover from the covid pandemic but i have to say that it be disappoint the government fail to start the negotiation with president trump ’s team for month after the election and fire britain ’s top trade negotiator it be difficult not to wonder whether a different approach could have lead to a different outcome 
 none the less the priority be to protect our film industry so what assessment have the minister make of the potential impact on the uk film sector what immediate step be the government take to engage with the us and ensure that the investment in uk facility by many us business which would be affect be highlight what contingency plan have he prepare in the event that no exemption can be secure finally what assessment have the government make of the potential drastic cut in bbc studios profit from sale to the us market and what impact could that have on the licence fee 
 may i on a co operative note say that reason we have a very strong film and high end television sector in the uk be the joint policy adopt across several year by both conservative and labour administrations to ensure we have very competitive tax credit i pay tribute to the work do by the previous government which we be able to enhance when we bring in new tariff i mean new tax credit in the budget just before christmas no we be not in favour of bring in tariff i think i be right in say that in the labour government do bring in tariff on us film because we think too many us film be be show in british cinema that strategy do not go very well the americans simply ban the export of us film and we end up watch ben hur repeatedly in every cinema as well as a film call hellzapoppin which i do not think anybody have watch since however the successful bit of what we do in and be that we invest in the british film production system which lead to film such as hamlet and kind hearts and coronets that be the pattern we still want to adopt 
 let i be absolutely clear we believe that there be mutual benefit to both of we if we continue on the path we have select i be not sure precisely what be intend i do not know what a tariff on a service would look like and i do not know whether the intention be for it to be on movie theatre the danger be that the us already have major problem with its film industry be distribution cost so if the us go down that route it could lead to heavy problem for the industry and the other be the very high cost of make movie in the us 
 most film these day be an international collaboration of some kind and we want to maintain that even the british production of paddington”—i be look at   the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   only because i suspect he be about to mention it and he have just give i a paddington hard stare be make by studiocanal which be of course part of canal+ it have spanish actor as well as british actor this be just   a fact of modern film they be multinational and that be of their strength incidentally i do not think that paddington ever go to peru i do not think they film any of it in peru i be also tell by my peruvian friend that there be n’t any bear in peru 
 i welcome the minister ’s measured and thoughtful response to president trump ’s late announcement and his full throate support for the british film industry he will be aware that my constituency be very much a film venue for both film and television in his discussion with the united states will he ensure that he be also champion high end television as i think he briefly mention which be often film produce and make in hackney i also make a plea for all the creative industry in my constituency that feed into the film industry can the minister ensure there be good communication from the government on these negotiation this be create a great a deal of uncertainty 
 i know hackney very well as my hon friend know i use to be a councillor there it be not just london that be a phenomenal place to make a movie but the whole united kingdom we have some of the good scenery and some of the good building it be not only bath which get use endlessly in lot of film when i be there a couple of week ago i hear about a long list of they my hon friend be also right about television what be the difference between make bridgerton and make a movie in fact the pattern be very similar international collaboration be important because it deliver international audience and we want to maintain that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 british film really be the marmalade sandwich in the lunchbox of our creative industry it have give we bond paddington harry potter and monty python donald trump clearly think he be a god like figure but on the lib dem benches we be clear that he be not the messiah he ’ a very naughty boy if he have his way we would be watch harry potter and the prisoner of alcatraz or perhaps harry potter and the executive order of the phoenix will the minister confirm that all option will be on the table to protect our film industry include work with ally such as canada and australia which have show strength in recent week by vote anti trump will he commit to immediately meet film industry leader in the uk to co ordinate a response in this area and will the government back our world lead creative by do the right thing on ai and copyright 
 i could have predict half the hon gentleman ’s question because i know paddington would get in there on a serious note i be meet industry representative tomorrow afternoon and i look forward to understand their precise concern in addition to the obvious concern that we all share 
 i want to caution slightly against a word that have be use time now i think with member say that president trump have announce something a clear policy have not be announce i think we need   to be careful about that as i say early it be difficult to see how a tariff would be impose on a service or on film in this way i want to be careful and precise in the way we move forward on this 
 i have be ask what we be do we have already have people in washington dc talk with people in the trump administration at the high level and we will progress that of course we want to do everything we can to preserve the strength of the industry 
 i declare an interest as of my little sister work in the uk film and tv industry i be immensely proud of she i urge the minister to look at how we bolster home make film and tv as part of the soon to be publish creative industry sector plan particularly in northumbria where we have some of the most wonderful landscape a couple of year ago we sadly lose sycamore gap which provide a memorable backdrop but we also have hadrian ’s wall we also have a fantastic workforce but too often i see young people have to leave the north east to get creative opportunity elsewhere in the uk 
 that be an extremely well make point and i would add to it something i say when i appear before the select committee from whom i suppose we might hear in a moment which be that i be very keen on have a mixed economy in the british film industry sometimes we will be make film for other market sometimes we will be make film that tell predominantly british story about the way we be in this country and sell they around the world but where the intellectual property remain with british production company that be the mix that we need to achieve 
 the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   refer to our relationship with the us i should also say that the secretary of state be in india last week both she and i want to ensure that we also have a much strong relationship with india which be of the fast grow economy in the world we think we can do a great deal more in that film production space as well 
 i call the chair of the culture media and sport committee 
 there be no doubt that this speculation will cause huge worry to those work in british film production but as the minister say it highlight once again the importance of bolster the british screen sector we recommend step to deliver that in a recent select committee report yet within day of publish it his department have already ask for an extension to the time in which it would respond this weekend we hear rumour that the whole department be up for the chop under his government i be not sure if that be before or after he have sacrifice our creative industry on the altar of ai the minister be a brilliant communicator and i know that deep in his heart he care passionately about this issue but when will he show some grit and action on behalf of our world lead creative industry in particular our screen sector 
 i hope the hon lady accept that there be area where i have take very deliberate action on the back of recommendation from her committee not least in relation to a levy on gig and arena ticket to   fund support for small music venue but i take her point i be not aware that we have ask for an extension we will get on with provide a response to she as fast as possible it be an excellent report i have read it it contain lot of good thing that i want to take forward but we probably will not be able to do everything in it 
 it be really important that we focus on skill in the uk screen industry that have be raise repeatedly with i i want every kid in the country to have a chance to work in the creative industry include in film and high end television many would not even think that that be a possibility so we need to transform the whole pathway into those industry skill i know that that be of the thing that the hon lady ’s committee have raise 
 whether it be because of the fantastic state of the art shinfield studio just up the road access to fantastic filming location such as swinley forest on the crown estate or our incredible transport link bracknell forest be increasingly become a go to location for the film industry as the minister have already touch on we need to see more emphasis place on home grow skill so that young people in bracknell can access the fantastic opportunity that the film sector offer will he say a bit more about what this government will do to break down the barrier to opportunity in the film industry 
 we have already invest significant amount of money in the skill sector and more come as a result of the budget my hon friend be quite right that his patch be a go to area for film production reason that us company and for that matter company from many place around the world come to the uk to make film be for our skill we have some of the good cinematographer technical expert and designer as well as the act talent which mean that it be possible to make a very convincing film in the uk more effectively and cheaply than in many other place we be determined to ensure that the uk remain the good place in the world to make movie 
 film studio be a really important part of our economy in hertfordshire and give opportunity job apprenticeship and work experience to people in my constituency as the minister have recognise it be not remotely clear yet how the tariff will operate and many have say that they be unworkable but if america go ahead and we have to take action in this country to ensure that our film industry be competitive i urge he to look at the business rate regime with the treasury sky studios elstree near my constituency have see its business rate go up by more than 600%—they now account for of its operating cost i encourage the minister to look at tackle that regime as measure to ensure that we protect our creative industry and the film sector here in the uk 
 the hon lady make a good point which have be raise with i by several other member we make special provision in the budget to ensure that the business rate for studio be protect until and i think that be a good measure i know that some of the very large studio be find it more difficult and    i be happy to continue look at the issue let i read some statistic that may be helpful accord to a report publish in january by the motion picture association of the united states of america in the us earn $ in film and television export and its service trade surplus be $ or of the total us trade surplus in service it be mutually beneficial for the us and the uk to remain with the system we have without tariff 
 as you will be aware mr speaker harlow be the birthplace of rupert grint jo joyner and rik mayall i have to mention leila khan too because i use to teach she and she be an up and come star harlow have also recently double as paris in an episode of the crown do the minister agree that harlow as well as the rest of the uk have a huge amount of talent and that far from rely on us film import we produce some fantastic film in this country and our film industry be grow what can this government do to support it to continue to grow and thrive 
 my hon friend be quite right about harlow i would argue that many different part of the uk that have never yet manage to get into film need to up their game local authority can play a role in ensure that their area be consider as a potential place to make a film it be often about whether other facility be available in the local area that can contribute to that he make a fair point on behalf of harlow and if there be a film he will be star in it 
 i may be able to help the minister paddington bear actually live in borehamwood because the movie paddington be produce in my constituency at elstree studios which sit alongside sky studios elstree as a jewel in the crown of the british industry it be no surprise that donald trump be jealous because by many account more film and television content be produce in hertfordshire than in hollywood 
 as the minister rightly say the current situation be of mutual benefit to our nation there be thing that he could do right now though and for once i agree with the minister sorry i mean to say   the hon member for st albans daisy cooper i will get my fact right in a moment the key point be that business rate be prove to be crippling for many of our studio include elstree so i urge the minister to have another go at the treasury i remember a similar situation with the culture recovery fund the treasury be resistant to begin with but if he keep go he will get some further movement that would be a huge fillip to the industry and would help it to withstand whatever shock it may face 
 i be very confused about who be and be not a minister these day i accept the point it be clearly an issue i remember that when we be in opposition i be regularly knock on the door of the now shadow secretary of state   the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew try to get he to do something to persuade the treasury to do something about business rate i be fully on board and i understand the problem i look forward to   the right hon member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden   assist i in more endeavour in the future hugh bonneville tell i that   he be slightly upset when he sign up to paddington in peru because he think that he would be film in peru but he only get as far as borehamwood 
 the economy be set to benefit from a £ boost from the universal theme park in bedfordshire which will star paddington bear all member will welcome that do the minister agree that star like paddington bear have an enormous amount of soft power we have hear that in the chamber today what can the minister do to reassure i that he will ensure that we protect and support the next generation of great british storyteller 
 my hon friend make a very good point i be delighted that the theme park will happen it will be transformational for the british tourism industry apart from anything else and it will be the large theme park across the whole of europe i be very grateful to my colleague in the treasury who certainly deliver when it be necessary in relation to that i emphasise how important not just our film industry but our high end television and for that matter the very existence of the bbc and stuff produce by itv and many other be as part of our soft power although i think paddington probably count as hard power 
 shinfield studios in wokingham borough have bring hundred of job to my constituent and to many across berkshire it be a very important part of our local economy and a symbol of the uk ’s creative strength we must not forget that berkshire be the hollywood of britain and it must be protect from donald trump ’s reckless tariff will the minister condemn these harmful tariff and work with the film industry to ensure that the uk remain the world ’s premier destination for film investment 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right we want to maintain the uk as the premier destination for international investment from not just the united states of america but india which i have already reference and nigeria i would like to see a lot more co production between the uk and nigeria it be worth bear in mind that of our movie export go to the european union so this be a genuinely open market and my belief be that free trade be well than tariff 
 the minister will know that the uk have a world lead film and tv workforce that fly the flag for collaboration british talent and economic growth around the world but he will also know that much of our film workforce be freelance and that they will be watch this news with anxiety particularly as many of they be still recover from the impact of the recent us industrial action i thank the minister for his hard work i be pleased that he have speak to phillipa childs the head of bectu the union bectu be a fearless champion for our industry in the uk will he join i in reassure bectu member and our film workforce that we be on their side and that whatever happen we will help protect film talent in the uk 
 i shall make point in reply to that question there have be difficulty over the past couple of year in the uk film and high end television    industry because of what happen in the united states of america that make the point about the mutuality between the us and the uk film industry all the strong the truth be that i would like the us movie industry to be strong because if it be strong our industry will be strong as well there be net benefit for both of we and there be a win win situation 
 the point be about freelance work i have often worry that so much of the creative industry rely on freelance worker in many case that be great because people want that kind of career but they also need some degree of security if they be to be able to take out a mortgage and plan their economic future that be definitely of the thing that we will look at in relation to the industrial strategy which we hope to be publish soon 
 the film industry be enormously important to the buckinghamshire economy pinewood studios be in the constituency of my hon friend   the member for beaconsfield joy morrissey but many of my constituent be support in job not just at the studio themselves but in the many supply chain business that feed into they pinewood go over and above most other business i know in provide opportunity for young people through its futures festival which showcase every single career that can be have in the film industry much of that success be actually achieve on american money because company such as disney and amazon use pinewood out of choice therefore on top of what the minister have say about work with the trump administration to try to avoid these tariff can he assure we that he be work with company such as disney and amazon to ensure that those american brand be speak up to say why they be choose pinewood and other uk studio 
 i think the text message that i receive early on monday morning be from pinewood so yes i be on that case as well but it be not just about amazon and disney it be also about the streamer and a whole series of other such organisation make their product here in the united kingdom of course pinewood be the home of bond which also make the point because historically the distribution right for bond be i think with an american company but the production right be with barbara broccoli and her relative all of that be now with the us but let i put it this way i be very hopeful that bond will still always be british 
 i be glad that the minister mention the phrase win win because in international trade in the film industry and the creative industry it have to be about win win rather than sum when i discuss this industry with fabien riggall the founder of secret cinema it become absolutely clear that we have such incredible innovator in our creative industry and in the film sector specifically for they to flourish we need to retain that sense that it be a win win situation internationally and for the uk not sum 
 my hon friend make an extremely good point i will if i might just leap off the word cinema to make the point that film be not just about production but about find audience of my concern in the uk be about how we make sure that   cinema or movie theatre as they be know in the us can flourish as well they can be a really important part of dignity in a town a town that have a cinema be likely to be a place that have respect for itself and i would like to ensure that that continue into the future 
 scotland be now of the most seek after film destination in the world and us film company regularly base their operation in scotland we have feature in everything from batman to indiana jones to world war z all of that as well as develop the film sector in scotland will be put at risk if there be any concept of tariff at all will the minister work closely with the scottish government in his response to the us will he state quite clearly that such a move would be mutually self destructive and that all party be set to lose if the us proceed with anything approach tariff 
 i have already make the point that we think there be a win win situation a strong us movie industry will benefit a strong uk movie industry i believe in fair trade and free trade in fact over recent year it have be worry that more and more country have want to put up protectionist measure around a whole series of industry it have tend not to happen in service and to be more about good which be of the other issue the hon member be right about scotland i be very keen on work with all the devolve administration to make sure that we remain the good place in which to make film and high end television i do not know whether anybody have watch havoc”—[interruption sorry i be not refer to the conservative party return to my point havoc be all film in wales but it look as if it be an american dystopian city 
 warner brothers studios leavesden be in my constituency and a genuinely world class film and tv production centre it provide thousand of job generate significant wealth for the uk economy and earn south west hertfordshire the reputation of hollywood in hertfordshire major international blockbuster include barbie mission impossible paddington and the harry potter franchise have be film there and the recently confirm hbo harry potter tv series be set to be film there this summer 
 leave aside the decision that the chancellor have make and the impact that they have have on the economy can the minister reassure we that he will continue to update the house and the industry more widely about how the government will mitigate these tariff if they come to fruition 
 we be work on make sure that we have a proper trade deal that would not just mitigate the tariff but mean that we would not end up in the situation that the hon gentleman have just describe i know leavesden well and for that matter warner be in touch very quickly actually i think i be in touch with it very quickly on monday morning i   be very hopeful that it will be part of our discussion when i gather the industry together tomorrow afternoon but the hon gentleman make a good point none   the less 
 unlike many other in the house i can not say that my area totnes have film studio or that a major movie have be make in my constituency but we do have a lot of creative live in our community from writer to musician and producer we also have a costume maker who happen to be my daughter i be very proud of she and she be enter this industry an industry that we should all be proud of if these tariff materialise they will deal another blow to the uk film industry follow the strike that we have already see will the minister assure we that he be ready to protect and insulate the uk film industry and all the job that it sustain particularly freelance job by push for either tax credit or business rate adjustment 
 i find it difficult to believe that there have not ever be a film make in devon but if that be the case of my major aim must be to make sure that in the next few year a film be make in devon perhaps we will be able to get the hon member a bit part i will if i may just refer back to cheltenham of the film make in cheltenham many many year ago be if which be wonderful and be direct by lindsay anderson the word if be a very important at the moment because we be talk about if these tariff be to be impose 
 on sunday the president of the united states say 
 we want movie make in america again 
 do the minister agree that the key to make great movie be to ensure artistic freedom and expression and to grow the necessary skill with that in mind would he visit tech trowbridge in my constituency which be do a good job in upskille young people in multimedia 
 yes 
 as a time producer of a british make film i be proud that north norfolk have be the backdrop for many great film include alan partridge alpha papa it be no wonder that president trump would want to dissuade such a film from come to america as steve coogan himself have say that 
 the only person on earth who ’s more alan partridge than alan partridge be donald trump 
 can the minister assure the blossom creative sector in north norfolk that he value its contribution to our economy and can he give reassurance that the government will do everything they can to protect the sector from another trump trade tantrum 
 the hon member refer to some thing i have already speak about but why do he not make his film in devon he have obviously not get the message from his party colleague there be lot of great british film that will be watch in american cinema over the week to come and i be certain that no president would want to say do not watch british film of the film i enjoy most over the last few month be conclave which be a phenomenal success and remarkably timely 
 the film industry be important in northern ireland the executive have pour a considerable amount of money into northern ireland screen and the internationally successful game   of thrones be film in northern ireland much of it in my constituency we can see the benefit of that as ten of million of pound have be pour in for building set for costume and for catering and even now thousand of tourist come every year to see where the filming be so there be a long legacy 
 i welcome the way in which the minister be deal with this situation tariff be speculation at the moment but before they become policy it be important that we get the message over to the administration will he ensure that in construct his argument he consult with the northern ireland executive to ensure that northern ireland ’s voice be hear in these discussion 
 a rather lawrence of arabia question 
 the right hon gentleman make a good point i have already have discussion on other matter relate to the creative industry with member of the executive in northern ireland and i think i have another call next week so i will of course make sure they be consult he make a very good point about tourism an awful lot of tourist who come to the uk want to see the place where some of their favourite movie and television series be make that be of the thing that visitbritain be capitalise on at the moment with its star great britain campaign 
 i very much enjoy discuss the british film industry because member across the house stand up and say that they have the hollywood of hertfordshire or bedfordshire and everywhere else i be bless in spelthorne to have europe ’s big film studio and the big in the world in shepperton interestingly it be not to hollywood but to china there be a certain amount of nervousness in spelthorne as a result of the posting on truth social that the minister have come here to talk about i agree with he that it be incredibly difficult logistically and technically to unpick the us uk intellectual property in a film and i think it will prove to be so i therefore commend he for his consider run at this i think it be the right thing to do 
 a couple of week ago i visit cineco of our many british film support company which make set and prop point it make on skill be that the apprenticeship model do not work terribly well for industry that have so many freelancer and such lumpy work schedule as a sidebar to the minister ’s meeting with industry leader tomorrow would he please raise and discuss that with industry leader 
 another lawrence of arabia question 
 interestingly i be at the bad wolf studio in cardiff last week and thing jane tranter raise with i be how important the security of know that they have a number of project in their studio have be to take on apprentice in the company they have be make not just doctor who but his dark materials and industry be be film there at the moment there be a whole series of different project and that enable the studio to take people   on not just on a daily basis we need to change the    apprenticeship levy in the uk so that it work well for the film industry and so that the industry can make long term commitment to people ’s future career 
 i appreciate the minister ’s comment this afternoon i be a member of the culture media and sport committee and we have hear over and over again how important uk film tax credit be to the industry and about the tangible difference they make to film maker across the uk can the minister say whether the government be consider increase or adjust they in any way to maintain competitiveness with us and other international market give the context we be now work within 
 i have always say that i support film tax credit labour introduce they under gordon brown they be continue by the conservative government and then we introduce new one incidentally i think that the independent £ movie tax credit will make a significant difference to the uk particularly at this point i note that some document produce around the semi announcement in the united states of america have praise the way that we have do thing in the uk and other part of the world want to mirror it i will take praise wherever i can get it 
 the uncertainty of president trump ’s comment put an unsettledness in the industry especially in northern ireland where we have the titanic studios and northern ireland screen work away titanic studios be already work on a knight of the kingdoms which be a prequel to game of thrones so there be a lot of activity go on in the industry will the minister consider include northern ireland screen in his meeting tomorrow with the industry rather than leave it another week to engage with it 
 that be a very fair point i be happy to do that 
 i be deeply proud that st margarets in my constituency have be home to twickenham film studios for over year the studio have be involve in production and post production work for big name film include the italian job and ghandi and most recently they do the oscar win sound production for top gun maverick however they have be beset by financial challenge from the us writer strike to the sky rocket business rate mention by my hon friend   the member for st albans daisy cooper the tariff could deal a fatal blow to studio such as twickenham can i urge the minister as other have to work with the treasury and the valuation office agency on bring down the rateable value of film studio can i also invite he to follow in the footstep of tom cruise and come to st margarets to visit twickenham film studios 
 the thing be tom cruise do all his own stunt do n’t he i be a little bit nervous about be dangle off the back of a helicopter or dump   in a vat of i do not know interruption the shadow minister say he will happily arrange it well then i invite he to see the rhondda tunnel we can dangle he down a hole as well 
 the hon lady be make a point that have be make several time tom cruise be of the big investor in the uk because of all the movie that have be make here and we be very grateful to he the british film institute will be honour he next week and i think that be really good as i say we be the good place in the world to make movie and we want to continue that 
 i feel very left out not have a studio in my constituency but we have produce some of the good actor in the world include sir stanley baker i think of his good film you will know this mr speaker be sodom and gomorrah 
 i be think of a different film 
 what film be you hang on we be not mean to do this be we order order as i be say i be also very proud of the young actor callum scott howells who be do phenomenally well 
 for the final episode i call jim shannon
