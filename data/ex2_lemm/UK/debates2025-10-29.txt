 minister welcome 
 thank you mr speaker as a proud welsh mp i be honour to be here for my welsh question 
 we fully recognise the role of farmer and the agricultural community in wales that be why of the thing that i do as minister be meet member of the farmers union of wales at the farm of of its member just week ago i will be meet with the national farmers union later today to discuss important matter for its member include inheritance tax this government have also make sure to protect the farm budget for wales ensure that the full £ have be allocate to the welsh government 
 i welcome the minister to her place the impact of the change to iht go far beyond just farmer last month a pembrokeshire farm gather business from vet machinery dealership and milk processor to electrician and fence company employ almost people almost half of those be totally reliant on income from local farm have the government fully consider the ripple effect of that policy on farm in wales and across the uk include in my constituency 
 this government want to strike a fair balance between support farmer and fix our public finance on which our community include those important agricultural community rely so heavily   the vast majority of farmer will not be affect by this change and they will be able to pass the family farm down to their child welsh conservatives vote to block the support reach welsh farm in march which show that the conservative party just do not care for farmer and the agricultural community 
 i welcome the minister to her position at the dispatch box i know she will be excellent at the job i also refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests welsh farming be central to the welsh economy we can all agree on that but it be now face a double whammy from the mad sustainable farming scheme from labour in cardiff and the frankly bad family farm tax that have be dream up by labour in london the farmers union of wales tell we that more than of active farm in wales will have iht bill that exceed their income that spell economic disaster why be labour so deaf to the voice of farmer in wales 
 as i say the government want to strike that fair balance and that be what they be do our reform mean that the majority of those claim agricultural property relief will not be affect that be a fair approach that balance fix our public finance after the chaos of the conservative party and maintain much need support for family farm and the wide rural agricultural community 
 i welcome my hon friend to her place be she as shock as i be last year that plaid cymru and conservative senedd members vote against the £ funding for welsh farmer will she join i in urge they to stop play political game put the people of wales and work with the welsh government constructively to ensure that we do not have uncertainty for our farmer and our public sector which we all depend on in wales 
 i thank my hon friend and pay tribute to her work in this role prior to my appointment i completely agree the welsh government publish their outline draft budget early this month and be work with opposition party to ensure that it have broad support the question everyone in wales want the answer to be whether the opposition party will vote against billion of pound for public service include vital support for welsh farmer just like they do last year 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i note that it take woman to take i on now but   i very much welcome the ministers to their place charles rees a generation pembrokeshire farmer have bravely and move share his battle with cancer on the bbc ’s countryfile and i know this house will send he and his family our good wish his illness be not his only worry he be also seriously concerned that his son who be run his farm could now be face an unaffordable inheritance tax bill of £ solely due to this government ’s catastrophic family farm tax despite ministers say differently charles and many other farmer across the country be fear for their   livelihood their way of life their future and for food security will the government scrap the family farm tax 
 i reiterate that our reform mean that the majority of those claim the relief will not be affect as confirm by the minister for food security and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for wallasey dame angela eagle there will be no change and no u turn on inheritance tax this policy strike a fair balance and be fix our public finance after the chaos that the tories leave while protect our rural community 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on increase economic growth in wales 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on increase economic growth in wales 
 economic growth be the no priority for this government the uk be the fast grow economy in the g7 in the half of this year wage be up inward investment be up inactivity be down on the year and interest rate be down this labour government be deliver for work people all across wales and the united kingdom 
 it be brilliant that last month a total of £ be invest in community across wales as part of the government ’s pride in place scheme   in my patch i be delighted that early this year scarborough be award £ through the plan for neighbourhood these initiative will give local people the power to decide how funding will transform our town will the secretary of state update the house on how fund such as these will boost local economic growth and restore pride in our community 
 through the pride in place initiative we be put power and resource directly into the hand of local community from conwy to carmarthenshire give they the ability to decide the priority that matter most and the funding to pay for visible and lasting change in wales community will benefit from £ of investment alongside a furth £ benefit every single local authority across wales together the investment will help revitalise high street and improve public space and community facility which be a central part of our mission to boost the economy and break down barrier to opportunity 
 as the mp for the centre of london include paddington station i know how interconnect our country and our economy be in stark contrast to the nationalist party of reform and plaid cymru the labour government be focus on job creation will the secretary of state update we on the impact of plaid cymru ’s damage independence plan 
 plaid cymru ’s disastrous plan for independence will cost wales £ every year over £ for every working age person in wales   or over £ for every adult and child in wales every    single year the people of wales deserve to know what public service plaid cymru will cut or what taxis it would raise to pay for its divisive separatist plan 
 it be not just farmer but lot of other family business who be terrify for their future under the business property relief a company worth £ would have to pay £ in tax yet that responsibility fall not on the business but the person who inherit it so they will have to extract another £ to pay that tax crippling family business crippling investment and hurt growth in wales that be true be it not 
 it be certainly not the right hon gentleman will have hear of tax planning and so will the people he have be talk about investment be up in wales and we have have record inward investment in wales with a increase on the previous financial year and a increase in job create the uk be the fast grow economy in the g7 in the half of this year business be grow develop and create job under this government 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 under the watch of the current secretary of state opportunity for young people be now unbelievably dire despite what she say unemployment be rise and employment be fall and that situation be not good enough for the next generation in wales last week my colleague darren millar who be the conservative leader of the senedd group meet the welsh minister do anyone know who that is?—offere to potentially support the welsh government ’s budget provide labour ministers agree to scrap welsh stamp duty that would help young people on to the property ladder in wales where it be the hard to achieve that and boost the welsh economy will the secretary of state confirm that she agree with scrap welsh stamp duty if so what measure be she take to persuade baroness morgan of ely to scrap the tax in wales 
 i be very glad that the hon lady know the name of the welsh conservative leader in the senedd because clearly her colleague the shadow home secretary   the right hon member for croydon south chris philp do not they must have end their fight about who be the actual leader 
 we be deliver for the people of wales we have end tory austerity and we have the large budget settlement in the history of devolution with nearly £ extra to spend on public service over the next year we be create job and we have increase the minimum wage and the national living wage for welsh worker we be fix the foundation and the chaos that the hon lady ’s party leave behind 
 allow i to congratulate lindsay whittle on his seismic victory in caerphilly in do so i pay tribute to the late hefin david whose service to his community be deeply respect as mr whittle have say 
 he will be a hard act to follow i will never fill his shoe but i promise you i will walk the same path that he do 
 the result show that people in wales seek real change in her capacity as secretary of state at the wales office what be she do to press the labour chancellor to include measure that benefit wales in the autumn budget 
 i thank the right hon lady for her word about our late colleague hefin david i congratulate lindsay whittle on his victory and on become a senedd member i be sure that he will work very hard for his caerphilly constituency for the next month as she will know i be not go to comment on discussion between myself and the chancellor ahead of the budget she will have to wait and see what the chancellor say on   november 
 none the less i think we all know that the autumn budget risk fall short of tackle the deep poverty and lack of opportunity that still scar far too many welsh community we need to tax income from wealth fairly scrap the child limit and ensure that family have the support they need to cope with rise cost the secretary of state tell i to wait for the budget perhaps she be therefore prepare for once to meet with i to discuss plaid cymru ’s proposal for a fairer more ambitious uk budget that actually work for wales will she meet with i 
 i be very happy to meet with the right hon lady 
 i think so 
 what recent discussion she have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on reduce the cost of live in wales 
 i have regular discussion with the chancellor and treasury ministers on a wide range of issue include the cost of living this labour government be on the side of work people that be why we have already take action by increase the national minimum wage and the national living wage for worker across wales we have freeze fuel duty and extend the warm home discount there be more to do and we be determined to put more money into people ’s pocket right across wales 
 a century of labour take the people of wales for grant come crash down last week with the sensational victory of plaid ’s lindsay whittle in caerphilly with labour reduce to place why would anybody accept any more labour as labour ’s cost of living soar its westminster perma crisis deepen and people in wales live under its poverty prospectus the secretary of state will not say what she be go to speak to the chancellor about but do she think the chancellor be ready and willing to help the people of wales the people of wales feel abandon by labour over the last decade 
 i be not sure whether the hon member have ever be to caerphilly or even to wales if he have that be good if he have not he need to be careful about    what he say about the people in wales he absolutely do not know what he be talk about his party ’s record in scotland be nothing to boast about nationalist will divide the united kingdom cost wales £ every single year 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i welcome last month ’s news that newport city council and caerphilly county borough council will each receive £ from the uk labour government ’s pride in place scheme that funding will empower community across my constituency to invest in community asset and their local high street drive local growth and create job thus reduce the cost of living do the secretary of state agree that at last in wales we have labour government deliver for the people of wales 
 my hon friend the chair of the welsh affairs select committee be absolutely right our pride in place programme the local growth fund the city and growth deal the investment zone and our freeport be all the result of have labour government work together for the benefit of everyone across wales take together they will boost the economy draw in further investment create thousand of job and raise living standard across wales they demonstrate this government ’s commitment to growth practical visible long term investment that empower local community and deliver real benefit for they 
 whether she have have recent discussion with the welsh government on the replacement of overhead pylon with underground cabling 
 overhead line be much cheap to build accord to the institution of engineering and technology undergrounde cost an estimate and a half time more than overhead line overhead line be also quick to build cause less environmental damage and be much easy to maintain the cost of build this infrastructure be bear by electricity bill payer and plaid ’s policy on undergrounding will not only increase bill but suffocate the economic potential of wales ’s green industrial revolution 
 my constituency be the location of major infrastructure project a network of pylon of km and km alongside wind turbine that be metre tall the cumulative impact of these project be significant occupy land that could support other development and it remain unclear whether they will lower electricity bill or improve electricity connectivity for local household or business what discussion have the secretary of state have with the welsh government to ensure that those project deliver genuine benefit for our community 
 i have hear what the hon lady have say but we do have a policy to ensure that community that host clean energy infrastructure can directly benefit the new community fund guidance aim to improve the consistency and amount of funding for community   that could be use for local project turn to bill discount we be introduce a scheme that will provide household discount to those live close to new and significantly upgrade transmission infrastructure project 
 i like my constituency neighbour   the hon member for caerfyrddin ann davies and plaid want to be take seriously as a party of government but it fail to recognise the importance of the role that renewable energy will play do the secretary of state agree with renewableuk cymru which recently conclude that plaid ’s approach would cost job and investment in community such as mine in pembrokeshire 
 labour be the only party that be commit to invest in renewable energy which will bring down bill and create thousand of job for people right across wales plaid and reform be against renewable infrastructure and plaid and the snp do not want nuclear plaid ’s economy spokesperson in the senedd be anti nuclear plaid be happy to see people pay high bill to spurn investment and to see job opportunity slash 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 during the world war over people be force to leave their home and give up their land in the epynt when more than half of the community be take for use by the ministry of defence the people of the epynt understand why that sacrifice have to be make but now bute energy and its wealthy investment backer want to take the rest of the epynt do the secretary of state agree that the epynt have already sacrifice enough and will she work with i to defend the welsh countryside from once again have its wealth extract from it with no benefit to local community 
 it sound like the liberal democrats in wales have the same position as plaid cymru our priority be to drive growth low bill and create job for people through our new green energy revolution include those in the hon gentleman ’s constituency investment in his constituency be something he should be welcome 
 what discussion she have have with the secretary of state for the home department on the adequacy of accommodation for asylum seeker in wales 
 we inherit a broken asylum system in absolute chaos from the tories with ten of thousand stick in a system dependent on expensive asylum hotel we be commit to end the use of hotel as asylum accommodation as soon as possible and before the end of this parliament as part of a control manage and orderly programme 
 under the welsh labour government waiting list educational standard and opportunity for young people have all grind to an abrupt halt it be therefore shocking that the welsh labour government    be not prioritise issue that would make a real difference to the people of wales instead labour ministers support by plaid cymru be plough ten of million of pound into their nation of sanctuary policy which be believe to support service for some illegal immigrant do the hon lady agree that it be high time her colleague scrap this wasteful non devolved policy and instead focus their time on lower nhs waiting time and improve standard 
 it sound like the hon member do not agree with welcome the thousand of ukrainian refugee that the uk government ’s nation of sanctuary have support the scheme have be use to welcome ukrainian family flee from russian aggression that be a cause that i understand her party support 
 i associate myself with the remark of the leader of plaid cymru in pay tribute to hefin david my friend and colleague he be an amazing representative for wales and a real warrior for those who be neurodivergent or find themselves on the margin of society 
 i be delighted that caerphilly be so popular today it seem that so many people who have either only visit several time or not visit at all and have only read about it in the press have become expert about my constituency 
 i be also pleased that the minister have raise the plight of ukrainians who come to wales to seek sanctuary run from war because if there be downside to the by election it be the talk of asylum seeker be bad people that they be all illegal and that they do not contribute anything those who say such thing should see the exhibition that be on at caerphilly council and see what asylum seeker have contribute what message do the minister have for those ukrainians who be still seek asylum in wales 
 we offer sanctuary for those who desperately need it and we be proud of that but we inherit contract and a broken system from the conservatives hotel use have nearly halve since the last election and we have remove people who have no right to be here ensure that those who do need to be here have the welcome and support that they need it be not job do but work in progress we can compare that with the year of the tory government 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 after wantonly scrap the rwanda scheme the labour government be now oversee record break figure of illegal immigrant it be report that the scandal be now engulf north wales where more than illegal immigrant have try to gain entry to the country on ferry from dublin to holyhead meanwhile there be talk about penally military camp in south west wales which be previously condemn by the welsh labour government it appear that their policy along with reform ’s be from boat to barrack as be happen in scotland and sussex yet plaid say that there be no such thing as illegal immigration do the minister agree that her government and plaid have no idea about and no interest in how to make our border safe 
 i fear that the conservatives forget about the chaos that they create we inherit a broken system after year of chaos and contract that we have to honour but in the past year we have halve the use of hotel we have remove people who have no right to be here it be not job do as i say but it be a work in progress we can compare that work in just year with year of chaos under the hon lady ’s government 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to improve cross border rail connectivity between wales and england 
 we be invest at least £ in welsh rail in order to right year of underfunding by past government that will mean new station and more and fast train along the key line and will improve cross border connectivity create job and boost economic growth 
 i thank the minister for that £ investment which will be a fundamental driver of economic growth and connectivity in south wales what action be she take with cabinet colleague and industry partner to ensure that a new station serve my constituent in magor and undy be deliver without delay get my constituent on track and fast towards their destination 
 my hon friend have be a strong champion for this rail investment which be the key to unlock wales ’s economic potential it include fund to progress the burns station in cardiff east newport west somerton llanwern and magor and undy i will continue to work with the wales rail board and the welsh government to ensure that the community my hon friend represent be give the infrastructure that it need 
 the huge potential of both the north west of england and north wales be be hold back by poor rail infra structure the last conservative government commit themselves to spend at least £ to upgrade and electrify the railway line from crewe and warrington through chester and into north wales but this labour government have scrap those transformational plan at a time when economic growth be a priority will the minister seek to reinstate the vital rail infrastructure investment in the mersey dee and north wales region 
 that money just do not exist we be invest a historic £ in welsh rail to right year of underfunding by previous government unleash wales ’s economic potential that will mean new station fast train on key line and connect people with well pay and well job right across wales government be work in partnership to deliver for the people of wales 
 order before we come to prime minister ’s question may i welcome in the gallery the honourable speaker of the parliament of sri lanka and his delegation 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday october 
 the scene of destruction emerge from jamaica be truly shocking both the foreign secretary and i have be in close contact with our jamaican counterpart in recent day to offer the uk ’s full support i can update the house hms trent and specialist rapid deployment team be pre positioned in the region and we stand ready to provide humanitarian support 
 awaab ishak die year ago from a respiratory condition cause by exposure to black mould in his flat in rochdale he be just year old no child should grow up without the safety and security of a decent home for far too long million of people have live at the mercy of rogue landlord and insecure contract labour be end that despite the good effort of the tories and reform who vote against it our renters rights act be now law include awaab ’s law 
 fight for work people that be the difference that a labour government make and on that issue this government have secure the big deal to manufacture typhoon fighter jet in this country for almost year we secure that deal because the uk be back as a lead and trust member of nato that be a timely reminder for the green party whose policy be to take we out of nato for the putin friendly reform party which would have no standing with nato and for the leader of the opposition because you do not win nato deal by not turn up to nato summit 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in the house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark about support jamaica 
 across our country and in blaenau gwent and rhymney off road biker be a menace they tear up our environment and turn our street into racetrack after year of tory cut gwent police be now tackle that do the prime minister agree that police force and community such as mine be see the difference that labour can make in power 
 i share my hon friend ’s determination that everyone should feel safe and secure in their community neighbourhood policing be decimate by the conservative party and we be restore it with extra officer by spring we be also give they the power that they need include tough new respect order that allow the police to seize and destroy vehicle within hour the tories walk through the   lobby with reform to vote against our crime and policing bill 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 last year in its manifesto labour promise not to increase income tax not to increase national insurance and not to increase vat do the prime minister still stand by his promise 
 i be glad that the leader of the opposition be now finally talk about the economy i can update the house retail sale be high than expect inflation be low than expect growth have be upgrade this year and the uk stock market be at an all time high the budget be on   november and we will lay out our plan then but i can tell the house now that we will build a strong economy cut nhs waiting list and deliver a well future for our country 
 well well well what a fascinating answer it be not the same answer that i receive when i ask exactly the same question word for word on   july then the prime minister reply with just word yes and then he sit down with a smug grin on his face what have change in the past month 
 as the leader of the opposition well know no prime minister or chancellor will ever set out their plan in advance but i can say this the figure from the productivity review that be be undertake which be a judgment on the tories record in office be now come through and they confirm that the tories do even more damage to the economy than we have previously think we will turn that around we have already deliver the fast growth in the g7 in the half of this year interest rate cut in a row and trade deal with the us eu and india the tories break the economy we be fix it 
 the right and learn hon gentleman say that no prime minister or chancellor will say these thing before the budget have he tell his chancellor she have be out there fly kite cause constant speculation around the budget that be damage the economy all week the government have be brief about tax rise what we have hear be that he do not have a plan so we have some idea for he interruption it be quite clear that they need some idea on the conservative benches we believe in scrap taxis on family home yesterday we vote to abolish stamp duty labour vote against it even the former deputy prime minister who resign in disgrace for not pay stamp duty vote to keep it i remind they that on this side of the house we know that abolish stamp duty be how we get young people on the housing ladder and get the economy grow so why will he not scrap this terrible tax 
 why do the tories not do it then in their year in office as i say the productivity review figure be now come in and those show the true extent of the damage that they do the leader of the opposition ask we to take advice from they these figure be come out and we all know that austerity damage the economy on their watch the botched brexit deal damage the economy on their watch liz truss ’s mini budget damage the economy on their watch so we will take no lecture or advice from they on the economy they will not be trust on the economy for generation to come that be why i can be clear that   at our budget there will be no return to austerity that be what break the country and no return to the instability of their mad borrowing spree and we will end the unfairness and low growth that squeeze living standard for work people that be the path to national renewal 
 the conservatives reduce the deficit every year until the pandemic we more than double the personal allowance we leave more job than we find from labour we bring inflation down to it have nearly doubled—[interruption 
 order mr tufnell you be in my sight the pantomime season have not arrive do not start it too early 
 on our record we bring inflation down to it have double under the prime minister we leave he the fast grow economy in the g7 it be no long the truth be the government have no idea we be give they some there be another way to get growth cut welfare spending and get people into work last month i offer to work cross party with he to bring down welfare spending because he know and we know that he would rather dip into people ’s pocket than upset the people behind he instead of tax rise will he work with we to find a way to cut welfare spending and get britain work again 
 the right hon lady talk about the conservatives record so let we go through it they crash the economy inflation go up to mortgage go through the roof welfare spending go up by £ and they want to give we advice they reduce the uk to a laugh stock because of our budget waiting list have come down wage be up mortgage rate be down and other country want to do deal with we just on monday of this week the turkish government sign an £ deal for typhoons early this year the norwegian government sign   a £ deal for frigate that be because of   the budget that we pass fix the mess that the tories leave 
 it be not because of the budget that the prime minister pass i start that deal back in january and i welcome it interruption it have nothing to do with the government ’s budget we be lucky the deal be still happen i welcome the £ deal that he have do with turkey but i remind he that just last month his chancellor borrow £ he will have to sell a hell of a lot more jet to make up for that he will not rule out any tax rise he can not cut spending and he be increase unemployment this man know nothing about economic growth except how to destroy it in his weakness he have cave in to the union on their regulation that will cripple business cost they £ every year interruption yes please do speak up because i want every single business out there to hear labour mp heckle when we talk about the damage that they be do i ask the prime minister how on earth can he consider add more burden for these firm to deal with 
 the right hon lady have overlook the fact that we have the high growth in the g7 in the month of this year and that growth have just   be upgrade and we have interest rate cut we be not go to take lesson from the conservatives she have now introduce what i think she call a golden economic rule this golden rule that she be now put forward very golden!—is £ worth of unspecified spending cut with no detail whatsoever let i put that in context that would mean few nurse few teacher or cut every police officer in the country twice over no wonder the institute for government say she be on shaky foundation that be exactly what cause the problem in the place 
 the fact that he have to stand there and make stuff up just show what kind of prime minister he be we have an itemise list worth £ £ be on welfare spending which i ask he to work with we to cut he refuse to do so all he know how to do be tax tax tax if you work the government tax you more if you save they tax you more if you buy a home they tax you more none of these taxis be in their manifesto which he have year to prepare he be raise taxis because he be too weak to control spending he be blame we he be blame the obr last week they be blame brexit be it not the truth that with this prime minister it be always someone else ’s fault 
 the conservatives be kick out of office because they break the economy they will not be trust for year to come the right hon lady can not tell we what her position be on the last budget and she have a phantom £ with no foundation as we go forward that be exactly the mess that they cause and they have not change bit meanwhile we be fix their mess extra nhs appointment interest rate cut and growth and wage be up that be the change a labour government make 
 as palestinians try to rebuild their life amid the rubble of gaza last night once again dozen of innocent people be kill by israeli airstrike what will the uk do along with our international partner to hold the israeli the netanyahu government to account for their action and what more can we do to ensure that aid get in as the israel defence forces block aid in breach of both the peace agreement and international law 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this point i be deeply concerned by the strike this underline the fragility of the ceasefire deal all side need to uphold president trump ’s peace plan it be the only route to long term peace for israelis and palestinians we be of course in close touch with the us and regional ally push for de escalation the scale of destruction in gaza be unimaginable the immediate priority remain get aid in at the speed and the volume need 
 we come to the leader of the liberal democrats 
 may i associate myself with what the prime minister say about jamaica and indeed all the island and country affect by hurricane melissa our thought and prayer be with they all 
 i be sure the whole house will also want to join i in pay tribute to prunella scales i suspect i be not the only member of the house with a fawlty towers dvd box set she will be greatly miss 
 across europe in country like poland germany and france we have see evidence of dangerous russian political interference last month the former leader of a major party in wales plead guilty to take bribe to make pro russian statement the evidence show that nathan gill be a close confidant of the current reform party leader for year do the prime minister agree with i that it be time we have an in depth investigation into russian meddling and money in british politic 
 i join in the right hon member ’s comment on prunella scales 
 on the question of russian interference it be a serious problem in country across europe include in our country where it be a constant threat for nato ally the conflict in ukraine and deal with russian aggression be the no issue that be why i have to say the reform party would be an absolute disaster for our defence we be a trusted member of nato we would not be a trusted member if we be putin friendly we be lead the coalition of the willing give security and comfort to other country that would collapse under reform because it be putin friendly and it would be a real threat to our defence and our security 
 i be grateful for the prime minister ’s reply and i agree with he on ukraine but i do hope he will look to have an investigation into this russian interference in our politic 
 last week i question how the prime minister can accept the damage of brexit while refuse to do anything meaningful about it the damage be clear with the financial times report that low productivity growth alone have blow a £ black hole in the public finance just part of the brexit black hole that the conservatives and reform will not apologise for last week he reject my plan for a new custom union so can i ask he what action he will take to change the brexit deal or be he just plan to complain about it 
 the right hon member must have overlook the fact that there be a uk eu summit early this year in which there be strand to the change that we have already agree in relation to the relationship with the eu include close trading relationship and close work on defence and security that be an iterative process that we will continue into next year but he be absolutely right about the botched deal of the last government and the damage that have do to our economy we be just see some of the figure come through in relation to that that be of the factor behind the way they crash the economy 
 football be a game base on fairness yet brilliant club that unite community every week like hartlepool be be hold back by a fundamental unfairness the 3up campaign back by national league club include hartlepool united and champion by hartlepool legend jeff stelling seek to grant a promotion place from the national league to league this simple change would be transformational for these historic   club many of which be over a century old while i accept arsenal may never directly benefit from such a change do the prime minister agree that this campaign to put football would help the new football regulator to protect club heritage ensure stability and put fairness and fan back at the heart of our game 
 can i start by wish hartlepool united the good for this season my hon friend will appreciate that the structure of the league be a matter for the league themselves but i commend his campaign and everything that he be put behind it i also pay tribute to the staff fan and player of sheffield wednesday at this difficult time we have deliver the independent football regulator to stand up for fan and to make sure that club have fit and proper owner the conservatives use to support that but now they   oppose it 
 the prime minister have a deep understanding of police in northern ireland and its importance he know about the ongoing national security threat and about the additional cost of deal with the legacy of our past he know that the police service of northern ireland have be underfunde and that the northern ireland executive have rightly bring forward a stability programme for it he also know that it be under strength in new decade new approach suggest that there should be police officer in northern ireland but today there be 
 do the prime minister know however that the treasury do not look favourably on a request to draw on the reserve for a data breach that cost £ do he recognise that in treasury term the incident be unforeseen unaffordable and unavoidable and therefore match the treasury ’s criterion to set aside that money in year would be of the psni ’s overall budget it be not affordable can i ask he to think about this issue again in engagement with the chancellor and to ensure that our police service of northern ireland and the national security threat that it face be not hamper by in year financial rule 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise this important issue which i know be of real concern to he i reassure he that i be in regular contact with chief constable jon boutcher and the psni on it as he would expect as he be aware we provide a record settlement of £ a year on average for the executive and we invest £ in additional security funding for the psni to help to address specific security challenge while it be for the executive to set the psni budget i reassure he that our commitment be to keep people safe in northern ireland 
 i be speak on behalf of my constituent shannon and tyler who lose their year old son hudson early this year worried about their son they call and be tell that he have gastroenteritis in fact hudson have a twisted bowel and after be rush to hospital a few day later he tragically die

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if she will make a statement on the action take to secure the elimination of hamas from gaza and the preservation of the ceasefire 
 the house will be aware of event over the past hour in rafah include report that israeli strike take place last night estimate of the death toll vary but the suggestion be that up to people in gaza have be kill we understand that these strike follow an attack yesterday afternoon where responsibility remain unclear 
 as the prime minister say early we echo the americans in call for urgent de escalation and for all party to keep the commitment they have make in the ceasefire agreement we be clear that hamas must release the body of all remain israeli hostage the immediate priority be to ensure the unrestricted flow of aid into gaza the israeli government must urgently lift restriction on aid enter and international non governmental organisation must be permit to operate in gaza to provide the scale of support that be need civilian can not wait 
 this government be work closely with our partner to do everything we can to support the transition from the ceasefire to phase of the peace plan this include the disarmament of hamas the deployment of a ceasefire monitor mission an international security force   and the implementation of transitional governance arrangement in gaza we be clear that there can be no role for hamas in the future governance of the strip in recent day the foreign secretary have speak to the un under secretary general for humanitarian affair and emergency relief co ordination tom fletcher the egyptian foreign minister and the israeli foreign minister about the importance of open more crossing and remove restriction on aid as i tell the house yesterday the foreign secretary and i will be head to the region shortly 
 on to   october i co hosted with the egyptian government and the palestinian authority the conference to look at how we can leverage sustainable support to gaza ’s reconstruction britain will continue to play our full part in support of the ceasefire and the wide peace initiative there be not a moment to lose to get relief at scale to those in need and to make progress on the pathway to a last peace 
 the situation in gaza be fragile we all want the ceasefire to hold and endure and for it to transition into a sustainable end to the conflict but that require the term of the ceasefire to be adhere to the scene of mask hamas gunman carry out summary execution be sicken their continued hoarding and disruption of aid to starve gazans be shocking their refusal to disarm be disturbing and their failure to return the body of the deceased hostage be distress the hostage and their family deserve the dignity of a proper burial their loved one have already be through   terrible pain and suffering no more coffin should be release with the wrong remain this be a disgusting game that have to end immediately 
 can the minister explain what pressure be be exert on hamas by the uk government to ensure that they comply with the full term of the agreement and release all the deceased hostage yesterday it be report that hamas gunman kill an israel defence forces soldier violate the ceasefire and lead to the target idf action in response what be the minister ’s assessment of the threat that hamas pose and what practical step be the uk take to support the disarming and elimination of hamas and the terrorist infrastructure in gaza 
 yesterday the secretary of state tell the house that 
 the uk have be propose different way in which we can help in the process of decommissioning and disarm hamas use expertise that we have build up over very many year ”—[official report   october vol c. 
 can the minister now say what britain ’s specific role be this be a unique situation regard hamas with terrorist infrastructure and threat fund by iran across the region what action be the government take to rebuild their relationship with israel give the important partnership that we have with israel 
 on aid what step be be take to increase get aid into gaza give the remark by the us secretary of state about the united nations relief and works agency and its role in gaza what discussion have take place with the us administration about unrwa ’s future and the implication for the uk follow the government ’s decision to give it million of pound despite know some of the risk 
 we track event in gaza incredibly carefully i do not intend to give the house a run commentary on each and every individual incident that take place the situation remain volatile and messy i hope not to disappoint hon member if i avoid give very specific answer on very specific incident structure be now be put in place include the civil military co ordination centre which play a role in seek to verify the fact on the ground where we can that work obviously take some time the uk be make a contribution to it but i do not wish to get ahead of that process from the dispatch box 
 what i will say be that we have be absolutely clear on the threat that hamas pose to palestinians israelis and the wide world that be why it be sanction as a terrorist organisation here we be take a range of measure with our partner to work through the very complicated but necessary step whether that be about transitional governance in gaza the security arrangement that need to follow the international security force or a whole range of other question i assure the shadow foreign secretary that we be deep in those discussion we have be have they over the last few day and we will have they in the region too this be an incredibly complex piece of work and we remain very focused   on it 
 just quickly on aid i would like to inform the house that there appear to have be quite a significant uprating of the aid go in particularly through kerem shalom which be welcome but the house will know of the centrality of the other crossing particularly rafah and the allenby bridge they be not yet fully open aid   can not therefore flow in the volume that we would wish to see we continue to work with all our partner to try to see they reopen 
 i welcome the statement from my hon friend it be fairly clear that the israeli government agree to the peace deal only because they feel they have to not because they necessarily want to after all this time we still have not get aid flow into gaza in the way we would all want to see what further action can the government take to put pressure on the israeli government to ensure that all the aid that be need actually get in and get in quickly 
 that be a vital question from my hon friend who follow these thing closely as i say in my last answer to get to the volume that we need we will need both rafah and the allenby bridge to be reopen it be welcome that there appear to be an increase of aid through kerem shalom both un aid and private truck it be vital that the palestinian private sector particularly in gaza can get good in restart the market and enable people to go about their normal life we will as he would expect continue to work with all our partner until we see the reopening of those crossing 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the ceasefire be a rare moment of hope despite the challenge ahead so we share the dismay that extremist on both side continue to look for opportunity to restart the war we feel the distress of the hostage family be torture by hamas cruelty and the grief of those whose family member woman and child die under idf bomb the fake recovery of body by hamas as evidence by the red cross be a cruel and despicable act yet we can also see that extremist in the netanyahu cabinet who have no interest in peace nor in the right of palestinian civilian be strain at the leash to retaliate it be this cycle of violence and suffering that we must break 
 what step have the government take to work with regional partner to force hamas to find and return the remain hostage body and to disarm give the importance of maintain president trump ’s interest and attention what conversation have the minister have with us counterpart to ensure that the white house do not lose focus on the prize of peace through a state solution 
 i can reassure the house that the british government remain in very regular contact at the high level with the american government on these question the american government as i think have be clear in recent day remain very focused on these issue which be to be welcome and support as the hon member say he raise important point about the recovery of body i can confirm that i have be in talk with many of my opposite number across the region most recently my qatari opposite yesterday as have the foreign secretary and we continue to make these point with force 
 i thank the minister for his answer to the urgent question he have do a great job over time update this chamber he have be terrific through this difficult period will he say more about the type of aid that he think our country need to send into gaza to support the people there 
 i thank my hon friend for his kind word there be area in which aid will be particularly vital of course there be the immediate need of the gazan people most recently at sharm el sheikh the prime minister announce a £ contribution to the humanitarian programme to meet those need which will be focus on water sanitation and health there be also a need for the sustainable reconstruction of gaza the message that we hear so often from palestinians be that they wish for their own company and private sector to be engage in that endeavour and do not simply wish to see the world bank or the united nations lead the charge they too want to take agency in those question that be reason we involve they so closely in the conference that i hold in october 
 once again it be the child of gaza who seem to bear the brunt of the violence with report that of they be liquidate overnight in the casual dropping of bomb in retaliation equally as shocking be the realisation that there will be absolutely no accountability whatsoever for those death likely no investigation into the targeting or intelligence use and no sense of any punishment for what be very obviously a significant crime ally to that be the fact that it have prove quite a handy distraction from the significant violence and brutality take place daily in the west bank give that we have now recognise palestine as a sovereign nation will there be any further measure to deter israeli aggression on palestinian soil 
 we have speak in this house on a number of occasion about event in the west bank and we have announce wave of sanction include at the most senior level against the israeli government i reassure the house that we remain very focused on settler violence we be move into the olive harvesting period which as the right hon member will know be a period in which violence be often particularly high regrettably we be see similar trend this year i will have more to say about that later in the day 
 in relation to the right hon member ’s point on individual incident i refer he to my previous comment it be important at such a delicate moment for the ceasefire that we be as precise as possible that be why the cmcc be engage in the way that it be 
 the international court of justice have call on israel to allow aid into gaza denounce its occupation of palestinian territory as unlawful and demand the removal of troop do the minister understand that as long as there be boot on the ground and uk arm be still sell to israel and unless palestinians be allow to determine their fate and be free of the violence that they continue to face they will not have the peace   that they need 
 i think my hon friend refer to the icj advisory opinion in relation to the occupied palestinian territories as the house will be aware there have be another advisory opinion from the icj more recently in relation to aid access gaza assume that she be ask about the former we have make significant decision since that advisory opinion not least on the recognition of the palestinian state i clarify once again for the house that no british weaponry be use either in gaza or in the west bank other than subject to the message relate to f-35s that we have discuss previously 
 the minister quite rightly say that hamas must disarm and that there can be no place for hamas in the future of gaza yet the white house appear to be license hamas to conduct internal security operation what conversation be he have with his us counterpart to reconcile the uk position which he clearly outline and that of the us 
 as the right hon member know disarmament be usually a process it take time and require serious and greatly complex technical work we want to ensure that gaza be free of hamas and that hamas be disarm that will take time and it be the work that we and the americans be engage in 
 both in gaza where grassroots peacebuilder will face the immense task of reconciliation and here at home where debate have become dangerously polarise the peace plan and the state solution remain the only credible path forward and we must all be absolutely clear in condemn hamas who have no place in the future governance of a free palestine and the atrocity that prime minister netanyahu ’s far right government continue to commit put simply wrong do not make a right i urge the minister to make a statement call for unity at this fractious time 
 there have obviously be innumerable wrong in the region in recent month it be important that we now continue the work move forward with the ceasefire into phase and see the wide peace plan fully implement 
 throughout these horrific year i have keep try to make the case for the innocent for the people who do not choose any of this and who be not responsible it be completely unacceptable that hamas have not release all the body and it be equally unacceptable that the israeli authority release palestinian body with just number what be the government do to help the palestinian authority to identify all the body that have be return in both israel and palestine so that family can grieve and the dead can have the dignity that they deserve 
 the hon member speak with personal experience real force and a long track record on these issue my heart go out to family on both side mortuary process be difficult at the good of time can only imagine the agony that they be face we be not aware of specific request for support in mortuary service but if they be any i be very happy to consider they 
 let we be clear peace can not exist under impunity week into the ceasefire israel have once again bomb gaza kill over palestinians include child as it continue its genocide our government have shamefully yet to reply more than a year and a half after the substantial ruling by the international court of justice which make it absolutely clear that any government who allow trade with israel ’s settlement economy be complicit in sustain the illegal occupation of the palestinian territory british company continue to trade in good and financial service with the settlement undermine our obligation under international law when will the government suspend the uk israel trade deal and end all trade link to the settlement or will the minister continue to sit back and allow this complicity 
 the hon member refer to the icj advisory opinion i would not want the house to have the impression that the british government have do nothing at the centre of that advisory opinion be the question of the status of the occupied palestinian territories we have be clear subsequently in recognise the status of that territory 
 the hon member raise important question about the trade in good with settlement we do not accept trade with settlement on the same basis as trade with israel where british company be do so they be in breach of the trading arrangement and his majesty ’s revenue and customs will take an interest they must ensure that they know who they be trade with and in which territory if people in settlement wish to falsely label where the thing be produce it be difficult as a whole range of nation and state have find for other to determine 
 i know that the hon member follow these issue closely he will no doubt be interested in the effort of the irish government to try to pass exactly the kind of legislation that he be describe and in the very many difficulty that they have encounter in so do we be not in breach of our international obligation if he could point i to legislation that be in operation and do what he say i would be grateful to see it but i think this be of those question on which we must continue to work with our partner to ensure that the status of the occupied palestinian territories part of the palestinian state be understand by all 
 do the minister agree that on top of the absolute imperative of hamas release the remain hostage body and not only completely disarm but be remove from all governance in gaza there must be a widespread deradicalisation programme to undo the damage do by innocent child in gaza be teach in their textbook some of which be fund through the unrwa an uncomfortable truth to hate israel and jews that deradicalisation must happen too 
 much work have be do in recent month include under this government in relation to the curriculum in gaza and i be aware of the concern that have be raise the funding to unrwa that we have provide which the shadow foreign secretary refer to include specific provision for ensure that all reform identify in the colonna report include on curricula be follow through and we continue to engage with unrwa on those question 
 my colleague have already ask about the current horror in gaza so i will pivot to the long term before this crisis we see decade of illegal settlement on palestinian territory so i welcome the government ’s sanction on extremist settler and israeli ministers i do not want we to lose sight of that issue so will the minister consider what further step he can take include trade restriction to combat illegal settlement 
 my hon friend be absolutely right there have be a significant increase in settlement and in violence associate with those settlement this be a continued problem and we will continue to work at it alongside our partner to try to see that terrible trend reverse 
 i get the impression that the minister share my despair at what feel like constant impediment to real progress that be be put in place by the impunity of both hamas and of benjamin netanyahu ’s genocidal regime the united states of america have indicate that israel ’s response last night be proportionate and it back the action i be curious be that view share by his majesty ’s government 
 for the reason i give early i be reluctant to be draw into a day by day commentary on the action of both side what be key be that we keep the ceasefire go and that be what the americans have be clear be still in place this be go to be difficult the event of the last hour have be difficult and i be sure that we will have far difficult day ahead this be not a straightforward path and if the right hon gentleman do not mind i will not be draw on an individual instance today 
 it be now day since   october and there be still hostage family who can not grieve for a love and still people starve in gaza because there be not enough aid and now we be see the west bank deteriorate in the last hour vice president vance have argue that skirmish be somehow inevitable with the great will in the world the death of child and possibly more be not a skirmish if the international community can do anything it be to be involve in the detail of ensure that the ceasefire hold if the minister will not tell we what the government ’s response be will he at least say what possible justification the israelis have give for the late incident 
 i do not wish to spend too much time at the dispatch box repeat the statement of other i be sure that my hon friend who follow this issue closely will have see what the israeli government provide as justification the statement from hamas deny that they be involve in the shooting in rafah and the considerable uncertainty that have surround some of those event the key question for the british government be whether or not we think the ceasefire can hold and whether we think we can make all the progress that my hon friend describe on reopen the aid crossing disarm hamas and transitional governance arrangement i be not for take away from the gravity of these incident life have be lose child have be kill but the role   that stand before the british government at the moment be to ensure that the ceasefire do not break down that do not mean that we do not get into the detail we have a major general in the civil military co ordination centre who be part of the effort to ensure that when violence and threat to the ceasefire occur we understand the who and the why but i will not give a running commentary from the dispatch box until we be in a position to do so 
 the minister have already acknowledge that it be olive harvest season in the west bank a harvest that support approximately farming palestinians yet we have see more than attack by settler against those farmer how be the government hold the israeli government to account to stop those settler act with impunity 
 as the hon member rightly identify this be a period of particular danger we have repeatedly condemn the increase in violence that be associate with settlement and we have make sanction against that we will continue to make those point strongly in this harvest season as we do during the last 
 all members have be appal by the scene that emerge from gaza in the wake of the ceasefire show hamas execute people in the street as they seek to reassert control over the area do the minister agree that such scene simply reinforce that hamas be nothing but terrorist and murderer and that they must have nothing to do with the future governance of palestine 
 i agree with my hon friend the scene we have see which the shadow foreign secretary refer to be chill hamas be terrorist and they can have no role the work to remove and disarm they will not be easy but it be the vital and necessary next step 
 yesterday it emerge that hamas do know where the body of the remain hostage be as video evidence emerge of they play game with body remove it from a building bury it then bring along the international red cross and pretend that they have find it and dig it up do the minister and the government condemn that and what more can they do with our international ally and the gulf nation to put pressure and leverage on hamas to return all the remain body immediately 
 the hon member be right hamas must return all the body immediately we have make that point to our regional partner with force and we will continue to do so 
 the war crime carry out by israel last night include the killing of child be a continuation of the horror that we have see over the last year visit on the people of palestine by a state lead by prime minister netanyahu who be currently want for war crime the government rightly bring wide range sanction on russia for its unlawful invasion of ukraine and its war crime but be it the truth that unless there be real consequence for netanyahu and israel for these war crime they will carry on a lack of action and sanction be give the   green light and treat they with kid glove so be now the time for extensive widespread sanction on israel why be israel treat differently from russia and why be netanyahu treat differently from putin 
 we have discuss sanction in this house many time include the wave during my time in government and include against ministers the priority now have to be to make the ceasefire work to move to phase and to get through all these incredibly important and complex question and that be the focus of this government 
 over the past decade there have be a stark absence of diplomatic effort to address the core issue of the conflict and the continued advocacy for a state solution civil society organisation have play a vital role during this time in enter that chasm will the minister outline how the government be provide help to those organisation for example will it be through the recently announce international fund for israeli palestinian peace 
 we remain focused on support the whole range of civil society the hon member will be aware of some of the proposal in the knesset which we have oppose and to which i refer in my opening remark we will continue to conduct that work and will have more to say about the fund she refer to in the come day and week 
 the ceasefire have be of the few positive achievement in what have be an unending tale of misery violence and horrific suffering and all those involve in achieve that ceasefire deserve the gratitude and recognition that have be receive now as israel continue to kill gazan child and hamas refuse to disarm will the minister reassure we that everyone involve in achieve a ceasefire in the us the uk and the middle east be equally concentrated and focus on keep the peace and make the ceasefire work as a beginning of a peace process can he far reassure we give our recognition of palestine that the palestinian voice will be hear 
 i reassure the house that i be absolutely certain that everyone in the uk who be work on this be focus on ensure that the ceasefire stick in the way that my hon friend describe indeed i can tell from our many contact with the american system that they remain similarly focused they want this ceasefire to stick and they be work to try to ensure that it do 
 will the minister give assurance to the house that this government be utterly commit along with our international ally to eradicate hamas ’s terrorist infrastructure and that they will not cease until hamas have be fully dismantle and obliterate and the remain of those hostage murder in captivity have be return 
 as i say to   the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice we be commit to ensure that those body be return and that hamas   be disarm the infrastructure of hamas be not just heavy weapon and small weapon as have be the case in other conflict there be also a network of tunnel under gaza that have pose a very significant threat to israel dismantle they be a difficult and complex engineering and military task but it need to be include as part of the process 
 i strongly welcome the minister ’s commitment to work to support chevening scholar to leave gaza particularly the decision to extend that support to student with full scholarship will the minister update the house on the late step that the government have take to support gazan student who wish to study in the uk particularly those i have be argue about who have dependant who they understandably do not wish to leave in gaza 
 if you will permit i madam deputy speaker i will say a little bit about the wide evacuation operation evacuation have continue include on monday and tuesday this week both for student who my hon friend have be so doughty in pursue and for highly medically vulnerable child who can benefit from uk support that work continue and i have be work alongside the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend   the member for glasgow south west dr ahmed we have be able to help many people to get to the uk to transform their life by get vital medical assistance and educational opportunity which i hope will allow all of they to make a real contribution to the future of palestine 
 the operation to get people in and out of gaza have be incredibly complex not least give the most recent closure i be afraid that there be very strict limit on how many dependant anyone can bring out we have make an update to our policy in relation to student who be fully fund which say that we can support a very small number of dependant to leave i know that many hon member with an interest in this have engage with i directly and i reiterate that these operation remain incredibly complex i be happy to talk to all hon member who have an interest but there be neither infinite capacity in the uk to support people nor even with our partner unlimited capacity to get people out we have make an announcement and i pay tribute to the work of my hon friend and many other across the house but i wish to keep people ’s expectation suitably focus on the very many constraint that remain on these operation 
 renew violence in gaza continue against a backdrop of unimaginable human suffering million remain in desperate need of food water and medical supply yet aid convoy continue to face unacceptable obstacle the un report yesterday that many of the aid truck that enter kerem shalom be limit by congestion on coastal road in part because of damage to that aid route mean that they be force to limit their supply of aid far below what be agree as yet aid route be not fully open but gazans can not wait any long aid restriction should never have be there in the place what specific pressure be the government exert on prime minister netanyahu and the israeli authority to get the route fully open and the aid in 
 the hon member ask an important question as i say early it be welcome that there have be an increase in kerem shalom but there be congestion too the un the private sector and a number of donor who be not use the un be all try to get aid through kerem shalom so the congestion that she describe be perhaps to be expect it be vital that other route include the allenby bridge with jordan and the rafah crossing which have already be the subject of much discussion reopen too we be work with our partner on these question we want to see progress soon i would like to see it in day but this have prove to be more complex than i have hop and talk be ongoing 
 i place on record my thank to the minister for his tireless work on the issue in the middle east the devastation continue for palestinian people live in gaza whether from the murderous intent of hamas or from further strike from israel which reportedly kill people include child overnight alongside that gaza ’s healthcare system have be decimate and it be always woman and girl who end up be the bad victim in such circumstance do the minister agree and will he update the house on how further aid can be direct to support woman and girl in particular and to rebuild healthcare system in gaza 
 these be vital question from my hon friend who i know have remain very focused on the issue the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend the member for glasgow south west who have kindly join i on the front bench and i remain focused on the issue as access to gaza become easy as we all hope that it do among the most urgent action be ensure that medical supply personnel and infrastructure be in place to meet the very significant need of gazan people we will continue to work closely on that 
 every day since the ceasefire take place at least palestinians in gaza have be kill by the idf there have be numerous other breach of the ceasefire and continue military activity in the west bank will the minister assure the house that britain no long fly raf aeroplane over gaza no long co operate with israel on its security arrangement and no long supply any weapon to israel because of its frequent breach of the ceasefire and its continued abuse of the people of gaza and the west bank 
 i have set out our arrangement in relation to arm and the very significant suspension that we make from the dispatch box a number of time they remain in place the right hon member ask about raf flight i think he refer to the raf flight that be attempt to find hostage in gaza those flight have stop the hostage have be release so there be no further function for those flight and they have end 
 crucial factor in achieve the current ceasefire be the unprecedented declaration at the end of july by all member of the arab league call on hamas to release the hostage lie down their arm and give up power in gaza that be   hugely important in show hamas that they have run out of road what role do the uk and our partner have in influence that declaration do the minister agree that our strong diplomatic relation lead by our excellent diplomat have a positive impact 
 i associate myself very much with my hon friend ’s comment he know that neck of the wood well our diplomat be excellent i be pleased to be in new york in july when the declaration he describe be make it be part of a declaration that include our own commitment in relation to the palestinian state which lead to our recognition in september 
 we all hope desperately for a just peace in gaza i serve alongside the minister as a diplomat in the middle east and as a soldier give that i particularly welcome the propose international security force but it be essential that such a force include troop from arab country and possibly from western country too in order to reassure the israelis and that it be there for the long term and ready to take casualty will the minister update the house on what progress there have be on the composition and the mandate of the potential force 
 my friend the hon and gallant member be right to focus on some of these practical question he like i serve in country where peacekeeping force be unable to keep the peace and unwilling to take casualty and be therefore unable to fulfil their mandate these be some of the most central and most delicate question around the isf i hope he will forgive i for not give a detailed commentary at this time but i expect to return to the house to provide more detail when i be able 
 there have be recent press report that the israeli government have be arm faction within gaza in order to destabilise hamas can the minister comment on any of those report what be the position of the british government on that 
 as i say early i will not provide extensive commentary on report but clearly safety and security for gazans will involve palestinian authority able to ensure law and order those who have be live in gaza have suffer terribly there have be widespread looting and violence i be sure many will pore over the question of who those faction and criminal be and who be support they the key thing now be that security need to return to gaza and that security can not be provide by the mask hamas gunman that the shadow foreign secretary rightly refer to at the outset so that work continue 
 the minister have rightly emphasise the importance of secure the swift and urgent supply of aid to all those in need in gaza but he have also mention that some of the crossing remain disrupted or fully close what reason have be give for the continue delay in reopen all the crossing 
 there have be some public reporting of israeli concern about the allenby bridge particularly after the violence there rafah be a subject that we have discuss many time in this house and it remain an   absolutely critical artery it be true to say that in both the allenby crossing and rafah there will need to be agreement between both country i hope that agreement can be secure quickly that israel remove the restriction in place and that we see the free flow of aid through those crossing very shortly 
 i thank the minister for his statement and his focus on maintain the ceasefire i stand in solidarity with the many ordinary palestinians live under hamas and with the family in israel wait for their love one to be return but i can not conclude that what netanyahu have do in the last hour be proportionate in any way i continue to hope and pray for peace with peace will come the opportunity to rebuild gaza but i do not see how that can be do when israel hold so many people without charge particularly healthcare worker my constituent eman be really concerned about dr hussam abu safiya who be be hold do the minister agree it be really important that people particularly healthcare worker should not be hold without charge be he have negotiation with israel on their release 
 due process be incredibly important i have raise this specific case with the israeli authority it be important that adequate explanation be provide where people be detain particularly doctor who be provide vital lifesave work we will continue to take this matter up with the israelis
