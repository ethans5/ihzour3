the right hon member be right to raise that question we will ban china ’s economic engagement and make sure we strengthen our national security 
 the hon lady raise an important point we will be look at the system as a whole and at any legislation that need to be amend or bring in to achieve our vision for an inclusive mainstem education that not only provide education for all child regardless of their special educational need and disability but provide specialist place for those with the most complex need that can not be meet within mainstream education we know the evidence show that where those need be be meet within the inclusive mainstream education system the need for ehcp be significantly reduce 
 i thank the hon lady for raise the issue and bring it to the house she be absolutely right to draw attention to the national audit office report and its damn indictment of a system that have lose the confidence of family and be fail child with special educational need and disability she rightly call for the system to be reform that be what this government be absolutely focused on and determine to do 
 of the difference that we make on come into office be move the special educational need and disability remit within the school sector our vision be of mainstream inclusive education for all child who would benefit from it while have specialist school where we know that child with the most complex need can have those need meet that be not be deliver and for far too many family it be not the reality it be a reality that we urgently need to see not only to address the local authority deficit to which the hon lady rightly refer but to create well outcome for child 
 at the moment the system cost the treasury a significant amount the hon lady tempt i into anticipate next week ’s budget statement or make announcement ahead of it which she know i can not but she be right to identify that the system cost an increase amount but be not deliver the outcome that child deserve and family want 
 we be absolutely determined to reform the system we be work at pace all the change that we have make since come into office be to that end we have launch the curriculum and assessment review which will support a broad and inclusive education for all child we have make change to ofsted those change be continue at pace to ensure that the system take into account the whole school life and journey that include create an inclusive environment for child with special educational need 
 most of all we be determined to restore parent trust that in our education system if their child have special educational need they will be identify early    we know that early identification be key and support we be continue to support early language and speech intervention and to prioritise the roll out of special educational need training for the early year workforce to ensure that child ’s need can be identify at the early point we be expand our childcare system to ensure that more child can get into setting as early as possible so any need can be identify and so we can rebuild the public ’s trust that every child in our state sector will get the opportunity of a fantastic education regardless of any additional special educational need or disability 
 my hon friend highlight the fact that not only be the system create stress and fail far too many child and family but it be not create the outcome that we want to see for every child include those with special educational need and disability i will raise the important point she have make with my colleague in the department of health who have responsibility for apprenticeship 
 my hon friend can see just how keen i be to act on this issue he be right that taxpayer be pay the price for the conservative government allow waste and fraud to spiral out of control the chancellor of the exchequer recently take decisive action by appoint a new covid counter fraud commissioner to help we recover public money and ensure that this never happen again i be work closely with the public sector fraud authority to push every avenue to detect fraud from advanced artificial intelligence and analytic through to strengthen our enforcement power

 my constituent sharon moore have be a fierce campaigner for victim of the infected blood scandal and their family member after decade of government negligence sir brian langstaff be clear that the community of infected and affected people should be include to enact his inquiry recommendation however the previous government engage in little to no communication with patient or organisation such as the haemophilia society and the terrence higgins trust i be delighted that those recommendation be be enact today but could the minister please tell we how he will be work with the department of health and social care and his colleague in that department to make sure that people get the compensation they deserve 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s constituent sharon moore for all her campaigning as i have say to the house i have now give the instruction for interim payment to the estate of the deceased infect to open today and i expect the infected blood compensation authority to make its payment before the end of the year subject to the house ’s process i would hope that regulation for those who be affect the set of regulation will be complete by the end of march next year and i expect that payment to the affect to begin next year as well 
 i be very pleased to hear that the minister have open application for interim payment will he elaborate on how those payment may be access so that my constituent in erewash can get their hand on they as fast as possible

 i welcome the urgency with which this government have move this important issue forward especially now that we know there be a timescale for application be open will the minister update the house on when victim can expect to receive their final compensation payment 
 as i have indicate to the house i expect the infected blood compensation authority to make its payment before the end of the year and to start payment to the affected next year the government be move as quickly as they can to ensure that people receive the compensation that frankly be long overdue 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i warmly welcome the right hon gentleman ’s announcement on the £ interim payment to the estate of the deceased infected thereby maintain the momentum that be establish early this year and i thank he for his thorough statement to the house yesterday introduce the statutory instrument will he confirm that it be his intention to ramp up rapidly from the payout to the test case cohort of infect can he give the house as much detail as he can about when other in the infected cohort should expect to receive their payout 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for the constructive tone he have take throughout the debate under this government that continue the work we do when i be the shadow minister when we work together to try to deliver these payment as quickly as possible 
 the whole purpose of have the test cohort be to enable a range of different case to be consider by the infected blood compensation authority to give we the good possible opportunity to ramp up as quickly as possible that be why i expect the payment to be make before the end of this year i then expect payment to the affect to begin next year and i will ensure that regulation be place before this house to make sure those deadline be reach 
 what step he be take to ensure high ministerial standard in government 
 the behaviour of conservative ministers in their year in power party in downing street while people in the whole country sacrifice their freedom hand lucrative covid contract to friend and donor and fail to expel mps catch break the rule shatter trust in politic this new government be determined to restore trust in politic the prime minister have make it clear that he expect the high standard from those who have the privilege of serve in his government and he will soon be issue an update ministerial code alongside this we be take a range of other measure to restore confidence in government as a force for good 
 as a veterinary surgeon i be expect to maintain the high professional and behavioural standard at all time as be those in many other regulated profession such as doctor and teacher and if i fail to meet those standard i face the very real prospect of be strike off give the behaviour of previous ministers and even a prime minister do the minister agree that if we enshrine the ministerial code in law that would restore trust in politic and ensure that people who lie and break the rule face very real consequence 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question as the leader of the house have say 
 this new parliament offer a chance to turn the page after the sorry and sordid record of the last ”—[official report   july vol c. 
 that be why we will be issue a new robust ministerial code as we promise in our manifesto the house have establish a modernisation committee which will be task with drive up standard and address the culture of the house that sit alongside the work the cabinet office be do to improve standard and confidence in politic 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the opposition support the new government ’s aspiration for the high ministerial standard and we acknowledge the significant experience that the prime minister ’s former chief of staff can bring to her role as envoy to the nation and region why then in breach of cabinet office guidance have ministers not publish a word on her term of reference her new salary or her special adviser severance payment and be she correct in her understanding that she be at the top of the list of new peer 
 anything in relation to the former chief of staff will be announce in due course it be not right for i to comment on the term and condition of any individual 
 what step he plan to take to strengthen the union 
 what progress he have make on resetting relation with the devolved administration 
 this government be elect to deliver for people throughout the united kingdom and whatever political difference we have in different part of the uk the public expect we to work together for the common good that be why we hold the council of the nations and regions recently in edinburgh which be focus on investment and good job across the country 
 i be sure we all agree that local community know what be good for their own affair will the minister formalise the council of ministers so that the governments of scotland wales and northern ireland along with regional leader in england can meet regularly to shape their community 
 the idea be that the council of the nations and regions which meet in edinburgh the other week will meet twice a year however i believe that these relationship be about more than formal meeting it be important underneath the formality to establish as good and as normal a work relationship as we possibly can 
 this new labour government have already outline that they be go to invest in sector vital to the economy of dunfermline and dollar include renewable defence and engineering that investment can only fully deliver if there be alignment with the scottish government to deliver the pipeline of skill need for local people to fill those job which be an agenda that the snp have singularly fail to address in   year in power will the minister outline how this labour government will co ordinate with and press the snp to ensure that the opportunity of this investment be fully realise 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to stress investment investment be the theme of the meeting it be also the theme of the investment summit hold last week through that we be able to announce over £ of inward investment to the united kingdom this will benefit people in all part of the country my hon friend be right to say that to make the most of it we have to give people the skill to do the job this investment will bring 
 what step he be take to reform the house of lords 
 as be set out in our manifesto this government be commit to reform the house of lords our objective be to bring about a renew focus on active contribution within a small house of lords that well reflect the country it serve as an immediate step in reform the government have introduce legislation within our day to remove the right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords 
 it be extremely welcome that this house overwhelmingly support the house of lords hereditary peers bill the lords must be more reflective of society currently it be not reflective of society or of region like south yorkshire and sheffield do the minister agree that there should not be place in our parliament that be reserve purely for those from certain family as that only preserve the privilege of the aristocracy 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the conservative party seem to stand for few thing currently and it be astonishing that it decide that of they be hereditary privilege in the house of lords 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 last week ’s legislation be welcome and be support by the liberal democrats and we be glad of the government ’s suggestion that these be initial step ahead of broad reform will the minister outline a timeframe for when further legislation will be bring forward for democratic reform of our upper chamber and can he assure i that safeguard will be put in place to protect against cronyism with improved mechanism to review appointment to the other house 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her constructive approach to this matter clearly we want to see the current bill on the statute book as soon as possible we will then move on to the stage of our reform look carefully to build a consensus to have that small well value active house of lords that we all want to see provide more consider scrutiny of this house we will certainly consider she specific point about the appointment process 
 if he will take step to ensure that the uk government resilience framework help community mitigate against flood risk 
 in the aftermath of the flooding experience at the end of september and as the final figure of flooded property be confirm discussion be ongoing between the ministry of housing communities and local government and the department for business and trade about the activation of the flood recovery framework which be a core package of business and community recovery support there be stringent criterion for activation of the scheme by ministers and the current estimate of localise impact and a relatively low number of property flood in september be below the threshold for activation however the flood re insurance scheme a joint initiative between the uk government and the insurance industry be available to a wide range of eligible household in flood risk area 
 climate change mean that west dorset face a grow flood risk with increasingly frequent heavy rainfall flooding field make road impassable and turn village like stratton and maiden newton into island last year property in my hometown of bridport include a school and a vital healthcare centre be put at risk by flooding what step be the government take to ensure that the necessary funding and resource be available for flood prevention and emergency response in rural constituency like west dorset where large geographical area can create additional challenge 
 the department for environment food and rural affairs be the lead department for flooding in england and it stand up its emergency operation centre when a flood forecast or flood incident justifie that this include when flooding may exceed the capacity of local response network to manage the eoc work in tandem with government we have also set up the flood taskforce which be look at how we can deal with flooding in the future to make sure we can address issue like those in the hon gentleman ’s constituency 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility

 i very much share my hon friend ’s concern in fact the only economic policy we have have so far from the conservative leadership contest have be the suggestion that we reduce maternity pay that will do nothing for family nothing for mother and child and nothing for the good operation of our economy i hope they think twice about that suggestion

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for education if she will make a statement on support for child and young people with special educational need and disability 
 every child deserve the opportunity to achieve and thrive but at the moment far from every child be be give that chance today ’s report from the national audit office be sadly bang on the money the system have totally lose the confidence of family family and child with special educational need be be fail on every measure and even shadow ministers have admit that they should hang their head in shame at the failure to support they 
 our promise to family be that we be absolutely committed to regain parent confidence in the special educational need and disability system but that will be a huge and complex reform there be no magic wand and no quick fix so we continue to ask for patience as we work as quickly as we can to make the change that i know family be cry out for 
 there be light at the end of the tunnel today we have publish independently commission insight that suggest that if the system be extensively improve through early intervention and well resource in mainstream school the need of ten of thousand more child and young people could be meet without an education health and care plan and in a mainstream setting rather than a specialist placement that can pave the way for a sustainable system in which school cater for all child and special school cater only for those with the most complex need 
 our plan include strengthen accountability for mainstream setting to be inclusive for instance through ofsted and help the mainstream workforce to have send expertise it be clear that we need to work with the teacher parent child therapist and council who for so long have be try but have be set up to fail by a broken system this work form part of the government ’s opportunity mission which will break the unfair link between background and opportunity and will start by give every child include child with special educational need and disability the good start in life 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question 
 today ’s national audit office report confirm what parent carer child and young people across the country have be tell we for year that our system to support those with special educational need and disability be in crisis and on the brink the last conservative government ’s abject failure to tackle the systemic problem face send provision have be lay bare for all to see with half of child wait long than the statutory week for an education health and care plan with outcome not improve with special school over capacity and damningly with the department for education not know how much capacity be require to meet future need we be fail our most vulnerable child   shockingly of council be at risk of bankruptcy give the deficit that they be rack up in their high- need budget 
 this be a nationwide issue colleague on both side of the house have like i be inundate with casework from concerned and often desperate parent who just want to know that their child will receive the support they need without wait for month or year the report make clear the urgent need for whole system reform with join up thinking across local and national government the nhs and school 
 will the minister please give we a clear timeline for the full reform call for by the nao will she consider liberal democrat proposal for a new national body for send to support child with the most complex need to tackle the postcode lottery what step be she take to incentivise early intervention include training specialist for assessment and reduce the contribution that school have to make before they can apply for an ehcp what be she do to speed up the building of state special school give that local authority be spend a staggering £ on independent special school be she press the chancellor for an urgent cash injection in next week ’s budget so that we can start clean up this mess 
 i thank the hon lady for raise the issue and bring it to the house she be absolutely right to draw attention to the national audit office report and its damn indictment of a system that have lose the confidence of family and be fail child with special educational need and disability she rightly call for the system to be reform that be what this government be absolutely focused on and determine to do 
 of the difference that we make on come into office be move the special educational need and disability remit within the school sector.[official report   november vol c. 1wc correction our vision be of mainstream inclusive education for all child who would benefit from it while have specialist school where we know that child with the most complex need can have those need meet that be not be deliver and for far too many family it be not the reality it be a reality that we urgently need to see not only to address the local authority deficit to which the hon lady rightly refer but to create well outcome for child 
 at the moment the system cost the treasury a significant amount the hon lady tempt i into anticipate next week ’s budget statement or make announcement ahead of it which she know i can not but she be right to identify that the system cost an increase amount but be not deliver the outcome that child deserve and family want 
 we be absolutely determined to reform the system we be work at pace all the change that we have make since come into office be to that end we have launch the curriculum and assessment review which will support a broad and inclusive education for all child we have make change to ofsted those change be continue at pace to ensure that the system take into account the whole school life and journey that include create an inclusive environment for child with special educational need 
 most of all we be determined to restore parent trust that in our education system if their child have special educational need they will be identify early   we know that early identification be key and support   we be continue to support early language and speech intervention and to prioritise the roll out of special educational need training for the early year workforce to ensure that child ’s need can be identify at the early point we be expand our childcare system to ensure that more child can get into setting as early as possible so any need can be identify and so we can rebuild the public ’s trust that every child in our state sector will get the opportunity of a fantastic education regardless of any additional special educational need or disability 
 i call the chair of the select committee on education 
 the national audit office report could not be clear child and young people and their family be be fail by a send system that can not meet their need and local authority be be drive to the edge of a financial precipice by a £ funding gap this government have inherit an appalling legacy the government be clear that their focus be on the early identification of need and the inclusivity of mainstream school but the report note that there be currently no process or funding to support early identification and no specific funding or ofsted measure on send support or inclusivity can the minister say more about how the government will provide the resource and the lever of accountability to address the scale of the crisis 
 order can member please all look to the chair you be speak to i not the minister look to the chair so i can hear and then i can help minister you can be a good example for everybody 
 i welcome my hon friend to her position as chair of the education committee which i know will undertake vital work scrutinise the government ’s approach on this issue and on many other 
 we know that wide change be need which be why we have start to make improvement as quickly as possible the change that i outline to   the hon member for twickenham munira wilson   amount to a whole system change to ensure that the inclusive mainstream education that the national audit office have identify will provide the education that many child deserve but be not currently receive however it will take time and we will not be make promise that we can not keep there be some thing that we can move on very quickly but there be other that will take time to show the change that the nao report highlight as be desperately need will take time so we ask for patience while we make these incredibly urgent change 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be grateful to   the hon member for twickenham munira wilson   for secure this urgent question 
 the opposition welcome the nao report every hon member will regularly be deal with constituent send case the grow demand be why we put major increase in funding in place to ensure that child get the support they need the last government work with the sector on comprehensive reform but since the election we have hear very little from this government   about their plan for reform we look for more clarity and we certainly support great inclusivity with too much variation in the system and parent often have to battle for support do the government plan to continue with the conservatives national standard and bring forward a standardised approach to ehcp 
 more than pupil with special educational need be educate at independent school without ehcp how do the minister think hit those pupil with a education tax with more pupil move into the state sector as a result will help pressure on school what assessment have she make of the increase in ehcp application that that will generate put further burden on local authority can she confirm that the axe that the education secretary be hold above free school do not apply to free special school finally council budget be under huge pressure so be the minister make the argument to the treasury to extend the statutory override beyond march or not 
 as i have say of the act of the education secretary be to reorganise the department to make sure that the send team sit within our school team and be not separate from it that speak to the vision that we have for reform a vision for our whole education system to create the inclusive mainstream education that we know will provide the good opportunity for the maximum number of child and as far as possible keep child with special educational need and disability within the mainstream system with their friend that be why we have launch the curriculum assessment review 
 we need to look closely at the key challenge to attainment for young people and the barrier hold they back from access the current mainstream education system we be work with ofsted to introduce report card to look at how inclusion can be reflect as part of how school be monitor by ofsted we be also increase training for early year provider we have extend the nuffield early language intervention programme to make sure that no child ’s need be miss out and that every child can find their voice we have be very clear full reform will take time but nothing be off the table to make sure that every child with send can achieve and thrive in mainstream school we have also start legislative change the child ’s wellbee bill will be introduce in the come month 
 the shadow minister make a point about private school end tax break on private school will help to raise the revenue to fund our educational priority for next year include recruit new teacher as he know the treasury be consult on plan to enable those change to come into force in january and on how to design those plan to make sure that no child with special educational need on an education health and care plan will be adversely affect 
 on the question of free school the review announce this week relate only to mainstream free school we be start a process with local authority and trust with the mainstream school that be in scope with a strong focus on assess that need to make sure that school place be in the local area where they should be and that they align with our vision for mainstream inclusive education for every child who need it 
 nearly of child in hackney have an ehcp and that be not account for other who have special educational need with school close we have an opportunity to create alternative provision the other week poor headteacher tell i that more than a of her reception class have special educational need most of which be not identify before the child start school clearly there be a need for a different vision will my hon friend meet i and people from hackney or even visit hackney to see what we can do with spare school space to motor this change forward in hackney fast than be possible nationally 
 i thank my hon friend for her question she rightly identify the need to ensure that we have the right school place for child whose need be currently not be meet in the most productive way possible we be open to meet hon member to discuss where in their constituency this can well be achieve i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss this far 
 cambridgeshire county council be fail to meet the condition of the dedicated school grant safety valve agreement with only of ehcp be grant within the week timeframe the average in england be family in my constituency face huge challenge in ensure that their child ’s education be not disrupt or negatively impact how do the government plan to address these unacceptable delay 
 the hon member be right to identify those challenge in its analysis publish today the national audit office say that the current system be not work and not serve the need of child and their family in the way that it should we be move at pace to review the system in a wholesale way and the change that i have outline will support that in addition we will legislate to ensure that local authority can plan properly for place and admission in their area we want every state school regardless of how they be establish to co operate in ensure that place be there for the child who need they i have outline a whole range of change that will seek to address the problem that he mention 
 i be in no doubt that the labour government have a terrible inheritance on send provision but child in my constituency of easington who rely on service provide by the tees esk and wear valleys nhs foundation trust face unreasonably long waiting time incredibly they have to wait up to year for assessment for autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other related condition what step be the minister take to reduce those unacceptably long waiting list and support both child and their family during these lengthy wait for assessment 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i reiterate that the government have inherit a terrible legacy not only on special educational need and disability but on our public spending and the state of our public service overall the example he raise be good as it highlight the importance of work   across government to resolve issue and help the family who need support whether that be do through the education system which my department be responsible for or through the health service we need to work collaboratively across government to address the huge backlog that far too many people face in get the support that they need i can assure he that that be a priority for we 
 in the past week i have meet family whose child be suicidal of whom be year old the other be commit to a secure unit for most of the cause of their suicidal thought be their educational need not be meet by the education system neither of those child have ehcp conservative control west sussex county council be complete only of ehcp within week block be the lack of educational psychologist do the minister agree that increase the supply of educational psychologist be essential 
 i be so sorry to hear about the case the hon lady raise she highlight very well the huge challenge that we face in address need in ensure that we have not only the inclusive mainstream education system that every child should feel they belong in and that provide the education they need but the mental health support that we know be sadly lack the waiting list be too long for far too many child and family we be prioritise investment to ensure mental health support and educational psychologist be available in school because we know how important it be to get the right support in place to help the family and individual affect and to enable school to address these need 
 after today ’s shocking report do the minister agree with i that we need to rebuild the send system from the ground up 
 my hon friend be absolutely right this change need to be deliver in conjunction with teacher family council educational psychologist and the health sector we need to work together to ensure support be available at every stage the system need reform and significant change we can not carry on as we be with this lose lose lose system which be let down far too many family 
 be the government surge support to local authority to help they process and complete ehcp within the statutory timeframe my community be see a significant increase in application because of the decision to impose vat on independent school i have send schools—[interruption government members may shout but that be the reality my council face i be ask for urgent support for those council that have to deal with these increase number 
 we have be clear about our manifesto commitment and our approach in government our priority be to ensure that we have the investment in our school that we need in order to ensure that every child have the teaching and the school experience that they deserve we know that council be face significant   challenge processing application and deliver for child with special educational need after year of a system that have let down family and child and which the former secretary of state for education herself describe as lose lose lose this be the legacy we be deal with and the mess we be clear up but we be determined to do that for family and child who we know deserve well 
 sadly today ’s report confirm what many parent in my constituency of leeds south west and morley have be tell i since long before the election the send system in this country be fail as a secondary school math teacher i know all too well that send provision be not up to scratch i have see at hand that after year of negligence by the conservative party parent and child have lose hope of ever see an improvement in the system follow the send crisis do the minister agree that although there be no silver bullet we must improve the send system and give people hope that it will improve 
 order this urgent question will run until about am so if i be to get everyone in we will have to speed up the question and answer i want to take as many question as possible as this be a very important subject to all of we 
 thank you mr speaker it be understandable that a huge number of hon member want to ask question on this subject we have inherit an appalling legacy of failure on this front we have prioritise the issue and we be determined to fix it but that will take time as hon member have recognise but we be move at pace to fix the broken system 
 parent and teacher in north herefordshire tell i how concerned they be that special educational need funding have stagnate for the last year while need have increase i visit westfield school in my constituency which be in desperate need of capital investment it be allocate funding under the school rebuilding programme but the implementation of that programme have be very slow can the minister assure i that she remain committed to the programme that it be on track and that she will amend the way that the funding system work to incentivise mainstream inclusion 
 on the hon lady ’s final question i can assure she that we be determined to prioritise mainstream inclusion and to ensure that school be support we will have the framework in place to encourage incentivise and support school to do what we know will create the good outcome for the vast majority of child in this country inclusion in a mainstream system where they can thrive 
 give today ’s report and the shocking and devastating impact that the reality have on child young people and their family what message do the minister have for the child and young people with send and their family in portsmouth north 
 we recognise how challenging this situation be for family who be not get the support they need for special education need or disability   we know that the system be break the national audit office report lay it out bare we be determined to fix this that be the message that i want to send 
 within month of enter office this government will introduce vat on independent school with all the impact that may have on the state sector how long will we have to wait for an actual plan for send child rather than just political posturing around vat 
 the change that we have set out and be determined to make all aim to improve the situation that we have inherit after year of neglect and decline under the previous government i have set out at length all the change that we seek to make through legislation and the change we have already make to our education system to ensure an inclusive mainstream and high and rise standard and opportunity for all 
 today ’s report be damn but not surprising it be an indictment of the former government and their year of failure even today they shamelessly deflect and gaslight the very family whom they have fail independent send provision be grow in southampton itchen and across the country those place be need but council be leave at the mercy of market price and often when it come to residential care venture capitalist that be wrong do the minister agree that as part of whole system reform we must return to basic and that profiteer from send be the wrong approach will she meet i and my constituent to hear what they want from this whole system reform 
 my hon friend raise an important challenge that we be determined to address we want mainstream inclusive education in our state school system which every child should have access to and thrive in however we need specialist place for child with complex need when that be the only place where their need can be meet and a system that not only well serve the need of child but be sustainable i will take away his comment and that will be part of our thinking as we go ahead 
 other members have ask about educational psychologist there be a real shortage right now be the government consider enable other professional to undertake some of the assessment to help unblock the waiting list 
 i thank the hon lady for the constructive way in which she put her question i will take it away and consider how it would fit into our broad plan to ensure that we have an education system that can meet the need of child in term of both their educational requirement and their mental health special educational need and disability requirement within a broad health system that can meet those need as well 
 far too many family in my constituency have come to i in tear not just at the lack of support for their child with send but at a system that seem set up to stop they   get that support how many appeal be successful because they should have get through the time around people feel they be be let down by the system so will the minister please ensure that our reform system will not make family have to fight to get the support that their child so desperately need 
 my hon friend be right the system be let down family and child and create a situation where not only be educational outcome impact by the poor response but too many family life be affect by try to deal with the system that be why we be determined to reform it the evidence show very clearly that inclusive mainstream school that meet demand will reduce the need for education health and care plan and the need for family to go through the process in the place 
 what additional resource will the government provide to worcestershire county council give what will undoubtedly be the profound and devastating impact of the government ’s education tax 
 the change that we be look to make to remove the exemption for private school will be use to fund more teacher in our state sector and create the inclusive mainstream education that we know every child deserve 
 send provision in conservative run norfolk have collapse after year of adversarial mismanagement by the county council i welcome the step that my hon friend have take so far will she commit to recognise the value of co production to ensure that send family voice be value and money be spend wisely 
 we be very clear that this reform be a journey that we want to go on with all those who support our child and family whether that be teacher school staff more broadly education professional health professional or local authority everybody want this to work well and we need to work together to achieve it 
 datum for autumn and spring show that more than a of child with an ehc plan be persistently absent more than double the rate for pupil without identify send persistent absence be a very complex issue and a multi faceted approach be need to tackle the problem in the light of this damn report from the national audit office do the minister agree that we can not have parent face prosecution for the failing of the system how will she work across government to ensure that parent of child with send can be sure that their child will get the support that they need to attend school safely and receive the education that they deserve 
 the government have inherit an absence epidemic in this country last year in child be persistently absent from school miss a day every fortnight or more we know that strong   foundation be root in attendance at school child can not receive an outstanding education that unlock opportunity if they be not in school i recognise the challenge that the hon lady have set out it be important that we work together to create an inclusive mainstream education system that every child want to attend and feel they belong to so that those opportunity be unlocked for they as they should be for every child in this country 
 i thank the minister for her statement on this damn report on send last week the minister and the secretary of state visit my constituency we go to mount pleasant primary a shin example of inclusive mainstream send provision in the state sector do the minister agree with i and the teacher there that child with physical condition and disability could be refer for an ehcp by their gp much early so that they arrive at school with everything they need in place ready to excel in their education 
 the visit to that school in my hon friend ’s constituency be wonderful the school be of many example of the provision of inclusive mainstream education we need such provision to be in school in every community and available to every child she rightly recognise the challenge of co ordinating between health service and education provision and the vital importance of those system work together to achieve outcome for child i will certainly take away her specific suggestion and share it with my colleague in the department for health and social care 
 parent in my constituency be not interested in what the minister think about the conservative party they may recall that ehcp be introduce under the coalition government they want we to work together to make thing well we all know that a problem with ehcp have lead to a tripling of cost for county council in the westminster hall debate that the minister take part in with i recently she be much more constructive than she be be today and i would like to believe that that be the approach that she want to take to these issue do she have a timescale for the reform of ehcp 
 i appreciate the hon gentleman ’s comment and i will always work cross party with colleague to achieve the good for all child in this country but level the blame for the current situation at a government only month old can not be accept the inheritance that we have take on can not be underestimate we will continue to work on put right what have be fail for the past year and the department for education be move at pace on work to that end we will make specific suggestion for legislative change and for any other necessary systemic change in due course 
 many concerned parent write to i at the start of term because they have finally be give a school place for their child with special educational need but have no transport to get their child to and from school will the minister reassure my constituent that we will take measure to   ensure that every child with special educational need have a reliable and safe mean of get to and from school 
 transport to school be the responsibility of the local authority and family need to work with their local authority to ensure that they be not disadvantaged in get their child to school by transport i appreciate that that be a challenge our transport system too be in crisis after year of conservative government but we will continue to work across government to ensure that all our public service meet the need of family in the interim my hon friend ’s constituent should work with the local authority to ensure that they get the transport they require for their child ’s educational need 
 zak be year old he be of dozen of child in my constituency who have be fail by the send system zak be traumatise by his experience in an inappropriate school setting cause his learning to regress and both his parent to stop work oxfordshire county council have an accumulate high need deficit of £ because of inadequate funding which have fail family such as zak ’s have the minister press the treasury to increase that funding and maintain the statutory override in next week ’s budget 
 the hon gentleman tempt i into commentary on next week ’s budget in which i can not indulge he 
 i speak both as a parent whose child be badly fail in send provision under the last government and as an mp whose surgery have be visit on every single occasion by a parent who be struggle not just to get an ehcp but to get from a school the flexibility that match their child ’s need i say respectfully to opposition member include the shadow secretary of state   the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds that until and unless you have walk in my shoe and the shoe of your constituent you should show a little humility and decorum in how you respond on this issue in the review will the minister encourage school to be more flexible in their send provision for child who need it 
 order i remind member that when they say you they mean i and i do not want responsibility 
 my hon friend speak with great passion and compassion on behalf of her constituent and i agree with everything that she say i reiterate that what she outline be the epitome of what we be seek to achieve on inclusive mainstream education so that it can meet the need of the vast majority of child with special educational need and disability in our country
