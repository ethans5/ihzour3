there be a deal by whatsapp that be never follow up by the treasury or ministers there be no meeting between astrazeneca and the conservative government their government let britain down every time which be why the country turn to labour and labour be deliver 
 far to that point of order madam deputy speaker why detain the house why do n’t i just apologise now and correct the record i be grateful to the hon member for alert i to that information i be happy to correct the record and i be happy to apologise to he for say what i say early i should also correct the thrust of my argument this morning which be that there be insouciance during the period between the march statement and the general election in july actually it be not insouciance it be just incompetence that mean they could not get the deal across the line 
 i be a dsit minister today but the debate feel remarkably like the creative industry debate a couple of week ago when i be respond as the minister for creative industries arts and tourism i will get on to some of the point about ai and copyright later so if anybody want to intervene on i they can wait for that bit 
 i will start with some of the point hon member have make the measure on the nhs and datum be among the most positive in the bill and be welcome by everybody today it be not in the previous version of the bill it be of our addition the other day a colleague be tell i about her local hospital and i be strike by the fact that it employ people simply to carry around physical medical record we have put our back into change that that be not a good way to preserve record or to ensure they be secure and not get lose let alone anything else 
 my hon friend   the member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley   be absolutely right when he talk about patient passport we need to turn the issue on its head so that people have access to their datum and can participate in and make well decision about their own healthcare as i say to my hon friend yesterday that be similar to the change that happen a few year ago after an appointment consultant use to write to gp about the patient in doctor gobbledegook but now many of they write to the patient in plain english copy in the gp that be the kind of change we need to see 
 i be very hopeful about the change that will be introduce by the bill as my hon friend   the member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling   say they will make dramatic difference we need to ensure the interoperability of all the it system use across the whole of the nhs i would like to extend that beyond england and wales i would not mind if we could manage to do the same for scotland and northern ireland but i fear that even my friend   the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart who like i sometimes would baulk a little at a united kingdom wide approach to such matter 
 i be also excited about the element of the bill on smart datum which have barely have a look in in today ’s debate but which could be transformative in many sector many of we will know that when we use our   banking app we be enable to go not just to our bank but to our insurance include our car insurance and all those thing can be relate to another in a secure way that be because of the smart datum system that have be in existence for the last few year we need to roll that out in many other sector and that be precisely what the bill allow for instance in the gig economy it will mean that uber driver and those deliver for deliveroo will have a well understanding of whether they be actually earn a living from each delivery 
 thirdly nobody have refer to the reform of the information commissioner ’s office it be an important part of the bill there have be brief mention of the register of birth and death which basically bring the modern world to the register office as a former vicar i suppose i be more interested in that than most as i have hatch and dispatch quite a few in my time 
 that be the original point that i be try to make and i obviously do not make it as well as the hon member do so i congratulate he on that 
 the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed   be a bit critical of article but i think that he be be a bit unfair the requirement in subsection and and then later in and of the article be very clear about the circumstance and they be the only circumstance in which the secretary of state can bring forward change of the kind to which he refer i hope that we will be able to please he if not appease he if that matter appear in committee or on report 
 i just want to finish with some comment on ai and ip not least because there have be so much focus on this area all of we on the front bench want to have a data bill because we think that it be really important for our economy and for so many different aspect of the way that we deliver government service we also want a debate about ai and copyright which be why we launch the consultation but it feel odd to be do a bit of that in this bill 
 let i turn now to what the shadow secretary of state say early i ask chatgpt what the view of the shadow secretary of state be on ai and copyright it reply regard his view on copyright there be no publicly available information indicate that he have express specific opinion on this matter well yes we hear that this afternoon do n’t we i hope the opposition manage to find some idea at some point 
 this be a very serious matter and it be of the trickiest issue that any country have to face at this point i think that it be tricky for our country than most other because we be the large ai economy in the world and we be probably the or at bad the great ip country in the world we have creator in every single sphere some country specialise in particular form of the creative industry but we manage to do all of they that be why i be listen very attentively to the contribution from my hon friend the members for bury north mr frith and for stirling and strathallan chris kane and the hon member for perth and kinross shire and many other as well 
 i just want to focus on the thing on which there be some agreement i think there be agreement across the house on the idea that transparency be an important part of what we need to ensure in this legislation and on the aim of control over intellectual property right and on possibly end a strong version of right reservation for the creative industry i can announce that we have set up work group in the past week both of which have people from the creative industry and from the ai company in they be specifically look at transparency and what that look like to be effective and proportionate and it will start work on that next week 
 secondly on the question of right reservation i fully understand that people be sceptical about whether there be a simple technical mean of everybody be about to assert their right 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step his department be take to use technology to improve access to public service 
 i congratulate my hon friend on get on the order paper twice today it would be a good day for he to buy a lottery ticket i can assure he that the new digital centre exist to serve departments and the wide public sector the government digital service enable department to deliver digital public service that work for everyone 
 good public service be dependent on reliable and easily accessible and available underlying datum such as postal address however address datum be complex and expensive for uk business to access give the importance of that datum to public service delivery and economic growth will the minister commit to review the term under which uk address datum be make available to support growth 
 my hon friend raise an important point follow the privatisation of royal mail in the postcode address file the definitive list of uk postal address become a privately own datum asset he will know that this afternoon we have the reading of the data use and access bill which will be a great step forward for the use of datum in the public and private sector he will also know that we have commit to create a national datum library which will use datum in a radically new way for the benefit of the country and public sector user 
 i be sure that the secretary of state will agree that people want their public service deliver efficiently and effectively to that end what discussion have he and his department have with the department of government efficiency and elon musk in the united states about how we can harness the power of artificial intelligence to deliver well service and scrutinise government spending and dataset to eliminate waste and inefficiency 
 i think the right hon gentleman have be asleep at the wheel since the election not just when he be in government our government have bring in the regulatory innovation office which be now up and run and pilot area to get innovation through the regulatory landscape without delay our government have bring in the gov.uk app which will be deliver in june as well as the digital wallet and the digital drive licence and a suite of productivity service be already be deploy in the public sector his government do none of those thing we be do they now 
 i call the chair of the science innovation and technology committee 
 the government ’s determination to embrace ai to transform public service and pull through procurement opportunity for british business be very welcome but many public service user and other may have be concern by the government ’s failure to sign the paris ai summit declaration which seek to ensure that ai be open inclusive transparent ethical safe secure and trustworthy a government spokesperson say that there be concern about progress on global governance and national security will the secretary of state elaborate on that 
 i be grateful to my hon friend the chair of the select committee who raise an important point let we focus on what we do achieve in paris we sign this week the joint coalition for sustainable ai which be to be launch this summer we join the initial group of country and multilateral organisation kick off the collaborative network of ai observatory on work we co seal the statement on cyber security with france that also launch this week and we sign a statement on ai and gender as part of the global partnership for action on gender base online harassment and abuse a lot be achieve this week but we will always put the national interest the house will know full well that this government will always put national security an issue that we want to raise at the summit and which prevent we from sign the overall agreement 
 when it come to public service thing that bug i and bug our constituent be the difficulty of access gp appointment let alone have to call at half past in the morning what progress be be make in allow patient to book gp appointment online so that they be not force to wait on the phone every morning to see a doctor when they need an appointment right away 
 as always i be grateful for the exchange that the hon gentleman and i have in this house which be always constructive that issue be part of the legacy that we have inherit from the fail tory government of over year but i assure he that the data use and access bill which have its reading today will force different part of the nhs to finally start communicate with themselves and use interoperable datum in the interest of patient 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the secretary of state ’s plan to improve government service depend on the cloud in the light of the competition   and markets authority decision to assess whether amazon web services and microsoft should be designate as have strategic market status in cloud service provision what decision have he make regard the approach to current and future government procurement of cloud service 
 obviously i can not comment on the cma which be an independent regulator i can however say that this government via the ai opportunitie action plan have commit to fully invest in ai infrastructure so that we can have a sovereign ai infrastructure here with datum store here and process here create job and wealth in this country 
 what step his department be take to support innovation in livingston constituency 
 we have already spend £ on project in my hon friend ’s constituency include £ on silvibio ltd. i be very proud of the fact that we have be able to commit in to a record amount of money—£20.4 for research and development 
 i thank the minister for that answer in the livingston constituency we have a number of fantastic biotech and life science business such as valneva which be work on a range of vaccine include for malaria and as the minister mention silvibio which be work on sustainable alternative to peat give the failure and neglect of the conservative government and the snp scottish government in this regard what conversation be he have with the scottish government to ensure that we create an environment in which the biotech and life science industry can thrive in the livingston constituency and across scotland 
 livingston be a remarkable example of where investment can make a significant difference i be really pleased that the chief executive of silvibio recently receive a woman in innovation award for innovation in science my hon friend be absolutely right that innovation accelerator project in glasgow and across the whole of scotland need the integration between the westminster government and the holyrood government to be really successful but that be precisely what we be determined to do in october last year he also have another £ investment in livingston by merck make it of the big investor in scotland

 what step his department be take to make digital service easy to access for small business in the north east 
 no anywhere in the uk should have difficulty use government service and the government be commit to ensure that our online and digital service be as accessible as possible there be globally recognise standard for digital accessibility but they be only part of the design of an inclusive service which be why we will be revise the government service standard to incorporate requirement cover wide issue of inclusion and look at extend their scope into the wide public sector 
 recently i attend a roundtable of small business in the north east hold at sage and a key theme be the need for good connection and digital service to help their business to grow digital connectivity be of course critical but this often hold people back what be the government do to ensure that digital infrastructure be strong enough to support local business in constituency such as mine 
 it be right that not only do we need to have good online access to service but business need to be able to connect to those service and that be why the government be commit to deliver nationwide gigabit connectivity coverage by i be glad to say that over of premise in her constituency can access gigabit broadband include the business that she refer to but i be of course happy to meet she to talk about what more we can do in this important area

 i think that be link to the north east that be the subject 
 i absolutely agree with the hon member business across the country should be able to connect especially in this day and age if the business in her constituency continue to experience problem my hon friend the minister for data protection and telecoms will be happy to meet she to discuss this issue far 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson

 in my constituency of huntingdon i have site that form a key component of pre clinical animal testing labcorp where the testing take place and marshall bioresources where the beagle puppy be breed and then test on almost none survive the testing process while i do not support animal testing i recognise that it be currently a necessary element of the pre clinical testing process and can not be phase out until non animal method have sufficient scope the minister for science research and innovation write to i in september outline the government ’s approach to phase out animal testing but will the government publish a timeline of what test will be phase out via the work of the national centre for the replacement refinement and reduction of animals in research and when 
 i can not provide the hon gentleman with that timeline now we be work at pace try to put together a practicable policy and a strategy which as i say we will publish by the end of the year he make a perfectly good point about the complexity it will not be easy for the mhra to meet its international commitment and our manifesto commitment we be happy to work with the sector as well as with other departments to deliver this and i be happy to have a conversation with he if that would help

 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in the house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 i be proud to have play my part in help to draft what have become the employment rights bill a new poll show that quarter of the british public back the strong worker right in the bill include well sick pay yet that lot over there the tories and reform disgracefully vote against it in fact the leader of the opposition do not even believe in maternity pay or the living wage our statutory sick pay be rank as of the low in europe it need to be bring in line with the living wage will the prime minister back my campaign to strengthen the bill far so that sick pay be at a level that will finally stop punish worker for be sick 
 our plan for change deliver the big upgrade in worker right in a generation through our employment rights bill end exploitative hour contract and the scandal of fire and rehire and expand statutory sick pay to employee of course that be on top of the pay rise for of the low pay i would have think the leader of the opposition might support the protection of day employment right give where she be go but she think maternity pay be excessive our plan be pro worker and pro growth 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 the conservative government establish the ukraine family scheme in total more than ukrainians mostly woman child and the elderly have find sanctuary in the uk from putin ’s war however a family of from gaza have apply to live in britain use this scheme and a judge have now rule in their favour that be not what the scheme be design to do this decision be completely wrong and can not be allow to stand be the government plan to appeal on any point of law and if so which one 
 let i be clear i do not agree with the decision the leader of the opposition be right that it be the wrong decision she have not quite do her homework however because the decision in question be take under the last government accord to their legal framework however let i be clear it should be parliament that make the rule on immigration it should be the government who make the policy that be the principle the home secretary be already look at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case 
 the prime minister do not answer the question if he plan to appeal the appeal might be unsuccessful and the law will need to be change if he do not appeal the law will definitely need to be change he talk about a decision make under the previous government but it be not make by that government it be make by the court the issue we be discuss today be about judicial decision we can not be in a situation where we allow enormous number of people to exploit our law in this way there be million of people all around the world in terrible situation we can not help they all and we certainly can not bring they all here will the prime minister commit to bring forward that new legislation or amend his border bill 
 i have already say that the home secretary have already get her team work on close this loophole we do not need to wait for that we be get on with that because we be take control the conservatives lose control of immigration we have nearly people come into this country we have an open border experiment on monday this week they vote against increase power to deal with those who be run the vile trade of people smuggle same old tories open border empty promise 
 if the prime minister be on top of his brief perhaps he would be able to answer some question give this crazy decision and so many other new legislation be need to clarify the right to a family life in article interruption i be not talk about what he just say i know labour mp do not understand much of what they be say the prime minister literally write a book on the european convention on human right this be a situation where we need to put our national interest before the echr do he agree that we should legislate even if lawyer warn that that might be incompatible with human right law 
 the right hon lady complain about scripted answer her script do not allow she to listen to the answer hon member more she ask i if we be go to change the law and close the loophole in question i say yes she ask i again in question and i say yes she ask i again in question it be still yes 
 the right hon and learn gentleman do not listen to question i ask if he would appeal the decision he do not answer that he be not listen he be too busy defend the international human right law framework 
 this case have arise because a palestinian come to the uk from gaza in he be now a british citizen this be precisely why we need to break the conveyor belt from   arrive in the uk to acquire indefinite leave to remain and then a british passport and now a right to bring family member here as well just last week the prime minister bizarrely claim that a british passport be not a pull factor for those come to the uk will he now support our plan to toughen the process on indefinite leave to remain and make get a british passport a privilege not a right 
 the conservatives preside over record high level of immigration it reach nearly it be a nation experiment in open border the right hon lady be the cheerleader she be the campaigning for more people to come and thank her own side when they support her campaign so before she lecture we she need to reflect on her own record 
 the right hon and learn gentleman be the prime minister now the people out there want to know what he be go to do about the situation he need to spend less time whine about the last government and do his job 
 i think the prime minister and i agree that israel have a right to defend herself yet the judge in this case note that the family be face a humanitarian crisis 
 as a consequence of the israeli government ’s indiscriminate attempt to eliminate hamas 
 and government lawyer accept that be the prime minister allow lawyer to change the position on israel and be that because of advice from the attorney general if not why on earth do government lawyer accept the argument that israeli action be indiscriminate 
 government lawyer put the complete opposite argument the right hon lady talk about be on top of her brief she have no idea what she be talk about i will tell she again we need to change the law that be why the home secretary be already close the gap i know the script do not allow any adaptation but this be get tedious 
 the prime minister have not read the judgment i suggest that he do so very serious question be now be ask about the attorney general the prime minister ’s personal friend and donor even labour ministers be concern labour peer lord glasman have call he 
 the absolute archetype of an arrogant progressive fool 
 if we be serious about protect our border we need to make sure that we appoint people who believe in our country and everything we stand for it be not clear that the attorney general do 
 the government be now recruit a new chief inspector of border who live in finland and want to work from home this be not serious why should the british public put up with it 
 the individual in question be appoint in by the last government to a senior position he then work for year from finland we have change that and he will now be work from the united kingdom full time it be finland under they 
 the leader of the opposition talk about the attorney general she sit round the cabinet table with an attorney general who be later sack for breach national security 
 long stand trader in the cps centre in culcheth be devastate to receive eviction notice give they just day to vacate the premise entirely out of the blue and on spurious pretext from the new owner the shell company shivat haminim capital so far the owner and its legal representative have fail to hear tenant concern and mine and to negotiate a way forward do the prime minister share my concern about this situation and will he set out our plan to protect independent business that be the heart of our high street and community 
 i thank my hon friend for raise an issue that be obviously of real concern to business in her constituency we expect landlord to meet their obligation to make building safe and we support robust enforcement action from the regulator if they fail to do so i will ensure that my hon friend secure a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss what step can be take in this particular case to support the business on which her constituent rely 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 year ago this week the ally begin a pincer movement against german force between the ruhr and the rhine british and canadian troop attack from the north americans from the south british canadian and american soldier be fight shoulder to shoulder to defeat fascist year on president trump seem to have forget all that his tariff against steel and aluminium will hit canada the hard but they will also hit job and the cost of live in our country in remind president trump who america ’ true and long stand friend and ally really be will the prime minister also prepare a plan for tariff in return start with tariff on american electric car 
 the right hon gentleman be right to refer to our history and the year anniversary we be fight alongside the americans and that be among the reason why we have a special relationship 
 british steel be an essential part of our heartland and we will not abandon our skilled workforce but a level head assessment of the implication be need and that be what we be go through at the moment however we will always put our national interest and steelworker 
 it seem to i that give the way in which president trump and his ally musk be operate they need to hear of strong measure and hear strong word even from their ally 
 let i move on to the subject of ukraine if it be force to surrender its own sovereign territory to russia that will be the great betrayal of a european ally since poland in but president trump say ukraine may end up russian and he want american money back i think we all fear where this could end and the dangerous implication for our defence and our security can the prime minister reassure the house that he and   other european leader have give sufficient support to president zelensky so that he can not be bully by trump and putin into accept a deal that would effectively hand victory to russia

 the hon lady ’s constituent be right to be frustrate about the empty unfunded promise that be leave behind by the conservatives a point make by she and by my hon friend   the member for basingstoke luke murphy under the previous government ’s plan a new hospital in basingstoke would simply not have be deliver because it be unfunded it be a promise without anything behind it we have put in place a fund deliverable plan that will see the hospital build and we will work closely with the trust to ensure that it be

 for the final question i call andrew mitchell 
 the prime minister will be well aware of the global vaccination fund gavi of the united kingdom ’s great success story it have vaccinate from deadly disease more than a child under it present real value for money to british taxpayer and more than of our constituent support it will he give the house an undertaking that britain will continue that leadership and make a decisive pledge at next month ’s replenishment conference 
 this be a really important issue as the right hon gentleman rightly point out i have long support it and will continue to support it and i will share detail with he just as soon as i can 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net if he will make a statement on the potential security implication of the involvement of chinese company include mingyang in energy infrastructure project 
 i thank the hon lady for bring the urgent question to the house 
 the protection and security of the energy sector be an absolute priority for this government we have a range of effective measure in place that give the government power to balance an open investment environment to facilitate growth with protect the area of our economy that be most sensitive to national security 
 the government firmly believe that the big risk to our energy system and energy security be remain dependent on international fossil fuel market control by petrostate and dictator that be why we have a mission to make britain a clean energy superpower to end that dependence we have a world lead offshore wind industry in the uk and international investment play a crucial role in support job across the country as part of that mission my department engage in discussion with a wide range of investor include those from other country we be also clear that alongside that the growth of uk supply chain be critical that be why we have set out plan for a clean industry bonus to drive investment in manufacturing as well as set up great british energy and the national wealth fund 
 the government will not hesitate to use our power to protect national security whenever we identify concern and we will take a consistent long term and strategic approach to manage the uk ’s relation with china root in uk and global interest the government will co operate with china where it can compete where it need to and challenge where it must 
 i thank the minister for her comment and general reassurance but there be specific concern at the moment china can produce what be useful to we for the development of renewable particularly in the north sea and we can benefit from those investment china also need access to our market however security issue involve company work in offshore renewable development have become apparent in recent week and have be raise numerous time 
 it have be report that the chinese company mingyang be interested in produce turbine for a new project in the north sea around £ of scottish government funding have be earmark for a wind turbine factory near inverness in addition to a potential £ for orient cable to provide subsea cable for island community that be despite the european union bring anti trust case against china and the norwegian government block mingyang from its green infrastructure project 
 will the minister reassure the house that the department will follow the same rigorous process to assess those risk as the previous government which ultimately   block huawei from the g network this must include an assessment of any opportunity for remote access to the turbine as the software will normally remain in the control of the manufacturer even once commission leave they vulnerable to be switch off we need local control 
 will the department reassure the house that discussion be ongoing with the scottish government to ensure that no public money be invest before this risk assessment have take place how will ministers work with the scottish government and cabinet colleague to ensure that offshore and undersea infrastructure be safe 
 the hon lady raise important concern that we be very much alive to as i say in my answer energy security be critical to the department ’s work and that be why we have the clean power mission to end our dependency on fossil fuel international investment be a crucial part of that and help to support growth and job across the country as part of that we have discussion with a wide range of international investor but we absolutely recognise that this need to be balance against national security implication we work on that constantly across government with input from a number of department and i be pleased to see my hon friend the minister for security from the home office here for the urgent question 
 the government have to consider both those aspect together the need for investment and for great capacity in our supply chain and the security risk while i can not get into the detail of the individual case give the nature of the ongoing discussion i reassure the hon lady that we be take these factor into account we do want to make sure that the most robust process be follow as we look at the detail of this particular issue 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i be pleased to hear the minister confirm the importance of our energy security in contrast to what we see under the previous government interruption opposition member can groan all they want but that be the reality of what be inherit in july last year 
 as we extend energy infrastructure in this country can my hon friend the minister confirm how this government will ensure that we have control of the operation of that infrastructure do she agree it be vital that through the industrial strategy we see a renaissance in our manufacturing and great resilience in our supply chain all of which add to the energy security of this country 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that deal with capacity issue in our supply chain be a crucial part of get this investment into infrastructure it be of the reason why through the national wealth fund we invest in lithium in cornwall last week through the critical mineral strategy we want to maximise the natural resource that we have where we can as i have say we want to make absolutely sure that security concern be address as well when we look at which investor invest in our new economy 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the indication that mingyang will get the green light from the treasury to supply wind turbine technology to the green volt wind farm in the north sea be concern indeed alarm bell have be sound by official in the minister ’s department and in the ministry of defence this green revolution will come with a make in china label the government in collusion with the scottish national party in holyrood be determined to see chinese company reap the economic reward 
 the minister ’s party say again and again that the transition to renewable energy will reduce our reliance on hostile regime chinese control technology embed in our critical energy infrastructure be evidently a threat to our security can the minister assure we that she be take this threat seriously can she explain how use wind turbine make by mingyang reduce our reliance on foreign state 
 just last week i along with many mp in the minister ’s party be brief by the royal navy on the vulnerability of our subsea communication and energy infrastructure we have see a pervasive rise in sabotage attack on subsea cable in the baltic affect our scandinavian ally if chinese manufacture turbine be instal security expert have warn that sensor could spy on british sea defence submarine programme and the layout of our energy infrastructure we would be reliant on chinese equipment and software and on chinese supplier for update and maintenance hand beijing significant opportunity for interference in the current international climate it be unthinkable to disregard the security implication of this decision 
 can the minister confirm that the government have scrap the giga green industry growth accelerator scheme that we launch to build british supply chain in energy technology what discussion have she have with the ministry of defence about its concern over our ability to ensure the security of our energy system what safeguard will be in place to prevent chinese maintenance ship access the turbine for repair what guarantee have she have if any from our defence and security agency that this investment will pose no threat to our national security if such assurance be not forthcoming will she revisit this decision and put a halt to the madness of allow the people ’s republic of china to have such a significant stake in our energy system 
 when the minister—[interruption sorry i be the minister now laughter the shadow minister mention revisit this decision but as yet no decision have be make we be undergo rigorous process to consider the role of china in our supply chain and in the investment in our critical infrastructure 
 have be in my position the hon gentleman will know why it be so important that i do not provide a running commentary on individual case but i have make it clear that we be take into account the national security consideration as well as our need for investment in the supply chain let i touch on the legacy that we be leave by the previous minister he be perfectly happy to leave our energy system expose with the british people pay the price the retreat the under new management line that he be parrot early this week would leave we even more exposed to those petrostate and dictator we be get on with our   clean power mission to end our energy insecurity and i shall take no lesson from the shadow minister on energy security give his government ’s record 
 i be glad to hear the minister point out that when it come to green investment over the past year the legacy that we be leave with be of an absolutely vacant industrial strategy i urge she to explain far how we might be able to develop the skill and competency in this country to make sure that we have good strong and ethical supply chain 
 i thank my hon friend for her question we have launch the clean industry bonus which will be crucial in protect our supply chain we be invest through gb energy and the national wealth fund i have already mention lithium in cornwall through the global clean power alliance which we launch at the end of last year we will bring together our counterpart from other country include at the international energy agency conference in april to look at a supply chain mission to deal with these issue these issue do not just affect we in this country as other country seek to decarbonise and increase the role of renewable we will all need to co operate and deal with the capacity issue across the supply chain 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for edinburgh west christine jardine   for secure this important urgent question since the russian invasion of ukraine as the minister have rightly say energy security have be a key term in this chamber there be way of look at energy security it be about generate our own renewable energy to avoid price volatility and exposure to authoritarian regime ensure that we have the job here at home for design and construction secondly it be about the national security issue around our energy infrastructure which be also a form of energy security a former mi6 chief have warn of the vulnerability either deliberate or inadvertent pose by foreign control software embed in our energy infrastructure give those serious concern can the minister guarantee that any further investment in scotland will increase both our energy and our national security 
 as i have say we be go through the robust process to try to make absolutely sure that our national security be not compromise by investment from overseas and we will continue to do that 
 the grangemouth refinery be a vital piece of scottish infrastructure and its economic contribution to the scottish economy be worth more than £ every year the grangemouth refinery be also a joint venture between petrochina own by the chinese state and ineos a multinational conglomerate together they be petroineos the refinery be due to close with thousand of job be lose an unjust transition and scotland have to rely on import oil all at a time of great global volatility why be this government allow a foreign government and private capital dictate scotland ’s industrial capacity its ability to produce oil and overall our national security 
 we be not allow anyone to dictate to we i know my hon friend have be deep in conversation for some time with the minister for energy over grangemouth ’s future to reiterate we absolutely need to attract investment to meet our clean power mission to secure our future energy security and in the long run to bring down bill for the british people we need to balance national security concern in tandem with that and neither take priority we need to tackle those challenge together and that be what we will do 
 whatever the question about energy be china be not the answer we know the ministry of defence and the department for energy security and net have raise objection about the treasury ’s push to bring mingyang smart energy into the circuit to bid for this secondly china be determined to involve slave labour in its product we be invest under this government in solar array which use a huge amount of slave labour in produce polysilicon do the government not recognise that their tilt towards china to get it to invest run the real risk of utter dependency on china and serious threat to our security which have be highlight endlessly by the security service and will they now stop 
 i recognise that the right hon member have long stand concern about the role of china and its investment in our economy he have be a great champion of raise concern about force labour and he be right to do so we have set up the solar taskforce as i be sure he be aware to look at whether there be force labour in our solar supply chain as i have say a supply chain mission will be launch as part of the global clean power alliance this be not something that country can tackle by itself we all need to be alert to the risk of slave labour i know that an amendment be pass in the house of lords last night that mean the issue will come back to this chamber soon and i look forward to the discussion then 
 do the minister agree that develop our economic and trading relationship with other nation be lever of many that the government be use to drive growth and investment alongside plan reform public investment and a proper industrial strategy for the people not only of the uk but my city at the same time our work across departments must always have our nation ’s security at its core 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and we be use a number of lever the growth mission and the clean power mission work hand in hand to ensure that energy security and the decarbonisation of our power system contribute to growth in this country and that mean contribute to job creation and in some case overseas investment we have set up great british energy and we have the national wealth fund and the clean industry bonus all of which will help we achieve those objective 
 have ministers or official in the ministry of defence the home office or the security service raise any concern with the   department over the possibility of offshore structure in british water be use for chinese intelligence gather technology if there be sensitive matter that can not be discuss in the house will she commit to hold a private briefing for member on the security implication of energy infrastructure from china 
 i can not comment on the extent of conversation other than to reassure the hon member that of course those conversation be take place and will be ongoing and that we be go through robust process again because it be not my specific role i can not say whether that information could be share i do not think that it can be share on a day to day basis but i will investigate whether we could arrange a briefing with member to give some reassurance as to the general approach 
 i be surprised that conservative members seem to have forget the time when they be push the golden era of the relationship between the uk and china some of this be a legacy of their time in government so they should be careful about how they approach this conversation 
 i point out to the minister the role that grimsby play in service and support operation of offshore wind not only around uk water but as far as taiwan those skill competency and capability exist here in the country so what additional support will be give to expand those capability and support for skill in this country 
 my hon friend have be a real champion for grimsby and i be glad to see she return at the recent election so that she can carry on champion all the potential that grimsby have to offer not least in the wind sector it be important that we link up skill and capacity that be of the obstacle we talk often about how grid capacity and planning issue can hold up the roll out of clean power but we have to have the skill base as well we be work with the department for education on how we can train and develop capacity within the exist workforce through thing like the growth and skill levy to work on these exciting new project 
 the minister speak about be reliant on the petrochemical state and dictatorship that supply the fuel need for our energy system and yet the vast majority of the process material need whether we construct thing here or not come from china we recognise that some of those country be dictatorship but will the minister confirm at the dispatch box that a country that use slave labour have carry out the most horrendous crime against the uyghur population and have sanction our own parliamentarian be as much a dictatorship as the country that she say we want to no long be reliant on 
 if we follow the approach suggest by the opposition front bench we would be firmly back in the hand of the petrostate and the dictator as for our relationship with china as i have say we will co operate where we can compete where we need to and absolutely challenge if we must we have be clear   that no company in the uk should have force labour in its supply chain that be why we have set up the solar taskforce and be go through robust process ahead of the decision that we be talk about i will take no lesson from the right hon member because we have have year of be expose to a volatile energy market and we be try to recreate our energy security through this investment 
 do the minister agree that after the real neglect of our energy infrastructure for the past year set up gb energy to help uk ownership of energy production can only be a good thing and that our investment in critical mineral particularly in cornwall and in the supply chain for float offshore wind will be crucial for our national security 
 on the hand conservative members raise concern about critical mineral be import from abroad on the other when my hon friend who be a real champion for her area praise the investment that we have put into lithium extraction in cornwall they start jeer we will continue to invest through gb energy and the national wealth fund 
 to have true energy security we need home grow capability at all stage of the development of renewable energy infrastructure from the early research to maintenance and decommissioning what step be the minister take to ensure that we have that home grow full lifecycle capability 
 from the hon member ’s question she may be talk about community energy i be not quite sure 
 indicate dissent 
 in that case i will say that it be important that any investment be place base and we need to look at develop the capability such as the skill and the capacity of the local authority that be where community energy come in we also need to ensure that the finance go where the investment be need if i have not understand the hon member ’s question i would be happy to take it up with she afterwards 
 i welcome the minister ’s engagement on this topic to have meaningful and serious discussion with other major economy be vital for our success do the minister agree that those discussion be key to not only secure our economic aim but tackle the climate and nature crisis and achieve our wide international objective 
 yes that international co operation be absolutely crucial it mean talk to country with which we share a great deal in common and which be sign up to the same objective but it also mean talk to other country to bring they with we that be why we be host the international energy agency summit in london in april why we have set up the global clean power alliance and why the prime minister go to the cop climate change talk in baku last   autumn and show international leadership which be very much lacking from uk government of previous year 
 clearly national security concern be be express across the house will the minister ensure that the construction maintenance and access to software will be carry out by british worker in british shop and will not be subcontract to foreign power 
 as i have say i can not comment on individual case but there be process to ensure that our national security be protect as we look ahead 
 i welcome the minister ’s reassurance about the government ’s rigorous scrutiny of energy project involve chinese technology i understand the argument that at the current stage of our transition to net we may need to look far afield to meet our domestic energy need but do she agree that the long term plan ought to be to reduce reliance on chinese technology in the uk energy sector and to use british make green technology about which there can be no national security or ethical supply chain concern 
 i agree that be why we be do all we can to increase capacity through initiative such as the clean industry bonus investment from the national wealth fund the role of gb energy and all the other measure that we will take through our industrial strategy to ensure that we keep and create job in the uk 
 the minister be all over the place on this in her opening remark she say that the united kingdom have a world lead renewable energy industry if we do we would not be have this discussion about foreign import infrastructure notwithstanding the tories total failure over year to invest in the industrial base for renewable energy manufacturing across the united kingdom what be the government ’s strategy to get in front of this not just in manufacturing but in resource supply enterprise resource planning and intellectual property what be the big shift that the government have plan i just hear jibber jabber 
 that be not very polite of the hon member as i have say we be do all we can to attract investment into the uk so that we can be as reliant as possible on our own resource that mean our own supply chain and attract investment and so on we be do that through the national wealth fund and through gb energy i do not know to what extent he take part in debate on the great british energy bill but there be much discussion then as i have say this issue must be solve on an international level we be do a lot of work with our colleague to make the north sea the green power plant of europe through the north seas energy co operation council and we have set up the global clean power alliance we can not act alone although i know that the scottish national party prefer that approach we be work in co operation but also in the good interest of the british economy 
 can the minister confirm that her department ’s work be entirely consistent with the government ’s approach to china co operate where we can compete where we need to and challenge where we must 
 that be exactly our approach and it be the right approach perhaps the opposition front benchers would advocate not co operate with china but it be an incredibly important player on the world stage and we gain nothing from completely turn our back on it and not engage in dialogue 
 follow its illegal invasion of ukraine we see how russia respond in the global tarrif sanction market it try to use its dominance in the nuclear fuel market to put pressure on ukraine ’s ally we see the vulnerability in our energy supply chain when our enemy and ally of those enemy want to use it against we former head of mi6 sir richard dearlove say that the government ’s target of decarbonise the grid hand power to beijing we have enough oil and gas in the uk not to have to rely on dictator state so why do we not just get drill and get our own oil and gas out of the ground i suspect that in their mad dash to decarbonise the grid the government will not do that but have they undertake a risk assessment of the strategic vulnerability of our national security in our increase reliance on chinese rare earth mineral and battery production 
 i think i have make it clear that there be ongoing conversation about that and that we take national security incredibly seriously when we consider investment decision on what the hon member say about produce more oil and gas here for our own use i think he need a lesson in how the energy market work there be no guarantee that it would be use here 
 the issue be the labour government ’s rush to decarbonise by which mean that this country do not have the capability to fulfil all the requirement to deliver on these project until we do we will always be reliant on overseas power and people such as the chinese government and chinese manufacturer to deliver what we need in order to decarbonise be the government prepared and happy to sacrifice our national security and our energy security to reach that target 
 it sound very much like the hon member be make the case for an industrial strategy   that ensure that we can match demand with supply that approach be particularly miss from the previous government 
 almost on a weekly basis we be lecture by the net obsess secretary of state that the race for renewable be necessary in order to give this country a secure future supply of energy yet the renewable industry be increasingly dependent on chinese technology and on rare earth metal of which the chinese control so we be place our future energy supply in the hand of a dictatorship that have prove itself willing to use such infrastructure to blackmail the country in which it be base should we not consider the supply of fossil fuel in this country decade of oil and gas which we could use without interference from other 
 we believe that the good route to energy security be through our clean power by mission and further investment in renewable that remain our stance 
 the minister will be aware that the costly environmental obligation that the government impose on home manufacture good be not adhere to by many other nation which often prevent uk manufacturer from be able to compete do the minister agree that those consideration as well as the routine human right breach of chinese business against the uyghurs falun gong christians and other ethnic minority should be equally weight with cost human right and chinese production will never add up that must inform any contract offer by this nation of our 
 the hon member have frequently raise almost every issue that could think of but he and i have take part in many debate about human right in country of concern over the year and he be absolutely right to flag those concern as i have say we have the solar taskforce and the supply chain mission with the global clean power alliance we be very much alert to those matter we do not want to see force labour or any form of modern slavery in our supply chain we be determined to take action on that
