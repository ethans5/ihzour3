 bill read a time 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what progress his department have make on establish the business growth service 
 small business be critical to our economy and to the future of all our community we will bring forward our small business strategy later this year to improve the environment for small business to grow as part of that work we be consult widely with small business and other stakeholder on the design of the business growth service which we will launch later this year 
 before christmas i be pleased to meet some of the many microbusinesse operate in osset and denby dale they tell i that they previously feel that they have fall through the crack of government policy and economic ambition how will the minister ’s business growth service assist those microbusinesse as well as broad measure that the government be take to help small organisation to grow 
 i commend my hon friend on her support for the microbusinesse in her constituency we want to get behind all those who be willing to take the risk to set up their own business they help to make our community more vibrant they create job and they generate the tax revenue that make our country strong the business growth service will be design to get business quick access to the support they need from the government such as apply for a start up loan access to training and management support and help with export 
 i thank the minister for his positive response to that question in strangford small business be the backbone of the community and many people in those business work from home the business growth policy may be specific to england but what discussion have the minister have with the department for business and trade in northern ireland to ensure that we benefit 
 the hon gentleman have always be a great champion of small business in his constituency and in northern ireland more generally we want the business growth service to complement the support that the northern ireland executive and the welsh and scottish governments already give their business to improve the quality of advice and support available to all business in all part of the uk 
 what step he plan to take to help reduce employment cost 
 the government be pursue the reform need to deliver sustain long term growth develop and deliver in partnership with business we have take significant step include launch a consultation on the modern industrial strategy establish the national wealth fund transform our planning rule commit to a year infrastructure strategy and introduce the employment rights bill to boost productivity we have also add extra protection for small business by increase the employment allowance and freeze the small business rate multiplier 
 i think the minister may have misunderstand my question i ask how he would reduce employment cost the president of the confederation of british industry recently say that because of thing like the employment rights bill employer will be lay people off and will be less likely to employ and that be before the national insurance tax on employment impose by this government do the minister accept responsibility for the increase in unemployment that we be already see 
 i think it be something of a stretch to say that a bill that be not even law yet most of the provision of which will not come into force until next year be drive unemployment already i quote back to he what the head of the cbi say yesterday about our growth plan he say 
 this positive leadership and a vision to kickstart the economy and boost productivity be welcome 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in the week of labour ’s late reset how do the minister reconcile impose an additional £ of cost on business on the government ’s own figure with grow the economy what be it about the breakfast with the prime minister that see boss lay off more worker hour later 
 i thank the shadow secretary of state for his question we believe that a increase in the overall pay bill which be what we have estimate the employment rights bill will mean for business be actually a fantastic return for great security at work great pay well staff retention increase productivity make job more secure and family friendly ban exploitative hour contract support woman in work in every stage of life provide a genuine living wage turn the page on industrial relation and bring an end to fire and rehire this be a pro business pro growth pro worker agenda from the government and we be determined to deliver it 
 if he will take step to reduce the noise level of firework on public sale 
 the government understand the effect that firework can have on animal and vulnerable individual consumer firework have a db noise limit but numerous low noise option be available on the market at around db or below this year ’s firework public information campaign have highlight low noise firework and the importance of considerate use additionally i be meet business consumer group and charity at the conclusion of the firework season in the next come week or to discuss their concern 
 antisocial firework keep our constituent awake cause alarm for pet and seriously affect people with post traumatic stress disorder or special educational need i know the minister hear extensively from colleague campaigner and charity on this during the westminster hall debate on my bill will he meet i to discuss the implementation of the common sense measure present in my fireworks bill include lower the noise limit on firework sell to the public close the licensing loophole and review social medium and online sale 
 it be always a pleasure to meet my hon friend and i be happy to do so indeed we will see whether we can get she to come along to some of the other meeting that we be hold with interested group some of which she have mention 
 may i wish a belate happy chinese new year to all those who be celebrate yesterday beauty of our great country be its diversity but with that come cause for celebration throughout the year my own community in south west hertfordshire celebrate diwali eid christmas chinese new year and other event which often entail the use of firework there be an expectation of firework and the noise associate with they at the main event of christmas and new year so pet owner inevitably take safeguard measure then but give the likelihood of firework throughout the year may i urge the minister to get on to this bill quickly ensure that we do not stifle the celebration but that we do protect our animal and those vulnerable child who may be affect by noise 
 i thank the hon member for his question he be right to recognise that firework be use at a number of event throughout the year but it would be wrong to characterise that as people have to expect that there will be noise there be now a sufficient number of low decibel product on the market for everyone to act more responsibly and we will be explore that in our meeting over the come week 
 what progress his department have make on develop an industrial strategy 
 what progress his department have make on develop an industrial strategy

 i be really pleased my hon friend hold that roundtable it be quite a turning point to have an industrial strategy with defence as of the sector build new relationship across departments with colleague who work in defence be a really powerful and important thing to do he speak to a wide problem face by a lot of industry when it come to deal with government agency and department we be work hard to make these thing easy because growth be our priority and we have to break down those barrier 
 it be essential that the government ’s industrial strategy create manufacture job across the country include in my constituency the renewableuk   offshore wind industrial growth plan show the uk can be a global technology leader in advanced turbine tech foundation electrical system and cable will my hon friend commit to use our industrial strategy to ensure there be growth in these area to put british manufacturing at the heart of the clean energy transition 
 i thank my hon friend for her question for her defence of her constituency and for her ambition which we share i believe the report she refer to come out before this labour government come to power with our new policy and the new drive and ambition from our secretary of state for business and trade and for energy security and net we be power forward with our renewable agenda and we will make sure that all of our growth drive sector speak to my hon friend ’s area and everyone ’s area of the country and drive growth across the board 
 manufacturer in my constituency be really excited about the upcoming industrial strategy and all the growth that will bring however steel and aluminium business in particular be concerned about the upcoming carbon border adjustment mechanism the gap with the eu and whether the whole system will be ready for implementation if we do not get it right the cbam will have a big impact on our ability to trade and on growth so can the minister assure i she be go to be work with the treasury to ensure we get this right and that it support manufacturer in the west midland 
 i know my hon friend will hold this government to account on what we be do and how we be go and she will push and already have do to make sure we be do everything we can for the industry in her area the cbam will be introduce in and she speak to concern that i have hear in conversation around steel in particular which be very important to this country that be why we be develop a steel strategy which will set a future direction of travel for steel but we be work with the eu and with industry here to make sure the cbam work and do what it be suppose to do

 why be it that the government ’s energy policy be drive uncompetitive energy cost in absolutely the wrong direction sir jim ratcliffe have point out that the principal threat to any strategy be actually the uncompetitive cost for those enterprise that will have to populate it 
 this government inherit very high energy cost from the previous government who have take no action to make our country more energy secure we be power through to have clean green home grow energy that will bring cost down and make sure we be secure as a country and not reliant on the whim of global leader and the price of oil and gas we will bring those cost down and we will support our industry which i be afraid the previous government fail to do 
 over the past week the uk government have commit to support a runway in london a football stadium in manchester and a science corridor for oxford and cambridge yet for the past year conservative and labour government have fail to act to secure the long term future of grangemouth after ineos announce the closure of the oil refinery despite general election promise to step in and save the plant why be the labour government willing to jeopardise job at grangemouth the country ’s energy security which the minister have just speak passionately about the need to secure and the wide industrial strategy through this inaction 
 the hon member will be pleased to hear that we have re- establish a working group with the scottish minister and the welsh and northern irish leadership to make sure we be work collectively because we do not want to take a party political approach to the growth of all our nation we be collaborate well with the scottish government on grangemouth where we be work at pace and put in investment and support we be work to transition people from north sea oil and gas into the new energy of the future there be the passport that we publish and we have set up great british energy which will be headquarter in aberdeen a lot of work be go on and we need the scottish government to support we in that work we will work in partnership because that be what will create good job 
 the chemical industry be an important employer in my constituency with the hex group and si group employ many people as mention sir jim ratcliffe be already highlight the extinction of the british chemical industry my chemical manufacturer need to ensure that they be buy energy at the same price as manufacturer in germany the netherlands and france when will they be able to do that 
 the chemical industry have be suffer for many year because of the previous government ’s economic policy crash the economy under liz truss and fail to deal with energy price over multiple   year i have meet the chemical industry it be an important part of our economy and we need to do what we can to protect it i be have conversation and we be build our energy policy we be build our industrial strategy 
 word salad 
 word salad gosh that abuse from the opposition front bench have cut i to the core the industrial strategy have set out sector that will turbocharge the economy across all those sector lie our foundational sector of which the chemical industry be we will support that industry in a way that his government fail to do 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i will try to avoid a word salad we have hear from various different industrial sector how important it be to have stable and predictable energy cost this month have see little sun and only intermittent wind so we have be heavily dependent on import oil and gas be ministers in the department for business and trade challenge the energy secretary over his policy 
 i be disappoint by the hon lady ’s approach to this matter and i be disappoint by the conservative party ’s overall abandonment of previously strongly hold view about the need to balance climate change with our economy it be a fact that we be move fast towards renewable energy last year of our energy come from renewable for the time we be grow they at pace because they be cheap onshore wind be the cheap form of energy we have solar be very cheap and float offshore wind bring we huge opportunity renewable will bring our cost down and make sure we be energy secure and they go hand in glove with growth as the chancellor set out in her speech yesterday 
 the minister ’s government have change policy to not issue any new licence for domestic oil and gas so we will become more dependent on import at time when solar and wind be not work unless we can increase nuclear generation it be nuclear week in parliament so what pressure be she put on the energy secretary to make new nuclear an important part of our industrial strategy 
 i sit jointly in the department for business and trade and the department for energy security and net so the hon lady can be reassure that i talk to my colleague and be work with they indeed i be lead on hydrogen and carbon capture which be an important part of the mix we be clear that nuclear be an important part of our future and that the strong approach to deliver energy security and bring price down be to have all the opportunity available to we and to build at pace that be why we be treble our solar double our wind and support big nuclear as well as small modular reactor she can be reassure that we be put a strategy in place which the previous government fail to do 
 what progress his department have make on develop a steel strategy 
 i delight to tell my hon friend that we be work hard on our steel strategy immediately after we have finish these question i will be go to sheffield to talk to the industry about future demand steel be an important industry for our future to which we have make a £ commitment we will ensure that we turn around the decline we see under the previous government and deliver a steel industry fit for the future 
 the steel industry be an important part of wolverhampton north east ’s heritage and must remain a part of our future will my hon friend outline how the £ uk steel strategy and the new steel council will boost competitiveness and secure job at tata ’s steelpark in wednesfield which be the uk ’s large processing and distribution centre 
 i thank my hon friend for stand up for her community and protect her industry i would be happy to have a conversation with she about the change she think we need to make 
 steel output in the uk fall by in by in and by in what an awful thing to have happen to our industry we need to turn that around we do not underestimate how hard that will be but we be put in place the money the policy and the government dedication to ensure that we support a thriving steel industry 
 what step he be take to support high street business 
 what step he be take to support high street business 
 we be continue to work with colleague across government to develop a programme that will revitalise the nation ’s high street and support business we will publish a small business strategy later this year and high street will be a key pillar of that we have already commit to continue funding for business growth programme such as the growth hub network and announce plan for a new business growth service 
 yesterday bromsgrove receive the devastating news that it be about to lose both its lloyds and halifax bank branch in the town centre those bank be a lifeline to many small business particularly those run by independent small entrepreneur as well as many resident who use their banking facility on probably a weekly or daily basis do the minister agree that banking hub can be part of an ongoing solution to retain banking service in our town will he support my campaign for a banking hub in bromsgrove will he meet i to make that a reality 
 i recognise that there will be a lot of concern in the hon member ’s constituency follow that news yesterday i agree that banking hub can make a significant difference which be why we have be quick to roll out more than of they plan for another have already be develop and we be commit to roll out in total in the spirit of thomas try to help another thomas i be happy to meet he 
 our small business be the lifeblood of our high street and often give young student their opportunity for a job on a saturday or in the holiday however of my local small business owner say that she can no long afford such role because of the increase in employer national insurance contribution and change to business rate among other thing what will the government do to support our young people into job when small business be leave in that awful position 
 the hon lady might want to check again with the business she refer to because in the most recent budget the employment allowance be raise to some £ which will help every small employer ’s national insurance bill every year and should ensure that more than firm benefit that be a very practical measure more broadly on the point about national insurance contribution she will know that labour inherit a very difficult financial situation because of mistake make by the conservatives and difficult decision have have to be take 
 small local business in grangemouth such as pub restaurant cafe hairdresser and garage all rely on the custom that they receive from the worker of the grangemouth refinery but the government have be very passive in allow the refinery to close thus impoverish the local community what message do the government have for the refinery worker who face redundancy and secondly for the small local business that rely on their custom 
 in her speech yesterday my right hon friend the chancellor set out a series of measure that the government want to take to boost growth across the country and benefit every part of the uk from invest in modern road and rail system to expand airport capacity rebalance the planning system and drive investment in cheap renewable energy and by create a national wealth fund that can back the new technology of the future i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss the specific concern he have mention if he think that would be useful 
 falkirk high street be the beat heart of our district with recent addition include barracuda chippy el toro gaucho steakhouse greek theory restaurant and rock bottom beer hall many falkirk town centre business still raise with i the hardship they have face because of cost rise and utility rent and parking increase over a number of year as well as rental value threshold change by the scottish government which have contribute to decrease footfall and fail business over a number of year while i welcome the government ’s commitment to shift   the burden away from the high street will the minister outline what further step he be take to support my high street and what engagement he have have with the scottish government to support shift the rate burden away from falkirk high street taxpayer 
 i refer to the establishment of the business growth service in answer to an early question we be work with the scottish government to begin to think through how that service can support business in scotland and complement the support already provide by the scottish government we be clear on the need to reform business rate to support retail hospitality and leisure business on the high street i be very happy to meet my hon friend if he think there be further initiative we can take to help small business in falkirk 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 r young art gallery be the last art gallery in wokingham town centre and a proud feature of our high street however political inactivity on business rate reform mean that it be on the precipice of closing i be shocked to learn that it be the impending cut to business rate relief with no measure in the short term to provide financial support that have lead the owner to fear for the survival of his business high street across the country continue to struggle what be the minister do to ensure that small independent business such as r young art gallery be support 
 reason why the conservatives lose the confidence of the british business community be that despite repeat promise to reform business rate they take no step to do so we announce plan in the budget back in october to reform business rate and introduce permanently low rate for retail hospitality and leisure business the conservatives be go to end business rate relief for retail hospitality and leisure we have choose to extend it we also announce in the budget that we be look at what further step we could take on business rate reform

 i be in davos last week meet representative from the life science industry and talk about the huge potential for growth that we have in the uk of the sector we have identify as part   of the industrial strategy be life science where we have huge talent and huge skill we need to build on that and be really ambitious in what we can deliver through the industrial strategy and the work with the brilliant industry we have in this country we can do just that 
 what step he be take to help increase business confidence 
 as the chancellor of the exchequer say only yesterday we be drive forward planning reform boost capital investment by over £ over the next year and create the national wealth fund we be launch the business growth service and will soon publish our modern industrial strategy which will be unreservedly pro business business leader not surprisingly have back those measure 
 but the minister will be aware that in the last few week the cbi the institute of directors and the london chamber of commerce have all say that business confidence be plummet give the tsunami of national insurance contribution increase business rate increase and employment cost rise be it not hardly surprising that confidence be be destroy be the government rather than promote growth not actually destroy it 
 i think the right hon gentleman need to check his source for comment from business leader only yesterday the british chambers of commerce the cbi and the federation of small businesses be make very positive comment about our plan for growth and last week interestingly pwc publish its annual survey of global ceo to reveal that britain be the most attractive country in the world in which to invest that be something that i do not think the party opposite ever achieve 
 business confidence increase when business know that they have the skilled workforce they need in order to grow we have just have nuclear week in parliament and it be a pleasure to host rolls royce and its apprentice its nuclear skill academy be provide a pipeline of talent and the same be need across other industry from technical skill to creative skill and from multinational to small business what cross departmental discussion have ministers have about help business of all size to provide skill opportunity for our future workforce

 i call the shadow minister 
 i begin by draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 when consumer confidence be low business confidence be low and nowhere be that more visible than in our automotive sector with uk car production slump to its low level since autocar magazine warn today that the emission vehicle mandate 
 be currently the industry ’s big headache as consumer demand be not there to meet the stringent regulation which be increase each year 
 when policy fail it be sensible to admit it and change course will the minister accept that the zev mandate fly in the face of what consumer actually want and that a radically different path be require to boost business confidence in our automotive sector 
 no i do not accept that and i would gently remind the hon gentleman that the policy to which he have refer be introduce by his party i recognise that there be many aspect of the conservative party ’s record about which he and his colleague be probably embarrassed the liz truss budget which the shadow secretary of state   the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith help to write do huge damage to our country and to consumer confidence the measure that the chancellor announce yesterday for example will drive growth forward and that be of the reason why business back they so strongly yesterday 
 it normally take long than month for a government to drift that far from reality the society of motor manufacturers and traders have predict that just car will roll off production line in compare to in today ’s edition of the telegraph report 
 the slump have be accelerate by a slowdown in demand across europe particularly by driver shun new electric vehicle 
 why do the minister persist in a policy to undermine our automotive business by force they to make a product that people just do not want to buy be it not time to get the state out of the way let our innovator innovate and boost automotive business confidence by let they deliver to actual consumer demand 
 the hon gentleman seem to have forget the extra investment that nissan have announce and the extra investment that have be announce by a number of other car manufacturer he and his colleague be very clear in oppose the measure that we take in the budget include measure that back investment in the automotive sector and they set out no plan to pay for that investment i gently encourage he to reflect a little far on the mistake that his party make in government which have cause some of the problem that we be have to sort out now 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of post office closure on local community 
 the post office have the freedom to operate the branch network within the   parameter set by the government we protect the network by set minimum access criterion so that in urban and rural area everyone have easy access to their near post office those criterion ensure that however the network change service remain within local reach of all citizen 
 the community of plymstock in my constituency see its main post office close in september when morrison close more than of its newsagent across the country the post office be essentially collateral damage despite the good effort of the community my predecessor and councillor include i at the time since the post office have downgrade the franchise on offer from main branch to post office local it have be impossible to secure an operator due to the financial unviability of the model yesterday the final local branch announce that it will close later in the year what be the minister do to ensure that sustainable joint post office and banking service replace closing branch in constituency like mine 
 we have support the post office in take measure to increase sub postmaster pay to make it a more attractive profession to come into in order to deal with precisely the issue that the hon member set out she will understand that i do not have specific knowledge of the issue around the post office in her constituency but i be always happy to challenge the post office on constituency issue so if she would like to write or speak to i about this afterwards i would be happy to look at the issue in more detail 
 what step he be take to negotiate a free trade agreement with india 
 as the chancellor announce yesterday the secretary of state will travel to delhi in february to relaunch trade talk with india work be under way across government to prepare for those negotiation as we seek a deal that drive economic growth an agreement with india project to be the large global importer by could provide further opportunity for business across the uk and further unlock growth 
 i thank my constituency neighbour for that update the previous government have more than round of trade talk with india before the general election in both india and the uk will the government ensure that we in the uk gain access to the service market in india which have previously be deny to uk firm that be the key issue in our negotiation 
 if i remember rightly the hon member and i be probably the most enthusiastic member of this house for a trade deal with india i slightly more than he i think we be determined to do everything we can to secure a trade deal with india he will forgive i i be sure if i do not give a running commentary on our priority for those trade talk with india but they represent a significant prize for the uk if we can reach an agreement the secretary of state   and the minister for trade policy and economic security be determined to work extremely hard and do everything they can to reach an agreement 
 although it be appreciate that a new trade deal with india could support job and prosperity in the uk and thus drive growth will the minister ensure that the talk include discussion of an agreement to the immediate release of my constituent jagtar singh johal from arbitrary detention in india before any trade deal be conclude 
 i recognise that this be a significant issue for my hon friend we remain committed to encourage the government of india to make fast progress on resolve this case my right hon and learn friend the prime minister raise this case with prime minister modi on   november and we have make clear the need for fast progress towards a resolution 
 what step his department be take to encourage entrepreneurship 
 the government continue to support entrepreneur through for example start up loan via the british business bank we will publish our small business strategy later this year which will signal a clear overarch ambition to promote entrepreneurship and will articulate a new vision for business support build around the new business growth service that i have allude to 
 economy grow and job be create when individual be able to take risk and invest in their idea so what have the government do specifically since the general election to help more people in my constituency of broxbourne become entrepreneur 
 thing we need to continue to do be make it easy for entrepreneur in the hon member ’s constituency and across the uk to access the finance that they need to set up their business we have give an extra £ to the british business bank which will help to ensure that more people have access to finance across the country include in his constituency we will publish our small business strategy later this year in which he will see further measure to support entrepreneur in broxbourne and across the uk 
 what specific support be be provide for woman entrepreneur they be the drive force behind small business in my great grimsby and cleethorpes constituency and deserve all the support that they can get 
 i strongly support my hon friend ’s substantive point we be back the invest in women taskforce which be set up to increase the number of female power business we be look at how to increase significantly the proportion of investment go to all female founding team it have be stick at just of equity investment in the last decade that be example of the thing we need to change to help woman lead business realise their full potential 
 what step his department be take to support business in the north east 
 the government be invest £ with the north east combine authority to deliver our share objective of economic growth and business support that include the development of the local part of the industrial strategy guide investment to deliver sustainable economic growth and deliver support to grow all business in there be £ worth of direct support give to the north east growth hub which provide business across the area with practical advice and support to grow and thrive 
 yesterday see full throate government support for project across the uk but not so much for the north east the region be decimate by year of tory government and that can not be repeat i accept what the minister say about what have happen but what will the government do to ensure that business in my blyth and ashington constituency can play their part in the cutting edge technology of the future and crucially see improved investment which will create much- needed job with good wage and term and condition 
 i be at with my hon friend in want all part of the country especially the north west and the north east to have high pay well skille good job in tech sector in particular but also in other area where we can see great advantage for the economy the local skill improvement plan for the north east will help and the excellent facility at blyth ’s energy central learning hub be support by over £ of government funding that be already develop sector skill in a real world port setting with the reopening of the northumberland line we have reconnecte town in south east northumberland with tyneside improve link and opportunity across the area 
 what step his department be take to support the automotive industry 
 as we have already discuss the automotive sector be absolutely vital to the government ’s plan for green economic growth and for grow the economy more widely that be why at the budget my right hon friend the chancellor commit to ensure over £ of capital and research and development funding before for emission vehicle manufacturing and its supply chain we be also consult the industry to make sure that the emission transition work for the uk ’s car industry and work with the automotive transformation fund and the advanced propulsion centre to make sure that we carry on innovate and see the growth of the automotive sector in the uk 
 around of my constituent in north warwickshire and bedworth work in the automotive sector i have meet representative of many small and   medium sized business that provide engineering and manufacturing service for the sector as well as jaguar land rover which have a battery assembly centre in my constituency a career in the automotive industry should be an attractive prospect to many young people in my constituency what be the minister do to support the sector in upskille its workforce and provide apprenticeship scheme so that company be not leave rely on immigration to fill skill gap 
 my hon friend make a really good point there be a lot of work under way to look at skill across the board because thus far no government have have a proper strategy on the skill that we need and on how we make sure that we train our own people so that we do not have to rely on immigration there be example in the automotive sector of absolutely brilliant apprenticeship scheme that other industry can learn from and we be work with skills england i have regular meeting with colleague in the department for education the home office and the department for work and pensions to make sure that we crack this nut and encourage people to go into good well pay job

 i commend charlotte on her business we recognise that we need to do more to help business like her to be able to export more easily to europe that be why the prime minister have set out our determination to reset the relationship with europe we have make clear our plan to negotiate a phytosanitary agreement with the eu which may or may not make an immediate difference for charlotte but there be other aspect of our plan to reset the relationship with europe that i hope will help 
 despite repeat government and union engagement it seem that luton could be set to lose of its large private sector employer as stellantis close its vauxhall plant despite our excellent transport connection skilled work- force and proud industrial heritage in the light of that devastating blow do the minister recognise the importance of luton airport as a tool to invest in growth and attract private sector employment to our town

 the pandemic expose the woeful inadequacy of the previous government ’s statutory sick pay provision and i be pleased that this government have commit to reform those through the employment rights bill will the minister look at the specific wording of the bill to ensure there be no unintended consequence of the provision on the removal of the low earning limit for statutory sick pay will he meet i to ensure that all worker receive proper statutory sick pay and no be leave bad off

 yesterday out of the blue bank of scotland announce that it will close branch in my constituency leave hundred of square mile of the rural south of scotland without a single bank branch while we must work with link and other to ensure access to cash in those community do the minister share my concern not only that this will leave empty premise prominent on the high street but that it send a message that the bank be give up on rural area and on those who do not bank online 
 i recognise that the right hon gentleman ’s constituent will be concern about the bank of scotland ’s decision he may know that more than bank branch close between and that be why the government be determined to ensure the much more widespread roll out of banking hub with a commitment to roll out banking hub i strongly suggest to the right hon gentleman that he get in contact with link and cash access uk to make the case for a banking hub in his constituency if i can help in any way i will be happy to consider do so

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs if he will make a statement on avian influenza 
 before i call the minister i give member a brief reminder that laptop use in the chamber be not permit 
 avian influenza be once again pose a threat to both keep and wild bird across the country and support birdkeeper the public and conservation body to manage and prepare for avian influenza continue to be of our main priority follow the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry and other captive bird this winter the department for environment food and rural affairs and the animal and plant health agency have stand up their well establish outbreak structure to control and eradicate disease restore normal trade and assist local community recovery 
 defra ’s disease control measure seek to contain the number of animal that need to be cull either for disease control purpose or to safeguard animal welfare and our approach aim to reduce adverse impact on the rural and wide economy the public rural community and the environment include the impact on wildlife while protect public health and minimise the overall cost of any outbreak our approach to avian influenza consider the late scientific and ornithological evidence and veterinary advice current policy reflect our experience of respond to past outbreak of exotic animal disease and be in line with international standard of good practice for disease control 
 all birdkeeper be urge to remain vigilant and take action to protect their bird from avian influenza scrupulous biosecurity by all birdkeeper at all time be essential to protect the health and welfare of flock in response to the heighten risk level and escalate number of case an avian influenza prevention zone mandate enhance biosecurity be in force across england wales and scotland in addition mandatory housing for keep bird be in force across the unitary authority of the east riding of yorkshire the unitary authority of york the city of kingston upon hull and all district in lincolnshire norfolk and suffolk north yorkshire and shropshire to mitigate the risk of further outbreak of disease occur 
 in area where an aipz be in force it be a legal requirement for all birdkeeper whether they have pet bird commercial flock or just a few bird in a backyard flock to follow strict biosecurity measure to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease include when mandatory housing measure be a requirement of an aipz a requirement to keep their bird house the need for an aipz be keep under regular review as part of the government ’s work to monitor and manage the risk of avian influenza together with the devolved government we will closely monitor the need to extend mandatory housing to other area of the country 
 while avian influenza be primarily consider a disease of bird it can infect human although this be a very rare event in the uk and the risk to the general public remain very low nevertheless protect public health remain of paramount importance and defra and the apha work closely with regional uk health security agency health protection team to monitor the situation and provide health advice to person at infect premise and those who have be in close contact with infected wildlife as a precaution as a further reassurance the food standards agency have confirm that avian influenza pose a very low food safety risk for uk consumer properly cook poultry and poultry product include egg be safe to eat 
 defra and the apha will continue to work with birdkeeper who be on the frontline of this terrible disease compensation be pay for any healthy keep bird cull as the house will know compensation be update to involve early assessment of the number of healthy bird and swifter calculation of compensation that allow defra to provide early certainty about entitlement to compensation well reflect the impact of outbreak on premise and lead to swifter payment to help to stem any cash flow pressure 
 order i be sure that the minister have conclude his remark i call the shadow secretary of state 
 this be a very difficult time for birdkeeper and farmer particularly those whose bird have die or be cull and all those who have have to upend their flock and move they inside give the impact that do so can have on both the mental and economic resilience of individual i thank everyone who be involve in tackle avian influenza and be work tirelessly to prevent the spread of this disease include in my constituency 
 i thank the minister for his response i regret that the secretary of state have not make an oral statement on this important matter particularly in the light of the revelation that a farm worker have be infect with avian influenza i would have think that the secretary of state would have think to update the house however we have manage to secure this urgent question for which i be grateful on the subject of the farm worker infect with the virus in the west midland how be this person have they recover and have anyone else be infect what be the wide risk to human health 
 elsewhere of the large and most modern egg lay site in the country have be affect with more than a bird be cull give the site ’s significant role in process the uk ’s barn egg production what discussion be the minister have with the sector to mitigate the impact on supply will he please update we on his discussion with the devolved government about introduce similar restriction to those in england of course bird and indeed viruse do not recognise border how be he ensure that compensation be make without delay and how much be it cost be the department keep the scheme under review include the loss of profit for farmer and the conservation impact for zoos housing rare and critically endanger specie such as the bali starle at battersea zoo which i visit this week 
 we be also concern by report that the avian influenza vaccination taskforce have stall be that correct and if so why finally defra ministers 
 order the shadow minister be try my patience we have a lot of business to get through today and time limit be there for a reason i call the minister 
 i thank the shadow secretary of state for her important question i reassure she and the house that the individual in question be in my understanding make a full recovery but obviously we want to ensure that no be put at undue risk the advice be clear the only people at risk be those who be in very close proximity people should follow the guidance and advice 
 on mitigate sector supply my understanding be there be sufficient supply within the system although the right hon member be absolutely right to raise the point that it be a significant and large producer that be affect we be confident that supply be secure on work with the devolved administration my official be in regular contact as i say in my opening statement the situation be be constantly monitor 
 the right hon member will be familiar with the compensation arrangement because they be the same as when she and her colleague be in government they be design to control the disease but of course they be also absolutely important to secure cash flow for farmer 
 my recollection from previous bout of avian influenza be that there be serious problem with delay and with compensation because farmer who be try to do a preventive cull of their bird have to wait for an inspection to take place and if that inspection have not take place compensation would not be give therefore some bird die from avian influenza that should have be cull and some bird do not die but the compensation be not pay i would be grateful if the minister update the house on exactly what the new arrangement for compensation will be 
 my hon friend be absolutely right he will recall the terrible outbreak a few year ago when exactly those question be raise and as the shadow minister i ask similar question at the time the compensation arrangement be change by the previous government in a beneficial way and i be absolutely confident at the moment that the delay we see before be not happen but he raise an important point anyone who have a suspicion of an outbreak should report it as soon as possible and they should not be concern that they will suffer detriment from so do 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 farmer and vet will remember the outbreak which be the big we have see in the uk and which kill million of bird worldwide so this new outbreak be of huge concern for major reason 
 there be the impact on animal welfare not just the bird catch avian influenza and die or be cull but their have to be keep inside rather than be free range secondly there be the impact on farmer their business and their mental health as with any notifiable disease this be hugely stressful and it be hugely disruptive to business model what be we do to ensure that compensation and support be give to farmer quickly thirdly there be a huge potential impact on public health while we fully understand that there be a low public health risk at the moment this be a disease of bird we have just come out of covid-19 we know that if someone be infect with human flu and potentially get infect with avian influenza there be a risk that it become more infectious to human what discussion be the minister have with apha and the department of health and social care to monitor the genotype 
 let i deal with the of those question the hon gentleman be absolutely right of course there be concern but i can assure he and the house that the advice from the uk health security agency be that avian influenza be primarily a disease of bird and the risk to the health of the general public be very low however of course we be monitor it and genetic testing and sequence be available to we for that he be right about the impact on bird keeper and on farmer it be why the compensation scheme be in place and work we absolutely recognise the pressure on people and the effect on their mental health 
 have the minister assess the conservative government ’s underspend of the agriculture budget 
 we have indeed assess it of course it be extraordinary that that happen in term of what we be do the system be well resource to deal with these outbreak and we work in a cross party way on that 
 this outbreak be concern for the whole of norfolk and particularly for the bird rearer in broadland and fakenham but it highlight the critical importance of the animal and plant health agency in new haw and the plan for its full redevelopment do the government agree that that redevelopment be long overdue and if so will they commit to support it 
 i thank my hon friend and he be a friend for his concern of course this be of particular concern and interest to representative from the east of england and i share that concern we have discuss the future of weybridge and the investment many time before i gently point out that the conservative government have the opportunity over year to make that investment over £ have be allocate by this government and we will continue to make sure that the agency be properly resource 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 i do not think anybody would disagree with the comment by   the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew   about the redevelopment of the facility   at weybridge but i suspect that once avian influenza be in the wild bird population as it be here even the good facility in the world will struggle to contain it on disease containment i remember the absolutely heartbreaking experience of walk along beach in orkney and see dead body after dead body be the minister engage with the royal society for the protection of birds and other major organisation so that he can at least be aware of the impact on the wild bird population 
 i thank the chair of the select committee who be absolutely right we have hear harrowing account in this chamber of the experience in member local community the situation with wild bird be awful of course official and i be constantly in dialogue with those organisation but the truth be that in the wild bird population there be not much we can do about it 
 i have of the uk ’s large egg producer in my constituency however the other trend be that more bird be be keep in a domestic situation hen geese and duck how be the government monitor those who be not professional bird keeper and ensure that such situation be also subject to the necessary control and regulation 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right the importance of biosecurity can not be overstress that be the way to tackle this he be also right to say that amateur and small bird keeper be important and that be why they be bring within the registration scheme which be beneficial and welcome 
 scientist at the university of glasgow find last month that avian influenza can spread to horse without any symptom will the minister clarify how the government be monitor the spread of the virus among other specie 
 the hon lady be absolutely right we need to be very careful about that i can assure she that those be exactly the kind of discussion that i be have with official we be track that and have the technology these day to look closely at what be go on i will not go into the expert account on the floor of the house of how the serotype work but i be happy to put she in contact with official if she need more information 
 i thank the minster for his update to the house about the spread of avian flu i want to ask a couple question as this be happen in city as much as in rural area how be people who live in city be make aware that they should look out for dead or die bird so that we can get a more accurate reflection of where it be spread secondly what discussion have he have with departments of the scottish government to ensure that we have reliable and up to date datum across these island 
 the hon gentleman make strong point i think there be general awareness of and concern about what be go on it be important to say to people   that if they have concern and they see such thing they should report they on our work with the devolved administration we have a very strong structure that allow all the devolve administration to be involve so that we have a consistent framework 
 again we rely on the facility at the animal and plant health agency base in new haw in my constituency and we thank it for its work a few week ago i ask the minister if he would visit the site with i to see for himself the work that need to be do and the urgent need for massive investment in the site do we have to wait until the next urgent question or statement before he will take i up on my offer 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his invitation i have have numerous invitation last week i be in northumberland look at rural crime and this week i be at the fenland soil sustainability opportunity innovation learn conference i will add the hon gentleman ’s invitation to my list 
 for my daughter ’s birthday i take she to the wonderful birdland in gloucestershire which have hundred of different exotic and rare bird could the minister please tell i how he be go to support that type of business model and how he be go to keep staff and visitor safe 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his important question everything we do to stop the spread will help business such as the he describe some specific rule and regulation also apply in those particular case which i can make available to he if he wish 
 do the minister accept that avian influenza represent an existential threat to business such as kelly turkeys in my constituency paul kelly have call this the covid of the poultry industry do the minister accept that it be likely as with covid that the only way forward will be vaccination 
 the right hon gentleman raise an important point as he will be aware significant international trade issue be involve but as we look to a world in which we seem to have more and more of these case that be certainly something that we keep under consideration 
 i thank the government for their strong and fast response which i know will be a big reassurance for lot of the farming community impact may i ask the minister to provide a bit more detail about the support we be give not just to those who be directly impact now but to those who be understandably very deeply concerned about what this may mean for their business over the come month 
 i thank my hon friend for his very important question i can assure he that an entire apparatus be in place to ensure that all reassurance can be give to the kind of business that   the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale   describe from an animal welfare point of view we will ensure that everybody involve in the sector have the kind of   advice and support that be need if my hon friend have colleague who wish to look at the advice they should look at the webpage available on government website which be significant and thorough if people need advice they should not hesitate to come to my official or to i and we will point they in the right direction 
 i thank the minister very much for his response to the urgent question poultry and egg production contribute significantly to the northern ireland economy it be value at some £ so it be little wonder that the agricultural community have great concern what discussion have the minister have with the devolved nation particularly the northern ireland assembly about put in place the support that be need take into account that wild bird case have be find in the last week in northern ireland 
 i be as ever grateful to the hon gentleman for raise the issue as it impact northern ireland we have be develop a uk wide response to this and my official be in constant contact with official from his administration we will ensure that this uk wide response continue to be in place because it be very important that we work together on all these issue i hope in the not too distant future to continue my tour of the country and i very much look forward to take up his long stand invitation not only to stormont where i have be before but to his fishing sector and the very warm welcome that i know i will receive 
 order the sitting be suspend 
 sitting suspend 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make a statement on the woman ’s health strategy 
 i thank the hon lady for give i the opportunity to set out our commitment to the woman ’s health strategy and everything that this government be do to fix our break nhs clean up the mess that the conservatives leave after year and get woman treat on time again 
 when we come into office we inherit record waiting list the gynaecology waiting list stand at just under woman let that sink in—600,000 woman in pain wait to be care for almost half the woman on gynaecology waiting list be wait more than week that be why the prime minister kick off with our elective reform plan set out how we will cut the long waiting list from month to week our new agreement with the independent sector will mean that where there be spare capacity in the private sector woman will be treat fast for gynaecology care pay for by the state 
 the government be also commit to root out the appalling inequality in maternity care we be support fail trust to make rapid improvement train thousand more midwife for the time and we will set an explicit target to close the black and asian maternal mortality gap we be pilot a training programme to help avoid brain injury for baby in childbirth and if successful we will crack on with roll it out nationally this year in october we extend the baby loss certificate service to help mum and dad who have suffer the heartbreak of pregnancy loss 
 let i also address the issue of woman ’s health hub there be a target in last year ’s planning guidance to roll out pilot woman ’s health hub across the country by last december today there be at least hub and at least out of every10 integrate care system have an open woman ’s health hub 
 let i correct some fake news we be not close these hub we be not cut they the target to roll they out be in last year ’s planning guidance it be achieve in of integrate care system which be why the target be not repeat in this year ’s guidance it have be meet in out of area 
 today we have slimme down the number of target for the nhs so that we can focus on fix the fundamental the system that the previous government break we be instruct the nhs to prioritise cut waiting time for operation a&e and ambulance make it easy for people to see a gp or a dentist and improve the mental health of the nation that will mean around woman with suspect cancer be diagnose early and treat fast more than extra woman will be treat within week as we drive down long wait and few woman will be force to wait hour in a&e. that be the difference that a labour government be make to woman ’s health 
 for too long a woman ’s experience of the health service have be of be push from pillar to post crucially woman ’s voice have be ignore   and response to their pain suffering poor sex life and traumatic birth have be too slow overall woman have a sense of be forget some more woman be in work under our conservative government pain and suffering be affect too many woman and their ability to remain in the labour market result in early retirement or not have their true career potential fulfil 
 we take direct action crucially by listen to woman ’s experience we have almost response to our call for evidence on the gender health gap we appoint dame lesley regan as the woman ’s health ambassador and helen tomlinson as the cross government menopause ambassador to find out the experience of woman employ in different sector we deliver and fund new woman ’s health hub and create join up service in the community the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists estimate that remove the requirement of integrate care board to have a woman ’s health hub will impact woman on waiting list in england create long wait disease progression that could be prevent and result in more woman attend a&e unable to work care or live a fulfilled life 
 labour ’s manifesto say that it will prioritise woman ’s health woman be now report to be a lobby group relegate to be unheard once again will the minister confirm whether it be true that the target to deal with woman ’s need will be drop if so what be her justification for that will she be deliver on the roundly welcome woman ’s health strategy from 
 a total of family give evidence to the all party group on birth trauma what be the plan to drive up maternity safety standard across the country will there be a response to that will dame lesley regan be sack will she remain the woman ’s health ambassador or will she be replace as helen tomlinson be by someone who seem more interested in sell book than in deliver on the ground for woman what step be be be take on sex specific language in health communication and guidance 
 order the shadow minister will know that there be a time limit which she have exceed i have be very generous i call the minister 
 i address most of those point in my outline statement i think the shadow minister write her comment when the opposition think that we be cancel thing only to find out that we be not cancel thing i have make clear our commitment to the woman ’s health strategy and how we seek to instruct the system at a local level to serve the need of woman and particularly prioritise those waiting list as i have outline the target have already be achieve unusually i will give a bit of credit to the other side because a lot of this be roll out and it be good practice and the system still think that it be good practice so sometimes opposition members should take a win we be committed to that it be embed in the system and we look forward to outcome be improve for woman 
 i call the chair of the women and equalities committee 
 the committee report on woman ’s reproductive health start under our fantastic predecessor lay out how medical misogyny have leave far too many woman suffer woman have be leave undiagnosed for debilitate condition such as endometriosis for an average of year not for treatment for diagnosis black woman be to time more likely to die during childbirth and the rate of maternal death in the uk have rise by in the last year the lead cause of that be suicide account for of death in the year postpartum do the minister therefore agree that woman and woman of colour especially have bear the brunt too often of year of disastrous health policy how can the government reverse this trend 
 i thank the committee chair for her question i think she be congratulate the previous committee and chair rather than those who be now in opposition i be very pleased to witness some of that work when we be in opposition and she be absolutely right about it the work of many woman member when in opposition and to be fair of many woman in the previous government have make sure that issue around endometriosis have rise up the agenda indeed we have a good debate in the chamber recently we be committed to take forward the strategy we think the health hub for example be do a good job but there be a lot of learn to be do on they and we will continue to do that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 nearly woman be wait for treatment on gynaecology waiting list in england the long wait be lead to preventable disease progress and it be of the bad specialty for long wait the care quality commission have investigate and report that of maternity unit be not as safe as they should be that high number could almost be consider a public health crisis and it have lead to the high amount of negligent payout due to avoidable injury and even death this absolutely need to be address 
 many woman such as my partner emma have have to fight for year to get just a diagnosis for endometriosis let alone any treatment have be tell for year that the symptom be completely normal and do not need investigate in the government ’s 
 order i know i be be difficult on time limit but the liberal democrat spokes- person should have minute in an urgent question which the hon gentleman have already far exceed perhaps he will come up with a question in sentence for the minister 
 apology madam deputy speaker yes in sentence the government ’s manifesto rightly say that 
 never again will woman ’s health be neglect 
 can we have assurance that we will not remove the icb requirement to have woman ’s health hub 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight those long wait that be why we particularly highlight gynaecology for attention in the elective reform plan   it be shocking that the last government leave woman on these list and move back to make sure people wait no long than week will predominantly be help those woman 
 the hon gentleman be also right to highlight the appalling maternity situation the secretary of state and my noble friend baroness merron who lead in this area have meet many family to discuss their experience and we know those experience be unacceptable we know there be big issue around staffing and it be a priority to work with nhs england to make sure that we grow workforce capacity as quickly as possible so that we can be sure that those situation be safe there be many debate in this place about the issue and we will continue to update the house 
 under the last government time more research go into erectile dysfunction which affect of man than go into premenstrual syndrome which affect of woman woman be wait more than year for endometriosis diagnosis gps be not require to undertake a gynaecological rotation within their training woman ’s health must be put at the head of our agenda will the minister assure woman in this country that thing will change under this government 
 i absolutely will give my hon friend that assurance the situation will change partly because there be more people like she and more woman in this place we have more woman across all party raise this issue and more woman in senior position in the national institute for health and care research crucially we have woman lead in science and research deal with the misogyny around the system and in medical system be also important for make sure that woman lead this work we want to make sure that the nihr which have a strategy to address this issue rectify the situation that she outline 
 the minister will be aware of the ockenden report back in which highlight the tragic case of more than mother and baby who be kill over a period of year at the shrewsbury and telford hospital nhs trust donna ockenden recently return to the trust and say that she be surprised and disappoint to hear from those parent and family affect that the trust have not be communicate as well as it should have be and have not be update the family in a timely manner do the minister agree not only that communication be key but also that review such as those undertake by donna ockenden should have the remit to go back to check and monitor the progress of maternity service that be either improve or not 
 i completely agree with the right hon member donna ockenden ’s work be hugely valuable and a lot of faith and trust have be place in it particularly by family i do not know specific date but the secretary of state and my noble friend baroness merron who lead on this work have be discuss the matter with donna ockenden i be happy to get back to the right hon member with the detail 
 on the specific point about the remit i do not know the answer to that question it be entirely sensible to look at progress and learn from mistake i know it be a   challenge system and we have to learn from those area if there be specific thing to report back to the right hon member i will get back to he but this issue be absolutely a priority the secretary of state be meet family directly we know and understand that we have to do much well on this for everybody 
 have listen to the shadow minister i be slightly tempt to suggest to the minister that our woman ’s health strategy include provision for the treatment of collective memory loss the shadow minister completely ignore the fact that the tories let our nhs fall into disrepute over the past year 
 i want to ask specifically about how our health strategy will deal with treatment and support for young people particularly young woman suffer from depression and anxiety that follow a tragic case in my constituency and a coroner ’s report last week which find that our local hospital be not able to support that patient 
 my hon friend be right to highlight some tragic incident and i know she will be work hard on behalf of her constituent we be absolutely committed to the woman ’s health strategy clearly that will be take forward as part of the year plan and it be an important part of that i meet my noble friend baroness merron yesterday and the team support that plan to make sure that we understand how those key issue be take forward 
 this be an opportunity if i may madam deputy speaker to say that the consultation on that plan be still open for idea we be keen to hear in particular from young people to make sure that we get a true representation these sort of thing be not often consult on so we encourage young people and people who be suffer from depression and mental health issue to contribute their thought about the system they face as part of our year plan consultation 
 i be sure we all welcome the move to reduce waiting list and recognise that the woman ’s health strategy be a year plan but give the enormous problem highlight by   the hon member for luton north sarah owen   and my hon friend   the member for winchester dr chambers do the minister appreciate that to many woman who be have trouble access often fragment gynaecological service it will seem like a vital facility be about to be lose and that the government ’s promise of never again will sound hollow what will the government do to reassure all the woman who be concerned about this move 
 i be not entirely clear what the hon member be refer to i have be clear that we be committed to the woman ’s health strategy and we will take it forward as part of the year plan most of the—[interruption if it be about the woman ’s health hub they be mainly there but in different form and with different level of service we want to ensure that the system reflect their local population need that be an entirely proper way to go about thing 
 as i say unusually we think that many of the hub which be roll out as pilot under the previous administration be do a good job in most area although not everywhere so we want to learn from the pilot our commitment be absolutely to woman that be   why gynaecology waiting list be particularly target we have woman on they woman should feel really assure about the support that the government be give they and their health to prioritise their health we be keen to learn more about woman ’s health hub they will be different in different place because they have different population and that be entirely in keep with the direction of travel of the government 
 i also thank my hon friend   the member for luton north sarah owen   for her work in raise the serious health inequality that woman across the uk face every single day do the minister agree that we need more expertise in woman ’s health issue in primary care setting to ensure early diagnosis and that woman get the treatment they need at the early point 
 my hon friend make an excellent point about both the work of the chair of the select committee my hon friend   the member for luton north sarah owen and the importance of primary and community care recognise listen to and support woman through woman ’s health as well as make sure that our knowledge and good practice be spread across the team this be an area where different system have woman ’s health hub use different team and different technology and they have different link to secondary care colleague and specialist colleague by listen to each other and work together they be so good at spread some of that good practice 
 i welcome the minister come to the house to answer the urgent question because the argument she be put forward seem slightly confused woman ’s health hub seem to be work on the whole and there be lot of they so why remove the target for everybody to have they if we be already there secondly many of the hub seem to be do good work and good practice be clearly emerge so why cancel the target for the programme rather than spread that good practice throughout the system i think the broad question from the opposition be why remove the target specifically relate to woman from the government ’s agenda go forward it feel to many woman and to the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists which have be in contact with i that that downgrade the status of woman in the nhs 
 i will try to be brief but this be hard to explain—[interruption no this be to answer the right hon gentleman target in the nhs have not be meet since which be under his government ’s watch but actually this target have be meet there be only place in the country that do not have a hub so there be no target for they because that have already be meet the issue now be to look at the outcome from those hub to see how they be perform we think and the system think that they do a good job that be why they be stay why we be committed to they and why we want to learn from they
