i congratulate my right hon friend   the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis   on secure the debate i know how passionate he be about ensure that his constituent get what they   should from the send system and ensure that his granddaughter chloe get the support she need he make a powerful case for both before i go any far i formally congratulate he on the announcement of his knighthood which be a well deserve honour for his decade of public service 
 by way of background i be an mp in an f40 area so i be familiar with the case the organisation make and i meet the group towards the end of last year i have be child ’s minister since the end of august but in the year before be appoint to that position the issue of parent and teacher be unable to get the support they need for child with send be already in the top item in my casework and surgery appointment i pay my own tribute to all the staff support child with special educational need in school college and alternative provision both locally and nationally 
 the issue raise in the debate be very familiar to i in previous debate i have talk about parent have what they feel be a war of attrition with the system to try to get the support they need for their child that be a war that any parent would wage but no parent should have to we know the system be not deliver consistent support and outcome and that there be significant financial pressure on it despite considerable government investment 
 i will begin with investment and funding as that have be the big issue discuss this afternoon as have be touch on the government have increase the high need budget considerably in it will be £ which be high than the figure in in the past year there have be a increase in per head funding in the constituency of my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden most member would agree that that be a considerable amount of money as my hon friend   the member for bracknell james sunderland   say in his speech some member may only agree with that privately but not many government budget under any government or in any area have increase by which demonstrate the government ’s considerable support for and commitment to the area 
 we have programme support local authority that face financial pressure in their send system and a number of member in the chamber have local authority involve in those programme the safety valve programme which include local authority with the high percentage deficit help local authority pay down accumulate deficit and reform their system by march the department will have allocate nearly £ through that programme and if what we be try to deliver be deliver those deficit will be eradicate 
 secondly we have the deliver well value programme for those with substantial but less severe deficit which involve local authority include east riding of yorkshire in the area of my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden that be help to deliver high quality outcome with sustainable cost under that programme each area develop a reform plan and receive £ to support its delivery 
 as have be touch on the high need budget have double since but even if a government be able to triple or quadruple it that would not by itself deliver the outcome we all want to see parent and teacher   know that and frequently say that the issue be not just about money my hon friend   the member for mansfield ben bradley   make that point well in his speech and i intend to pick up with he the discussion about conflict priority 
 the system need reform which be why we publish our send and alternative provision improvement plan last year with the aim of get child and young people the right support in the right place at the right time there be a lot within the plan but i wish to draw out key area briefly because they be the one that have come up most this afternoon and be in the petition attach to this debate 
 on special school provision and capital funding which be raise by   the hon member for harrow west gareth thomas   and other we be make a £ investment £ of which have already be allocate that be on top of our delivery of new special and alternative provision free school there be currently special free school open and a further have be approve to open in the future 
 secondly on combat regional variation the plan will move we towards a national system with national standard which we have never previously have across the country we now have change programme partnership which each have between and local area together with local school health service and parent what they be do be for example test an ehcp template that we hope can be use nationally which will improve the timeliness and quality of ehcp we be develop national standard of support for special educational need begin with for speech and language which will be release later this year we be also publish a local and national inclusion dashboard which parent will be able to access they will be able to see how their local area be do which will drive accountability 
 thirdly my hon friend   the member for torbay kevin foster   ask about the skill and knowledge of staff in mainstream school our teacher standard already include clear expectation that teacher must understand the need of all pupil include those with special educational need but we be review the core content framework and the early career framework to improve their confidence in this area we have a universal send service programme which more than staff have already access to improve their knowledge and skill we be also fund the training of early year staff with a level senco qualification as my hon friend the chair of the education committee say some staff have begin that training so we be on track with that target 
 there be many other point that i want to respond to but i have only minute so i will just say to my right hon friend   the member for west suffolk matt hancock   and my hon friend the members for tewkesbury mr robertson for south west bedfordshire andrew selous for gedling tom randall for waveney peter aldous for aylesbury rob butler and other that i understand their point about regional variation it be base partly on deprivation and other factor and partly on the historical spend factor that have be refer to i be happy to sit down with anybody to talk about those thing 
 to   the hon member for sheffield hallam olivia blake i say that it be already the case that a school have to be outstanding in all area to receive an outstanding   grade from ofsted and it be not the case that we have a target for reduce ehcp or indeed any other such target 
 in conclusion i reiterate my thank to my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden for secure this debate and to all member who have contribute to it we may disagree on certain aspect of how to achieve this but we be unite in our desire to ensure that the send system provide excellent outcome to all child and young people and that be what this government be determined to deliver

 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of require venue to introduce a surcharge on large event ticket to support grassroots music venue 
 if she will take step to require arena stadium and major festival to charge a ticket levy to help fund grassroots live music 
 i pay tribute to my right hon friend   the member for maldon sir john whittingdale   for support my maternity leave the chance to raise a tiny child be fleeting and precious and his superb stewardship of my portfolio grant i that gift of my big worry on stand for election and then become a minister be that it might prove incompatible with start and now expand my family i simply say to other woman who want to get involve in public life do not be afraid there be a lot of talk of barrier but service and motherhood be compatible privilege as my right hon friend   the member for norwich north chloe smith   say so encouragingly to i you can do it 
 grassroot live music venue be the talent pipeline of our music industry we be support they with fund and rate relief we have no plan for a government mandate ticket levy but we encourage industry discussion 
 i welcome the minister back to her place in edinburgh we benefit from a plethora of small venue that depend on the edinburgh festival to survive we also have big event every year at the moment all the excitement even in my household be about taylor swift come to the city in june but we recognise that small venue the music venue trust say currently struggle to survive and depend on grant from it do not get any benefit from big gig will the government consider a levy to support small venue because without they we will never have the elton johns the queens and the taylor swifts who use they to learn their craft develop and benefit our economy and culture 
 the hon lady be absolutely right that grassroots venue be the talent incubator of the music industry she will be aware that the chancellor give a substantial amount of money at last year ’s budget up to £ for a new hub for the edinburgh fringe because of that talent pipeline for the edinburgh fringe and the edinburgh festival we be do what we can with various different pot of money but we also think there be room for the industry to find a solution on ticket levy we think it be probably good for the industry to do that rather than mandate it as a government 
 i welcome my hon friend back to her place in across the country not just in edinburgh live music boom with some people attend gig yet small venue close more than a week i draw the minister ’s attention to an analogy with another hugely successful leisure industry football where a small amount of the enormous rich gain by the premier league be allow to trickle down to the grassroot so that the future of the sport be preserve just as with football we have hugely profitable large arena where the superstar of today perform and create huge revenue a levy on the ticket from those sort of shows—[interruption i be sorry mr speaker i be very passionate about this would help small venue to produce the superstar of tomorrow so will the minister take a positive attitude towards a levy 
 my right hon friend have make his point well if not briefly we agree about the importance of grassroots music which be why we have give another £ to the support grassroots music fund but we be also in close touch with the music venue trust which have a great initiative call own our venue arts council england be help with the purchase of some of the freehold of these venue we support that as well but we think there be more scope for the industry to lead a solution and we be back talk between different part of the industry 
 let we hear from the industry i call pete wishart 
 the music industry be just about the most unequal sector in the whole of society those at the bottom the   vast majority earn an absolute pittance while those at the very top have unimaginable earning surely we should be do everything possible to try to change that it be the sensible option they do it in france and the scottish national party government be consider do it in scotland will the minister support that effort and initiative in scotland and if it show that it can help redistribute some of this money will she follow that example 
 i thank the hon gentleman for tell we what the scottish national party be do i have understand that it be cut a substantial amount from the art budget we have be support for instance the edinburgh grassroots hub i think there be a great deal of appetite in this place for a solution i also think that the good option be for those in the industry to get together and we be back discussion of that kind indeed before i go on leave i talk to mark davyd of the music venue trust about the issue 
 i too warmly welcome the minister back to her place she mention the £ for the support grassroots music fund and that be greatly welcome but let we be clear festival rehearsal space and independent promoter be also eligible for the fund that be a lot of mouth to feed they be all important part of the ecosystem and they all need fund in real term this be a tiny amount of money for grassroots music venue be my hon friend push the treasury to expand that funding to ensure that it can go far 
 i thank the hon lady for draw on her expertise in this regard and for the work that the select committee be do i be go to provide that dreadful answer ahead of the budget we will be discuss all these matter with the treasury 
 whether her department have make an assessment of the potential impact of tax relief on the growth of the creative industry 
 let i begin by welcome the minister back to her place since the conservative government have introduce tax relief for the creative industry year on year that be of the reason why the creative industry be grow at twice the rate of the rest of the economy and why they be world lead the labour party oppose every single of those tax relief and despite its warm word it offer no substantive action 
 as my right hon and learn friend say since we come to office we have introduce a number of tax relief that have support child 's television video game production gallery orchestra theatre and museum it be for the chancellor to decide on tax policy but can my right hon and learn friend tell we what more she can do to make this go far to ensure that we remain of the world ’s lead production venue 
 we have indeed introduce many tax relief and since we come to office i have instigate and back the introduction of tax relief and other support for the sector independent film making have be support with more than £ of government and national lottery funding and i have recently speak to representative of the independent sector to establish how we can provide further support however as my hon friend have point out matter of tax be ultimately matter for the chancellor 
 i have a suggestion for the minister when i meet several film television and advertising company in my constituency recently they point out that malta and mauritius have a rebate which also cover commercial and that ireland will be follow suit with a rebate on reality tv and game show these be the bread and butter product of the industry and they have a huge impact on local area where filming take place the uk be fall behind in this respect what discussion be the secretary of state have with the treasury and other colleague about the matter 
 i assure the hon lady that i have regular discussion with the treasury and the industry about how we can continue to support this vital sector we be not fall behind we be world lead and we need to maintain that competitive edge our screen sector tax relief be estimate to have deliver over new job and more than £ in economic output 
 what step she be take to help increase community access to play field 
 the government be commit to ensure that every community have the facility it need to make sport and physical activity accessible to all with over £ be invest by to develop thousand of state of the art community football pitch and multi use sport facility across the uk 
 udney park playing field in teddington in my constituency have go to rack and ruin over the past decade as successive developer have buy the site and quite rightly fail to build on it the udney park community fields foundation lead by jonathan dunn have campaign tirelessly to bring those field into community use because we desperately need more sport field in my constituency now the site be back on the market will the minister join i local sport group and the local authority in back the community ’s bid for the site will he also put in a friendly word with relevant ministers on the bid to the community ownership fund 
 i commend the hon lady for her commitment to improve sport facility in her local area and i commend all the volunteer like jonathan dunn who do a tremendous amount of work frankly without they we would not have so many people be   physically active the football foundation and sport england be always ready to discuss potential investment and i would be happy to provide the hon lady with those contact of course i will raise this issue with my colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities 
 the community sport area on tithe farm road in houghton regis be about to get an amazing new all weather facility fund by developer money town council money central bedfordshire council money and government money will the minister come to open the facility it be much need and should be celebrate 
 how could i possibly resist such an invitation it be always a great honour to open facility in this role and i be delighted that we be so busy that we be open thousand of they 
 what step her department be take to support local journalism 
 we recognise that local medium face serious challenge to their sustainability our digital market legislation will help to rebalance the relationship between publisher and platform and the government have be explore the role of the bbc in local news through the mid term charter review we continue to consider all possible option in the interest of promote and sustain local newspaper because we think they be vital pillar of the community and of a thriving democracy 
 low pay and job insecurity be rife in local journalism there have recently be big redundancy at my local paper the evening chronicle which have lose a of its news reporter and half its sport reporter over a year period mean that my constituent get less local news less coverage of emergency incident and less coverage of their beloved sport team what further step will the minister take to address the issue of retain career in local journalism 
 i thank the hon lady for raise these issue i know that sustain a good financially beneficial career be a concern for many people work in journalism before i go on leave i meet reach and other local newspaper group to talk about some of the challenge they face the government be do what we can through our ad spend and we have look at various thing over the year include rating of vat rate relief and so on to try to help the sustainability of the local newspaper model ultimately sustainability be at the heart of the challenge of give local journalist place to have good career we be encourage the bbc ’s local democracy report service which give journalist opportunity beyond local newspaper 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the minister back to her place the government be of the big advertiser in the uk yet when it come to place advert and campaign local paper   such as the barnsley chronicle can be overlook in favour of buy ad space online many people in this country do not have digital access or still rely on print medium as their primary source of news and information and our local paper be struggle what step be the minister take to ensure that the government ’s policy on place advert support the interest of both our press and the public 
 i thank the hon lady for highlight this issue which the cabinet office lead on the dcms have be in talk with the cabinet office about that spend as i say i have speak to group such as reach about this previously i be in the cabinet office during the pandemic when some large advert be use and some of the issue face be about regularity the government spend a large amount of money with local newspaper because of that audience reach because of old readership and so on so the government do a lot in this area but i appreciate that there be always more we can look to do and i understand the point she be make about online advertising 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on develop new sport facility in devon and cornwall 
 as i mention a moment ago the government be invest in facility up and down the country i be pleased to say that the multi sport grassroots facility programme have invest through the football foundation more than £ since across devon and cornwall support project so far with equipment 
 group such as the torquay athletic club do great work in coach and encourage young people across torbay to participate in sport yet there be no synthetic metre track and field athletic facility suitable for high level training in our bay what opportunity do the minister see for get such a facility in torbay to address that need 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue it be vital that community have access to the right facility in order to help we meet our target of have more than more people be active by sport england have provide more than £ to support grassroots project in the region i would be happy to share a full list of the available fund that be open for he to have a look at let i also add my thank to his constituent for the work they be do in get people more active 
 what step her department be take to tackle loneliness 
 since the tackle loneliness strategy launch in the government   and their partner have invest more than £ in tackle loneliness the annual report include new cross government commitment and update on progress on thing include in that report be due to be publish in march 
 severe cut have leave a £ gap in adult social care funding more than lonely and isolate elderly people now rely on charity such as re engage which i volunteer with to plug that gap i know that the minister do care about this but surely he must recognise that those cut and their lead to that rise in desperate loneliness be because of this government 
 let i pay tribute to the hon lady for the work she do with those charity the partnership between government and charity have make the uk of the world ’s lead country on tackle loneliness that be why in the budget in we announce £ of support for charity and community organisation recognise the challenge they face and pay tribute to they for the work they be do in tackle this important issue 
 i call the shadow minister 
 when the government release their national strategy in we have a far more limited understanding of loneliness its consequence and the effectiveness of intervention than we do now however despite year of hard work and good initiative the problem have get bad the level of loneliness have rise by half a since as my hon friend   the member for south shields mrs lewell buck   say the pandemic and now the cost of living crisis have create new pressure and with charity and local authority face high demand and rise cost it be increasingly difficult for they to respond give all those challenge what have the minister do to prepare for a refreshed national strategy to tackle loneliness 
 this be a complex area and a lot of the research do since the strategy be launch in have help we to understand the issue in a lot more detail chronic loneliness have remain at about the same level but there be still more work to be do that be why we be now take very target approach to specific demographic within our society i be also convene a cross government meeting of ministers from across departments to see what more we can do to make sure we be meet our strategy ambition 
 what step her department be take to support local community and special interest group in protect heritage asset 
 dcms welcome application through historic england for local heritage asset to be consider for designation we be also commit to support community to care for their local heritage asset include   through historic england ’s repair grant for heritage at risk and the national lottery heritage fund ’s grant for heritage 
 with both raf northolt and the battle of britain bunker in the heart of my constituency the people of uxbridge and south ruislip share incredibly deep tie with the world war especially in the context of the royal air force as the anniversary of the battle of britain approach would my hon friend meet i and other local group dedicate to preserve the important fabric of both of these valuable heritage site to ensure all be do for they to continue to stand as testament to the bravery of the few who preserve our freedom 
 my constituency share deep tie with my hon friend ’s as raf hornchurch be in my constituency some raf fighter base there join in the battle of britain protect london and our nation at a time   of deep terror we have a fantastic local museum at raf hornchurch if i may just give it a plug that be run by volunteer and be an absolute treasure trove i recommend it i understand that my hon friend have meet with the parliamentary under secretary of state lord parkinson of whitley bay who be responsible for art and heritage but i understand that we will also have an opportunity to debate the subject in great detail next week and i look forward to that 
 hadrian ’s wall run through the heart of newcastle ’s west end but it be little celebrated or signpost and the hadrian ’s wall national trail do not actually follow the wall ’s path through my constituency what help can the minister offer to local community keen to celebrate this history which be literally in their backyard 
 i be not aware of this outrageous oversight on path and signage so i will raise it with lord parkinson at the next opportunity 
 i call the father of the house 
 will the minister help the heritage of victoria tower gardens and the voluntary organisation london parks gardens trust and the thorney island society by get the uk holocaust memorial foundation to unredact the minute of december so that i can quote they when i appear at the hybrid bill committee on wednesday 
 i confess i be not sure about the issue my hon friend refer to so i will do some investigation and we will see what the department can do to facilitate his request 
 i thank the minister for her positive answer it be good to see she back in her place 
 we have some incredible heritage in strangford which go back long before ards and north down borough council be bring together the council have some idea for promote and world war heritage at the somme museum at conlig have any discussion   take place with ards and north down borough council to ensure that our heritage be retain for everyone culturally historically and visually 
 i have just be inform that my ministerial colleague have a very positive visit to the hon gentleman ’s constituency i be sure he always offer a good time in northern ireland i will ask if there have be any discussion with his local authority on that basis 
 what step she be take to support uk musician seek to tour in europe 
 i be still feel slightly embarrassed by my answer to   the hon member for strangford jim shannon 
 we have engage with eu member state to clarify guidance and where possible improve arrangement when for eu touring the vast majority of eu member states—23 of the offer visa and permit free route to touring we be always look at what more we can do include through the music export growth scheme which be be triple to £ over the next year 
 glasgow north be home to many talented musician some of whom play in scotland ’s world class orchestra but the association of british orchestras have warn that the removal of tax credit for performance in the european economic area be a direct result of brexit and could make touring in europe unviable for orchestra what be the minister ’s message to my constituent whose ability to tour in europe be be sacrifice on the altar of brexit fundamentalism 
 unlike the snp we actually listen to what people say in referenda so i be afraid we will not be rejoin the eu and therefore we can not have special tax privilege on that basis dcms be aware of the concern of tour orchestra we be facilitate discussion with his majesty ’s revenue and customs so the orchestra know precisely where they stand on some of the issue they have raise 
 what step her department be take to support the growth of the film and television industry 
 we have see significant growth in the film and tv industry the support that we have take include reform to audiovisual tax relief uplift for animation and child ’s tv and £ of investment in the uk global screen fund as i have say the labour party vote against all our tax relief and as far as i be aware have offer no funding to those industry 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for her answer she will know that there be now more studio space for feature film production in the home county than there be in hollywood however   there be a vulnerability we find that out at the time of the american writer and actor strike when a number of my friend and many other people who be not my friend be make redundant temporarily because film production halt how can we make the british film industry more independent of the american production machine 
 i know that my hon friend be himself a veteran of the silver screen appear in the brilliant british house of cards our film industry be world lead he be right that the strike cause disruption we work very closely with our partner in other jurisdiction example be the international hit film barbie which be film in the uk support job add £ to our economy and earn more than £ at the global box office we need to ensure that the film industry could continue to thrive after the strike which be why we be continue to support the industry with tax incentive fund pot and importantly the development of a skill pipeline to ensure success long into the future 
 whether she have have recent discussion with the bbc board on the impartiality of the bbc ’s current affair coverage 
 the bbc have a duty to deliver its impartial and accurate news and current affair coverage under its royal charter it be editorially independent which mean that editorial policy be a matter for the bbc but both the secretary of state and i regularly meet the bbc ’s leadership team we have discuss the important issue of impartiality on multiple occasion it be also a key focus of the government ’s mid term review of the bbc ’s governance and regulation 
 as a former bbc journalist myself i completely believe in its editorial independence from the government but just as strongly i consider it essential that the bbc across all its programming and from all presenter should be absolutely and unequivocally impartial give the concern that we have hear about the current coverage of israel and the occupied palestinian territories the reporting of the resignation of the president of harvard and example of where ofcom have find significant editorial failing do my hon friend agree that the bbc need to work consistently constantly and visibly to enforce that requirement on impartiality 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he be absolutely right trust be the bbc ’s currency that be especially important in relation to its international coverage particularly during conflict so it must use its word with care with regard to the event in israel and gaza the government have be clear that the bbc should reflect on its coverage and learn lesson for the future but of course we again emphasise impartiality and the high editorial standard that be a strategic priority of the bbc ’s leadership and we be talk to they about this in relation to the mid term review and licensing renewal 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 as an ex bbc reporter i be in awe of my former colleague bravery and impartiality when they cover world affair we have all follow with horror the israeli bombardment of gaza reporter without borders say that it appear that israel be now directly target journalist the al jazeera bureau chief have have child kill include his journalist son what unimaginable pain another palestinian journalist ayat khaddoura say 
 when will this war end who will tell the world what we go through and what we see 
 i bring her question to the house as she be no long alive to do so can the minister share with journalist across the world how the government ’s refusal to call for a ceasefire be advance the cause of journalistic freedom or peace in the region and can she tell we who the government ’s position have persuade apart from those on the labour front bench who remain limpet close to the tory position on gaza as on so many other issue 
 that question be a long way from the impartiality of the bbc we must ensure that we stick to the subject of the question i suggest to the hon gentleman that topical would have be a much well place for his question minister can you pick out the part that you need to 
 i simply wish to pay tribute to every journalist who put their life on the line to bring truth to the public ’s attention they play an incredibly important role we be proud of what the bbc journalist do in particular they have also do some awesome thing in ukraine as a government we just want to say that we support their work and pay tribute to they 
 what progress she have make on increase woman and girl access to sport 
 woman and girl should have exactly the same access to sport as boy and man that be why we support the recommendation in karen carney ’s excellent report it be why we be invest £ to boost equal access to sport and why we recently announce £ for the lionesses futures fund to deliver pitch across the country with priority access for woman and girl with further opportunity for woman and girl 
 we have have fantastic success with woman ’s football particularly the lioness include harrogate ’s rachel daly who have be a great inspiration locally but what step be my right hon and learn friend take to ensure that sport with a small following can sustain a competitive grassroots environment for girl 
 i recognise rachel ’s success as the top scorer in the woman ’s super league last year we support sport at every level sport england ’s this girl can campaign fund by the government inspire million   of woman and girl to get involve in all sport the school games programme also fund by the government encourage child to take up sport and get active 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 unfortunately in recent week there have be a spate of disgusting sexist misogynistic abuse direct towards sportswomen just for be at the top of their game i know that the under secretary of state for culture media and sport   the right hon member for pudsey stuart andrew have be on the receiving end just for stand up to it which i commend he for i agree with he that vile misogynistic comment be dangerous the reality be that they be put woman and girl off sport do the secretary of state agree that every sporting organisation should have a strategy to eliminate all form of sexual harassment and abuse 
 i agree with the hon member we should not have misogynistic bully behaviour in sport and all govern body should be look at what their sport be do we set out in our sport strategy how we should have fair competition and integrity in sport 
 the secretary of state mention the carney review but i be afraid that the government seem to be fail woman ’s football on that with a complete lack of detail about how the implementation group to put into practice the carney review recommendation will work without senior leadership that group will not have the tooth that it need and all the hard work will be put at risk fan player and club deserve urgent action and leadership from the top if the secretary of state do not reform the woman ’s game and give it the same prominence as the man ’ i will will she commit to chair the implementation group and report back to parliament so that mps can hold she to account 
 i completely dispute what the hon member say about our support for woman in sport and woman in football i have have the pleasure of meet karen carney on a number of occasion her report be excellent we endorse all its recommendation many of which be for the fa which i have also speak to on this subject i will ensure that the recommendation be fulfil the implementation board will have all the govern body on it its meeting be in march i will keep a very close eye on the board and will work very closely with my right hon friend the under secretary on that and every other issue 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 as draw to a close official statistic highlight that under this government the creative industry continue to thrive they now employ almost worker a growth of so we be well on our way to meet our objective to grow the creative industry by £ and increase employment by by 
 local commercial radio whether in lancashire or suffolk can fill the gap leave by the reduction in bbc local radio coverage but in the lowestoft and waveney area it be constrain in do so as the local digital audio broadcasting network have not be extend to cover the area please can my right hon and learn friend arrange for that important infrastructure which be available throughout most of the uk to be extend to north east suffolk as soon as possible 
 i completely agree with my hon friend on the importance of local radio to listener across the uk and i know that he be an effective campaigner for his local area the bbc and commercial radio be responsible for the operation of their respective radio network include the dab radio network but i have ask my official to engage with local dab multiplex operator and broadcaster to look at whether there be a desire to increase local dab coverage far 
 do the secretary of state agree that in the medium world content be king and that that be why we must support our world lead creative talent will she take step to require artificial intelligence developer to provide songwriter and composer with detailed information as to how their work be be use include when authorisation have be grant for use of those work as train datum 
 the right hon member be absolutely right about the importance of protect the original work of the creative industry i have hold a number of roundtable to ensure that we protect that originality the intellectual property office be work on that very issue and i have be liaise with it and with the secretary of state for science innovation and technology 
 the secretary of state will be aware that the premier league and the english football league have hold meeting and yet have fail to come up with a solution for a fairer redistribution of funding give their inability to come to an agreement will she get the side together round the table she be probably already do it to encourage they to come up with a solution fail that if legislation be necessary will she consider it because we do not want to see any club go under 
 it be absolutely right that a deal should be do the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my right hon friend   the member for pudsey stuart andrew and i have be encourage all the authority to come to an arrangement we have be clear that if no arrangement be reach there will obviously be a backstop in the legislation for the football regulator that we will bring forward to the house shortly 
 as the secretary of state will be aware charity be face an extremely challenging fundraising environment and at the same time be try to respond to increase demand due to the cost of living crisis will she explain why the government continue to impose sale restriction on charity lottery fundraising the removal of which would not cost the treasury a single penny but would   ensure much need additional fund for charitable cause that would hugely benefit community in my constituency and across the whole uk

 the daily mirror report at the weekend that the conservative party be already spend more on the prime minister ’s facebook page and advert than donald trump be spend on his so the motivation for double the party spending limit be pretty clear already if this can not be stop can the commission at least do more to increase transparency so that people can see this shoddy attempt to buy democracy for what it be 
 the commission have say that any change to spending reporting threshold should be support by rigorous analysis which of course be for the government to publish include of the likely impact on public confidence and transparency the commission continue to make the case for change to the political finance system to far improve public trust and confidence

 the provisional business for the week commence   january   include

 happy new year to you mr speaker to staff to member and to those watch it might be a new year but i be afraid it be the same old story a government who have run out of road and idea and who be not fix the problem we face but make they bad many on the leader of the house ’s own side have reach the same conclusion yet another mp have resign have lose trust another have admit that over their year thing have get bad and a former immigration minister be take to the airwave to say that their rwanda plan will not work and it be only the week back 
 but some thing have change the prime minister seem to have have a dramatic reversal in strategy despite just month ago rather laughably say that he be the change candidate his late reset confirm what we all know he be now just offer more of the same more of the same low growth more of the same high taxis more of the same backlog and broken public service and more of the same historically low living standard only this hapless prime minister would set himself target that be hard to miss and then miss they 
 we have further confirmation today with new figure from the bbc show every nhs target miss and not just this past year when the government want to blame the strike or since the pandemic which might be a little understandable no key nhs target have be miss in each and every of the past year that be the half of their time in office after all their decision and policy take effect that be the record of this government let we have that debate in this election year about the choice the voter will face more of the same failure from the conservatives or change and hope with labour 
 turn to the sub postmaster scandal we welcome the government ’s announcement of emergency legislation to quickly pardon those wrongfully convict and we   stand ready to work with they what have now come to wide public attention be the travesty injustice and decade of struggle they face will the leader of the house give we more detail today and assure we that as the spotlight inevitably move on the government will not take their foot off the gas in get urgent justice redress and accountability 
 the issue go wide it follow a pattern similar to other injustice in which the state or corporate cover up have wrong ordinary people such as windrush infected blood build safety and grenfell hillsborough and more all those case transpire over decade come to public awareness after the notable effort of back benchers and dog journalist work with the victim today ’s government should be learn wide lesson 
 recourse and redress prove every time to be incredibly difficult lengthy and costly fight against powerful organisation that employ smoke and mirror expensive lawyer and enjoy the protection of the establishment leave victim face year and year of frustrating battle no amount of money can compensate for a life ruin how be the government collectively review these recent scandal to make it easy for group action against vested interest 
 will the leader of the house ensure that the government also expedite compensation for the windrush scheme and victim of infected blood who be still be frustrate pay out for the remediation of build safety where innocent leaseholder be still leave in limbo and bring in a legal duty of candour as demand by the hillsborough family be justice delay not justice deny 
 another big learning be for accountability time and again we see those responsible rewarded for failure and not hold accountable for their failing with more government contract bonus gong and peerage and the cost pick up by the taxpayer i have ask the leader of the house this before but will she make it easy for parliament to strip people of honour and peerage when they be find responsible for serious failing will she also condemn the practice as we see over the new year of honour be award for failure 
 will the leader of the house bring forward proposal to go after those responsible to pay financially and face the consequence will she put an end to the revolving door of award government contract in the case of fujitsu the contract be apparently worth several pound be it any wonder that trust in politic have be so erode when people do not see any accountability and when ordinary people pick up the bill while those responsible get off scot free 
 happy new year to you mr speaker and to all colleague this week i be delighted to welcome holocaust survivor mala tribich to the commons where she view the exhibition in portcullis house i encourage all member to see it 
 i be sure that i speak for the whole house in say that our thought remain with the hostage still keep captive in gaza next week see we pass the day since they be take just as our thought remain with all the innocent people catch up in those event 
 may i also give a shout out to the royal navy ’s rowing team hms oardacious who be row across the atlantic for mental health support with just nautical mile to go they may land before next week ’s business question and they be currently mile ahead of the next team 
 i turn to the substantive issue that the hon lady raise the post office scandal she will know about the exist legislation announce on   november but it be to be welcome that we be now take unprecedented step to quash conviction that work be well under way and we want to bring it to the house swiftly the house will be aware of the risk outline by the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend   the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake but i think we will find they necessary 
 while the inquiry will look at some of the issue raise in this place the hon lady be right that we should reflect now on what we could learn and in particular what we should conclude about the power give to arm ’s length body of the state and what operational independence should mean for those organisation subsequent conservative administrations have be right in grip and try to resolve some difficult and long run issue from windrush to the apology give by the noble lord cameron to the hillsborough family the apology give by the current prime minister to former member of our armed force who have be sham and drive out of service for be gay and the infected blood inquiry and the later compensation study which will make some amend for the decade of injustice and suffering that those people have endure i be optimistic that we will reach some justice for those affect this year i know that the paymaster general be work hard to do that 
 we be right to have a full public inquiry into the horizon post office scandal and we have rightly hear much about that this week include in statement and urgent question i pay tribute to all right hon and hon member and to the noble lord arbuthnot for the work they have do on this issue i also pay tribute to the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton in as a back bencher he be fight hard for sub postmaster and he have diligently pursue this issue in his ministerial role that be his record on this issue and on much else too i remind the house that when he be chair of the all party parliamentary group on fair business banking he help people whose business have be deliberately and cynically destroy by their lender win compensation from lloyds hbos and royal bank of scotland to the tune of hundred of million of pound he be a very good man and i know that he will bring forward legislation on this issue quickly 
 the hon lady mention nhs performance datum monthly performance data show that in november overall waiting list fall by more than from october down to there be also few patient wait for care in november than in the previous month and few than in september we have some difficult issue to deal with post pandemic but the prime minister ’s plan be work and the new secretary of state for health be bring forward further measure as the hon lady will know we have stand up an enormous number of new service and new healthcare professional as well as immense number of new diagnostic centre and we be vastly increase the number of operation that can take place 
 i do not wish to take any lecture from the hon lady on performance in the nhs i point she to what labour be do in wales where i think the current situation in   term of waiting list be time bad than in england nor will i take any lesson on tax from a party that be clobber british citizen where it be in power it be double rate in wales and its london mayor be clobber hard work people and charity with the ultra low emission zone he have just capitulate to the militant trade union on transport but do not know where to find the money to do that labour be soft on crime the met ’s £ black hole in its budget demonstrate that time and again where labour be in power it show that it be not on the side of the british people 
 i call the father of the house 
 my right hon friend rightly mention the holocaust exhibition and you mr speaker will lead the holocaust service in a few day time recently i meet holocaust survivor anita lasker wallfisch who say that the propose memorial in victoria tower gardens be too small for its purpose and too large for the park 
 the hybrid committee will meet on tuesday and wednesday next week will my right hon friend consider talk to the department for culture media and sport and the department for levelling up housing and communities to see whether they could put up scaffold on a temporary basis to show the amount of space take by the box of the so call learning centre and perhaps some plywood board to illustrate the fin that be suppose to be there then we could go round the outside of the park to see whether it be visible and see from inside how much damage it do to that well love park 
 i know that my hon friend continue to press on this particular project he will know that i be limited in what i can do to assist he but i will write to the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities to make sure that he have hear again what my hon friend have say 
 i call the scottish national party spokes- person 
 bliadhna mhath ùr happy new year to you mr speaker and to everyone in this place and watching 
 some positive news to start our business question of recent datum from the office for national statistics and the scottish parliament information centre the commons library equivalent show that scotland ’s gender pay gap be at a record low and almost half that of the uk as a whole woman ’s weekly full time pay have rise more than in the last year any gap be of course too high but i be sure that the leader of the house would like to acknowledge the scottish government ’s gender pay gap action plan the in the uk which undoubtedly have help to achieve those welcome result 
 the leader of the house ’s government could take several step to help end the gender pay gap and advance equality right across these isle after repeatedly shelve the employment bill they could finally act to make workplace fair particularly in the current cost of living crisis which we know impact woman more they could legislate for mandatory gender and ethnicity pay   gap reporting they could finally deliver compensation for waspi woman women against state pension inequality who have wait far too long to receive justice more broadly they could tackle the gender pension gap as yearly income among pensioner be on average more than £ low for woman 
 while the leader of the house consider her response to those suggestion could she also respond to report in the medium that her government block a minority ethnic woman from join the board of channel without offer a reason i be curious to hear what action she take in response to the recent comment by the home secretary and whether she will condemn they now they do nothing to dispel perception that a culture of misogyny in the uk government be hamper progress on these issue as she be a former minister for women and equality i be sure that these matter be close to her heart so will she support a debate on they where perhaps some solution might finally be agree 
 i also wish the hon lady a very happy new year i do welcome the good news on the gender pay gap in scotland it be nice to see the snp champion some good progress in scotland and give credit where it be due 
 with regard to the uk government ’s record we be make good progress since we have an additional woman in work as the author of the woman in work road map which look at every aspect of a woman ’s life and try to address the reason why she be financially disadvantaged right through her life from when she leave school through raise a family to the pension gap i know that this government be commit to deliver on those disparity 
 the hon lady raise the issue of channel i do not know the answer to that today but i shall certainly ensure that the relevant department have hear what she say 
 the hon lady will know what the home secretary have say about the other matter she raise i hope she also know that the home secretary be a very decent fellow who love his wife greatly they have be through a lot in recent year as a couple and the hon lady will also know that 
 i will conclude by add some further good news about scotland which i hope the hon lady will welcome i be delighted that part of the stone of destiny have be recover from snp headquarters i be sure that be a great relief to all member it be easy to lose thing i know like a couple of quid from your budget but i be sorry to hear that the snp have take as much care of it as it have take as the steward of scotland ’s public service happily the tupperware container it be store in have protect it during its stay and the police raid on that premise i join my scottish colleague in encourage the snp to find a more suitable home for it 
 traditional craft skill provide job and sustain business they also emphasise our share history everything from wheelwright to weaver and from corsetry to carpentry it be therefore very good news that after a long campaign by the all party parliamentary group for craft which i chair the government announce that our country will now join the unesco convention   for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage will the leader of the house bring a statement to the house say when we will join which will allow colleague across the chamber to question what far step the government might take to promote the expertise and experience that epitomise the good of britain

 i know that many member have constituent who be still wait for compensation or the resolution of issue on a number of front i shall not repeat what i say in response to the shadow leader of the house but i will say that i shall ask the cabinet office what more the head of the civil service can do to ensure that lesson be learn from the last few week in particular i know that the cabinet office evaluate inquiry to try to improve the quality of subsequent work that have certainly happen in connection with big public inquiry when it have look into what constitute good practice in respect of everything from look after witness to ensure that those inquiry take place speedily however i will ensure that the relevant people in the cabinet office have hear the hon lady ’s concern which i be sure be echo by many other member on both side of the house 
 on   friday february   my private member ’s bill the hereditary titles female succession bill be due to be debate but sadly it be no on the order paper and i fear that we may not have much time in which to debate it i wonder whether the leader of the house could allocate government time for a debate on the constitutional sexism which mean that an of the seat in the other place be reserve for man through such a debate we might be able to seek government support and also demonstrate the strength of feeling on both side of the house that this constitutional sexism need to end 
 hear hear 
 my hon friend will have hear that expression of support for her bill from member in all part of the house i congratulate she on her diligence i know that she have be work with the cabinet office for several year to ensure that any impediment to her bill ’s progress be deal with it be a very narrow bill which do not deal with any other issue such as inheritance 
 i will certainly ensure that the relevant minister at the cabinet office be aware that the bill be on the order paper i know that my hon friend be have discussion with many ministers about it and if i can facilitate any of those conversation i stand ready to do so 
 more than hospitality venue close each day in the uk before christmas i visit the wonderful abbey deli in bath to hear about the challenge that hospitality business face in my constituency i be tell that solution might be a slide scale of vat which could result in both more tax revenue for the government and high profit for small business can we have a statement from the relevant minister on what the government will do to support hospitality business in 
 the hon lady raise an important issue she will know that the treasury in particular have be very concerned about this sector to which it provide particular support through the pandemic year since then it have continue to support the sector through rate relief and so forth i fully appreciate that vat threshold be a particular problem for these type of business and i will make sure that my right hon friend the chancellor have hear what she say the hon lady be a very experienced parliamentarian and she will know what she can do as we approach the budget to ensure that these issue be address 
 my right hon friend have refer to arm ’s length government agency of which the post office be just i be sure that member across the house will have experience of track down decision maker within these organisation to hold they to account on behalf of our constituent can we have a debate on the accountability of these agency it may emerge from that debate how we can make they more accountable 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that suggestion i think it would be a very timely debate indeed i have already express my view on the subject and i know that on monday the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend   the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake speak about how accountability be key to ensure good oversight of arm ’s length body 
 my hon friend   the member for cleethorpes martin vickers   know how to apply for a debate and i be sure it would be well attend 
 my constituent mr richard troote have to wait over month to receive from his majesty ’s revenue and customs a national insurance refund worth more than £ for the tax year hmrc still have not respond to his complaint or indeed his request for a complaint on the refund   could the leader of the house ask for a write statement on what treasury ministers will do to provide more support to hmrc civil servant to try to deal with these backlog in a cost of living crisis none of our constituent can afford to wait month for these refund it be not acceptable 
 i agree with what the hon gentleman say money owe by hmrc accrue interest but that arrangement be not reciprocal as treasury question will not be until later next month i will write to the treasury if he give i detail of the case hopefully we will be able to get this resolve swiftly for his constituent 
 can we have a debate on bus priority measure so that i can express my constituent strong opposition to the proposal by barnet council and the mayor of london to introduce bus lane on the a1000 in high barnet and whetstone they will cause huge congestion they will damage local business and they be not need or want 
 my right hon friend be right that any such proposal should really be develop with input from the local community and something have go wrong if the community be so galvanised against a scheme that be due to come to the area the next transport question be not until   february but i will make sure that the secretary of state know about her concern i be afraid that the mayor of london be the decision maker and i hope he will listen to she and her constituent 
 when we ask write question and when our office require information from government departments our constituent expect a comprehensive response however we be get standardised response from uk visas and immigration in particular we have desperate people who fear for their future so will the leader of the house talk to the home office about how we can have comprehensive response so that we can know the timeline the detail and the reason for the delay in processing case
