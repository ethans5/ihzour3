the secretary of state be ask 
 whether she have have discussion with the welsh government on the potential impact of the propose visitor levy on the economy in wales 
 in british resident take over overnight trip in wales and during these trip they spend a total of £ wales ’s tourism sector be thrive as be clear to see last month during the visit of the under secretary of state for wales my hon friend   the member for llanelli dame nia griffith to elan valley lakes which will benefit from an £ investment from both the uk and welsh governments accord to the welsh government if a visitor levy be to be introduce by all welsh authority that could potentially raise up to £ 
 with the welsh bottle deposit scheme go down the same disastrous dead end as the scottish bottle deposit scheme and now more cost be be add to welsh tourism make staycation more expensive the government appear to be create a hostile environment for business add in the review of the uk internal market which be mean to make do business across this great land of ours easy why be the government loosen the bond of our great union 
 wales be the good recycling nation in the whole world 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 attack the welsh hospitality sector with the welsh government ’s disastrous tourism tax be supposedly a good plan yet their impact assessment warn of a potential loss of over a quarter of a pound of taxpayer money meanwhile last week labour pull the plug on funding for the western gateway a vital scheme focus on boost the welsh economy can the secretary of state now explain to taxpayer what the £ will actually do for cardiff airport and do she regret both government decision today the chief executive officer of bristol airport have openly voice huge concern about the welsh labour government ’s decision to spend the money on cardiff airport with no obvious benefit or transparency a move cost each welsh household an additional £ 
 investment in cardiff airport be a matter for the welsh government i recognise the importance of cardiff airport to the economy of the south wales region with thousand of job stem from the airport and the economic ecosystem support by it airline such as tui and vueling have recently add several new destination and extra flight from cardiff airport in the light of the welsh government ’s sustain support for welsh tourism i be delighted to welcome today ’s news that tui be expand its service at cardiff with more new route and an increase in flight to place such as tenerife and mallorca 
 yesterday wales lose a musical icon with the passing of mike peters from the alarm mike have an extraordinary relationship with his fan and he bring thousand of visitor from across the world into the area for his annual event the gathering mike peters his warmth and his music put north wales on the map for visitor from far and wide will my right hon friend join i in pay tribute to mike and to the power of music to bring people together like nothing else 
 order i be sure that the answer will be about the impact of the levy 
 music tourism be a huge part of the welsh visitor economy and i be very sad to hear about mike peters death mike and the alarm be the sound of my teenage year when i be grow up in north wales he be a proud welshman a hugely talented musician and a man of incredible resilience as well as bring music tourism to north wales he dedicate much of his life to charitable work to support blood cancer patient and i know he will be miss 
 whether she have have discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential merit of create a new offence of domestic abuse to help tackle violence against woman and girl in wales 
 i know that this be a deeply personal matter for the hon member and i commend he for his committed campaigning on this vital subject this labour government agree that more must be do to tackle violence against woman and girl which be why we have introduce a pilot this week in wales that will enable victim and their friend family and support worker to apply for a domestic abuse protection order we have commission david gauke a former justice secretary to conduct an independent review to examine how sentencing guideline can good address crime of violence against woman and girl in the future 
 i ask the government via a write parliamentary question how many domestic abuser there be in prison in wales and what their reoffende rate be the response be 
 it be not possible to robustly calculate the number of domestic abuser in prison or their reoffende rate because these crime be record under the specific offence for which they be prosecute 
 there be no specific offence of domestic abuse in law which mean we be not record this comprehensively we be not rehabilitate comprehensively and we be not protect victim comprehensively if the government do not create an offence as i have propose what will they do to protect the victim and survivor and to well identify these abuser 
 i understand that the hon member be bring forward a private member ’s bill on domestic abuse we recognise that be able to identify domestic abuse offender be critical but the government be not convince that the bill provide a solution to that challenge however the ministry of justice will continue to consider how it can make improvement to how we identify offender 
 i call the chair of the welsh affairs committee 
 tomorrow i will be visit the new sexual violence support centre in rothbury house in my constituency along with jane hutt the welsh government minister for social justice this great new facility will support many people in my constituency and the surround area for year to come will the minister join i in applaud the vital work of the staff many of they volunteer who provide lifesave support to woman in need 
 i pay tribute to that support centre and indeed to the many organisation the length and breadth of wales that help woman flee domestic violence as my hon friend know we work very closely with the welsh government indeed i speak to cabinet secretary jane hutt only yesterday as my hon friend will also know the welsh government launch their own strategy for combat violence against woman domestic abuse and sexual violence back in and they be carefully monitor progress on it 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the house will be as horrify as i be to learn from a shocking report in the times that a labour lead local authority apparently show teenager a powerpoint in which they be urge to seek consent from their partner before choke they during sex it be abhorrent to even attempt to normalise strangle in a love relationship indeed in any relationship it be important to note that the council in question do not categorically deny this at but do so after there be rightly a backlash do the minister agree that even consider show such appalling content to pupil in welsh school be totally unacceptable and will she undertake to hold her colleague to account on this part of the so call welsh curriculum 
 it be very distressing to hear what the hon member have say but i would say to she that the independent pornography review be a wide range and thorough piece of work that assess the effectiveness of pornography legislation regulation and enforcement the review ’s final report be publish on   february and its finding continue to be assess by the government it be right that the government take the time to understand this complex and deeply important topic and a further   update will be provide in due course if i may i would just stress the point that the review recommend make non fatal strangulation pornography clearly and explicitly illegal to possess distribute and publish 
 i think we can all agree that violence against woman and girl be an all too frequent occurrence the office for national statistics have publish datum reveal that shockingly of woman age between and in england and wales suffer a sexual assault in up from in 
 woman and girl will only truly be safe if we rid society of the appalling rape gang and a welsh rape gang survivor have publicly call for an inquiry into this have the minister meet the safeguarding minister the under secretary of state for the home department   the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips to reflect on this and to deliver for victim in wales if not on behalf of the woman and girl who want answer who want to be hear and who want to see action in wales and more widely may i again ask if she will push the welsh government to use the inquiries act to ensure that welsh victim get justice 
 the previous government sit on their hand and fail to deliver on the recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse whereas this government have already announce a comprehensive set of plan to implement all the recommendation to prevent the horror of child sexual abuse include the introduction of mandatory reporting the creation of a new child protection authority and the removal of the year statute of limitation period for personal injury claim bring by victim of child sexual abuse i will just stress that this be a reserved matter and that my government colleague have frequent discussion with colleague in the welsh government 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the spring statement on family farm in wales 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the spring statement on family farm in wales 
 just this morning i have the pleasure of visit the carmarthenshire day exhibition in the jubilee room which i strongly recommend as a real display of welsh farming and food produce the government be steadfastly commit to the farming sector we protect the farm budget at its current level and allocate £ to the welsh government at the autumn budget the welsh government in their budget have use that to maintain the basic payment scheme provide much need support for farmer across wales a budget that as the hon lady know tory and plaid cymru senedd members try to block 
 i draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 not only be labour ’s family farm tax threaten the future of farming in wales it be also a direct attack on farmer right across the uk in england the sustainable farming incentive scheme be close with no notice meanwhile in labour ’s spring statement the government bring forward increase in national insurance hit all farmer once again their tax on double cab pick up plus change to furnished holiday let penalise farmer who have actively diversify can the minister explain to the welsh agricultural sector why the government be carry out an all out assault on its way of life 
 just pick up on the point about national insurance contribution as the hon lady will know many farmer employ or people so they will come under the category of some of the small business we have make sure that we protect they by double the employment allowance to £ mean that over half of small and microbusinesse will pay less or no national insurance contribution at all her senedd colleague vote against the budget for welsh farmer in the senedd only a few week ago 
 the minister seem to have no grasp whatsoever of the constant struggle face our family farm in wales and across the united kingdom because of the lack of support in both labour ’s spring statement and labour ’s family farm tax farming family be not multimillionaire they be strive to make a profit with many earn less than the minimum wage will the minister finally accept that farm be crucial to the uk ’s food security and that the government should support they and scrap the vindictive family farm tax 
 we applaud the work that farmer do they be vital to our food security as the hon gentleman will know there be many way in which we have support farmer include the £ give to they in the budget this year and pass on by welsh government ministers to our farmer in wales he bring up inheritance tax i remind he that we be maintain significant level of relief from inheritance tax beyond what be available to other and compare to the position before where inheritance tax be due those liable for a charge can pay any liability on relevant asset over annual instalment interest free 
 the welsh government ’s budget contain over £ to support welsh farmer be it not the case that plaid cymru and the tories put welsh farmer livelihood at risk by vote against the welsh government ’s recent budget 
 my hon friend be absolutely right 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the uk ’s departure from the eu on the economy in wales 
 we be negotiate a new partnership with the eu and believe that secure a broad base security partnership bring close co operation on law and order and tackle   barrier to trade will boost our economy keep we safe and improve family finance since come into government i have work with uk and welsh government colleague to drive more than £ in private investment into wales from the like of eren holding and copenhagen infrastructure partners create hundred of job and lay the groundwork for thousand more 
 only this government can deliver cold comfort and warm word all in the same sentence the fact of the matter be that after the labour tory hard brexit the welsh economy suffer by £ trade have go down by £ and wales have lose £ in european structural and development funding on top of that the labour budget have kick wales even far down the track when will the secretary of state stand up to her westminster master and finally do something in the interest of the people of wales 
 welsh business both large and small tell we time and again that they be be hold back by red tape we need to tackle the barrier to trade in order to help drive investment job and growth for both the uk and eu economy nationalist can continue their obsession with the constitution put up border instead of break down barrier and raise taxis on work people as they have do in scotland 
 close collaboration between the uk and the eu on defence and defence spending be an important part of strengthen our relationship and will be important for the welsh economy include for company such as enersys which i visit recently which produce specialist battery for defence and other application will the secretary of state say a bit more about how increase defence spending will aid the welsh economy and company such as enersys particularly in advanced manufacturing and supply chain 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the potential for growth this government ’s commitment to increase defence spending mean that our strong defence manufacturing base in wales and the skilled job it support have real potential for growth the top supplier to the ministry of defence all have a footprint in wales and alongside that be a strong supply chain the forthcoming industrial strategy will set out more detail as to how that advanced manufacturing base will get government support 
 report of a new uk eu strategic partnership to reduce trade barrier will at last be a welcome boost to wales ’s food and drink producer give that of the sector ’s export go to the eu all producer from farm to fork of our wonderful welsh produce make a vital contribution to wales ’s economy will the secretary of state join i in celebrate all wales ’s food producer and farmer especially those at sioe nefyn nefyn show on monday and even more so those from sir gâr or carmarthenshire here today 
 i be delighted to support the welsh food and farming industry and i absolutely concur with the right hon lady ’s comment 
 on another note policy in practice show that nearly half of the uk local authority area worst hit by labour ’s welfare cut be in wales that be people affect in wales hit our post industrial quarrying and coalmine community hard how do the secretary of state explain to welsh colleague why the community where labour use to be strong should now suffer so much because of her government ’s cruel welfare cut 
 as the right hon lady might know none of those reform have actually go into effect yet so nobody have be affect by they we inherit a tory welfare system that be the bad of all world it provide the wrong incentive discourage people from work while the people who really need a safety net be still not get the dignity and support they need and deserve with the taxpayer fund an ever spiral bill it be unsustainable indefensible and unfair 
 what step she be take to strengthen the union 
 what step she be take to strengthen the union 
 in wales the partnership between our labour governments be deliver on the people ’s priority nhs waiting list have fall for consecutive month we be create ten of thousand of job in every corner of wales through our freeport investment zone support for steelworker inward investment and thriving green industry 
 support people into work be the right thing to do not just economically but morally i therefore welcome the recently announce uk trailblazer programme in north wales which will do away with the size fit all approach and will instead meet people where they be give they a great chance to secure stable and good employment do the secretary of state agree that this show the power of the partnership that we now have and our commitment that no on either side of the m4 will be leave behind also will the secretary of state join i in congratulate wrexham football team on their historic back to back to back promotion this weekend to the english football league championship 
 many congratulation to wrexham i be delighted to see they promote and very sad to see cardiff relegate my hon friend be right the government understand that work be crucial not just to our health and wellbeing but to improve our living standard that be why we announce last week a £ pilot in blaenau gwent neath port talbot and denbighshire to support people back into work we will not sit by and let the tories break welfare system continue which have condemn people to a life without work these trailblazer project will help more people in wales back into secure well pay job 
 since this uk labour government be elect more than extra gp appointment have be deliver in england and thank to a record- break £ budget settlement waiting list in   wale have go down month in a row do the secretary of state agree that our nhs and our country be safe and strong when we have government work together to make devolution work not to tear our union apart 
 i could not agree more with my hon friend drive down nhs waiting list be a share priority for both the uk and the welsh labour governments as she say waiting list have fall for consecutive month as a result of our government work together meanwhile the conservatives and plaid cymru vote against an extra £ for the welsh nhs and reform would sell off the nhs to the high bidder 
 do the secretary of state think that the imposition from tomorrow of a parcel border between great britain and northern ireland will strengthen the union give that parcel business to business from wales or any other part of the uk to northern ireland will now be subject to eu custom declaration and check how do that strengthen the union 
 i thank the hon and learn member for his question as i say in reply to an early question we want to make sure that trading be make easy and that we remove the red tape and barrier those be the discussion that we be have at the moment with the eu 
 do the minister agree that what strengthen this union be the nation of wales scotland and northern ireland intertwine with england it be the gaelic nation of scotland wales and northern ireland and their culture and history that bring we together the union also bring benefit relate to employment job and opportunity it be about the constitution and our service in uniform all those thing bring we together in a way that nothing else can and mean that this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland be well as a union we can all do well together 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i definitely believe that the uk be strong with the nation work together 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 there be no great threat to our union than the feeling that worker in nation matter less than those in another people in and around port talbot feel that they have have a rotten deal can the minister explain why under the deal that her government do with tata worker who have be at the company for long than year do not have that service reflect in their redundancy payment and why worker wish to access the retrain element have to forgo their right to the enhance redundancy payment be it true that as have be report as of february only people have apply for that scheme 
 tata make the decision to close the blast furnace in january month before the general election it close the coke oven in march when an agreement on the grant for the electric arc furnace   have already be make the hon gentleman might remember that blast furnace close down on polling day the timeline be fix for that electric arc furnace to be deliver in week we negotiate a well deal with well term and protection for the whole workforce at port talbot there be no immediate compulsory redundancy we see the good voluntary redundancy package ever offer by tata to its uk workforce we save job and acre of land be be release for development regeneration and future opportunity at the site all in all this be £ investment deal that be very different from the situation in scunthorpe

 i associate myself with the remark of the prime minister about the professionalism of our armed force and i too congratulate mark carney on be elect prime minister of canada i also congratulate everybody who take part in the london marathon both my daughter have do it but it be sadly something i can not do any more later today i will introduce a bill to guarantee that parliament have the final say on any trade deal include any agreement with president trump this idea be not new it be exactly what labour promise to do in an official policy paper put forward in so i be ask this government to keep their promise.[official report   may vol c. 3wc correction currently member of parliament have no vote or voice on trade deal will the prime minister 
 order i think the hon gentleman be on a marathon himself i call the prime minister 
 i extend my congratulation to the hon member ’s daughter for run the marathon the government retain the right to strike trade deal to deliver growth job and opportunity for work people we clearly set that out in our manifesto and that be exactly what we be do as he know parliament have a well establish role in scrutinise and ratify trade deal and as he reference that be strengthen under the last labour government 
 mr speaker 
 there be go to have to be a come together of reform and the conservative party in some way 
 a deal a pact or a merger those be not my word but the word of the most senior tory in elect public office in the country the mayor of the tees valley if senior tories be plot it and the leader of the opposition will not deny it be not the only way to stop the plot to vote labour tomorrow 
 order there be no need to answer that prime minister you have no responsibility for any of that 
 on monday the prime minister ’s safeguard minister the under secretary of state for the home department   the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips admit on the floor of the house that there be a cover up of the child rape gang scandal do the prime minister think we should expose this cover up 
 this be obviously a serious issue i oversee the groom gang prosecution which be in rochdale more than a decade ago there be a contrast here because when the leader of the opposition be minister for child and minister for women and equalities she never raise this issue in the house in year the shadow home secretary   the right hon member for croydon south chris philp hold external meeting during month how many be on this issue not of course the conservatives fail to implement a single recommendation from the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse 
 my position be absolutely clear where there be evidence the police should investigate and there should be appropriate prosecution that be route no route no be that we should implement exist recommendation which do expose what go wrong those recommendation be not implement by the last government they be be implement by this government we be provide for local inquiry we be invest more in deliver truth and justice for victim than the conservative party do in long year 
 in the last year of the conservative government we have a gang taskforce that find perpetrator protect thousand of victim we launch the inquiry that the prime minister be talk about but more still need to be do it be now month since i ask he for a full national inquiry instead he promise local inquiry there will be in oldham will he now name where the other will be 
 we be provide for local inquiries—[interruption conservative members have get so much to say now why do they not implement a single recommendation in the year they have in office there be recommendation already in place about the change that need to be make they sit on a shelf under the last government we be act on they we be provide for local inquiry and we be invest more in deliver truth than the last government ever do 
 the prime minister can not name a single place because nothing be happen he stand at the dispatch box and promise local inquiry on the last day of term he have his minister come out to water down the promise that they would provide funding that be not good enough at least town be affect by rape gang place like peterborough derby birmingham nottingham leicester rotherham rochdale and preston be he drag his heel on this because he do not want labour cover up expose 
 i spend year prosecute these case i be the prosecutor who bring the case and when that file be bring to my attention i notice that of the defendant have not be prosecute previously far from cover up i ask for that file so i could have a look at it on the back of that i change the entire approach to prosecution which be laud by the then government we be do the right thing and bring those prosecution my record where i think something have go wrong be of go after it and put it right the leader of the opposition stay silent throughout the conservatives year in government and so do their entire front bench 
 the right hon and learn gentleman be not the director of public prosecutions any more he be the prime minister people want to know what he be go to do now not have he talk about what he do year ago we be ask for a full national inquiry andy burnham want a national inquiry and he be not conservative he be labour harriet harman want   the hon member for rotherham sarah champion   want all the victim i have meet want a full national inquiry the prime minister keep talk about local inquiry yet they have not get go and they have not get go because local authority do not want to investigate themselves local inquiry can not force witness to appear local inquiry can not force people to give evidence under oath why will he not have a national inquiry 
 we have have a national inquiry and we have have recommendation interruption look hundred of recommendation have be make in relation to this issue it be a serious issue i strongly believe that we should implement the recommendation that have already be make and that be what we be do i strongly believe that we should listen to victim labour members have be listen to victim for decade and work with they in relation to what they want which be local inquiry and we have set those local inquiry up 
 the prime minister say we should listen to victim the victim want a national inquiry we have not have a national inquiry we have the child sex abuse inquiry which the conservatives launch there be still more to be do it do not cover the scandal in detail in manchester just last year authority be still cover up abuse and the local inquiry chair there have quit bradford council which cover an area with some of the bad abuse refuse any inquiry local or national whether we be talk about the street of birmingham or the town hall of bradford it be chaos and cover up with labour council when will he show leadership and do the right thing 
 the right thing be to implement the recommendation that we have which be what the conservatives palpably fail to do in government the right thing to do be to have the national inquiry that we need which be what the victim want the right thing to do be to invest in our criminal justice system so we can bring people to justice the conservatives have absolutely collapse the criminal justice system prosecution for rape under their watch do they go up or down they go down to record low investment in prosecute these case go down their record be abysmal they should hang their head in shame 
 these be just distraction tactic the prime minister have not read the recommendation because if he have he would know that none of they would tackle this issue the fact be if i be stand where he be we would have have a national inquiry month ago 
 this issue be personal for i i have meet many of the victim this be about the protection of child nothing else be more important in the last few day i have be to wiltshire lincolnshire northumberland and kent all of they have outstanding child ’s social care do you know why mr speaker because they be all run by conservative that be the difference that conservative councillor make be the choice tomorrow not between chaos and cover up under labour council and well service under the conservatives 
 the right hon lady say that the conservatives would have a national inquiry in year they do not do it it be so hollow 
 yes tomorrow be the country ’s opportunity to pass its verdict on the leader of the opposition and the conservative party after the general election have they change have they learn we will see she next week 
 i wish that the leader of the opposition would stop weaponise victim of child sexual abuse to score political point it be damaging victim and if she care about child protection she would not do that it be a disgrace you be a disgrace 
 new datum show that in march last year in the hyson green and arboretum ward in my constituency of child be in poverty which be the high proportion in the whole of the east midland and a damn indictment of the previous conservative government of the proud achievement of the last labour government be the action they take on child poverty will the prime minister confirm that this labour   government will do everything in their power to eliminate child poverty and that their taskforce have not rule out abolish the child benefit limit which be the single most cost effective way to pull child out of poverty 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise the disgraceful record of the previous government who see an extra child in poverty i be proud of labour ’s record in reduce child poverty which be what we do in government and the taskforce be explore every lever to reduce child poverty 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 on behalf of my party may i send our congratulation to mark carney and the liberal party of canada on their historic victory we wish they well as canada continue to stand up strongly to president trump ’s tariff and threat canada have learn what happen when a trade deal be do with president trump he can not be trust to stick with it the prime minister do not answer my question last week nor he do answer my hon friend   the member for wokingham clive jones   just now let i ask again will the government give member a vote on the floor of the house on any deal he agree with president trump yes or no 
 we be in negotiation on a deal with the us we will obviously act in the national interest to make sure that if there be a deal it be the right deal for our country if it be secure it will go through the known procedure for this house 
 i be very disappointed by that reply and the lack of a yes or no response we want a vote and we will keep press the prime minister and his government on that 
 turn to a domestic issue my hon friend   the member for dorking and horley chris coghlan   have take up the cause of fiona laskaris whose autistic adult son christopher be horrifically exploit and then murder by a convict criminal as itv news have report when fiona try to get a mental capacity assessment for her son she be dismiss so christopher never get the support that might have save his life we be go to try to change the law so that family concern over a love ’s mental capacity have to be consider will the prime minister give his personal backing to that change to prevent another tragedy like christopher ’s 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise that terrible case and i think the thought of the whole house will be with christopher ’s family and friend affect by this we will certainly look into what else we can do and if there be further detail that could be give to i of that particular case i will make sure that we follow it up

 to date so far this year young undocumented male have illegally cross the english channel into our country a increase on this time last year many come from culture that be somewhat alien to ours they be be house at a cost of many billion of pound a year in hotel and increasingly in private rent home the effect on community be of a sense of deep unfairness border on resentment in runcorn alone there be of these young man just in community be it not time to admit that smash the gang be nothing more than an election slogan not a policy and be it not time to declare a national emergency and to act accordingly 
 we be pass a border bill with extensive power to smash the gang these be anti terrorist like power that give power to the police to intercept where they think the suspect be commit people smuggling which be a vile trade and we must take back control of our border after the last government lose control but what do the hon gentleman and his party do do they support those extra measure to actually smash the gang no they go into the lobby to vote against they with the conservatives in their new coalition and let we be clear what a vote for his party mean it mean a vote to charge for the nhs a pro putin foreign policy and a vote against worker right and now we hear that he have recruit liz truss as his new top adviser just as he be cheer on the mini budget

 my hon friend be absolutely right conservative derbyshire county council be home to more pothole than anywhere else in the country and driver be pay the price our plan for change have commit enough funding to fix extra pothole this year for the time council like derbyshire must publish how many pothole they have actually repair in order to get the cash the conservative party leave britain ’s road crumble we be fix they 
 the blackout in spain have cause chaos there be a realisation among many back benchers in the prime minister ’s own party that thousand of job be be lose in scotland in the oil industry business face energy cost that be make they uncompetitive and consumer be be plunge into fuel poverty do the prime minister not recognise that his net policy be not only bad but mad indeed a former leader of his party now accept this will the prime minister accept advice from someone in his own party if he will not accept advice from those on the opposition benches 
 in many year on the opposition benches i learn when ask question at pmq not just to read the headline on a wednesday morning but to look at some of the detail what tony blair say be that we should have more carbon capture we have invest in carbon capture that be many job across different part of the country he say that ai should be use and we agree with that we have invest huge amount in ai and the job of the future he also say that we need domestic target so that business have certainty if the right hon gentleman look at the detail of what tony blair say he will see that tony blair be absolutely align with what we be do here these be the job and the security of the future i will also say that we should not weaponise the difficult position that people in spain and other country find themselves in at a very difficult time 
 i welcome the government ’s decision this month to secure british steel at a time when european security be critical defence manufacturer in the black country like somers forge in halesowen and b.b. price in cradley heath will be use that steel to make the military equipment that our defence need will the prime minister commit to make manufacturing investment in the black country a national priority so that we can live up to our industrial heritage and create the high quality defence job that our region so desperately need 
 i pay tribute to my hon and gallant friend for his service to his country he understand that our national security and economic security go hand in hand it be vital that defence investment create more job apprenticeship and opportunity in the black country and across the united kingdom that be why we have launch a new hub to give up to small firm well access to defence contract we be raise defence spending with the high sustained increase since the cold war something that the conservatives fail to do in year in office 
 i wish to make a statement to update the house on the action we take last night against a houthi military target we do so in collective self defence and to uphold the freedom of navigation as britain have always do 
 yesterday uk force conduct a joint operation with us ally against a houthi military facility in yemen our intelligence analysis identify a cluster of building mile south of sanaa use by the houthis to manufacture drone of the type use to attack ship in the red sea and in the gulf of aden royal air force typhoon fgr4s with air refuelling support from raf voyager tanker strike a number of those building with paveway iv precision bomb last night this action be limited target and devise to minimise the risk to civilian life everyone involve in the uk operation have return to base safely on behalf of the house i thank all member of our armed force involve in this operation and pay tribute to they for their total professionalism and courage 
 yesterday ’s operation be carry out alongside the us our close security ally it be conduct in line with both the un charter and the established uk policy of this government and the last you will remember mr speaker that when labour be in opposition it back the government when they conduct separate strike with the us against houthi target 
 yesterday ’s attack align with broad objective the be to restore freedom of navigation in the red sea and the gulf of aden the be to degrade houthi capability and prevent future attack the be to reinforce regional security alongside ally and partner and the be to protect our economic security at home thing this morning the government brief the shadow defence secretary   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge the speaker of both houses the liberal democrats defence spokesperson   the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire and the chair of the house of commons defence committee my hon friend   the member for slough mr dhesi i can now tell the house that our initial assessment be that the plan target be all successfully hit and we have see no evidence of civilian casualty 
 since november the houthis have be wag a campaign of aggression against international shipping in the red sea to date there have be over attack those attack be illegal and deadly and we totally condemn they maritime route have be disrupt sailor have be kill and commercial ship have be hit and sink the houthis have even target aid vessel destine for yemen itself as well as military vessel of our ally and partner both the royal navy and the us navy have be force into action in the red sea last september i meet the crew of hms diamond who shoot down a ballistic missile and multiple drone in self defence during their deployment in the red sea 
 make no mistake the houthis act as an agent of instability across the region they continue to receive both military and financial backing from iran and even russia have attempt to support the houthi operation the aggression in the red sea and the gulf of aden be yet another example of how our adversary be increasingly   work together against our interest as such i want to be clear that this government reject any houthi claim that attack ship in the red sea be somehow support gaza the houthis be target tanker and seize ship well before the war in gaza begin and their attack since have target vessel of all nation so hear i when i say that these attack do absolutely nothing for the palestinian people or the push for a last peace 
 an estimated of global trade and of container traffic pass through the red sea every year but the houthi threat have lead to a drastic fall level be down by on what they be in november the majority of ship now take a mile diversion around the cape of good hope add a full fortnight to a journey between asia and europe and push up price for the good that british people and other rely on this can not continue 
 in opposition i argue that for what be now year 
 the lion ’s share of the responsibility for protect international freedom of navigation in the red sea be be shoulder by the americans just as the us have be do across the world”—[official report   january vol c. 
 since last month the us have be conduct a sustained campaign target the houthis in yemen to restore freedom of navigation it move carrier into the region and its recent strike have destroy multiple command and control centre air defence system advanced weapon manufacturing site and advanced weapon storage site the us military say that its operation have now degrade the effectiveness of the houthi attack report that ballistic missile launch have drop by and way drone attack be down by 
 the us continue to be the uk ’s close security ally it be step up in the red sea and we be alongside it yesterday ’s joint operation build on the broad support that we have provide to the us in the region in recent month that include air to air refuelling the use of our important military base diego garcia for regional security operation and raf typhoon to support the defence of the us carrier strike group which have be come under near daily attack from houthi missile and drone 
 this government will always act in the interest of our national and economic security the uk be step up and encourage ally to do more to protect our common security just as we be with the month deployment of our carrier strike group to the mediterranean and the indo pacific which start last week the uk have a long and proud history of take action to protect freedom of navigation this illegal houthi aggression do not just disrupt shipping and destabilise the region it hit our economy here at home that be why the government take this decision it be why the uk have take this action to help protect freedom of navigation reinforce regional stability and strengthen economic security for family across the country we be determined that we will keep britain secure at home and strong abroad 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for early sight of his statement and to the minister for the armed forces for the briefing he extend to i and other parliamentarian   early today as far as his majesty ’s opposition be concern the rationale for these action have not change since we undertake similar operation in government in the month lead up to the general election with the support of the then opposition we agree that this action be effectively an act of self defence on behalf of ourselves and our close ally 
 with the main target for raf typhoons be a houthi drone factory we should remember that drone be use by the houthis to target our own naval ship such as the attempt drone attack on hms diamond in january last year while hms diamond be able to take effective action in response on that occasion we know that this capability can be produce in very large number and that the threat remain a clear and present danger indeed we understand that the us navy continue to be subject to houthi aggression include from drone in our view it be therefore entirely legitimate to support the defence of our close ally the us and to prevent future potential attack on our own fleet and international shipping by attack the houthi drone threat at source 
 the houthis action be not just a threat to ourselves and our ally as the secretary of state say they be illegal and completely counter to international humanitarian priority give that their attack have imperille aid delivery to the yemeni people while undermine a crucial shipping route for grain en route to some of the poor people in the world the government therefore have our full support for this late operation and the opposition be grateful to the brave and highly skilled personnel of the royal air force who conduct the mission include the typhoon crew and those support the air to air refuelling mission in particular we welcome their safe return and the completion of what appear to be a successful operation in degrade houthi drone capability 
 the us have be undertake its own self defence against houthi attack and we very much welcome the close work with us ally as be the case when we be in government work with the previous administration in the us that underline the continuity of our most important strategic military partnership and it be right that we work as closely as possible with the us to address threat to freedom of navigation 
 that be say freedom of navigation be vital to the ship of many nation not just the uk and the us the whole world benefit from action take to keep international shipping flow which support the wide economy can the secretary of state update we on what talk he have have with other ally include nato member on provide direct military support against the houthi threat in future after all it be not only a threat to many other nation but involve other hostile state notably iran with its long run support not just for the houthis but for hezbollah hamas and other armed group in iraq and elsewhere how will the uk dock in to the approach be take by the new us administration towards iran 
 the secretary of state refer to russian involvement can he confirm report that the houthis have receive target assistance with potential ballistic missile attack from russia do that not show why support ukraine against russia be about a much wide strategic picture   that directly threaten the united kingdom he also refer to the use of our military base diego garcia for regional security operation but soon it will not be ours do this kind of action not show why surrender its sovereignty be so reckless 
 let i finally turn to the subject of the strategic defence review it be very concern that the permanent secretary to the ministry of defence tell the public accounts committee on monday 
 it be a strategic defence review that will need to be translate into a set of specific investment decision in individual capability and project that will be work for later in the summer and into the autumn 
 the secretary of state know of the need for urgent procurement decision relate directly to the houthi threat in the red sea not least on upgrade to the sea viper system which we believe must be accelerate he also know that procurement be largely on hold await the publication of the sdr he promise to publish it in the spring can he confirm that it will definitely be publish in may which be the last month of spring and most importantly can he confirm that in may we will see the full detail of all major individual procurement choice so that the mod can get on with they as a matter of the utmost urgency 
 i welcome the tone and content of the hon gentleman ’s response to my statement labour back the last government ’s strike against the houthis and as he point out the rationale then be the same as the rationale now that be a useful contribution to this discussion the hon gentleman be right to say that the clear and present threat that the houthis pose to all nation include ours and our close ally be also the same 
 when i be shadow defence secretary and respond to what be say by the last government i do so as the hon gentleman have respond today because this be big than politic it be about freedom of navigation it be about regional stability and it be about that most important security relationship that the united kingdom have with the united states 
 the hon gentleman ask i about specific capability we be now able to plan to provide the good possible kit for our armed force because of the historic commitment that the prime minister make to the house in february to raise the level of defence spending to 2.5%—three year early than the date that be in the hon gentleman ’s own unfunded plan and then to raise it to in the next parliament he ask about the capability on some of our naval ship when i meet the crew of hms diamond in the autumn they demonstrate to i and describe to i in detail just how exceptional their response to that multiple attack be and just how effective the weaponry on the ship be at that time we be upgrade those ship with a number of capability include dragonfire it be the hon gentleman who talk about that but we be instal it not on just ship as he propose but on we be instal it soon than he plan and we be fund it fully which he have not do 
 the hon gentleman ask about discussion with other nation the importance of regional stability the houthi threat and the freedom of navigation in the red sea be discuss by foreign ministers at the g7 and have be discuss by nato foreign ministers in   the last month the very carrier strike group whose deployment the hon gentleman welcome last week be multinational by design it be design to exercise together but also together to reassert some of the basic principle that last night ’s attack be design to support such as the freedom of navigation of our sea 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for his statement and to the minister for the armed forces for his in person briefing beforehand 
 i be glad that our brave service personnel who be involve in yesterday ’s strike have return home safely and that the precision sovereign strike have destroy the drone factory with no civilian casualty i agree with the secretary of state that houthi attack since have tragically kill innocent merchant mariner lead to a shocking drop in shipping through the red sea cost billion fuel regional instability and exacerbate the cost of living crisis here in the uk and across the globe however on the basis of current intelligence how confident be he that follow yesterday ’s strike there will be freedom of navigation and that there will be no further loss of life because of the houthis 
 i be grateful for my hon friend ’s support for the action that we take overnight it be part of a sustained campaign a us campaign that we be work alongside there be no overnight solution to this but accord to the evidence report by the us military about this new sustained intensive campaign it seem to be have an effect on the pace the rate and the threat that the houthis pose our action last night be design to reinforce that campaign to support the push for regional stability and to protect the domestic economy and protect against the impact of the disruption in international shipping and its effect on price for ordinary people 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement and i thank the minister for the armed forces for his briefing early today 
 the houthis destabilising military campaign in the red sea have have a chilling effect on trade through that vital waterway threaten life while impose cost on british business and consumer the houthis can not be allow to act with impunity and hold the global economy to ransom by restrict freedom of navigation it be important that their military capability be degrade to ensure that trade can flow freely which be why the liberal democrats support the case for limited strike we thank the service personnel involve for their bravery and we be pleased that they have return home safely however it be vital that we fully understand the operational goal behind the mission as well as the intelligence planning and co ordination of the strike 
 can the secretary of state explain to the house why the government have choose this occasion to join us force in a joint strike rather than do so on previous similar mission the recent leak from president trump ’s cabinet also pertain to military action in yemen   against the houthis raise concern question about how secure us intelligence be and the possible impact on british service personnel in the light of those leak can the secretary of state reassure we that intelligence sharing with the us be completely secure and can he tell we whether the government have undertake an assessment of the security of our intelligence share network with the us i be reassure to hear from he that the government have no evidence of any loss of civilian life but can he update the house on what step be take ahead of the mission in an effort to minimise civilian casualty 
 before i respond to the hon lady may i point out that i neglect to respond to   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge   on the subject of the sdr when it be publish in the spring all his question will be answer 
 i welcome the hon lady ’s recognition of the importance of degrade the military capability of the houthis and i welcome her support for the action that we take last night i say to she with confidence and reassurance that our own uk intelligence and communication system remain secure 
 the hon lady ask why now the decision and the action that we take be in line with long establish policy both uk policy and the united nations charter secondly it be a reflection of the fact that as i have report to the house the us be step up and we as a close ally be alongside it in this action thirdly our purpose be to protect our economy at home because most of the shipping in this busy of international sea route make a big detour that push up price and have a direct impact on not just our security interest but our economic interest in britain that be why we be act 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 the houthis say that they be shell international shipping in order to help the palestinians but do my right hon friend agree that by not just undermine international trade but cause a devastating decline in the use of the suez canal and crash the number of cruise ship visit aqaba they be actually attack egypt and jordan country which could not be work hard for a future for the palestinians which could not be give more support whether it be financial political or diplomatic and which provide a refuge for so many do he agree that if the houthis really care about the palestinians they should simply stop this 
 i totally agree with my hon friend jordan and egypt be do a lot of the heavy lifting in try to support the palestinians and it be notable that there be no evidence that the houthis have provide any aid to the palestinians in gaza the action that they be take which be cause disruption and the intensification of insecurity in the region be do absolutely nothing to help the palestinians cause 
 i welcome this action and join the defence secretary in pay tribute to our exemplary armed force it be essential that we tackle the tentacle of iran through all its proxy whether   it be the houthis hamas or hezbollah which do so much damage to israel and the wide middle east and not least to the people of palestine fundamental question as he will know from our discussion when i be deputy prime minister be about the long term strategy to eliminate the threat of the houthis to red sea shipping for the benefit of the house will the defence secretary give some further indication of the new government ’s thinking on the long term strategy to address this threat 
 i pay tribute to the right hon gentleman for go out of his way when he be deputy prime minister as this government be do now to ensure that we be well brief on such strike he be absolutely right to say that military action against the houthis can take we only so far the wide strategy must therefore involve the uk do what we can to work with ally especially in the region to constrain the houthis as our action overnight be design to do secondly to bolster the strength authority and capability of the yemeni government which be why the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for lincoln mr falconer announce support early this year and thirdly to pursue the importance of a negotiate settlement that give yemen a peaceful way forward while in the meantime not lose sight of our responsibility as a nation to support the yemeni people who be suffer greatly 
 the right hon gentleman will welcome the fact that the foreign secretary announce in january an extra £ worth of uk aid for yemen which bring the total over the previous month to £ the uk remain the large donor to the yemeni humanitarian programme 
 i thank the secretary of state for his statement and echo his word about the courage and professionalism of our service personnel it be good that everyone have return safely 
 have a strong and capable military be essential to ensure our economic security and freedom of trade be that not why financial institution and pension fund should increase their investment in defence industry and not listen to voice oppose to that 
 quite right my hon friend will be interested to hear about the work that i and the chancellor have commission together on the barrier in the uk that be hold back private source of investment in our defence and technology industry an important part of the defence industrial strategy which we will be able to publish before too long will be about how we use the big commitment of this government and this country to invest in defence and make our armed force fit for the future and how we can use that to leverage much more investment from private sector source so that we can do more more quickly 
 it be unusual for a terrorist group engage in a civil war to invite retaliation of this sort by attack international shipping so comprehensively clearly the houthis be act as an agent of iran can the secretary of state advise we   what the government know about the ability of iran to keep fuel the attack in the red sea now that the domestic ability to manufacture drone in yemen have be degrade how easy will it be for iran to supply they directly to the houthis 
 the short answer be that we must do what we can with ally to make it as hard as possible for iran to maintain both its financial support to the houthis and its logistical munition and military support and supply we be work on that with ally and as i say to the house early the straight military action that we be conduct last night be part of the solution for the long term it be not the whole solution 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement we have have a long stand relationship with the us which be our close security ally do he agree that our continued work on aukus will help to deepen and strengthen that for all the nation involve 
 it will indeed the aukus programme be a good example of how big defence commitment provide not just long term deterrent commitment to our own security and that of our ally but an important economic boost show how defence can be a driver of economic growth my hon friend who have the privilege of represent the town of barrow and its royal shipyard will know well than anyone how important that combination be it be hardwire into the approach that this government take 
 the brutal oppression of the palestinians in gaza will not be help iota by the bombing of merchant shipping and drone strike against the merchant marine so we be supportive of the action that have be take it seem to be an operation that have the appearance of something which may endure into a more strategic affair do the secretary of state agree that notwithstanding the general consensus in the chamber on the action that be take a broad debate in parliament would be desirable not to discuss operational imperative plan or anything of that nature but to far reinforce the will of the house while he celebrate the action of aircrew will he far acknowledge that the aircrew would not be able to do their tremendous work if it be not for all the other trade that keep they mobilise 
 well say the hon gentleman be absolutely right to say that stand behind our armed force and the ultimate professionalism that they display be a large cadre of civilian and military personnel who make operation successful and possible he would be wrong to say that this be a sustained campaign this be the uk strike on houthi position since may last year and parliament will be keep inform in the event of any future military intervention like this 
 freedom of navigation in the red sea and the gulf of aden be essential to the global economic system and anything that impinge on it impact the global economy increase the cost to the environment and impact the poor people in the world it be for this reason that i be proud   to be the former commander of the expeditionary air wing whose typhoons and voyagers be launch last night to carry out these strike do the defence secretary agree that this action form part of the join up international strategy to end the attack and defend freedom of navigation 
 i do indeed it be part of a long term programme to degrade the ability of the houthis to hit international shipping to defend and protect freedom of navigation and to recognise that conflict in the middle east have a big impact on business and prosperity in this country the british chambers of commerce recently publish a survey that say of business in britain report that they have now be impact by conflict in the middle east 
 i draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and congratulate all involve on a very successful joint operation matter like this be likely to attract retaliation from iran and its proxy what be be do to support our ally in the region against possible attack as carrier strike group prepare to transit and exercise in the region on operation highmast will he assure the house without go into specific that all be be do to protect our man and woman 
 the right hon gentleman who i think serve as a defence minister under administration will know that defence ministers and secretaries include i give the high priority to our force protection my hon friend the armed forces minister and i go over that matter in detail with military planner and chief before the carrier group set sail and i be brief on that again when the prime minister and i visit the carrier last week in general term the operation last night be design to prevent further escalation it be design to prevent furth houthi attack by take out the major weapon manufacturing site that we strike last night 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement and i pay tribute to the courage and professionalism of all our service personnel who be involve in this successful operation do he agree that the whole house should stand together against the houthi attack which challenge freedom of navigation and if leave unaddresse could lead to a devastating rise in the cost of essential food item not just for my constituent but across the uk and in other country 
 my hon friend put the argument very well this be a matter of freedom of navigation and a matter of international law but it be also a matter of economic self interest for britain because the price for the disruption to world shipping on this essential trade route through the red sea be pay by ordinary people in the food and good they depend on that be in part why we take this action last night 
 i too pay tribute to the professionalism of our armed force and i be thankful for their safe return be the secretary of state confident about the appropriate security for our military personnel give that the previous leak   from the trump administration on signal give detail of such attack before they happen and what reassurance have he have from the united states on that 
 i be confident we handle secure communication in secure way and we do that consistently here in the uk 
 i join my right hon friend in pay tribute to the armed force personnel who take part in last night ’s action the fact that it be the uk that be support the usa in this action really do emphasise our close relationship however this morning ’s newspaper suggest that our desire to do a trade deal with america have be push back to a tranche of country or maybe even a do he share my disappointment at that decision and would he ask the trump administration to return to that issue and to consider our close relationship in defence and intelligence 
 i gently urge my hon friend not necessarily to believe everything he read in the newspaper he be very experienced and have a very good insight into the political world just to reassure he we be pull out all the stop behind the scene to try to settle a trade deal with the us just as we be to reinforce the special depth of the relationship on security and defence matter between the uk and the us 
 i very much welcome the statement and the action which i fully support and i be very pleased to hear of the level of engagement by the us the secretary of state will recall that the humanitarian situation in yemen be the subject of frequent debate and discussion during the previous parliament but it appear to have fall off the agenda partly because of atrocious conflict elsewhere i be pleased to hear what he say about the fcdo ’s approach but as the fcdo have more constrain resource will he ensure that the humanitarian situation in yemen remain a priority 
 i be confident that my right hon friend the foreign secretary have that in mind he will be conscious as be the right hon gentleman that the uk act not just as the large donor to the yemen humanitarian programme but as the penholder for yemen at the united nations 
 i thank my right hon friend for his statement and associate myself with his word about our brave military personnel do he agree that we must reiterate how the houthi attack be illegal be against the un charter and target the principle of freedom of navigation which benefit all nation include our ally in the region do he also agree that our action show that work in concert with our ally internationally can improve regional stability and security and indeed our security here at home 
 i do indeed agree with my hon friend this be a matter of reinforce regional stability and a matter of defend and protect freedom of navigation but it be also a matter of protect our own economic interest back home and i make no apology for stand up for british interest and those of our ally 
 we in reform fully endorse the government ’s action against the houthis and we thank our brave and brilliant military personnel the secretary of state refer to the continue support of the houthis by iran so will he update the house on further sanction against iran surely now be the time to proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps as a terrorist organisation 
 the hon gentleman have be around long enough to know that i will not comment on the process of proscription suffice it to say the government have sanction a number of major houthi leader i welcome his welcome for the action we take last night and i hope he will take that action as a sign of a determination to do what we can alongside our us ally to degrade their ability to continue to threaten freedom of navigation for international shipping 
 the houthis be act freely in the absence of a road map for peace yemen be face the bad humanitarian crisis with people need assistance of whom be child and in desperate need of food water and medical supply to defeat the houthis permanently will the secretary of state give a commitment that this government along with ally will do all that be possible to deliver a road map for peace and ensure that this happen now because otherwise it will be a lost opportunity 
 as i say early my responsibility as defence secretary be for the military component of the wide approach that must be pursue if we be to help play an important role in secure peace and a settlement to end the civil war in yemen and to provide relief to the hundred of thousand of yemenis who be suffer so severely constrain the houthi threat be part of that as be reinforce and bolster the yemeni government but work with ally particularly the lead regional ally in try to force the pace of a negotiate settlement and a peace in yemen be absolutely crucial 
 i welcome the defence secretary ’s statement and i add my thank to and appreciation for the royal air force and all those involve in this successful operation in his statement he say that 
 even russia have attempt to support the houthi operation 
 however do it not go a little bit deep than that the wall street journal have report that target datum provide by russia have be utilise by the houthis for their attack against western shipping while iran have arbitrate secret talk between the terror group and the kremlin what step be he take to disrupt russia ’s deepen tie to iran and its proxy across the middle east 
 i be really not go to disclose in public or even to this house the step that we be take to deal with some of that covert russian activity which go well beyond yemen to the wide middle east suffice it to say the hon member have make a contribution to the discussion on this statement by bring that report from the wall street journal to the house 
 i add my word of support for the action the uk take last night the houthi group be a terrorist organisation that have be deeply destabilising and it be right that we be play our role in protect freedom of navigation the halesowen community of yemenis be really concerned about the desperate humanitarian situation in yemen could the secretary of state add a few more word on what we be do to support yemenis who be so desperate right now and what we be do to end the civil war 
 yes i mention the in year uplift that the foreign secretary give to our contribution to the yemeni humanitarian assistance plan which make we the large donor our focus on aid have be especially on food of which there be a critical shortage and which be a necessity to hundred of thousand of yemenis we calculate that we will have help almost yemenis with our food support this year our support be also in healthcare support over medical centre across the country with medicine vaccine and some of the basic equipment need to provide the healthcare that people also so desperately need in that country 
 i share the recognition of the raf ’s role in last night ’s operation give the exist global commitment of our typhoon squadron should the coalition of the willing provide a military contribution to any post war force in ukraine and therefore a combat air patrol or air police role in ukraine in addition to the baltic and the high north how will we continue to facilitate direct action such as the strike against the iranian back houthis in yemen with no plan to purchase a tranche of f-35bs 
 on ukraine and a potential role in a coalition of the willing on security guarantee if a negotiate peace settlement which we all hope president trump secure can be put in place we be plan at the moment the consequence of any commitment we make will be fully explain to the house if a decision be make but that be contingent on a ceasefire and a peace agreement and that be contingent principally upon putin do what he say he want by seek an end to the fighting 
 i thank the defence secretary for his statement and pay tribute to all those involve in the successful strike do he agree that this government will always put personnel at the heart of our defence plan 
 for too long i believe the previous government overlook that they certainly fail to meet their recruitment test i be proud to be a defence secretary in a labour government who be able last year to give armed force personnel the large pay increase for year and to be the defence secretary who can stand at the dispatch box and say that nobody in uniform will be pay less now than the national living wage i be also proud to have manage to do a deal to buy back and bring into public control family military home follow what be quite the bad privatisation ever in under the previous tory government 
 in reply to an early question the secretary of state talk about the devastation in yemen with people in desperate need of help and support and the civil war condition that pertain there on the armed intervention that britain make yesterday we all need to know where it will lead what the end game be whether we be involve in an internal war in yemen and what the long term implication of our involvement be ultimately there have to be some kind of peace process in yemen just as much as there have to be in gaza and elsewhere in the region do this action bring peace nearer or do it exacerbate the danger of a widen conflict 
 the right hon gentleman be right to remind the house of the extreme hardship face by many yemenis in what have be a war tear country for year the strike last night be design to reduce and prevent the risk of further houthi attack and they be do because we be able to take out an important facility where the houthis have be manufacture the very weapon use to target international shipping and our own
