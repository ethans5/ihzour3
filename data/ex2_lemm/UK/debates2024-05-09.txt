i look forward to that opportunity i have write to the north east mayor ask for engagement on that and i would be delighted if the hon lady join i for such a meeting should it arise 
 ferryhill station be not just about travel it be also about economic regeneration the station close as part of the beeching cut in the same year that the ferryhill mine close and the same year as it happen that i move out of ferryhill to newton aycliffe about mile away it mean that resident lose not just a source of local job but a mean of travel to new job it be therefore an imperative that the project which be recently confirm again by the prime minister now make urgent progress like any investment it will show the community at or near the station ferryhill chilton mainsforth dean bank cornforth and bishop middleham that they be value while also present increase opportunity for those that be slightly far away such as spennymoor and tudhoe 
 of the tenet of my election in be the desire to improve access to opportunity for all and no be more needing or deserving of opportunity than the resident of what be and still be describe as mining village cause of mine have be to encourage aspiration particularly for the young people of sedgefield and that flow from session with the ambassador of ferryhill primary school lead by glenys newby as well as visit to school in hurworth wheatley hill and everywhere in between 
 to enable and encourage aspiration it be critical that we create opportunity opportunity come from job and career which be why i be so pleased about the growth of netpark a science community within mile of fishburn a former mining village close to my mining community be the new town of newton aycliffe which offer job include at hitachi it be fundamental for the recovery of the mining community that industry of the future can be sustain include at hitachi i be work with everyone from union to the secretary of state to find a way for those industry to continue admirably inspire their workforce in the future however they will help the community most in need only if my mining village can reach they via the bus connection that i mention 
 if we wish to secure future growth we must develop new skill i be enormously encourage by the growth in apprenticeship in the area where have start since and by the increase quality of our school which be help to deliver well educational outcome over the past year we have go from of our school be rat good or outstanding to today opportunity be support by education and i have be delighted to engage not only with school but with the amazing university that support my constituency most notably durham university i commend the work be do to reach out to community 
 i be delighted that fiona hill the recently appoint chancellor of durham university hail from bishop auckland a place with challenge similar to those in my community so she get it fiona hill hail from a disadvantaged background but manage to rise to work on the international stage and have now return to   become chancellor of durham university i support the university ’s shy bairn get nowt project which be an attempt to instil more confidence in our young people so that they speak up and be not only hear but listen to 
 i have such hope for the former mining community in my area we need to continue effort to support education and aspiration and to deliver well transport for those community despite their challenge i can see the potential they have to reinvent themselves however i can not stress enough just how crucial bus and train service be to that process i look forward to see the service improve and those amazing community become the place that they deserve to be 
 a birthday wish to phil our head doorkeeper who be today 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what the location be of successful applicant to the natural flood management programme 
 project have be select to proceed to the development stage of the £ natural flood management programme they include a broad range of location from alnmouth to st austell 
 i be work with resident in the chase way and kendal drive area of great sutton alongside environment agency representative and member of the local authority to try to find a solution to the flooding problem that we have there there be lot of different pot of money available at different time and sometimes it be difficult to understand what the realistic chance be of our succeed in get the funding that we need to bridge the gap that we have at the moment to get the work do will it be possible for i to meet with either the secretary of state or some of his team to talk about what realistic funding option we have for the area 
 i thank the hon member for his engagement and i will arrange a meeting with the relevant member of the team the information be on gov.uk project near his constituency the cheshire wildlife trust and the mersey rivers trust be involve in the programme i welcome his engagement it be a good scheme and i will ensure that he get that meeting 
 i have be work with the environment agency to address a small flood problem on the river gade in my constituency the environment agency have be very helpful and have meet with i in another part of my constituency the river ver have be flood with sewage yet again that be unacceptable and the environment agency   need to take it seriously and take action against the water company rather than just say we ’ll work with you action be what my constituent want 
 i agree that be why we be increase fourfold the number of inspection so that water company be not mark their own homework it be why we have the plan for water introduce by the former secretary of state my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey and significant additional investment it be why we be take tough enforcement action with the big ever criminal prosecution of water firm by the environment agency it be also why we be take action on thing such as bonus for company that commit serious wrongdoing 
 what step he be take to support farmer 
 what step he be take to support rural farmer 
 food security be more important than ever which be why we need to back british farmer to keep put food on our table while protect the environment we be support farm with £ of annual spending an average boost of for the sustainable farming incentive payment scheme and new rule to ensure that farmer get a fair price for their product 
 obviously farmer in low lie area of lincolnshire be suffer from flooding so any update on the support that they can be give would be very helpful i have a specific question for the secretary of state will the government update we on when they will announce the long term funding solution that they promise for internal drainage board to address the pressure on local authority through special levy 
 my right hon friend be right to focus on the importance of drainage board particularly in lincolnshire he know that i have a particular constituency interest in the adjacent area we have announce £ of funding and the minister for water my hon friend   the member for keighley robbie moore will make further announcement on that shortly we be look more widely at the huge pressure on farming from the wet weather particularly in area such as lincolnshire there have be a increase in rainfall these have be our wet month and we be look at a series of easement particularly with regard to sfi to ensure that farmer get their payment 
 on behalf of my party i too wish phil the head doorkeeper a very happy birthday 
 as the government know we grow the very fine seed potato in the far north of scotland they be particularly good because relatively speak they be virus free that be probably because of the northerly latitude where they be grow i happen to know that farmer in europe be cry out to get hold of these   seed potato i ask the government to do everything in their power to ensure that the potato go where they be need and want 
 the hon member make a valid point in term of both the quality and the desirability of the product to which he refer the minister for food farming and fisheries be engage actively with the eu on that specific point and i be sure that he will update the hon member on it 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 have only to look over the hedge of eastern england to agree with those who be predict the bad harvest in live memory what assessment have the secretary of state make of the impact that will have on the wide rural economy in particular the availability and price of straw which be vital for the livestock sector and important commodity such as potato which be likely to be under great pressure in term of supply and price this autumn 
 as ever my right hon friend be absolutely on the money in term of the concern regard straw price and low harvest this autumn we be engage extensively with the sector we have the farm to fork summit next week chair by the prime minister that be an indication of how seriously we be take this and how much we be engage with farmer and farm leader 
 it be north east week in the parliamentary canteen and i hope all member be take the opportunity to enjoy great north eastern produce however it be always north east week in grainger market in newcastle which try to champion local farmer and produce what be the secretary of state do to support north east farmer in the challenge they face to produce sustainable and affordable food for my constituent face a cost of living crisis 
 as the mp for north east cambridgeshire i feel i should extend north east a little wide give that we be a big food produce area to the hon lady ’s specific point the minister for farming be engage with that issue and be travel up to the north east this evening as part of that engagement our colleague my hon friend   the member for colchester will quince be conduct a review of public sector food procurement so that within our public sector we can well procure domestic produce we also have a review of label so that we can more clearly label that fantastic produce from the north east to ensure that purchaser can buy it more easily 
 i call the shadow minister 
 what be the government do to support farmer quite a few people be ask that when look at the evidence of what be go on the survey this week from the national farmers union into farmer confidence reveal that a staggering of farmer be face decline profit or their business will not survive at all their prospect be bad than most tory mp it suddenly seem why be it that farmer do so badly under the conservatives 
 the hon gentleman seem to have write that question before listen to the various example that i have just give but let i give he the most successful scheme the department for environment food and rural affairs have ever run be the current sustainable farming incentive scheme with over application more than any other scheme the department have run we have also be flexible in look at how those scheme be deliver give the challenge of the wet weather and i will have more to say on that very shortly 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i listen carefully to that answer while brexit have be deeply damaging to farmer all across the united kingdom the action take by the scottish government mean that farmer in scotland have far great protection than those elsewhere on these island the snp government have guarantee scottish farmer the level of funding that be available pre brexit unlike the tories here in england or indeed the labour party in wales that be the snp stand up for farmer in word and deed unlike the westminster party will the secretary of state take this opportunity to apologise to farmer in england for his government ’s betrayal of they 
 i refer the hon gentleman to the £ commitment in our manifesto which have be meet in full 
 what step his department be take to help increase tree planting 
 this government have put in place the most comprehensive regime ever to increase tree planting crucially it be underpin by legislation in the environment act and legally bind target to increase our tree cover to and support and back up by our £ nature for climate fund to date tree have be plant under this government more tree than in any other decade 
 tree must play a crucial role if we be to meet our commitment on nature recovery and net and they be a tremendous source of happiness well being and landscape beauty to meet the ambitious tree plant goal that the government have set can they streamline the permission process some of the red tape seem disproportionate and in need of regulatory reform 
 i thank my right hon friend for the work she have do in her constituency to encourage tree planting but she be right that the process need to be fast and simple we have take that on board and the forestry commission have recently introduce the woodland creation fast track aim to help to decide eligible woodland creation offer within just week to inform that scheme it have develop a low sensitivity map of the whole country to show people the good place to plant   tree or where they could think about planting tree that be not on our good available agricultural land which be important for food 
 lead by the woodland trust tree equity score uk be a map base application create to address disparity in urban tree distribution by identify the area in great need of investment in tree what be the department do to promote increase tree cover in the part of the country that need it most 
 i highlight again the low sensitivity map which point out exactly the same thing as the map the hon gentleman refer to we have many fund focus in particular on urban area some come from the department for levelling up housing and communities to encourage urban tree planting because it be so important for our health and wellbeing we have a whole list of fund available and i urge people to look at they and plant tree 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i have to say that the minister ’s response suggest that the government be completely in denial the office for environmental protection report expose that the government be way off target on their legally bind tree planting target there have be no trend of improvement on tree planting between and it would be bad enough if the problem be lack of money but her department be even fail to spend the money that it have be allocate the environmental land management scheme be underspent by hundred of million and the nature for climate fund that she speak about have return £ to the treasury unspent be not it clear that to get the tree cover that our country need we do not need a magic money tree we need a labour government 
 i ask the hon gentleman to look at his own tree planting record this government have plant more tree than labour do we now have the plan in place so if look at the graph it be ramp up to hit those target and the training skill the forest apprenticeship and the framework be in place to reach our target 
 what step his department be take to strengthen coastal defence 
 we be invest approximately £ of our £ flood and coastal risk management investment programme in coastal project they will well protect over property as well as critical infrastructure the environment agency be also run the £ government fund coastal transition accelerator programme which be fund coastal authority so they can explore how to well support their community 
 the east anglian coast have take a real battering in recent month and project such as the lowestoft flood defence scheme have be delay our   region be the most vulnerable to climate change and be a lead player in deliver net for the uk so will my hon friend consider a climate change risk assessment on which a regional coast defence strategy can then be prepared to properly protect home business port farmland and infrastructure as well as nurture our unique coastal environment 
 there be no well champion than my hon friend on the challenge of coastal erosion the environment agency be develop a new national flood risk assessment and an update coastal erosion risk map to improve how we access flood risk information and communicate it to our community those new dataset and map will include the potential impact of climate change on flood risk and coastal erosion and will help to inform how we well protect home business farmland and infrastructure along our coastal community 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we learn from the public accounts committee report that flood defence project have be cancel just like the in lowestoft whether the minister choose to use the word cancel defer delay or on a long list make no difference because he be still refuse to tell we where those project be why do he insist on hold resident in contempt by not tell they the fate of their local flood defence 
 i and my official have be review the application that have be put forward and announcement will be come very soon the government be invest £ in flood defence which be more than ever before and we will continue to ensure that we be well protect coastal community 
 how much fund his department plan to provide for catchment partnership in the financial year 
 catchment base approach partnership be set out in the plan for water the catchment base approach be exactly the right i agree with the decision take by my right hon friend on that and be exactly the approach that we be take in the financial year £ be allocate to each catchment for that 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer the plan for water be start to work in relation to community partnership next week the east suffolk catchments partnership will publish the plan for the river deben however could i encourage my right hon friend to try to accelerate some of those partnership potentially by increase the funding from £ per partnership to £ so that every single partnership can have a full time employee to really drive this action forward 
 i very much agree with my right hon friend what we be do be twofold we be increase funding she will have see that yesterday we announce an uplift of £ for local   community lead project to improve river catchment alongside that we be look at some major intervention in catchment such as on the river wye where we allocate £ we be take a targeted approach to catchment specific issue in that catchment the issue be chicken litter the phosphate be go into the river wye so we be fund anaerobic digester as a target way of take a catchment approach 
 sewage have be discharge into our river for hour include the river thames in my constituency funding be only part of clean up this mess the whole water sector be break and need to be put into special measure so what be the secretary of state ’s long term plan for tackle these issue or be he content to keep follow labour ’s lead and to take up our policy 
 the thing i would mention be the £ of investment in the thames tideway tunnel over the past year which be go to significantly improve the water quality of the river thames alongside that we be step up inspection with a fourfold increase in inspection we be tackle bonus in company that be guilty of pollution and we be take much tough enforcement action with the big ever prosecution of water firm by the environment agency a whole range of action couple with the plan for water be bring additional investment into the sector and take a catchment by catchment approach 
 what recent progress his department have make on improve air quality 
 what step his department be take to help reduce air pollution 
 we be drive down emission and concentration of the most harmful air pollutant reduce their impact on public health and the environment through the environment act we introduce further legal target for fine particulate matter we have allocate £ to support local authority and air pollution have fall significantly since with emission of nitrogen oxide down by pm2.5 down by and sulphur dioxide down by 
 give that incinerator capacity far outweighs waste i welcome the government ’s decision to introduce a short term pause in the determination of application for environmental permit for certain type of waste incineration facility will the minister please now extend that pause beyond its current official end date of   may   and include exist incinerator that have apply to increase their capacity 
 i be grateful for my hon friend ’s question our assessment of incineration capacity and need be ongoing i do not want to prejudge the outcome of that work or any of the next step but the government be clear that propose waste incineration facility must not result in overcapacity or compromise our ambition to minimise waste and improve recycling 
 last month my local authority of richmond upon thames along with other council be inform by defra that its local air quality grant of £ which have be award just month early be be rescind give the number of area in twickenham breach air quality standard include area close to school and with world health organisation target become ever more stringent how do the minister think he be meet his commitment to expand the resource available to council to improve air quality 
 i be grateful for the hon lady ’s question which give we the opportunity to highlight the great progress we be make in this area we want to continue to make progress and support local authority but we do have concern that the local air quality scheme be not deliver the most positive outcome and some of the bid that be come forward be not aim at improve air quality we have bid for a robotic chatbot and for a kinetic art project we want to focus on improve air quality and make sure we be fund local authority to do just that 
 if he will take step to implement a dog groomer charter mark that include a register of serious injury for dog 
 under the animal welfare act groomer must protect dog under their control from harm and provide for their welfare need where that act be breach offender face imprisonment or an unlimited fine as the legislation be already clear we do not have any plan at the moment to implement a charter 
 a constituent recently bring quite a distressing case to my office a routine trip to the dog groomer ’s turn into a disaster for her beloved pet the dog be seriously injure due to the groomer use incorrect equipment result in painful laceration multiple veterinary visit and permanent scarring unfortunately that be not an isolated case i be aware that as the minister say the animal welfare act provide some framework in relation to intentional harm but i be amazed at the lack of regulation in the industry will the minister make an assessment of what further legislative step can be take to regulate the dog groom industry and ensure the safety of all dog 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this case and obviously i sympathise with his constituent whose pet suffer that poor practice the government ’s belief in the importance of animal welfare underpin the strong protection include in the animal welfare act and we will take step to address widespread welfare issue where they arise 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of a operational and b consent waste incineration plant capacity 
 official be currently assess plan residual waste treatment capacity include incineration against expected future residual waste arise in england so that we can understand our future capacity need follow the implementation of key commitment in the resource and waste strategy this capacity assessment will be publish in due course 
 my north west norfolk constituent welcome the moratorium on new waste incinerator and the review but give that the incinerator already operate and those with consent provide enough capacity as we meet legally bind target to halve residual waste may i urge the minister to make that temporary pause permanent so that we do not have to have an unnecessary and unwanted incinerator in wisbech 
 defra official be currently scope the need for a review of the role of waste incineration facility and i do not want to prejudge the conclusion of that exercise the current pause period will end on   may and the next step will be announce no later than that date 
 what step his department be take to help improve animal welfare 
 this government remain absolutely committed to implement our action plan for animal welfare since the action plan be publish in we have make significant progress on a whole raft of animal welfare measure such as introduce tough sentence on animal cruelty and new law on animal sentience bring forward legislation to ban live export and keep primate as pet launch the animal health and welfare pathway ensure the microchipping of cat and back critical legislation to crack down on puppy smuggling pet abduction and livestock worry 
 i be grateful for that answer and indeed for all the animal welfare measure that this government have introduce recently pupil in larch class at bridges primary school write to i very eloquently about their concern for the welfare and protection of endangered specie can the minister say a little more about what her department be do in that respect 
 i thank my hon friend for that question and indeed for his own work on animal welfare in this place which have be impressive i also thank the pupil of larch class at bridges primary school he can go back and tell they that this government be absolutely committed to tackle this and to help endanger specie we be actually the government to legislate to halt specie decline in this country as far as i know no other country have do that anywhere in the world and we have fund to save specie they might also like to hear about otter return to our river about save red kite by protect they from persecution about save the chalk hill blue butterfly and more 
 what step his department be take to support local authority to tackle fly tipping 
 what step his department be take to support local authority to tackle fly tipping 
 nationally fly tipping on public land have fall for the year in a row with enforcement action up by but we all know the huge detrimental impact that fly tipping can have on our community fly tipping fine have more than double and we be now expect local authority to reinvest that income in enforcement and clean up our street we be go far with reform on how waste carrier be regulate with the introduction of digital waste tracking to help local authority continue to crack down on waste crime 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer what landowner and the public want be for this to stop i realise that we have double the fine we have massively increase they again but may i suggest that all case should be prosecute and that prosecution should be publicise widely both to reassure victim and to deter perpetrator 
 i could not agree more promote the conviction absolutely reassure victim that the government and local authority be take tough action i know that my hon friend have particular concern about what be happen across the countryside and defra be fund the national rural crime unit to explore the police ’s role in tackle fly tipping and how that can be optimise work with local authority to deal with this crime 
 fly tipping be a concern for many local resident across uxbridge and south ruislip i would like to pay tribute to mary in yiewsley bernie in south ruislip wendy in cowley and donna from ruislip gardens who all act as community champion in report regular fly tipping i also need to mention the waste service team at hillingdon council who work tirelessly in respond to regular case of fly tipping however all of this great work from resident and the council can only go so far so what further funding and support be available specifically to target fly tipping hotspot 
 we have provide nearly £ to help local authority combat fly tipping and our grant be focus on hotspot where they have fund around cctv camera plus other infrastructure include fencing signage and mobile tip a furth £ be due to be release shortly which will help far tackle these hotspot i pay tribute to mary wendy and all my hon friend ’s constituent who be get involve in help he 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since last update the house we have remain focused on deliver our plan to improve food security on improve our water quality and on lead the way both at home and abroad in protect the environment that be why we be introduce legislation to ban the supply and sale of wet wipe contain plastic it be why we have launch as part of our catchment plan the £ scheme on the river wye far to our announcement yesterday of £ in water company fine and penalty to be reinveste in water restoration scheme we be work on dartmoor to implement the very good recommendation set out in david fursdon ’s report and we have see over farmer now sign up to the sustainable farming incentive make it the most popular scheme ever alongside that we be work at the g7 on bluetongue virus and in many other respect but i can see mr speaker that you want i to speed up my reply 
 i want to get your colleague in i call thérèse coffey 
 the environment act be landmark legislation and we of course need to think not only locally but globally element of that legislation be the introduction of forest risk commodity regulation i would be grateful if my right hon friend say what more we can do through our global supply chain measure 
 my right hon friend be right to focus on forest risk commodity our flagship announcement at cop28 be that we be take lead action on that many who have watch nature documentary for example on the orangutan can see how important that be to particular specie i hope to table legislation on that later this month but my right hon friend be right to focus on its importance 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the environmental regulator have today condemn the disgusting state of our waterway cause by the conservatives let water company pump they full of raw sewage this have to stop so will the government now back labour ’s plan and make water boss personally criminally liable so that if they keep illegally dump sewage they end up in the dock 
 we already have the big ever prosecution by the environment agency which be already live we have also already ban bonus for those company guilty of serious pollution we be quadruple the number of inspection as part of that tough enforcement scheme we be also bring record investment into the water industry the hon gentleman never comment on the quality of water in wales but perhaps he will want to address that in his follow up question 
 we will try lincolnshire i call sir edward leigh 
 in response to my early question the secretary of state say that food security be of urgent national concern have any agriculture minister ever meet a farmer who have deny that 3b land be just as good for grow arable crop as 3a land 
 my right hon friend the minister for food farming and fisheries be extremely well place to speak about the quality of land and how it pay give that he himself farm we recognise that this be part of a wide debate about the clustering of solar site on farm- land we also recognise the importance of food security my right hon friend   the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh   can see the shift in focus to our environmental scheme that align with food security because i believe that food security be instrumental to our national security and that also affect our land use 
 an environment food and rural affairs committee report publish last year recommend that we support the request of the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food to undertake a country visit to the uk before the end of the government initially indicate that they would facilitate that but the minister ’s late correspondence to i state that it will not be feasible to invite the special rapporteur this year why be that not feasible before the general election the un be ready and wait 
 i be happy to look at the specific issue that the hon gentleman raise in relation to the un but we be clear about the importance of food production food security and back our farmer it be leave wing council around the country that be ban meat and act contrary to the interest of many of our farmer 
 what can be do to improve compensation payment for cattle farmer follow a tb outbreak 
 we be constantly work with those farmer face the misery of a tb outbreak i be aware of an outbreak in my hon friend ’s constituency in leicestershire which be very painful for the individual farmer concern that be why we must throw everything we can at this terrible disease every tool in the toolbox to try to stop tb spread across england 
 i be so old that i grow up in a land without plastic a well britain wrap in brown paper and string last year our household on this small island handle tonne of plastic it be indestructible it can not be burn and we can not get rid of it will the minister support the global plastic treaty campaign for by greenpeace and other 
 this government be take action on plastic let i give the hon gentleman a specific example there have be a reduction in the use of plastic bag as a result of measure that this government have introduce if he look at the communiqué from the g7 in turin he will see that the government be support action on plastic build on the work announce from ottawa last week 
 many community in my constituency face the double whammy of coastal tidal flooding and fluvial river flooding we have see significant investment in place such as par and st blazey through the starr project st austell   bay resilient regeneration which the minister have be to see we have recently complete flood defence at pentewan but the village of mawgan porth remain vulnerable to both river and coastal flooding and i can not get any real progress in develop a scheme to reduce flood risk there will the minister meet i to look at what we can do to protect mawgan porth 
 have be to cornwall to meet my hon friend and see the starr project for myself i be more than happy to meet to discuss what more we can do because i know that he and his colleague on the local council be champion this scheme as much as they can and i be more than happy to help 
 the sun may be shin today but it have be a long cold wet spring for our farmer give the prediction that of crop will be lose what assessment have the secretary of state make of the number of farming business that will reluctantly stop produce food how will he ensure that the farmer flood fund reach all the farmer who desperately need it 
 the hon lady raise an extremely valid point and it be a share concern across the house everyone can see the impact of the wet weather that be why we be continually engage with the sector we have the farm to fork summit as part of that engagement and we be look at what easement can be grant in scheme such as the sustainable farming incentive but also more widely i will have more to say on that shortly 
 southport have see million of pound of investment into drainage capacity for water but unfortunately the village of tarleton hesketh bank and banks have not these farming community have be devastate by flood the minister for food farming and fisheries meet i and my hon friend   the member for south ribble katherine fletcher   last year which be appreciate by farmer but more need to be do a report have be submit to the department we want to set up an internal drainage board what more can be do to make sure that be do at pace to help these community 
 as i touch on early i be a huge supporter of the work of our internal drainage board they do a superb job which be why the minister for water and rural growth my hon friend   the member for keighley robbie moore decide to allocate an additional £ we will look constructively at what more can be do in more area through the focus of drainage board my hon friend will have see that we have already flex our regulation in response to storm henk for example and we be look at what further thing we can do 
 brexit have be a disaster for farmer across the united kingdom but at least in scotland they have the certainty of funding go out beyond unlike in labour run wales and tory run england what step will the government take to provide the same level of surety for english farmer that the snp have deliver for scotland ’s farmer 
 as a former chief secretary to the treasury i think the suggestion that the way the snp allocate its barnett consequential give farmer fund certainty be a somewhat bold claim the point with brexit be that we can tailor our response to the need of our farmer whether through specific legislation such as that on gene edit to develop disease and drought resistant crop our procurement legislation so that we well leverage our public sector procurement and our labelling legislation so that we can support british producer as well as through scheme such as the sfi which be the most popular ever run by defra with more than farmer now sign up 
 in the past flood from the lady brook and micker brook which run through bramhall cheadle hulme and cheadle to join the river mersey have cause devastation to home and family do my hon friend agree that joint work across the region be part of the solution will he continue his support for the upper mersey catchment partnership work 
 my hon friend have raise that specific case with i before i be more than happy to meet she to have those conversation at speed because i know just how valuable project such as flood alleviation scheme be to her constituent in well protect more home 
 north west leicestershire have benefit enormously from be the heart of the national forest with million of tree plant over the past year much of which be on degraded former colliery land as desirable as tree planting be that must be balance against food security do the minister agree that good agricultural land must be protect to produce good food 
 i must commend the national forest for all that it have achieve many farmer be involve in that forest too that be why the forestry commission ’s map show the good place for tree planting be so important and that be not on what we call well available land for which we have specify that the main priority be food production 
 the attorney general be ask 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for violence against woman and girl 
 what step she be take to increase prosecution rate for case relate to violence against woman and girl 
 tackle violence against woman and girl be a priority for the government i recently visit cps thames and chiltern   to hear specifically about the work it be do to combat stalk i also hear how the domestic abuse joint justice plan will transform how we investigate this all too frequent crime 
 datum from the crown prosecution service show that despite an increase in the number of referral from the police for domestic abuse both charge rate and prosecution have decrease in the last quarter in bath the southside project voice and somerset and avon rape and sexual abuse support all support those affect by domestic abuse and sexual violence but we can not rely on charity to do the heavy lifting do the attorney general agree that if we want the public to have confidence in the system increase reporting should lead to increase number of prosecution 
 yes it be always difficult to talk with pleasure about increase number of prosecution because all the survivor of those act have go through a horrible event for a prosecution to take place but i agree with the hon lady that it be generally a good sign that prosecution number be go up i be pleased to say that they be go up in her area for adult rape case there be more to do on domestic abuse case which be why we be focus specifically on the domestic abuse joint justice plan the work of the charity in her region which i should say be fund by but independent of government that be what survivor prefer will really help we to ensure that those survivor get justice 
 the attorney general will know that the online safety act be give royal assent at the end of last year and that in that act there be various bit of legislation to protect woman and girl in relation to cyber flashing deepfake and revenge porn will she set out for the house how many prosecution have take place under that new important piece of legislation that be try to protect more woman and girl from those other form of violence 
 i be afraid that i do not have to hand specific figure for the hon gentleman ’s constituency under that act but i be happy to get they for he we be confident that it will be possible to bring prosecution under the act these be important and distressing but relatively new crime and it be important that we continue to work with the police and the cps to prosecute novel area of criminal activity it be really difficult for survivor of these crime to deal with they 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 the attorney general rightly refer to the work do in relation to domestic violence the most serious offence of violence against woman and girl be rape and serious sexual offence as she will know there be concern that once victim have come forward there be delay in their case be hear largely because of the difficulty in get suitably experience barrister to prosecute they do she accept that of the main driver of that be the fact that legal aid fee be increase for defence barrister but prosecution fee have lag behind there be a gap of around £ in the brief fee between prosecute and defending do she agree that we must plug that gap urgently to get suitable counsel prosecute as well as defend those case 
 the chair of the select committee be tempt i to step on the firm territory of the lord chancellor as he well know he also know because he and i have discuss this many time that the lord chancellor and i speak several time a week about our concern about the shortage of counsel in the criminal sphere in particular however i would say gently to my hon and learn friend that i do not think money be the only reason why it be not always attractive to prosecute rasso case after rasso case they be drain case to be involve in and they be list very tightly at the moment because of the pandemic backlog as he mention that lead to tension with listing and with the judiciary which can make it very difficult to do this area of work relentlessly i have nothing but praise for the barrister who be engage in it 
 what recent step she have take to increase joint working between the crown prosecution service and police service 
 close and collaborative work across the criminal justice system be key to secure justice for victim hold offender to account and keep the public safe the police and the cps have invest heavily in new way of working include through the national operating model for rape prosecution with the result that the police and the cps work more closely together at an early stage in prosecution 
 during a recent visit to greater manchester police ’s divisional headquarters in stockport i hear that there can be significant delay between send a case to the cps and receive a charge decision back to solve that it be suggest that have cps staff base inside the station would speed up the process and improve communication what consideration have my hon and learn friend give to a cps presence in police station and will he work with i and stockport division to facilitate a trial 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this extremely pertinent point she be right to emphasise the importance of early co operation between the police and the cps at a visit last month to charing cross police station i consider precisely that point there be a buddy system there with cps lawyer work with police officer which be improve case file quality we be actively explore how to ensure close early work with the cps and the police and i will look at stockport with she 
 the united kingdom government be go above and beyond to ensure that british arm be readily available in israel ’s arsenal to bomb gaza the attorney general be refuse to give out the legal advice base on the long- stand law officer convention yet the circumstance for up to people be now between life and death what step be she take to ensure that britain   be not complicit in the destruction of a nation and   its people 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that the attorney general keep all these matter under close review and will ensure that any legal advice be properly obtain and act upon 
 if she will refer the governance of the royal albert hall to the tier tribunal charity 
 the royal albert hall be of our most important cultural institution there be long stand difference between the trustee of the hall and the charity commissioner over governance matter i really hope that the party will work together to resolve their difference without expensive litigation and i stand absolutely ready to facilitate those discussion 
 the attorney general in she i must say excellent recent letter on the matter express she disappointment that the royal albert hall bill be not more ambitious and 
 that the constitution of the corporation of the hall of arts and sciences give rise to a potential conflict between the private interest of seat hold trustee and the corporation ’s charitable object 
 i totally agree she have say that she will look at this issue but unlike her predecessor will she please also consider if she need to refer the matter to the charity tribunal so it can be settle once and for all ticket to attend of our country ’s most famous and treasured venue should not be turn up on notorious ticket website like viagogo and those who be receive ill get gain should not be run the charity 
 the hon lady take a very close interest in these matter and be i believe the chair of the all party parliamentary group on ticket abuse i really commend she for her work in this important area many of we who be great supporter of the albert hall be concern by ticket cost i be hopeful as i say that the party can continue to work together i want to avoid expensive litigation if that can be do a previous attorney general be ask permission to refer the matter to the tier tribunal i have not be ask by the charity commission to do so i be very hopeful that this matter can be resolve amicably and i be very happy to remain involved if that be helpful 
 what recent step the crown prosecution service have take to help keep woman and child safe online 
 the cps take the issue of keep woman and child safe online extremely seriously i be pleased to report that the cps have deliver the conviction for cyber flashing within week of the new offence become law this be an important milestone for protect woman and girl online and demonstrate how the government have work to put perpetrator behind bar 
 i thank my hon and learn friend for that answer in addition to the good work he be do to help prevent online bullying trolling and abuse keep safe online include help to prevent fraud will he detail how the government through the online fraud charter be ensure that tech company help woman and child 
 my hon friend be quite right to draw attention to the online fraud charter a world which sit under the online safety act of the big tech company be work together to reduce fraud on their platform the signatory be agree to undertake certain measure within month such as block report and take down to ensure that the vulnerable such as child be exploit as money mule be protect online 
 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the crown prosecution service in prosecute people that have commit crime while protest 
 non threatening peaceful protest be fundamental but those right be not absolute and they must be balance with the right and freedom of other the cps work closely with the police to ensure that those who commit offence during protest be bring to justice and our street be keep safe indeed just last month the cps successfully prosecute a protester under the terrorism act after he wear a hamas headband to a pro palestine rally 
 the minister rightly point out that there be a clear balance between democratic peaceful protest and the tactic use by the like of just stop oil to disrupt society we have see mass protest mostly peaceful on the london street but we do see damage such as that to the ministry of defence which be completely unacceptable how do the new law that we have pass in parliament aid the prosecution of those who be not interested in peaceful protest 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this extremely pertinent and concern point the police already have a full suite of power under section 4a   of the public order act as well as some relate   to criminal damage the offence to which he refer to ensure that they act the government have however reinforce those power under the public order act the crown prosecution service be work closely with the police in for instance provide round the clock charging advice nationally my hon friend be right it be unacceptable that those who be take part in legitimate democratic process commit criminal damage and it be also utterly unacceptable that for example jewish people feel threatened the government expect the full power available to the police to be use so that offender can be prosecute 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on compliance with international humanitarian law in relation to the israel palestine conflict 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on compliance with international humanitarian law in relation to the israel palestine conflict 
 as all member know the law officer convention mean that i can not disclose outside government whether or not i have provide advice or the specific of such advice but it be no secret that we continue to call for international humanitarian law to be respect and for civilian to be protect 
 it be more than month since the international court of justice issue its interim ruling on the gaza conflict and set out step that israel must take in order to protect civilian life the netanyahu government have as yet fail to comply with that ruling but our government have still not come out publicly and urge they to do so will the attorney general take the opportunity today to call on israel to take the step order by the court 
 this government firmly respect the role and the independence of the icj its ruling or order call for the immediate release of the hostage and refer to the need to get more aid into gaza and that be exactly what the government be also call for 
 the icj ruling also declare that there be a plausible right to be protect from genocide and follow the urgent question to the deputy foreign secretary on tuesday i cite united nations international law relate to that when there be concern about a potential genocide take place those be the circumstance in which the sale of arm should be withdraw can the attorney general tell i and my constituent as this be a massive issue for thousand of people across the country exactly when the government will come out and recognise both international law and the risk that we take in breach it 
 this government believe very firmly in international law on   april the foreign secretary announce that our position on export licence be unchanged we publish datum on our export licensing decision transparently and on a quarterly basis 
 i call the shadow attorney general 
 we have hear question about the international court of justice but i want ask some question about the international criminal court its chief prosecutor say last week that 
 all attempt to impede intimidate or improperly influence 
 the court over its investigation of war crime in gaza must cease immediately 
 he be force to issue that demand after a letter sign by united states senator warn the icc 
 target israel and we will target you 
 that letter threaten sanction not just against the icc ’s official but against its employee associate and family 
 will the attorney general join i in condemn those republican senator for their outrageous action will she also join the chief prosecutor in agree that   anyone who threaten the icc simply for do its job be undermine the very impartiality and independence on which its international mandate depend 
 i think that the icc ’s statement be worthy of note and i be grateful to the right hon lady for bring it to the house ’s attention in his statement the independent prosecutor be also keen to point out that he welcome active engagement by government and other party on the work in which he be clearly engage around the world to ensure that international humanitarian law be respect and war crime be not commit he be a british prosecutor and we in this government be proud to work with he we have be very proud to support he in his work in ukraine for example there be ongoing investigation of what be go on in israel and gaza by more than international court at present and i think it be difficult to speculate on specific outcome 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the attorney general will be aware of the government ’s ground of defence in the ongoing case of al haq v. the secretary of state for business and trade in which the fcdo lawyer admit that the 
 inability to come to a clear assessment on israel ’s record of compliance 
 with international humanitarian law pose significant policy risk what be the attorney general ’s assessment of that submission give the fcdo ’s concern about israel ’s compliance with ihl what have she say to her cabinet colleague who be worried that the issuing of arm export licence could make the uk government complicit in breach of international humanitarian law and the arm trade treaty 
 as the hon gentleman know i can not give my specific legal advice i can not share that with the house it be for the government alone but i can say that the foreign secretary have review the most recent advice from the ihl cell that have inform his decision that there be not a clear risk that the item export from the uk might be use to commit or facilitate a serious violation of ihl it leave our position on export licence unchanged but that position be keep under review 
 what step she be take to prosecute perpetrator of fraud and economic crime 
 last year the government publish a new fraud strategy to combat fraud and economic crime and the corporate transparency act receive royal assent last month the serious fraud office publish its strategy for the next year which be focus on tech intelligence gathering and enforcement in fact i be pleased to report to the house that on friday the sfo secure the conviction of former investment manager david kennedy for his part in a £ investment fraud in which hundred of people lose their saving 
 fraud be prevalent in fact it account for a of all crime commit in this country and increasingly we be see online scam vulnerable people often get catch up in phishe scheme will the government consider set up an online crime agency to clamp down specifically on online crime which will become more prevalent with the use of artificial intelligence 
 the hon member be absolutely right this be a particularly pernicious crime it often target the vulnerable and sadly in an interconnected and digital world it be likely to increase we will look very closely at all such matter a number of joint strategy be share between agency in any event but i be certainly very happy to look at her suggestion 
 i call the shadow minister 
 there be fail personal protective equipment contract during the pandemic cost over £ but only    company ppe medpro have be name if the government be serious about tackle fraud why be they refuse to disclose the detail of the other company how exactly be those contract award and can the solicitor general update the house on how many prosecution be pende 
 the hon member quite rightly raise a matter of particular concern to he and indeed to the whole house his majesty ’s revenue and customs remain committed to covid-19 scheme compliance and will continue to prioritise the most serious case of abuse specifically on prevention and recovery up to   september hmrc have prevent the payment or recover the overpayment of over £ worth of grant make up of £ that be prevent from be pay out and over £ that be recover from overpayment by   september hmrc have open criminal investigation into suspect fraud within the scheme and make a total of arrest

 i welcome my new hon friend   the member for blackpool south chris webb he be the person from blackpool to represent blackpool in over year have campaign with he for year i be now proud to call he my hon friend i know that his former boss and our good friend tony lloyd would be thrill and proud too 
 i also welcome more member to labour my hon friend the members for dover mrs elphicke and for central suffolk and north ipswich dr poulter our reach into previously undiscovered support be much broad and deep than i ever imagine 
 talk of which we understand that conservative members be all troop over to no yesterday for a presentation and briefing on how they do not really lose the local election after all perhaps we could have a debate on what the local election result tell we it might   help to inject a little bit of reality into their thinking because they can not cure something if they be in complete denial about it 
 which part of the message that voter express do their tin ear not hear this time the big swing since the world war in a parliamentary by election lose the york and north yorkshire mayoral election in the prime minister ’s own backyard labour take rushmoor the home of the british army or lose of their more successful elect representative andy street in the west midland if they can not hear the message now they will have a stark awakening at the general election 
 we might have all have a small laugh when the former prime minister forget his voter id yet another of his own rule that he think do not apply to he but there be a more serious point we also see veteran turn away from the poll because they could not use their veteran id card the government have promise to add the card to the list of acceptable id when will they do so 
 i notice that there be nothing in the upcoming business on the sentencing bill which be quite a surprise give that we learn this week from a leak email to probation and prison staff that some prisoner will be free up to day early why be the government consistently fail to bring back the sentencing bill so that these issue can be properly debate and why be they fail to publish the figure on the number and nature of prisoner who will be release early it be another part of their plan that be not work be it not 
 despite serious and fast move development in israel and gaza the government again do not come to the house to make a statement this week it be only through your grant an urgent question mr speaker that member could raise issue we want an urgent ceasefire and the assault on rafah stop after much delay the government reject the procedure committee report on hold lords secretaries of state accountable yet there be clearly widespread support across the house for its recommendation rather than the government simply reject they should the leader of the house not seek the view of this house and table a motion on the accountability of the foreign secretary to this house as soon as possible whether on the middle east china or ukraine there be hugely important matter to be raise 
 i be pleased that the leader of the house have finally bring forward the house of commons commission ’s proposal on risk base exclusion next week staff and those work in this place will be look carefully at what we say on monday in the interest of their safeguarding as we hear last night member want proper time to debate these proposal and amendment have she consider those call to extend the debate on the motion beyond hour 
 despite the prime minister ’s late set of disastrous election result he continue to insist that his plan be work he have his finger in his ear and be plough on as if everything be fine it be as if there be no cost of live crisis or waiting list be not sky high and that voter just need to see more of the real rishi and listen to he well the reality be very different people be cry out for change but the only thing that do not seem ever to change be that every time he face the electorate he lose that be not go to change be it 
 let i mark the fact that yesterday be ve day i know there will be many event go on across our constituency during the week give we a chance to remember the debt we owe our forebear and also to think of those face conflict today 
 may i too welcome the hon lady ’s new colleague   the hon member for blackpool south chris webb to his place and pay tribute to all candidate who take part in the important election last week i also thank she for help i to launch the publication to which she refer we commission it and i thank all the organisation that work on it it be important that we combat the rise of conspiracy theory as that be part of restore trust in what we do here and keep trust in democracy this publication will be a useful product not just for member but for those who wish to come here too i shall certainly make sure that the lord chancellor have hear what she say about the sentencing bill although he will find her concern odd give labour ’s voting record on our measure to introduce tough sentence 
 the hon lady mention her new colleague and i do hope   the hon member for dover mrs elphicke   be be make to feel very welcome in her new party i be buoy at the news that our odd of retain dover have slightly improve since yesterday lunch time—[laughter it be true but i think this be a personal tragedy for the hon member for dover as be what happen last week for   the hon member for central suffolk and north ipswich dr poulter it have expose a pattern of behaviour from the leader of the opposition and it be a shame that we be not due an update to peter brookes nature notes for the decorator crab be a specie that cover its surface area with material to disguise its true form usually select sedentary creature and seaweed the leader of the opposition be the decorator crab of these benches desperate to show that he be not really lead the labour party at all he have channel margaret thatcher his deputy have praise boris he have expel   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn   with great fanfare a man he be campaign for to be prime minister only moment before and his exterior shell be stick over with st george ’s flag his gunners season ticket and several programme from the last night of the prom what next will it be a photo op with a bulldog will it be a lecture on how misunderstood enoch powell be should i ask the whip on duty on the front bench if he have check in recently with my right hon friend   the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois 
 this be operation radish the concerted effort to convince the british public that while the labour party might look red on the outside at its heart it really be not at all 
 even the defection from the government benches of of labour ’s stern critic can not disguise the fact that operation radish be not go well not everyone have get the memo the shadow leader of the house talk about the important election result last week have she notice that the act of the new mayor of the west midlands be to turn his attention not to investment or infrastructure but to israel and gaza ditto for the mayors of west yorkshire and london with the latter also state equivalence between the head of state of israel and a terrorist organisation 
 the anti nuke shadow foreign secretary be currently try to walk back from call a candidate for the presidency of the united states a neo nazi sympathise   kkk sociopath   the hon member for ilford north wes streeting   seek to smear a decent candidate for mayor of london as a white supremacist object to ulez and you be a child killer if you be a woman advocate for your right and dignity you be a bigot want to strengthen our border you be a racist if you have make money through hard work you can not possibly get britain that be today ’s labour party just as it have always be 
 the politic of the plp be more the politic of the plo and the jcr more comfortable in university tent encampment and on picket line than on the international stage more interested in thought police than actual policing labour have not change not its behaviour or its record it be still high crime rate high waiting list high taxis high level of poverty less pay less opportunity less money for the nhs and less freedom the british people can see what be go on they like their radish in salad not in no

 may i warmly welcome the launch by the leader of the house this week of the guide to recognise conspiracy theory such as those around g mast and minute city it will be useful reading for some of the member on her own bench and perhaps those on labour ’s increasingly busy right wing

 last week i ask the leader of the house about the chaos of the tory trade tax the border check that brexit now require or as former tory ministers have call it that act of self harm on the uk 
 she swerve that with a boast about brexit boost uk financial service brexit be do its damage to edinburgh ’s trade and talent in that sector too but service be a sector not affect by the serious issue that i raise of rot food cripple import charge biosecurity risk and delay and chaos at the port the leader of the house and the shadow leader of the house might be content to ignore the exporter and importer the farmer and the fisher whose business have suffer while she pretend that all be well on the brexit front but my party and i be not so i ask again when can we put the record straight after last week ’s twaddle and have a debate in government time on the ruinous impact of brexit all across the economy

 i have always say that the conservatives make a mistake in overlook the right hon lady and she have show that again today in that regard can she help i with what i think be a narrow but important problem both front bench team support the continuation of arm sale to israel but the great majority of back benchers even on the conservative side would like the opportunity to vote otherwise that have be stop stymie in the past i hope that she can find a way for the house to freely express its attitude to this question the government and the labour front benchers might get a rude awakening and a big surprise 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his concern but i have not be overlook i be leader of the house of commons 
 the hon gentleman have find the answer to his own question he have just be able to freely express his view on this matter as he know there be strict rule regard our arm export which be also scrutinise by a select committee of this house that be the government ’s policy and if those line be breach and there be evidence of that that policy will kick in 
 wessex fields be a large chunk of council own land in north bournemouth bournemouth christchurch and poole council be rush through the sale of that acre of real estate for £ less than its independent evaluation claim it be storage rather than employment land this be the same council that be cut our famous annual air festival and sell off car park public paddle pool and plant nursery all because it claim there be no money yet here it be throw away £ of local taxpayer money i have write to the secretary of state for levelling up and to the council ’s scrutiny committee call for that decision to be investigate but bournemouth deserve well so can we please have a debate on poor council decision making
