we have be do lot of work on that and will release the report today 
 i congratulate   the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady   on bring forward what be a genuinely interesting and surprisingly well attend adjournment debate i think it be the well attend adjournment debate i have take for some time be i in mischievous mood i would gently refer he to the answer that i give he on   november   february   and   march   and resume my place but alas mischief elude i and i will give he as full an answer as i can 
 obviously the government be consider the very good and serious report into this situation from the procedure committee it be not an anomalous situation it have arise before but it be right that we should consider it in a modern light in the meantime while we be wait for the government ’ full consideration there be a number of way in which the foreign secretary be be hold to account by parliament as a whole in the house of lords he answer question on   november   december   january   january   february   march   and   march 
 i know that the house of lords be not a place where the scottish national party go to play as the hon gentleman know because we have debate this on a   number of occasion i think that be a great shame i understand that the party ’s plan and vision to break up the kingdom fail with the support of the scottish people i be pleased to say after that juncture snp members would have do well to accept that that be a once in a generation vote and that they be plausibly go to be here for some time if people continue to elect snp members to this house it would therefore have be wise of they to stick a few people in the upper house so that the view of their party and that part of the electorate could be represent in that part of parliament they choose not to consequently they be now unable to question the foreign secretary when he stand to answer question in the lords but that be their prerogative 
 the minister for women and equalities be ask 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities on implement a definition of islamophobia 
 what recent discussion she have have with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities on the work of the anti muslim hatred working group 
 we will not tolerate anti muslim hatred in any form and we will seek to stamp it out wherever it occur we be appoint an independent adviser to tackle the scourge of anti muslim hatred to join our independent adviser on antisemitism we have a programme for tackle anti muslim hatred which include the consideration of definition it also include £ of funding to protect muslim place of worship and faith school until 
 despite what the minister say many believe that the government ’s year delay in come up with a definition on islamophobia the conservatives be the only political party in the uk to have take so long reflect their indifference to the fear discrimination and hatred that thousand of muslims experience why have it take so long 
 we do not agree with the all party group on british muslims definition of islamophobia we believe the most appropriate term be anti muslim hatred let i explain why in this country there be freedom of religion and also freedom to criticise a religion what someone can not do be discriminate against or show hatred to i because of my religion 
 alex cunningham be not here i call the shadow secretary of state 
 a senior conservative who go on to become prime minister say that muslim woman look like letter box a conservative candidate for london mayor say that she want to defeat her muslim opponent to make thing safe for our jewish community a former conservative deputy chairman say that islamists have get control of the mayor of london be those incident of anti muslim hatred the kind of incident that the minister just say will not be tolerate 
 we have make it very clear that a number of these comment we just do not accept we think they be wrong but before the hon lady throw abuse at conservative members she should take a look at what be happen on the labour benches hers be the only party that have be sanction by the equality and human rights commission for institutional racism her party have now give the whip back to   the hon member for middlesbrough andy mcdonald even though the labour party say that his comment be deeply offensive   the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott   have also have the whip suspend because of antisemitism 
 it be important that we do not trade abuse about these very serious issue interruption with respect that be the tone that i adopt where there be issue with political party rather than laugh about they we should take action that be what the labour party do after the ehrc investigation sadly the conservatives have not act to develop a definition of anti muslim hatred we have change but the conservatives have not a definition be promise and an adviser be appoint to develop year ago perhaps the minister be unaware of that but today there be still no definition there be no adviser now no active anti muslim hate crime working group no hate crime strategy and minimal action on tackle online hate when be the government go to wake up to this problem 
 as i say this government be completely committed to support our muslim community we have say that we will appoint an independent adviser we have make more money available to protect mosque and muslim faith school i be visit my local mosque al manaar this afternoon early evening to attend an iftar if look at the composition of the conservative front bench and at how diverse the people there be can see clearly that our party be commit to diversity and equality

 happy st cuthbert ’s day mr speaker   i congratulate my right hon friend on all the work do in the fight against hiv but do he agree that if we be to reach our commitment of transmission by we need a pronged approach that include improve sex education an expansion of opt out testing well availability of pre exposure prophylaxis and find the people with hiv who be lose to care 
 my hon friend ’s suggestion be right through opt out testing we have identify case of undiagnosed and untreated hiv we have expand that testing to a further emergency room so that we can find even more people on the availability of prep we be gather evidence to understand why some population group who would benefit from it be not access it this be still an important area of work for we as a government 
 since the funding have be secure for opt out hiv testing in very high prevalence area as part of the hiv action plan that i publish when i be minister for public health in the scheme have far exceed expectation over people be newly diagnose with hiv hepatitis b or hepatitis c in just city in month the scheme also disproportionately identify woman people of black african ethnicity and old people with those blood bear disease will my right hon friend update the house on progress in expand the programme to an additional hospital across england include in derby and nottingham and confirm that work be under way to ensure that opt out testing will continue beyond april 
 i put on record my thank to my hon friend for the amazing work she do in the department the initiative have be a great success story it be amazing that we have be able to find more case which be precisely why an extra £ have be allocate to increase the testing i will write to colleague in the department of health and social care about what will happen post but we be do lot of other work with partner such as the terrence higgins trust to ensure that we do everything we can to make this important goal a reality 
 in northern ireland we have a proactive hiv action plan but it be always good to share information about the work that be do here and the work that be do back home what discussion have the minister have with the department of health in northern ireland on extend the hiv action plan guideline to northern ireland let we exchange good idea and move forward together

 it be this conservative government who introduce mandatory gender pay gap reporting for large employer to shine a light on the gender pay gap and promote action to close it as a result the gender pay gap have fall by approximately a quarter over the past decade 
 i thank the minister for her response can she indicate whether the narrowing of the gender pay gap over the past year have be less pronounce in percentage term among woman on low income than among those on large salary 
 actually the result from our gender pay gap reporting be slightly different it be in higher pay profession that the gender pay gap seem to exist but that be because woman be often in low pay work the hon member be absolutely right to raise the issue next month we be introduce a pay rise of for the low pay through an increase to the national living   wage after the national insurance cut add on to the cut in january people will be almost £ well off in work

 all form of religious hatred have absolutely no place in our community and we work with police and community partner to monitor and combat it we be take a broad approach to tackle religious hatred and be engage extensively with expert to explore how religious hatred be experience by british community and how it affect different faith and individual 
 there have be an appalling surge of antisemitism and islamophobia in recent month but the anti muslim hatred working group have be suspend since march and the hate crime strategy be year old we clearly need a new to tackle the hate crime in our community will the minister commit to restart the anti muslim hatred working group and bring forward a new hate crime strategy

 if only that cheer be for i 
 the hon lady raise a really important point it be something i feel really passionately about myself and it be go to increase in prevalence as we get generation become old because people have be more out in recent year i have be speak to people about this important area of work and will continue to raise it with colleague in relevant department 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday march 
 i know the whole house will join i in congratulate vaughan gething on his election as welsh labour leader and expect election as minister of wales and also in offer mark drakeford our good wish on his retirement the government i lead will always work tirelessly to benefit the life of people across the united kingdom and i look forward to work constructively with the new minister to deliver for the people of wales 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 the people of clacton have have a tough time with the cost of living and i be do everything i can to support they with that in mind do my right hon friend agree that cut inflation be the very good way to do that and that today ’s statistic be very welcome can he reassure my constituent that he will continue work hard to get inflation as low as possible in order to protect their saving help with their bill and give they the financial security they deserve 
 today ’s figure show that our plan be work inflation have fall to from its peak of over down by almost 70%—the steep fall since the 1980s and now at the low level since september and people ’s pay packet be go far with real wage grow for month in a row and taxis be cut by £ for the average worker that be why we need to stick to the plan to deliver a bright future for our country 
 we now come to the leader of the opposition 
 i thank the prime minister for his word in welcome vaughan gething to his post as minister of wales as the black leader of any european government it be a historic moment that speak to the progress and value of modern day wales i also pay tribute to mark drakeford for his long steady service in wales 
 with violent prisoner release early because the tories wreck the criminal justice system small boat arrival already this year because the tories lose control of the border the nhs struggle to see people because the tories break it million pay more on their mortgage a budget that hit pensioner and a £ hole in his sum why be the prime minister so scar to call an election 
 as i say in january my working assumption be that the election will be in the half of the year i must say i think that out of everybody the leader of the opposition would be the most grateful because he have now actually get time to come up with a plan for britain we be all look forward to finally see it 
 oh we be ready just call it 
 let we just take the prime minister ’s rwanda policy when the tories announce this gimmick they claim it would settle ten of thousand of people the home office then whittle it down to a mere   time that number have already arrive this month and the backlog stand at can the prime minister see any flaw in his plan to deport less than of that backlog 
 since i become prime minister the number of small boat crossing be actually down by over a that be because we have double national crime agency funding and we have increase illegal immigration enforcement raid by we have close bank account deport illegal migrant and process over case more than at any point in the last decade it be crystal clear as we be see from the labour party ’s opposition in this house that while we be committed to stop the boat the labour party would keep they come 
 the tragedy be we know the prime minister do not even believe in the rwanda gimmick he try to stop fund it but he be now so diminish that his entire focus be stop his mps hold the sword of damocles above his head perhaps even literally in the case of the leader of the house his great hope be to placate those in his party with a couple of empty plane pray they will not notice when the flight stop go the boat be still come and the cost keep mount how have he manage to spend £ of taxpayer money on a gimmick to deport people 
 it be crystal clear that not only do the labour party not have a plan to fix this issue but the truth be it do not actually care about fix this issue the right hon and learn gentleman talk about gang when we give the police new power to crack down on the people smuggle gang he spend month campaign and vote against it but thank to our new law criminal have be arrest and have be convict serve over year behind bar if it be up to he those criminal would still be out on our street the truth be that if he be not the labour leader he would still want to be their lawyer hon member more 
 order 
 i have prosecute more people smuggler than the prime minister have have helicopter ride and that be a lot interruption i have do it this rwanda gimmick be go to cost the taxpayer £ for every of his people that they deport i know the prime minister like to spend a lot on jet setting but that be some plane ticket it be the cost of tory chaos and it be work people who be pay the price the man he make his immigration minister let the cat out of the bag when he say the prime minister ’s 
 symbolic flight will not provide a credible deterrent 
 we know the prime minister himself think it would not work if the people sell this gimmick do not believe in it why should the country 
 the right hon and learn gentleman be very keen to talk about who he prosecute he be a bit less keen to talk about when he defend hizb ut tahrir but when it come to this question of how to deal with people who be here illegally his value be simply not those of the british people after   all this be the person who campaign to stop the deportation of foreign dangerous criminal a dangerous criminal be jail for deal class a drug after he fight to keep he here a gangmaster be convict of carry a knife after he fight to keep he here so whether it be represent terrorist or campaign for criminal it be clear whose side he be on and it be not the british people ’s 
 it be genuinely sad to see the prime minister reduce to this nonsense let we take another example which i start with interruption 
 order 
 after year of tory chaos in the prison system the justice secretary be reduce to beg the prime minister either to send few offender to prison or to release they even early i must say i have sympathy for anyone try to get an answer out of the prime minister so what be it go to be few criminal behind bar in the place or more release early on to our street which be it 
 thank to our record and plan violent crime have fall by we have recruit more police officer give they more power and keep serious offender in prison for long what be the right hon and learn gentleman ’s record he vote against great protection for our emergency worker oppose tough sentence for violent criminal and fail to give police the power they need it would be back to square with labour soft on crime and soft on criminal 
 you can see why he do not want an election mr speaker why his party have lose faith in he and why half his cabinet be line up to replace he no answer no plan no clue the prime minister have never have the courage to stand up to his party so let i help he out and say to they what he wish he could say the mortgage mayhem the waiting list the criminal walk free they be the cost of tory chaos and if they can not bring themselves to stop the endless game and gimmick and stop put themselves before country they should pack up go home and waste somebody else ’s time it be n’t that difficult be it prime minister 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about his idea but we be week on from the budget the shadow chancellor find time to make a hour speech last night and we still do not know how labour be go to pay for its £ black hole but while he try to talk down britain and the progress we be make today ’s news show that the plan be work inflation down energy bill down wag up pension up and taxis cut by £ that be the choice high taxis and back to square with labour or tax cut and real change with the conservatives 
 the uk birth rate be fall the while number of those require fertility treatment to conceive be rise there be no employment right attach to those undertaking fertility treatment and no pay time off work will the prime minister join i in encourage employer large and small and across   the united kingdom to sign up to the fertility workplace pledge that i have launch with fertility matters   at work lgbt mummy fertility network uk and many other to support those undertaking fertility treatment when they be in work 
 may i start by thank my hon friend for her excellent work campaign on this issue she be right employer should offer their staff understanding support and flexibility while they be undergo fertility treatment the good way to improve the experience of those undergo treatment both woman and their partner be through voluntary approach that be why i join my hon friend in encourage all company to sign up to the fertility workplace pledge 
 i call the snp leader 
 with his back benchers look for a unity candidate to replace he which of the now numerous bear again thatcherites on the labour front bench do the prime minister believe good fit the bill 
 it be surprising mr speaker to hear all this talk about the 1970 from the shadow chancellor in particular but if you see what be happen in place like birmingham where taxis be go up   by and service be be cut whether that be social care child ’s service or in some street the light literally be turn off it be unsurprise why they be talk about the 70 i just say that what they have do to birmingham the conservatives will never let they do to britain 
 of course there be a serious point to be make here because the institute for fiscal studies have warn of the conspiracy of silence that exist between the labour party and the conservative party when it come to £ of loom public sector cut indeed just last night it outline that the fiscal rule of the labour party and the conservative party be in effect identical with such continuity on offer the public be right to be anti westminster be n’t they 
 i be surprised to hear the hon gentleman quote the ifs because it also describe the recent snp budget as in its word misleading and say that 
 pain be almost certainly come 
 it be a savage tax and axe budget because here be the reality while nhs spending in england be go up in real term in scotland it be go down while taxis be be cut by the uk government the snp government be put they up that be the contrast and where the snp or indeed labour be in charge it be work people who pay the price 
 the prime minister rightly often criticise the scottish government for the extra tax they put on resident in my part of cornwall we have an extra tax call the tamar toll i have be work on a petition with my constituency neighbour my right hon friend the member for plymouth moor view johnny mercer   will the prime minister make our part of the country more competitive by lose this extra tax and help our community to level up 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important local issue any application for a toll revision will be consider by the transport secretary at the right opportunity when it have be receive but i be tell that there be plan in place to create a new locally lead focal group of key stakeholder to ensure that there be a real opportunity for they to make their view about crossing hear and i know that she will play an active role in that group 
 yesterday see the northern ireland assembly for the time in its history exercise its new veto power to prevent the application of new eu law that would harm our ability to trade with the rest of the united kingdom that be something that the dup campaign to achieve when other be call for rigorous implementation of the protocol to his credit the prime minister be able to work with we to deliver the real change to the protocol that will help to restore northern ireland ’s place within the united kingdom and its internal market 
 will the prime minister now assure i that the government will continue to faithfully implement the measure outline in the command paper safeguard the union include fully restore our place within the united kingdom and its internal market and end the unnecessary check on good move from great britain to northern ireland 
 i want to congratulate my right hon friend again on his leadership of unionism i agree that it have be an encouraging few week and   i salute the work of the minister and deputy minister in represent the future of northern ireland i assure he that we will implement our commitment at pace include further regulation to be lay before this house in the come day to take power to deliver those commitment on uk internal trade we be also host the meeting of the uk east west council and establish intertrade uk but it come down to this fundamental point and i know that he will agree northern ireland ’s place be strong in the union with locally elect politician in place represent the need of all part of the community 
 note the national audit office report today on the spiral cost of use ex military basis for migrant and note that the home office have announce this week that it be to reduce the project number at raf scampton down to will the prime minister ensure that an immigration minister meet west lindsey district council and i urgently so that we can release most of this iconic raf base the home of the red arrows and the dambusters for regeneration 
 i pay tribute to the way that my right hon friend have engage with the government on this important issue for his local community as he acknowledge our plan be work to cut the use of asylum hotel and we will have close hotel next week on top of cut small boat arrival i know that he be talk to the minister for legal migration and   the border my hon friend   the member for corby tom pursglove about how good to accommodate a small number of asylum seeker safely at raf scampton while recognise the council ’s ambitious plan for regeneration i fully support those discussion and the government be commit to the site be use for accommodation for the short possible time and then release for the benefit of the local community 
 our nhs be at break point my constituent be tell that he need a gall bladder operation after   a visit to accident and emergency he wait all day in hospital nil by mouth and have no operation he be then tell to stay overnight or risk his place on the list so he sit in a hot smelly windowless waiting room for hour on a plastic chair then a gurney come with no pillow and that be where he sleep the next day the nurse say no operation there just be n’t any bed his wife tell i that the conservatives be run the nhs into the ground give his experience which   so many other across the country share how can he   say otherwise 
 i be very sorry to hear about the experience of the hon lady ’s constituent and i be sure she will be raise it with the local nhs trust as well the nhs be of course recover from a difficult year but it have receive considerable backing from   this government include record investment as be acknowledge by the nhs chief executive officer just the other week and a plan to improve productivity in the future we have invest in new bed over the last year and more ambulance all of that be contribute to low waiting time waiting list come down and an improve a&e performance over the last year 
 the people of the eastern village of guildford the clandons the horsleys effingham ripley send and ockham have have enough unwanted development and village take out of the green belt without promised infrastructure be why i have be call for an immediate review of the local plan for the last year do my right hon friend agree that labour ’s promise of concrete over the green belt even against the wish of local mp would simply add insult to injury

 i pay tribute to the hon member for his championing of his area and for his passion to preserve its character although there be no current plan to redraw the boundary i understand his desire especially with london be run by the labour mayor with nightlife decimate crime increase and the mayor raise taxis on hard work people by more than london can certainly do well the only way for pride to be restore in london be with susan hall as its   new mayor 
 sunday be the anniversary of p&o ferries illegal sacking of british seafarer despite what ministers have say p&o have face no sanction and this government ’s new code of practice on fire and rehire would not stop it happen again this parliament will be the bad on record for living standard and real wage be still worth less than in after year why have this government fail to deliver a well deal for worker across britain 
 as the chancellor recently point out living standard be £ high in real term than in if the hon gentleman want to protect work people in this country perhaps he should have a chat with his shadow chancellor about her plan to impose £ of tax rise on everyone in our country

 last week the prime minister rightly call conservative party donor frank hester ’s comment about my right hon friend the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott racist it have since emerge that mr hester have make comment that a group of indian member of staff should 
 climb on the roof like on the roof of the train 
 and make reference to asian corner do the prime minister agree with i that those comment be racist yes or no 
 i address this last week and the minister for women and equalities address it just half an hour ago 
 i call the father of the house 
 mr speaker you and the prime minister will be welcome in the arun district of my constituency where developer be try to build over every vineyard horticultural nursery and piece of agricultural land will he point out that the last place to build home be prime agricultural land especially in an area where developer have enough permission to meet the council ’s target for the next year 
 my hon friend be right that sustainable development must be at the heart of our planning system that be why we be commit to meet the housing need of our community by build the right home in the right place make sure that everyone make good use of brownfield land conserve our countryside that be also the point he make which be important i have be crystal clear we must protect agricultural land food security be incredibly important and we need our farmer to produce more great british food 
 we know the prime minister have receive advice about the legality of the israel gaza war that he have have time to consider it and that government can and do publish such advice will he tell the house what step he be take to act on that advice in review uk arm sale in support the proceeding of the international court of justice and international criminal court and in exercise the uk ’s vote at the un security council 
 we continue to call for israel to respect international humanitarian law and for civilian to be protect too many civilian have be kill and we want israel to take great care to limit its operation to military target those be point that both i and the foreign secretary have make repeatedly to prime minister    netanyahu we have previously assess that israel be commit and capable of comply with international humanitarian law and of course we always keep that under review 
 the prime minister will be aware of plan by national grid to build a network of metre high pylon through much of rural lincolnshire this be cause much consternation particularly in rural village can my right hon friend assure my resident that when ministers finally consider the consultation that come forward from national grid they will give sympathetic consideration to put some of the section underground 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise the concern of his constituent he will recognise the balance we need to strike by make sure that we give our country the energy security it need but do it in a way that be respectful of the impact on local community i will make sure that minister take into account the concern he raise and that all the view of local constituent be take into account 
 give that the prime minister ’s and his government ’s day be number and that they will soon be in opposition will he use the small amount of time available to he to join united nations member state in recognise the state of palestine 
 our position have be consistently clear we will recognise the state of palestine when it make the most beneficial sense for the overall peace process of course we be commit to an ultimate state solution but in the here and now what we be call for be an immediate sustained humanitarian pause that would allow for the safe release of hostage include british national and would allow more aid to reach gaza we urge all side to seize the opportunity and continue negotiation to reach an agreement as soon as possible 
 urgent question to ask the chancellor of the exchequer to make a statement on the government ’s decision to close the hmrc self assessment helpline every year between april and september 
 you have good news minister 
 thank you mr speaker 
 i thank   the hon member for ealing north james murray and other for raise the important issue of hmrc ’s customer service and its plan to provide well service for taxpayer 
 as member probably know his majesty ’s revenue and customs have announce that it be halt plan change to its helpline but aim to encourage more taxpayer to self serve online it have listen to the feedback and recognise that more need to be do to ensure that all taxpayer need be meet while also encourage those who can to make the transition to online service make the good use of online service allow hmrc to help more taxpayer and to get the most out of every pound of taxpayer money by boost productivity hmrc helpline and webchat adviser will always be there for taxpayer who need support because they be vulnerable or digitally exclude or have complex affair i recognise that such reassurance be not communicate clearly enough yesterday 
 of course the pace of this change need to match the public ’s appetite for manage their tax affair online the change in the self assessment vat and paye helpline announce by hmrc will therefore be halt while it engage with stakeholder which mean that the phone line will remain open as usual hmrc will now work with stakeholder include i while continue to encourage customer to self serve and gain access to the information that they need more quickly and easily by go online or to the hmrc app which be available 
 i thank the minister for his response but the question that i be tempt to ask be who on earth be run the treasury 
 this morning just after we have request the urgent question we find out that the chancellor have tell hmrc to pause this change that be a u turn of quite extraordinary speed and indignity follow hmrc ’s announcement yesterday that it would be permanently close its self assessment helpline altogether for half the year from april to september this morning a treasury source say 
 minister have halt this change immediately 
 imply that those ministers have be take by surprise by the announcement can the minister tell we whether any treasury ministers have any involvement in the decision announce yesterday or whether hmrc ’s announcement be make without any ministerial involvement 
 in announce the closure of the helpline hmrc ’s permanent secretary and deputy chief executive say that the change would 
 allow our helpline adviser to focus support where it be most need help those with complex tax query and those who be vulnerable and need extra support 
 can the minister confirm that hmrc ’s plan to help those who be vulnerable and need extra support be now in tatter after the chancellor ’s chaotic u turn i note that report of the chancellor ’s position refer to a pause of the change rather than a scrapping of it altogether can the minister confirm that the self assessment helpline will now remain fully open this year if this plan be merely pause will hmrc still be look at month long period of closure of the helpline in the future 
 it be clear that yesterday ’s announcement of the helpline ’s closure come not as part of a comprehensive orderly or effective plan to help customer to move online but rather as a panicked response to the collapse of hmrc ’s service level to an all time low and it be clear from today ’s chaotic u turn that this government be fundamentally unstable and have give up on serious governing 
 i be sure the hon member be aware that hmrc be a non ministerial department minister set strategy and work closely with the department on operation and communication it be important to recognise that people work for hmrc they go to work every day and try to do the right thing and it be important to recognise that many people there work very hard 
 the overall strategy be absolutely right and i completely support it and i will give the hon member an example of why we need to encourage and support the move to online service in hmrc receive more than call on just thing that can easily be do digitally reset online password get ’s tax code and get ’s national insurance number that involve almost people work full time to answer just those call and such resource could be redeploy the hon member can be reassure that those who be not digitally savvy and those with difficulty will always be able to access service include telephone service 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 may i thank the financial secretary and the chancellor for listen to the howl of pain that come from ordinary taxpayer when they see the announcement yesterday those who contact the hmrc hotline be the most law abide tax pay people across this land 
 this morning the treasury committee have publish more datum show that it be increasingly difficult to contact hmrc by telephone while i fully endorse what the minister have just say about the long term strategy to move people online it can not be do by randomly shut down hmrc ’s telephone line 
 the minister have an excellent digital track record in the private sector before he come into parliament may i urge he to use that experience to make this much more of a gradual transition for those law abide citizen of our 
 i thank my hon friend and the select committee for their work in this area i know that hmrc customer service have be an area of focus    for she and other for some time and we appreciate the input i recognise that she acknowledge the potential opportunity and the upside to encourage more people to go online but the point she make be really important hmrc have take the feedback with good grace because it be important that we move at the speed at which the public be willing to move of course some people be not willing or able to move to purely online service 
 i be sorry for not respond early to   the hon member for ealing north james murray   on whether the telephone line will stay open yes of course   they will 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 this be absolute chaos the proposal to permanently close the self assessment helpline for half the year be truly half baked and irresponsible as be the plan restriction to the vat helpline the reversal be welcome but the fact that the announcement be make at all highlight the disconnect at the heart of hmrc ’s customer operation as the federation of small businesses have point out 
 customer service level be at an all time low 
 a view back up by the public accounts committee at a time when the chancellor ’s policy be fiscally drag more people into paye the proposal be typically tone deaf to people ’s need 
 fran heathcote of the pcs union have say that 
 the combination of low pay and micro management 
 be rife across the whole of hmrc ’s customer service department the minister say that hmrc be a non ministerial department but we know that it have be tell what to do by the chancellor overnight when do the government get notice of the announcement be it a reaction to the chancellor ’s decision to cut hmrc ’s budget by £ next year will he now ensure that the cut be reverse and order hmrc to recruit more customer service staff and will he now instruct hmrc to make the reversal permanent 
 as i outline a few moment ago i think we can all appreciate that in order to serve customer and particularly those who most need support we need to ensure that those who do not need to go online have alternative channel by the way the customer service level be high in online channel and the use of the app which i encourage all individual to use those who can go online will find a very effective and efficient service so this be absolutely the right strategy and that i completely and utterly support we have also previously have a trial closure of the line and the report release yesterday show that it work quite well 
 the hon gentleman also ask about redeployment hmrc be proactive in notify people who for example do not need to provide a self assessment form i think more than people be notify last year that they do not need to do so follow other change in government policy we have also communicate that those on high income up to £ for example but do not have complex tax affair do not need to provide a self assessment return there be a broad package   go on here to enhance and improve customer service but we recognise that many people like and would prefer a telephone service 
 despite extensive government investment in rural broadband in my constituency there remain a lack of connectivity with small business the elderly and the vulnerable still have difficulty go fully online what can the minister do to ensure that nobody will be leave behind in derbyshire dales 
 my hon friend make the really important point that there be still people in this country include in her constituency who be not digitally aware or who be digitally exclude for a variety of reason that be why an important part of our strategy be to ensure that those who be digitally exclude and those who be vulnerable or have particularly complex affair can always reach a human being 
 this be another chaotic government u turn with the chancellor take the decision this morning to scrap plan to close hmrc phone line less than hour after the measure be announce a treasury source admit this morning that close hmrc ’s helpline would be to 
 the detriment of the general public and the vulnerable who need access to the helpline to support they with tax matter 
 this be part of a wide malaise within tory break britain where many of my slough constituent can not speak to a doctor when they want to can not register for an nhs dentist and much bad besides so why be this decision take in the place 
 i mention in my opening comment i will stress it again because it be important that nobody scaremonger about this that it be never intend and never would have be the case that the vulnerable the digitally exclude or those with complex affair would be unable to access these service even with the proposal set out yesterday on that particular point the hon gentleman be just wrong 
 i be grateful to the minister for his statement which i welcome last september in this very place i raise the issue of heavy fine be impose on self employ constituent for late submission of self assessment form even though no money be owe i meet the minister in post at the time but will the current minister please write to i with an update on progress 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this matter i reiterate that there be a very good reason why hmrc ’s structure and relationship with government be as it be because it would be inappropriate for minister to interfere with individual tax affair however i would be more than happy to raise his point with hmrc and respectfully ask that it pay it due attention of course the government set broad policy 
 as a former financial controller of a small business in a rural place i have use those helpline extensively not least in sort out dispute when hmrc have get its datum wrong give that our own experience be that the website ’s   process be byzantine that the wait on the phone line be inordinately long and that £ of tax go uncollecte by hmrc every year how can anyone have any confidence that the treasury be work effectively 
 very simply we have of the low tax gap report in the world at about precisely because of the clarity of the tax system and the efficiency of hmrc in gain the tax that be owe of course there be customer service challenge and i be have conversation with hmrc about that hmrc be also hold to account in the chamber the treasury select committee and elsewhere as appropriate it   be important that we recognise that hmrc receive telephone call and piece of correspondence in if it be a private sector business we can see how it would make sense strategically to move where appropriate as much of that activity as possible online where it can be deal with more appropriately and often more quickly 
 the women and equalities committee which be currently carry out an inquiry on the right of old people this week meet independent age and a range of stakeholder in andover they make the point that old people need to be able to access all service on the telephone as people who be disabled or have a visual impairment find online service difficult to be able to communicate effectively people who be hard of hear need website with a british sign language overlay independent age and the stakeholder i meet be horrify at yesterday ’s announcement on the closure of the helpline 
 what consultation have there be with my hon friend   the member for mid sussex mims davies in her expand role as minister for disabled people on the potential impact of these change when members of parliament deal with hmrc on constituency casework it now try to push we into use the telephone rather than email can the financial secretary assure i that vulnerable people will still be able to use telephone service will he comment on the contradiction between how members of parliament and the public be deal with by hmrc 
 i assure my right hon friend that we be have live conversation with hmrc about how it communicate with member of parliament on behalf of our constituent some member tell i that they would prefer a telephone call whereas other would prefer email it be important that we have both i be more than happy to communicate view and opinion from across the chamber on that point i be well aware that of the big area of concern about yesterday ’s announcement and of the reason why the feedback have be so loud be that vulnerable people include those with disability might not be help it be never the intention or the plan that such people would be unable to access online webchat or other channel 
 the minister have speak about member of the public who be willing and able to access service online member have to complete our own self assessment form i be willing and able but i still need access to a telephone helpline he say that people be need to answer the same   question which obviously can not be handle by the online system follow this announcement be he confident that hmrc have the digital tool necessary to cater for more than self assessment taxpayer 
 i need to correct the hon lady as the vast majority of the point i raise could be handle online include through the app of the thing we must do be communicate far more clearly a fair point have be raise in the chamber today and i will continue to discuss it with hmrc because there be clearly some challenge with communicate what be available where help exist and so on but there be a wealth of information on the digital offering particularly the app and i encourage people to adopt they where possible the hon lady make a valid point that people who can not adopt they will need other help and we be listen 
 it be clear that hmrc make a serious mistake and the government act commendably quickly in intervene to put matter right i be sure they will now take a close interest in what happen next as a matter of policy will the minister ensure that whatever the future hold it will not be anything so sudden or brutal and that there will be a trial period before anything so dramatic be implement across the board 
 as i mention a few moment ago there have be a trial closure of telephone service the recently report result show that the trial work quite well as we hear overnight and be hear again in the chamber today the important challenge be that the confidence behind that have not be effectively communicate the reassurance that i personally receive on what will happen to help those who be not able to access online service include the disabled those without digital access and those with particularly complex case be not communicate that be important to make sure that as hmrc move forward and policy be develop we move at a pace with which people be comfortable 
 i hope that hmrc ’s screech u turn be a result of the minister ’s action if it be i congratulate he on step in so quickly do he agree that at a time when more and more people be be drag into complex tax return because of fiscal drag when people have their call to hmrc unanswered in january and when a record number of people be put in their tax return late because they can not get information hmrc should not have adopt such a policy will the minister give we an assurance that this be not temporary and that whatever help income tax payer require to pay their tax will be make available 
 i give the right hon gentleman an assurance on the latter point as i have outline several time today i think we can all recognise that the move to digital where appropriate will relieve the burden on the people answer telephone call and on some other service allow they to deliver precisely the end goal that he describe simplify the tax system be a goal of government policy i give an example of people on high income with relatively simple tax affair those   who pay through paye for example and we be try to remove as many of those people as possible from self assessment i completely understand the right hon gentleman ’s point 
 although decision on individual tax case be rightly manage independently by hmrc political and public pressure see this ridiculous decision squash what step will ministers take to improve the accountability and performance of hmrc 
 there be a variety of channel and tool include my ministerial oversight the treasury select committee and other body also play an important part i be not suggest in any way shape or form that i be remove myself from responsibility for hmrc as i have ministerial oversight if colleague have concern they can always raise they with i it be my job to raise those concern with hmrc 
 i refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests as i chair the public and commercial services union parliamentary group 
 do the minister accept that of the more disgraceful aspect of this episode be that neither the trade union nor the staff appear to have be consult prior to yesterday ’s announcement do he accept that this be no way to conduct industrial relation or to deal with staff how do he see yesterday ’s announcement in the light of the public accounts committee ’s comment that the department have to improve its ability to reach out to taxpayer and that it need additional resource why be the government now restrict customer access to the department 
 hmrc and i have hear and respect the view of the pac and other body include their recommendation and suggestion for improvement of course many of these body suggest that the continue move towards digital and online be an important part of that process as i have say i do not have day to day operational responsibility for hmrc but i do have oversight i proactively request a meeting with the union several week ago and that be what i have tend to do in all my ministerial role 
 this be a welcome u turn but do my hon friend accept that of the problem be hmrc ’s chronic lack of productivity be that not make bad because so many people be work from home 
 my hon friend be correct that a focus on productivity be key and i can assure he that these be exactly the kind of conversation that i be have the chief secretary to the treasury be lead a cross government review of productivity hmrc staff be require to work in the office for of the time i have ask hmrc to assess and monitor the productivity of staff who be work from home versus staff work in the office and there be very little difference because of the concern express by my hon friend and other i will keep an eye on it 
 the reprieve be welcome but if we be to keep these helpline open can we at least resource they properly and make they work i speak to a chartered accountant in my constituency this morning and he tell i that when he recently phone hmrc with a complex query on behalf of a client it take minute to get an answer when the phone be answer there be an acknowledgment of the problem he suggest that the answer might lie in his client ’s wife ’s datum be incorrectly order at which point he be tell that the staff be allow to handle only case per call and that he would have to hang up and phone back with another minute wait for an answer surely that be no way to treat a customer 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise that point and i be happy to raise it with hmrc 
 i be regularly contact by constituent who have have poor service from hmrc as i be sure many of my colleague be these people be pretty certain that they would still be wait have they not get their mp involve my constituent mr mccall retire to care for his terminally ill wife in but have since be chase repeatedly by hmrc to provide a tax return for he do not use email and have describe the diabolical experience he have have with the phone line he wait minute for an automated voice and the line then go dead do the minister accept that that service level be not acceptable at all and thing must improve would he like to take the opportunity to apologise to mr mccall for the distress that hmrc have cause he 
 yes i be sorry to hear about those circumstance for the hon lady ’s constituent as i say i have to be careful give the need to keep at arm ’s length in individual case but she also raise a broad policy point a lot of training and work go on i repeat that some people work for hmrc many of whom be dedicate hard work and well train individual and they often do a thankless job but she make a valid point and i will happy raise that issue i speak incorrectly a few moment ago so may i take the opportunity to correct what i say mr speaker hmrc staff be require to work in the office of the time not of the time 
 the government be force to extend the state pension top up through to april next year because of unacceptable delay on the department for work and pensions hmrc helpline for that issue the minister have mention that a review will take place will that helpline be in its scope it be a concern to many many constituent 
 as i say i have ongoing engagement with hmrc it be operationally independent but i do have some oversight and ministerial guidance be appropriate i appreciate all the comment make by hon member today these will be live conversation and hmrc be listen to the conversation today i will be happy to raise with it the point that she make 
 let i thank the minister for a positive response and for try to solve the problem we appreciate that constituent have tell my office about their struggle to get through to hmrc on the phone line there be no doubt that people still rely on service that allow they to speak to an individual that be so important as it be for we   as mps we have call unanswered in january alone which illustrate clearly the problem that the minister be try to address do he not see that there must be an enhanced service for all of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to ensure that all call be answer and deal with the well option of a personal phone call be right and we need a drastic change to be make 
 it be important that hmrc command respect to a broad degree it do across the house and among our constituent because that be how we can ensure that we comply with tax requirement where there be confusion uncertainty or a valid question it be important that people can get help advice and support for some people it be appropriate to go online to get that but that be not the case for everybody as i say the comment make today be very much appreciate i suspect that the hon gentleman will recognise that as   i have say many time it be important that all of we encourage and support the digitisation of these service and the adoption of the app by our constituent because that will help ensure that the time available be focus on those who most need help and support 
 i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that his majesty have signify his royal assent to the follow act 
 supply and appropriation anticipation and adjustments act 
 national insurance contributions reduction in rates act 
 trade comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership act 
 bishop ’s stortford cemetery act 
 urgent question to ask the foreign secretary if he will make a statement on the security and human right implication of article in hong kong 
 i thank my right hon friend for his urgent question yesterday hong kong ’s legislative council pass new national security legislation unanimously under article of the basic law the bill which rush through the legislative process and be likely incompatible with international human right law will come into force on saturday since we have see hongkonger right and freedom deliberately erode as a result of the beijing impose national security law and this law continue that pattern 
 yesterday his majesty ’s government make it clear that the law ’s overall impact will be to far damage the right and freedom enjoy throughout hong kong it will enable the authority to continue their clampdown on freedom include freedom of speech assembly and the medium it will far entrench the culture of self censorship dominate hong kong ’s social and political landscape it fail to provide certainty for international organisation include diplomatic mission operate there broad definition will negatively affect those who live work and do business there 
 although britain recognise the right of all jurisdiction to implement national security legislation hong kong be also require to ensure that law align with international standard right and norm as set out in un treaty the sino british joint declaration and its basic law hong kong be an international city respect for the rule of law its high degree of autonomy and the independence of its well respect institution have always be critical to its success the british government have urge the hong kong authority to respect right and freedom uphold hong kong ’s high degree of autonomy and the rule of law and act in accordance with its international commitment and legal obligation 
 let i conclude by welcome the contribution our grow hong kong diaspora make to life in the uk they be safe to live here and exercise the right and freedom that all other british resident enjoy we will not tolerate any attempt by any foreign power to intimidate harass or harm individual or community in the uk this law have no effect in the uk and we have no active extradition treaty with hong kong 
 i welcome the government ’s statement but it do not go far enough article allow sentence of up to year imprisonment if an individual fail to disclose that another person indicate an intention to commit treason which include peaceful protest or voice discontent if a journalist disclose information deem to be a national secret they will be jail for year since the passage of the national security law in the people of hong kong have endure relentless oppression in contravention of the sino british agreement yet the uk have do very little to hold those responsible to account i remind my right   hon friend that the united states which do not sign that agreement have sanction people include senior individual in hong kong whereas the uk have sanction none 
 i have question as a result this legislation harmonise hong kong ’s and china ’s national security system with devastating consequence for human right it also change business and legal arrangement last year the us government warn us business that they can no long rely on the protection that the rule of english common law afford in hong kong why have the uk government not do the same for our business secondly we now know that foreign commonwealth and development office internal document show that the department pause target sanction against chinese official in november document state 
 fcdo have pause consideration of this work indefinitely 
 as of the parliamentarian whom china have sanction i must say that that be a terrible decision and it fly in the face of the evidence will the government publish those document and make a statement explain why they no long wish to sanction chinese official 
 i thank my right hon friend for his comment which i will deal with as good i can he indicate just or of the defect in this appalling legislation he be right to identify they he do not ask i whether the legislation be in breach of the sino british joint declaration in fact it be not the hong kong government be legislate for themselves the british government declare in that china be in ongoing breach of the sino british joint declaration 
 my right hon friend ask about the rule of english common law and the warning give by the government of the united states the british business community be extremely experienced and well able to reach conclusion for itself but if ever the british government ’s advice be seek we would always give it he talk about target sanction i know that he be sanction i hope that he will bear that with the necessary fortitude it be outrageous that he and other should be sanction in that way we do not discuss our approach to sanction on the floor of the house but my right hon friend may rest assure that we be keep all such matter under regular review 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 hong kong ’s new national security law be the late degradation of the right and freedom of hong kong it be cause fear and unease not only to hongkongers but to uk and other foreign national live and work in hong kong as well as international business and organisation operate there and many outside hong kong article ’s provision apply to hong kong resident and business anywhere in the uk we have see where that can lead there be the frankly appalling attack on a protester in manchester in december what step be the uk government take to counter the threat of transnational repression especially towards the hongkonger who have come to the uk via the british national overseas passport route many will feel unsafe and unprotected and be deny access even to their own   pension i ask on their behalf do the minister accept that the law not only undermine the legally binding sino british joint declaration as the foreign secretary put it but represent a clear breach if so will he say that to his chinese counterpart 
 the minister say that he do not talk about sanction but it be of concern that although the us think sanction be appropriate the uk government seem to be sit on their hand in the constant absence of the foreign secretary can i ask the minister whether the foreign secretary accept that his golden era with china be a strategic mistake that undermine british influence over hong kong set we on a rodeo of inconsistency towards china and fail to stand up for the uk ’s national security interest can we expect the foreign secretary to deliver the strong clear eyed and consistent approach that be need 
 i thank the shadow foreign secretary for his comment i agree entirely with what he say about article he chide i for not say more on the issue of sanction the point i be make i hope that he will accept that this be common to both party when in government be that we do not discuss our application or consideration of sanction or sanction policy on the floor of the house but when we feel it be necessary to act we certainly do 
 the right hon gentleman ask i about the view of the foreign secretary give his long career and understanding of china from his time as prime minister the foreign secretary have speak out very clearly on the change that have take place since he be prime minister the right hon gentleman ask i whether the legislation be a breach of the sino british joint declaration as i have say we decide in that china be in ongoing breach of that on the issue of whether it be a breach of international law the bill specifically say that it will be compliant with international law i suspect that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating 
 the shadow foreign secretary slightly steal my script about the golden era of sino british relation trumpet by then prime minister cameron while the minister say that thing have change since then thing have not change communist china be a totalitarian state then and it be a totalitarian state now be it not about time that the foreign commonwealth and development office learn that lesson 
 my right hon friend speak with great experience on these matter from his time on the intelligence and security committee i agree with he about the nature of china the question be whether china would respect the sino british joint declaration and recognise the uniquely brilliant feature of hong kong as an international trading city it be a matter of great regret that politic have trump economic in that respect as perhaps it always will in the case of china 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 i thank   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   for secure the urgent    question let i try to get some answer from the government about a response to what communist china have do and critically what we can do in the uk about confucius institutes back in may the open university brag about be the online confucius institute until the government be allocate at least £ to mandarin language teaching channel through university base confucius institutes will the minister confirm that that have stop there be some confusion about that 
 in relation to the comment make by the shadow foreign secretary the government of country such as the united states and other believe that sanction be possible the netherlands and germany have discourage their university from engage with the confucius institutes sweden have go as far as i would by ban they on provide answer there be practical thing that the united kingdom can do about what be go on in hong kong will the government consider end the right of confucius institutes in the uk and will the minister clarify the government ’s allocation of funding to mandarin language teaching through those institute 
 we be very much aware of the confucius institutes and the way in which they operate i can assure the hon gentleman that we always keep such matter under review if we have any change to make to what we be do we will be sure to announce they in the house 
 there be no doubt that article will have a chilling effect on freedom and human right in hong kong it be design to far stifle all criticism of the chinese regime and its policy both inside and outside hong kong give the number of uk dual national in hong kong what plan do the government have to protect uk citizen from political persecution by china both here and in hong kong will the minister look again at extend the bno passport scheme to child bear before 
 i thank the chair of the international development committee for her comment as she know we create the british national overseas route in which create a pathway to permanent citizenship for british national overseas passport holder it be work extremely well of course we always keep it under review but we have no current plan to change it 
 it be suppose to be country system but that have clearly disappear the big picture be that it be increasingly clear that china be openly pursue a compete interpretation of the international rule base order nowhere be that more evident than in hong kong the independence of the judiciary have disappear along with freedom of speech and of the press hong kong ’s own democratic structure have be severely challenge and erode the new national security legislation will see the introduction of closed door trial detention for up to day without charge and the lowering of the bar of when life sentence can be impose i believe my right hon friend the minister have business experience in hong kong so what impact do he think these    new draconian measure will have on the international community do business with hong kong in the future 
 i thank the former chair of the defence committee for his question during my business career i be in and out of hong kong very regularly it be quite extraordinary how hong kong ’s brilliant pre eminence in business be be undermine by this legislation and indeed by much other legislation and act by the chinese government hong kong be build on independent institution a high degree of autonomy and openness to the world all those thing help to increase the economic activity the living standard and the wealth of a country or a city and it be deeply regrettable that this do not appear to be recognise by the government of china 
 this be yet another nail in the coffin of hong kong democracy and i can not believe that we be here yet again talk about the matter my thought be with the family of hongkongers who be here they must be look at this and wonder what it mean for they the trade comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership bill be pass in this place yesterday and give that china be next in line to join we do not get a cast iron assurance during the debate that britain would stop it from join the cptpp in his role as foreign minister would the right hon gentleman care to give that assurance now should china be join the cptpp while it be do thing such as this
