on noise it be important to strike a balance between the negative impact of aviation on local community who live close to the airport and the economic benefit of flight around the uk we will shortly publish the result of a consultation on night flight and the hon member should wait for it 
 the use of private e scooter on public land on road and pavement be illegal in the uk and it be up to the police to enforce that law we have different legal trial of rental e scooter around the country we recently announce the extension of those trial and we be use that datum to learn more about the danger or otherwise of e scooter which will inform the policy for the future regulation of e scooter 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step his department be take with cabinet colleague to support seafarer work in the red sea 
 let i take this opportunity to offer my support and good wish to his majesty the king for a swift and full recovery i look forward to see he out and about again on his public face duty 
 this be a challenging time for seafarer their welfare be central to our concern during the red sea crisis their bravery have ensure the continue supply of vital good to the uk we have engage with organisation that represent seafarer work closely with the international maritime organisation i have meet its new secretary general twice this year we will not hesitate to take action to protect innocent life and preserve freedom of navigation in response to the red sea crisis the raf have engage in wave of proportionate and target strike against houthi military target with the united states and other ally my department continue to work closely with industry to provide the good possible advice and support 
 i associate myself and the people of banff and buchan with my right hon friend ’s remark wish his majesty the full of recovery could he set out in more detail precisely what engagement the government have have with british company across the uk on not just the attack but the threat of attack in the red sea 
 i be pleased to tell my hon friend that we have be engage regularly with shipping company to ensure that they have as much advice and support as possible so that they can take informed commercial decision about vessel movement base on a full consideration of recent event we provide security advisory notice and convene meeting with the sector at both official and ministerial level i have meet sector leader to discuss these critical development 
 i thank the minister for that positive response it be clear that the government be take the right step to broadly address the issue but what be be do to ensure that individual seafare company with responsibility for crew have access to up to date advice i would go so far as to suggest protective measure to enable they to keep their route open perhaps protective staff on boat or helicopter or plane overhead 
 the hon gentleman be right to put the safety of ship and seafarer at the centre of the issue as we and the imo do we work very closely with the sector to ensure that it have the good possible information both at policy level and in the region we be take further step to ensure that the good advice be available on the ground so that individual captain as well as their company can make the good decision commercially and importantly for the safety of their crew 
 what step he be take to increase transport connectivity between town and city in the north west 
 network north will see a furth £ billion- worth of investment in the north of england follow the redirection of funding from high speed that be in addition to what have already be commit through the £ to northern city region from the round of the city region sustainable transport settlement the development of northern powerhouse rail which will transform rail connectivity between the north of england ’s key economic centre and £ for the trans pennine route upgrade 
 in the light of the government ’s commitment to level up through network north will my hon friend commit to a meeting with i and other key stakeholder to discuss reinstate the burscough curve rail link which would connect southport to preston and the wide north of england fulfil our economic potential and help we welcome another visitor a year to southport 
 you could meet in chorley at coppull station 
 i be always happy to meet my hon friend and i pay tribute to his doughty campaigning on the reopening of the burscough curve it be for local transport authority to consider whether such project be the good way to meet local transport need and if so whether they wish to develop the scheme from the significant new transport budget that the government will shortly be allocate from hs2 saving 
 i call the shadow minister 
 when the prime minister make the decision to scrap hs2 the department for transport say that the plan would lead to increase capacity on the west coast mainline that be not correct be it i have a leak document from the minister ’s own official that prove it in it they   admit that the decision will mean few seat than today with glasgow and manchester badly hit and because hs2 train can not tilt they will be even slow than current train do he not owe it to the north finally to admit that do he accept that he will be the high speed rail minister who leave behind slow train and few seat 
 obviously we do not comment on document that may or may not have be leak what i can say be that the hs2 train design have always have capacity for seat if the train have double up to metre in length the capacity would of course be seat the network north document commit half a pound to look at unlock further capacity let we be quite clear that the mile of hs2 be build to birmingham will reduce the journey time not only to birmingham but to manchester by another minute and to liverpool by minute as far as the tilting be concern as the department make clear to the public accounts committee we be look at where those speed can still be achieve on the west coast main line without the need to tilt 
 what step he be take to ensure consistent standard of taxi licensing across local authority 
 what step he be take to ensure consistent standard of taxi licensing across local authority 
 what step he be take to ensure consistent standard of taxi licensing across local authority 
 the department for transport issue guidance to licensing authority in england to help they regulate the sector include the statutory taxi and private hire vehicle standard and the good practice guidance update in november last year the government enact legislation require licensing authority in england to use a national database to share information in order to prevent driver who have lose their licence from apply to other authority that would not know about their previous wrongdoing 
 local taxi driver in barnsley be have their price undermine by cross border taxi driver who do not have to abide by the same regulatory measure local council have no jurisdiction over out of borough hire and concern have be raise about difference in the training and safety precaution require the labour party have commit to action when will the government do the same 
 there be already a database and already a duty on local authority to share information licence can be take away in the particular circumstance the hon lady identifie 
 taxis and private hire vehicle be a very personal service and it be important for customer that both the vehicle and the driver have proper safety   check so that if thing go wrong they can take a complaint to the licensing authority the problem be that when that authority be mile away in wolverhampton the system simply do not work when will the minister legislate to ensure that journey can be make in a licensed vehicle only when they either take place or finish in the licensing authority area 
 with the great respect to the hon gentleman we have already bring in change to the rule that mean that individual authority can take action against an individual operate in another authority which be something i think he should welcome 
 as we have hear from colleague the cross border issue remain a real problem right across the country we have the additional problem of the potentially change relationship between operator and driver which be highlight by the press campaign about the possible imposition of vat on private hire journey do all this not show that the department should have modernise taxi and private hire legislation age ago rather than wait for company such as uber to drive a coach and horse through regulation that be frankly write in the time of coach and horse 
 i would not refer to regulation write in and update in as write in the time of coach and horse perhaps the hon gentleman should check his history on the uber case that he rightly identify that be clearly a court case that the government have to address and will therefore consult on thereafter 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s good wish to his majesty the king 
 during my time in this house i have work alongside victim and survivor of the rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal follow the scandal rotherham council set very high standard for its taxi driver include instal cctv in cab and require national vocational qualification level on child safeguarding those standard be be undercut by the government ’s deregulation of taxi standard and nothing the minister have set out this morning will stop that do he not agree that the government ’s position be put the safety of woman and girl at risk be it not time for robust legislation and national minimum standard to protect they 
 with respect on   april   a new law come into force that require license authority in england to use a database to record refusal suspension and revocation make on safeguarding or road safety ground the new requirement mean that individual who be not fit and proper to hold a taxi or private hire vehicle licence will be unable to apply for a licence with other authority without that authority be make aware of past safety concern that change will help to protect passenger include woman and girl as well as the reputation of the majority of driver from those who be unfit to hold that office 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of bus service 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of bus service level in england 
 the government be provide the large public investment in bus for a generation provide more than £ worth of service in england outside london since as we rebuilt post covid 
 my constituent be deeply concerned about the propose cut to the and bus route link village and town in bedfordshire that be in the context of the government ’s own late bus statistic which show that in the last decade the bus sector in england outside london lose worker and have around few annual bus passenger journey the government ’s bus strategy publish in be not reverse that decline will they commit to reverse the ideological ban on municipal bus company and ensure that all local authority get sufficient funding to deliver the bus service our community need 
 the hon lady seem to have forget the covid pandemic the number of local bus passenger journey in england increase by half a that is 19%—in the financial year end march her local authority receive extra bsip plus bus service improvement plan funding of £ i urge her bus operator to sign up to the £ bus fare which have be transformational across the country in raise bus number 
 would the minister be as surprised as i be to learn that of the £ long term bsip government cash give to blackburn with darwen council only £ less than of the entire budget be be spend in the town of darwen it be all very well for the minister to give money to council such as blackburn with darwen but will he ensure that it be spend fairly among the population they represent 
 my right hon fried make a very good point this be money that the government give to ensure that community across a particular constituency receive support it should not be solely focused on area i will take up that point and write to the local authority myself 
 bus mileage have drop by just in london since yet astonishingly it have fall by more than in the north east as the minister will know kim mcguinness labour ’s candidate for north east mayor be keen to fix that as a priority if elect in may be it not beyond time to let local community have power and control of their own local bus service 
 clearly that we be to have a regional mayor for the north east be good news but i do not think the hon lady would be celebrate the fact that   she have a disastrous police and crime commissioner as her candidate and that the previously labour metro mayor of north of tyne be now run as an independent against the labour party however it be without a shadow of a doubt the 
 well fund devolution deal in the country 
 those be not my word but those of the previously labour mayor i genuinely believe we be build back well post covid with enhanced bus company usage in circumstance where the £ bus fare be make a huge difference 
 i call the shadow minister 
 recent statistic show that the bee network be already make a daily difference for bus passenger across greater manchester with an rise in patronage in the month of franchising alone and more bus service run on time than before liverpool and west yorkshire be now follow in greater manchester ’s footstep and explore their own franchising plan to revolutionise local transport for thousand of resident do the minister agree with labour ’s plan to give every local authority not just metro mayors the same freedom to take back control of their own bus service if not what do he say to the million of people whose bus route be be so badly cut back under this tired tory government do it not prove that while the conservatives dither labour deliver 
 with respect the number of bus journey in england increase by half a to in the financial year end march and that happen because of massive government funding which have effectively double since the hon gentleman be actually laud something that be fund by this government it be unquestionably the case that we have allow certain local authority and mayors to engage in franchising something we introduce but there have to be a way of pay for it and it have be demonstrate repeatedly that when labour organisation be challenge on this they struggle to find out how they be go to deal with the funding because quite simply they do not have a plan 
 what discussion he have have with local authority on mph speed limit on road 
 in england this be primarily a matter for local authority the mph limit work in the right place such as outside school and follow the right consultation with the public they do not work as blanket measure we do not want they to be set indiscriminately on all road without due regard for the safety case and without local support 
 the mph limit can work in quiet narrow residential side street where there be local consent but london ’s labour mayor and borough be increasingly inflict they on wide road and main road where they be not justified now barnet council want to introduce a big mph zone in whetstone without   adequate consultation will the secretary of state intervene to ensure that these speed limit be introduce only in appropriate circumstance and only when they have strong local support 
 i entirely agree with my right hon friend impose blanket mph zone without local support which be what labour have do across wales and in london be bad for driver but it also risk reduce the specific protection for vulnerable road user which operate for example near school as our policy paper plan for driver explain we will be provide strong guidance to ensure that blanket mph zone be restrict and we will consider further action against council that do not comply with it 
 on hand the secretary of state acknowledge the ability of local authority to deliver their own local transport strategy such as low traffic neighbourhood and mph zone where they fit but on the other hand this plan for driver weaponise such policy will he stop weaponise they and consider those who be not in vehicle but be use our road and the safety measure from their local authority will he recognise that we be all road user whether or not we be in a vehicle 
 i think that question have the disadvantage of be write before the hon lady have listen to my answer i say very clearly that i support mph zone in area where they make sense outside a school for instance they make perfect sense what do not make sense be impose blanket policy that bear no relation to the circumstance which as i have say be what labour have do in wales it have implement blanket policy that be very unpopular do not carry public support and damage the acceptance of mph zone in place where they do make sense 
 he be peddle conspiracy theory again 
 the hon gentleman from a sedentary position refer to conspiracy my constituency be next door to wales and i can tell the house that that be not a conspiracy the mph zone be incredibly unpopular in wales this be a blanket policy that make no sense and be not support by the public 
 what step he be take with the department for energy security and net to improve the allocation of resource between the production of sustainable aviation fuel and other us of biomass 
 in develop the biomass strategy and our forthcoming low carbon fuel strategy my department have work closely with the department for energy security and net whose policy paper on the biomass strategy be publish last year sector that be hard to decarbonise include aviation should be priority us for biomass we be continue to work   across government and with industry expert to ensure that policy that increase the supply of sustainable aviation fuel deliver on our climate change commitment 
 as the minister will know the sustainable aviation fuel mandate will come into force in but meanwhile the government have not yet respond to consultation on how it will work and there be no real world fuel source analysis or plan that would take account of the change nature of municipal waste arise from the already allocate us of municipal and agricultural feedstock for purpose other than the production of saf what step be the minister take to develop a realistic plan for feedstock availability and use 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s question as i have just say we will shortly publish the low carbon fuel strategy which will set out the different source of low carbon fuel we will publish our response to the saf mandate by the spring a great deal of detailed analysis and work be be do in relation to different fuel source we will also publish a revenue certainty mechanism to ensure that we have a uk saf industry we engage regularly with the industry on this and it be very confident about and supportive of the government ’s policy we do have a detailed plan and i want to commiserate with the hon gentleman because i be sure that as energy minister he too have a plan but the opposition ’s plan seem to have be u turn today 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the rise in rail fare on passenger number since 
 since regulate fare across great britain have decrease by around compare with the retail price index the government continue to intervene to keep fare affordable and to encourage travel by cap increase below inflation and deliver initiative such as the great british rail sale we have to strike a balance between encourage passenger to use our rail network and support the rail industry to get back on a good financial footing as it continue to deal with a revenue shortfall follow the pandemic 
 for a period last year urmston train station in my constituency be of the country ’s worst perform train station for service reliability give the level of service experience by my constituent who use urmston and other station on the line why be they set to face an inflation bust fare increase in march 
 if we take the current year ’s fare as an example we deliver the big government intervention on rail fare since privatisation by cap fare increase at which be percentage point below the july rpi it be all about strike a balance and i believe that balance be a fair 
 in the last year the uk taxpayer have contribute £ to keep the railway go this year ’s figure of be again below inflation it can not be   that bad because labour run wales have do exactly the same it be well than scotland where the snp have put up fare by 
 if a person be to get a train from market rasen to london later this morning not only would they be hit by a hefty rail fare as we all know but bad it would take they over hour and change my hon friend have repeatedly promise i and my hon friend   the member for cleethorpes martin vickers   that he will give we a through train to london i understand that he have now approve that he can confirm it today but it be hold up on the desk of the chief secretary to the treasury we do not want some bean counter in the treasury stop our train 
 i fear a career limit response my right hon friend ’s campaign be strong and he be absolutely right that it have this team ’s support i be sure that it will have support across government it be currently be look at and i hope to be able to give he and his colleague good news 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i apologise for the disruption to normal service my hon friend   the member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands   be on committee business so the house will have to put up with a spokesperson replacement service this morning 
 last october peak fare be scrap across scotland ’s railway for month that have be extend to month until the end of june as a result scotrail service be busy and demand have shift across the service day meanwhile department for transport own london north eastern railway have push up price for thousand of ticket in the name of simplification in some case cost passenger go to and from scotland hundred of pound extra will the minister look to the lesson that scotland have learn from scrap peak fare and apply that policy across anglo scottish service 
 i be delighted to talk about thing that be be scrap because perhaps we can shift towards rail freight the snp budget have just be set mode shift revenue support have always be give to rail freight to move freight from road to rail but the snp scottish government have just announce that they be ax that subsidy not only that but for the year to come the cross border subsidy between scotland and the rest of great britain be be scrap too we stand by the rail freight subsidy so we will fund the scottish element 
 what be the scottish government do they talk about decarbonisation while shift more freight on to the road because they refuse to support rail freight that be an absolute shocker that along with the increase in fare and the £ cut to scotrail mean that the hon gentleman be in no place to lecture anyone when it come to rail 
 what fund his department be provide for road resurfacing 
 what fund his department be provide for road resurfacing 
 as part of the network north plan the government be provide a record funding increase of £ for local highway maintenance in england over the next decade to enable local highway authority to resurface road up and down the country over that period nottinghamshire will get £ of additional funding over and above what it would have receive in the current financial year most highway authority in england will get more funding than they do in the previous year 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for that answer and for the billion that have be redirect to the midland for road repair from hs2 conservative control nottinghamshire county council in difficult financial circumstance be endeavour to spend million beyond its regular highway budget on road repair may i impress on he that this remain perhaps the top issue raise with i in my inbox will he bear that in mind particularly when he have his conversation with the treasury will he join i in my campaign to carry on fix gedling ’s road 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise the issue and for point out how effective nottinghamshire county council be in spend the £ that it be get this year and will get next year this be revolutionary long term funding interestingly this be happen because we have a plan not just for deliver well road but for pay for that have a plan for deliver and pay for thing be important as the labour party be find out today it have no plan and no way to pay 
 may i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s remark wish his majesty the king a speedy recovery 
 pothole in broxtowe be incredibly bad my constituent raise this issue all the time the ongoing situation have be compound by multiple recent flooding event in nottinghamshire which have result in time more damage to our road than have occur in other year my office get call and email constantly about this plight from constituent in beeston stapleford strelley nuthall and kimberley to name a few of the area i be contact about this week i meet my hon friend   the member for mansfield ben bradley the leader of nottinghamshire county council to raise this issue what more be the government do to work with local council to tackle pothole in broxtowe 
 my hon friend   the member for mansfield ben bradley   raise the issue of flood damage with i as well and we be look at what we can do i be glad that my hon friend   the member for broxtowe darren henry   raise the issue of the importance of funding for improve local road we make a big decision on that and improve the road network over time and allow local authority to spend that money show an important sense of priority we be also make sure that reporting requirement be in place so that   highway authority have to set out to the people to whom they be accountable what they be spend the money on 
 the pothole situation be a metaphor for what the government have be do with public investment in the past year the road have get bad and bad with the automobile association describe october as the bad month for pothole breakdown on our road if the government be really concerned about this issue they would not have starve local authority of the resource to deal with the problem be that not correct 
 no i do not agree with the hon gentleman on that at all we have give local authority more than £ of funding for local road maintenance the £ in the network north plan be over and above that i would have think he would welcome the fact that when we announce the money for local road maintenance i decide that in london of that extra funding would go to london council rather than transport for london so that it get spend on fix the road rather than be waste by the mayor of london 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the secretary of state seem to have forget the extensive cut to the road repair budget that his government have preside over let we consider the example of northamptonshire where the government have cut £ from highway maintenance since alone that be leave pothole unfille he know that the network north announcement will give northamptonshire back only £ of that £ over the next year as for wellingborough the last time peter bone mention road repair be in after year of neglect by the conservative government and their former conservative mp be not the good advice for people in wellingborough who want action on pothole to vote for labour ’s gen kitchen next thursday 
 it will not surprise the hon gentleman to hear that i do not agree with he at all before the network north announcement the government be already invest over £ of capital funding in highway maintenance between and and in the budget last year the chancellor find an extra £ for eligible highway authority the £ be on top of that so i would urge voter in wellingborough to vote for our fantastic candidate helen harrison who will make a fantastic member of parliament to serve on the government side of the house 
 what step he be take to help ensure the safety of vulnerable road user 
 in january the government update the highway code to improve road safety for people walk cycling and riding the change aim to make a positive shift in road user behaviour by   make road user aware of their responsibility to use road safely and to reduce the danger they may pose to other the government ’s flagship multimillion pound road safety campaign think also play a crucial part in reduce the number of people kill or seriously injure on our road 
 be the minister and his team aware that our country once know to be of the good place in the world for road safety be now after year of neglect no target in fact there be a hatred of target and little enforcement a very dangerous place to be a vulnerable road user when will this government wake up and start do something about that 
 with no disrespect to the hon gentleman who i like as a person he be simply wrong in the last year end june there be a decline of in fatality compare to the year end june look at the specific measure take we have toughen up the drive test make the highway code more robust and introduce tough criminal sentence those be the action of a government who be listen and take action 
 whether the office of rail regulation have identify unused rail network capacity for open access service 
 the office of rail and road have be work with network rail and the department for transport to identify unused access right that work will support the release of under use capacity on the rail network which may then be use by potential operator in the development of open access proposal 
 it be great to hear that there be work under way but i notice that my hon friend do not say how far it have get i know that he understand that this be a huge opportunity to improve our over subsidise post pandemic railway so that passenger can get a well deal but if we do not move fast it will slip through our finger the only people who be happy with the status quo be middle aged man who want to carry on play with train at the expense of taxpayer and the labour party which want to run rail for the benefit of rail union rather than passenger so please can we get on with this a lot fast 
 i think he be refer to i with that middle aged man point but i can assure my hon friend that we be work at pace since we meet in november with the team which include my hon friend to see what far we could do we have write to operator to clarify that unused access right should be release with regard to department for transport operator we have hundred of unused access right that we have identify for release we also talk about speed up the entire decision make process and the orr and network rail now have a draft service level agreement to do that i will write to he with more detail but a lot have happen in the last month 
 what discussion he have have with transport for london on its use of government funding 
 transport in london be devolve to the mayor of london since the government have give tfl £ of funding to support transport service it be the responsibility of the greater london authority to hold the mayor and transport for london to account the department be in regular contact with tfl and monitor its finance in accordance with the term of our funding settlement letter 
 clearly the £ to subsidise tfl come with string attach include raise fare in line with the rest of england no soon do the last instalment of the money arrive than the mayor manage to find £ to pay off the national union of rail maritime and transport workers which threaten strike action store up problem for the next negotiation he then find £ so that he do not have to raise fare in line with the rest of england he have now come up with a crazy policy of reduce fare on fridays without have talk to anyone before introduce it will my right hon friend have a meeting with the labour mayor of london and ensure the money provide by the department be use for the benefit of londoners 
 my hon friend be right it be important that the money be use for the benefit of londoners we have provide very significant support as i have set out but it have not stop the mayor of london from put up taxis on the poor motorist with the extension of his ultra low emission zone scheme to outer london rather than my have a meeting with he the good way to hold the mayor of london to account be for voter in london to vote for susan hall and kick he out 
 what step he be take to increase transport connectivity across north yorkshire 
 because of the prime minister ’s decision network north will see £ of extra transport investment in the north of england include a brand new £ fund to transform local transport in rural county small city and town in every part of the north outside the big city region this be in addition to what have already be commit through the integrated rail plan and the £ transpennine route upgrade 
 i thank the minister for visit my constituency back in january follow that visit he become aware of the important economic impact of the a64 on york and north yorkshire may i stress to he again how important the upgrade be to safety on the road a few day follow his visit the road be again close due to a serious accident sadly that follow another fatal accident on the road in december this be   become an ever more frequent occurrence so when he look at the upgrade of the a64 will he ensure that the safety impact play an important role 
 it be a pleasure to visit my hon friend ’s constituency and meet he and other parliamentary colleague who be so passionately concerned about the improvement of the a64 and its safety issue i take the point he raise on board i know that national highways be develop option to address the concern that he local people and business have identify with the road we will look at they very closely i welcome the fact that he continue to champion this important matter 
 what step he be take to support low income motorist 
 the government be help low income motorist by keep down the cost of motoring there have be no increase in fuel duty since january year ago furthermore recognise the fuel price volatility after putin ’s invasion of ukraine we cut 5p from fuel duty in march this be extend for another year in march this cut along with the inflation freeze have save the average car driver around £ this year 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer month after the mayor of london ’s ulez expansion come into effect some of uxbridge and south ruislip ’s most hard work and least well off resident continue to be penalise by it as part of the government ’s work to help motorist will he commit to continue to work with i and colleague from across outer london to ensure that we be do all we can to lessen the financial burden on all motorist 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that matter i be very sorry to hear about the burden that the mayor of london have force on the poor motorist in london particularly when we hear that his scrappage scheme be underfunde and slow to process payment this be a direct consequence of a labour mayor who do not keep his word to londoner the only remedy for londoners be to vote he out and vote in susan hall in may 
 we need to incentivise people from all income to participate in the green transition however electric vehicle be totally out of reach for most car owner especially those on low income in addition people who rely on public charging point be still pay a lot more than those who can charge from home will the government close this gap to ensure that everybody be get a fair deal include those on low income to make sure that we get to net those on low income also want to help the country get to net 
 i thank the hon member for her question it be my responsibility to help roll out electric vehicle we introduce the emission vehicle mandate   to ensure that of vehicle sale this year be emission i should say that throughout the life cycle of an electric vehicle they be cheap than petrol or diesel car to drive this government have give £ worth of support to owner of electric vehicle and to charge point company to help smooth that introduction the specific question that she raise be about vat and that be a matter for the treasury 
 what step he be take to increase rail connectivity between cambridge and norwich 
 greater anglia currently operate an hourly direct rail service between norwich and cambridge use its new rolling stock with a journey time of around minute it be also possible to travel between norwich and cambridge at other time by change train at ely station when the ely area capacity enhancement scheme be deliver it could create improve regional journey for passenger across east anglia 
 cost be rise for grow a business in cambridge yet norwich a fine city be just down the road and more importantly just down the railway we need a great frequency of train and fast train to make the norwich cambridge tech corridor a great reality it be be hold back by the delay in get the ely junction fix how soon will that be sort out by the department 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s campaign for the ely junction capacity enhancement scheme which be of the scheme reference in the prime minister ’s network north plan network rail have develop the scheme to outline business case stage and next step will involve further investment case development and delivery planning i be keen to see it deliver because it will deliver for rail freight 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 this week the government show once again that we be on the side of britain ’s driver new measure from our plan for driver will make it simple to charge electric car with school and college receive grant to boost charge and the release of the payment from our £ levy fund we be also consult on speed up charge point installation 
 we have a plan to decarbonise transport that be work the labour party be in disarray its leader   the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer would ditch labour ’s flagship spending promise despite only commit to it on tuesday   the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh   must feel uncomfortable have say week ago that it be very important it be not the time that she have be in that position she say a month ago that cancel phase of hs2 would make transport worse the   very same day the leader of the labour party overrule she and agree with the prime minister ’s plan labour have no plan no direction no clue 
 order just a secretary of state you know that you have no responsibility for the opposition and i be sure that you would not want to take it on as part of your portfolio i need to get through topical question 
 i be pleased to hear about the secretary of state ’s plan but do he have a plan to deal with some of the apparent traffic jam in respond to consultation on private member legislation in his department in the consultation on pavement parking close pavement parking cause huge problem for guide dog wheelchair user and everybody else when will we have a response to that on the parking code of practice act introduce by my right hon friend   the member for east yorkshire sir greg knight when will we see the plan to cut down on cowboy parking enforcement company when will that traffic jam be ease 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise those issue we will come out with a response on pavement parking very shortly i can not give he a specific date on roadwork generally we will consult on plan to improve the measure that stop utility company cause roadwork to overrun put more pressure on they to ensure that our road can keep move to support driver 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 what do the secretary of state think that it say about the performance standard in the contract that he sign with fail operator that senior executive at avanti whose cancellation now run at could boast about the free money from the taxpayer that be 
 too good to be true 
 thing avanti do not have any money under the performance regime because it have not deliver appropriate enough quality demonstrate that we pay only for good performance on the specific issue that the hon lady raise the rail minister and i raise that with avanti senior executive at firstgroup agree with we that those comment be appalling and they be take step to deal with that issue within the company 
 they be disgraceful comment from avanti but the problem go to the contract that the secretary of state be sign with such fail operator last year govia thameslink fail on every single performance measure at its station but rather than enforce the standard in the contract and demand well he lower they so that govia would still potentially receive its bonus and performance fee at a potential cost of million to the taxpayer be that not the perfect symbol of the conservatives break rail network failure reward and passenger and taxpayer pay the price 
 it absolutely be not the hon lady refer to avanti west coast i give she the answer to the question on avanti and then she just repeat   something that simply be not the case accord to the service quality regime under which avanti west coast operate it have not receive any payment because it have not be hit the quality targets—[interruption if she would listen to my answer avanti have not hit the quality target so that be exactly the performance regime work 
 the cumbrian coast railway be vital to the energy coast for both passenger and freight i welcome the extra funding and service that network north will bring but could the rail minister update i on the late progress 
 i would be delighted to update my hon friend she will know that the upgrade of the energy coast line be of the commitment in the network north document the department be now work closely with network rail and local stakeholder to revisit the scope of the intervention which be present in the outline business case and we expect that work to conclude later this year 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the a701 relief road realignment be a key regional infrastructure project with knock on national benefit not to mention the major improvement it would make in midlothian so call levelling up round do not even allow the project to bid for funding and i know that the leader of midlothian council and the leader of all the council in the edinburgh and south east scotland city region deal have write to the levelling up secretary to express their disappointment will this secretary of state add his voice to theirs in call for that critical infrastructure to be support 
 the hon gentleman will know that the primary responsibility for deliver road transport in scotland be the responsibility of the snp government because it be devolve i be pleased that he have welcome the levelling up bid that have be deliver in scotland this government deliver for the people of scotland where his government have fail on the specific issue he raise i will of course draw his remark to the attention of the secretary of state 
 fraserburgh base gray adams be the uk ’s pre eminent manufacturer of refrigerated trailer i be tell they be involve in the design of regulation in the early day of refrigerated transport will the minister meet i and gray adams ’s management and engineer to see what can be do to ensure that regulation be update at a pace that keep up with the ongoing innovation make by that great example of british manufacturing

 his majesty the king be well know and much love in my constituency and on behalf of my constituent i wish he a full recovery 
 do the government agree that the sustainability of transport link particularly air link between scottish airport and the rest of the uk be very important for example flight in and out of wick john o’groat airport be crucial to the economic development of the far north 
 indeed aviation be important for economic development across the entirety of the uk include link between scotland and england however the hon gentleman ’s question be about wick john o’groats airport and the public service obligation for that airport lie entirely within scotland and be a matter for the scottish government 
 the road minister will recall a meeting i have with he along with my hon friend the members for great grimsby lia nici and for scunthorpe holly mumby croft about resurface the a180 and remove the concrete surface i have have many meeting with road ministers over the year who have promise that will he be the who can deliver it 
 i sincerely hope so 
 sme owner in my constituency tell i that if he have meeting in london he now often travel down the night before because he can not rely on avanti ’s train service even if the train be not cancel as we learn recently avanti be britain ’s least punctual train operator give that terrible service do the secretary of state now regret his premature decision to extend the contract for the west coast main line 
 the decision to extend the avanti contract be take because its performance have improve dramatically at that time its self induce cancellation rate be at down from avanti be in the process of hire driver per year i have speak to avanti about matter that have be raise in the chamber today and about its recent service we know that it need to do well and we be hold it to account to ensure that it do so 
 it be an appalling service 
 hear hear 
 the propose west london orbital network could enable train to run from hendon to hounslow and take million of passenger off the underground and will be a boon to all people in west london have my hon friend have a look at the proposal and will he give it the green light 
 we have have a presentation on the plan and i would be very happy to meet my hon friend to update he it be a matter of interest and i like to see   such proposal bring forward although of course we have to balance they with ensure that the taxpayer be not at extra risk 
 the dualling of the a47 at blofield be fully fund and ready to go a year ago since then a former green party parliamentary candidate have bogge it down in a series of legal challenge once they have be overcome will the department be right behind that much need dualle scheme 
 the government be utterly committed to the a47 the court case to which my hon friend refer be also link to the a57 we be passionately commit to both road we await the judgment which we believe will come within the next month or so 
 bedford borough could become the home of the only universal studios theme park in europe bring enormous prosperity and many job to my constituency and the eastern region although road infrastructure funding have already be allocate until will the government commit to support that exciting project by fund the substantial road improvement that will be necessary for the plan to go ahead 
 i be familiar with that scheme on which i have be brief and i know that the chancellor have be involve in it as well the government will look carefully at the proposal that be bring forward and will want to do what we can to ensure that that exciting proposal come to fruition 
 will the minister update the house on what measure be be take to reduce the amount of litter and debris blight many central reservation and grass verge on our major highway 
 my hon friend be right to raise that point it be absolutely vital that the great british public stop throw litter that would be the and most important thing i can assure he that national highways be utterly commit on this matter and give evidence to the transport committee about the dozen and dozen of people it have clear up the litter every single day however it be fundamentally up to the public to stop litter 
 heathrow airport see a significant increase in noise complaint last year resident in my constituency be regularly wake up in the middle of the night by the roar of jet engine overhead and there be well document impact on their physical and mental health will the secretary of state finally commit to ban night flight between pm and am 
 on noise it be important to strike a balance between the negative impact of aviation on local community who live close to the airport and the economic benefit of flight around the uk we will shortly publish the result of a consultation on night flight and the hon member should wait for it.[official report   february vol c. 7mc correction 
 vehicle park on pavement continue to have a negative impact on disabled people especially those who be blind or partially sight like myself it have be year since the government ’s consultation on that yet still no action have be take the minister say that they be go to respond to that consultation soon soon be not good enough when will they bring forward a plan to ban pavement parking 
 the hon lady will understand that there be already provision in place permit action by local authority we intend to publish the government review very shortly 
 have the ministerial team see the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety ’s recent report on the grow number of accident involve e scooter and if not will they look at it not only be e scooter an increase danger to all our constituent there be a lack of police follow up when accident happen 
 the use of private e scooter on public land on road and pavement be illegal in the uk and it be up to the police to enforce that law we have different legal trial of rental e scooter around the country.[official report   february vol c. 7mc correction we recently announce the extension of those trial and we be use that datum to learn more about the danger or otherwise of e scooter which will inform the policy for the future regulation of e scooter 
 the mayor of london have freeze fare for out of the year he have be in office mean that they be below national fare increase should i take it from the secretary of state ’s early answer to   the hon member for harrow east bob blackman   that he be oppose to those fare freeze and that he expect a conservative mayor to put fare up if elect 
 no what i find surprising be that the london mayor spend an awful lot of time pretend that he do not have any money so he put up taxis on hard work motorist in outer london and then just before an election he find a secret war chest that enable he to do popular thing everyone know that if he be to win he would put up taxis again on the poor motorist as sure as night follow day which be why they should vote for susan hall 
 i thank ministers for all their answer regard accessibility for disabled passenger be ever mindful that we be in an age of equality and that disabled people deserve the same opportunity as everyone else have consideration be give to ensure that taxi firm have an obligation to provide vehicle for disabled people in every shift pattern 
 it be always good to have the hon gentleman wind up proceeding i will take away that point and have a very detailed look at it and get official to give i a detailed answer that i will provide in writing

 friday march private member bill 
 i start by offer my good wish to his majesty the king and all the royal family at this difficult time i wish he a speedy recovery 
 i thank the leader of the house for the business but yet again there be a few thing miss that we have long be promise i be glad that the motion on risk base exclusion of members be lay before the house last week but when will the leader of the house schedule a debate and a vote once again there be no motion on the procedure committee ’s recommendation on hold secretary of state in the lords to account report stage of the renters reform bill be promise by early february but it be nowhere to be see and the football regulator long promise to club and their community be still not in the upcoming business the leader of the house say a few week ago that that legislation would be bring forward very soon 
 will she also confirm that the government will make a statement as soon we be back on progress in exonerate victim of the post office horizon scandal and that it be still the intention of the government to bring forward legislation to exonerate victim we be get a write ministerial statement today on infected blood yet time and again she have promise oral statement to update the house the business she have announce be not exactly go to fill all the day so surely she can find time for these important matter 
 this week we see the launch of the popular conservatives who apparently have not hear of irony or oxymoron they be head by   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss the least popular prime minister in the history of british polling i know the leader of the house be a fan but in the week she be in office she manage to totally crash the economy who exactly do they think they be popular with mortgage holder come out of fix rate and now pay hundred of pound more a month shopper see the price of food and essential soar or renter see massive hike let we be honest poll after poll show there be absolutely nothing popular about the current conservative party although i do notice that the leader of the house herself rank as the most popular conservative with voter so maybe she could offer the popular conservatives some advice show some contrition for the economic mess they have cause and stay off the airwave 
 perhaps more sombrely the prime minister have this week make some serious misjudgment on monday he shake hand on a bet to deport migrant to rwanda before the next general election bet on people ’s life be grim to watch and the ease with which the prime minister agree to a £ bet when so many be suffer through the conservative cost of living crisis be a gross spectacle do the leader of the house think bet about the plight of desperate people be a good advert for her government 
 in that interview the prime minister also infer that the leader of the opposition be a terrorist sympathiser actually when he be the director of public prosecutions my right hon and learn friend oversee the conviction of senior member of al qaeda the jailing of the airline liquid bomb plotter and the deportation of countless terrorist all the while the prime minister be make money as a hedge funder in the city during the global financial crisis as ordinary people pay the price i know who i would rather have in charge only last week we agree in here that civility respect decency and truth in politic matter so will the leader of the house distance herself from such malicious mud sling 
 this week in prime minister ’s question time we hit a new low in the week of the anniversary of the murder of brianna ghey and while her mother be in the public gallery the prime minister try to score cheap political point at the expense of trans people which brianna ’s father condemn as absolutely dehumanising many of we find it deeply offensive and distasteful include many government member the prime minister have be give plenty of opportunity to apologise to esther ghey and her family and have refuse while the minister for women and equalities whose job it be to stand up for the marginalised double down and dismiss the cry of the family the leader of the house have a well record than many in her party on this issue and i know she will be appal too so will she take this opportunity to apologise on the prime minister ’s behalf and call out use minority as a political punchbag 
 we be about to go into recess and i think it be restorative to spend time with our constituent and to escape the westminster and social medium bubble 
 since parliament return this year we have witness the nation rally behind a group of people mightily wrong who take on those in powerful position to   fight to get justice for themselves and other the hon lady mention the post office horizon scandal she will know that there be a debate this afternoon and i be sure that the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend   the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake will take the opportunity to update the house on progress make towards that legislation i confirm that that be still our intent i also know that the minister for the cabinet office and paymaster general my right hon friend   the member for salisbury john glen be work at pace with regard to infected blood i understand he have a meeting with   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   about that early this week 
 we have also see the crew of the prince of wales aircraft carrier cancel plan leave and time with their love one to do their duty we have learn that thank to the graft and grit of the british people and business our economy have turn a corner we have see our monarch respond to his cancer diagnosis as many other brits have with courage duty and cheerfulness and with family rally around and i thank the hon lady for her remark and good wish as well as all member and the british public who have send their good wish to his majesty 
 we have also see a mother meet the brutal murder of her child with the most profound grace and compassion turn her anguish into positive action to protect other child and we have see a father speak about how the love for his child enable he to overcome his worry about they be tran those be the thing that our nation be make of compassion fairness tolerance responsibility service and love we see those thing every day in the people who send we here and we look on they with pride sometimes that pride be reciprocate as i be sure it be for my hon friend   the member for carshalton and wallington elliot colburn   in what he say yesterday sometimes that pride be not reciprocate whatever the rough and tumble of this place and whatever the pressure and mistake that be make in the heat of political combat we owe it to the people who send we here to strive every day to make they proud of we and this place 
 the prime minister be a good and caring man i be sure that he have reflect on thing and i understand that he will say something later today or perhaps even during these question it be not just about mr and mrs ghey that he should reflect on i be sure he be also reflect on people who be tran or who have trans love one and family some of whom sit on these green benches i hope the leader of the opposition will also reflect on his action this government have be right to protect the safety and dignity of woman and at each stage of do so they have seek to bring certainty and assurance to tran people this government be also right to hold the opposition to account for their multiple inconsistency and u turn on their policy platform 
 today supposition have end and reality have land about the schrödinger £ a policy that for month and month have be both alive and dead and be now confirm as dead at least for now there will be question over whether the shadow energy secretary ’s tenure in that role be also alive or dead politically it ’ strategically incompetent as   the hon member for brent north barry gardiner   call this sorry saga and that   description could also apply to labour ’s costing on its insulation programme and its council tax policy and modelling it be more confirmation that not only do labour not have a plan it have no hope of arrive at either 
 the hon member for manchester central lucy powell   ask i about risk base exclusion and we have table that motion on future business she know that we will bring forward a debate and vote on that after recess but i want members of the house to have time to make themselves aware of the issue and to ask i and other member of the house of commons commission question about it 
 regard scrutiny of the foreign secretary i be in touch with the leader of the house of lords about that matter and i hope to update the house soon 
 finally today mark the start of marriage and family week and it be appropriate that we send a big thank you to all those who support we in this place and who quite often put up with a great deal further business will be announce in the usual way 
 the leader of the house know that i be a member of the programme board on restoration and renewal and she be the responsible minister there be a debate due on the business case and she might now tell the house when that will happen it be imminent we will also have a debate on whether we will have a decant but not until and even if we do decant that will not be until and i doubt i will personally live to see it although i wish member well with that project 
 i do not want to get involve with whether we decant but ask a specific question this matter have now drag on since and could drag on until meanwhile the building be decay around we option be deliver to the speaker ’s commission on this matter and be plan maintenance around we we have successfully do good work on part of the building and i urge the leader of the house now she might make an announcement on this to press ahead with proper plan maintenance so that we can repair the building and make it good for future generation 
 may i start by thank my right hon friend and other colleague for all the work they have do on the programme board the new governance structure i hope mr speaker would concur have enable we to make good progress on get a proper grip of what need to happen to this building and the activity and cost associate with that we will bring forward further news to the house shortly on where we be with the plan and the programme but that should not get in the way of concurrent activity he will know there be some early project that we think we can get on with that be perfectly within the boundary of the parliamentary buildings restoration and renewal act and we should get on and do they i hope that the house will welcome a more pragmatic approach to take care of this important unesco heritage site 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 may i associate myself with the shadow leader of the house ’s comment about brianna ghey and her remarkable parent 
 last week i ask the leader of the house about the cost of the tories secret and highly sensitive report to cabinet on the state of the union hansard record that not word of her answer reflect my question not syllable instead she read out to the chamber a video script about bingo and make a joke about monkey the week before i ask the leader of the house about the electoral commission ’s concern over tory voter id plan again there be not word in hansard about tory voter id not a peep instead she read she prepare script attack the snp in fact hansard reveal that week after week not only do my question go unanswered but they be completely ignore week after week we get a clickbait video for her personal youtube channel surely that behaviour demean her office and disrespect this house she be here to answer question from member 
 return to that state of the union report to cabinet in july it aim to undermine the scottish government and the scottish independence cause which be apparently a tory top priority at the height of the pandemic it come to light last week and no wonder the leader of the house ’s government want to keep it under wrap it contain more grim news for any remain supporter of the union my question again be how much do it cost taxpayer what be its purpose and what strategy be it ask the cabinet to endorse do the union strategy and operation committee still exist while she be at it i would be pleased to know the detail of the highly professional attack dog as describe by journalist who be employ around that time in an attempt to counter independence support unlike the prime minister i be not a bet woman but i would wager £ that i will not get answer to those today either 
 i will be write to the leader of the house with all the question she have ignore just this year for starter my question today though just need a simple yes or no and i challenge she then to sit back down and resist the video script will she at the very least attempt to find answer to my question when she receive they in writing as she refuse to do so here can we have a debate on the role and function of the leader of the house 
 the hon lady can have a debate on the role and function of the leader of the house every thursday at approximately am i hope it be colleague experience that when they ask i question i either furnish they with answer if it be about the business of the house or i follow up with departments and write to they i be afraid that as hansard will show her question to i and to various departments be sometimes hard to fathom 
 the hon lady ask i about a particular piece of polling i can certainly write to the cabinet office although she indicate that she may kindly save i the trouble in that case i will just send her letter to the cabinet office for it to respond to she but it come in a week when the scottish government ’s own cost for polling have be expose 
 i hope that hon member disagree with the hon lady ’s assessment that i demean my office although that be high praise indeed from the scottish national party i think my party have some way to go before we reach live police investigation while it may be true   that those who live in labour area be more likely to be a victim of crime i think snp politician be probably more likely to be investigate for 
 i do not need to join the new organisation point out by the shadow leader of the house because as my friend the hon member for wansbeck ian lavery for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone and for huddersfield mr sheerman know i be already popular and conservative 
 will the leader of the house organise a statement on pernicious political correctness mr speaker you will be as surprised as i be to note that the environment agency have remove the word mother and father from all its document because it believe they should be non gendere my dear mother look down from a great place will be spin in her grave to have be designate non gender can we have a debate on that it sound like nonsense but it be actually much more sinister free speech be at stake 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise that important question while our legislation and the thing that arm ’s length body use need to be legally accurate it be important that people can use language and word such as mother and father actually that be not only the right thing to do but what the guidance they operate under say they should do may i ask he to let my office have the detail of that case in addition to perhaps have a debate he will know how to apply for in the usual way i could follow that up for he with relevant arm ’s length body 
 i call the chair of the backbench business committee 
 i thank the leader of the house for the business statement and for announce full week business that be welcome 
 last week we have to pull a debate due to shortage of time that be understandable give the importance of the government business table for that day but the sad point from our perspective be that unless we be allocate time other than on thursdays for back bench debate we will probably have no further time to allocate in the chamber before the easter recess   monday february   might fit the bill since a general debate have be announce for that day we be of course open for application particularly for business in westminster hall 
 i know this have be mention but could the leader of the house give an indication of the progress make on bring forward legislation for the appointment of the football regulator i have a particular interest in that television ’s impact on travel football fan be worsen with newcastle united fan alone i be of they have have inconvenient and almost unworkable away game fixture impose on they no few than time this season we have have away kick off time of pm on new year ’s day pm in brighton and bournemouth this be when travel from the north east of england and saturday night kick off in london at pm on occasion and pm on occasion those time make it unworkable for people to get back from those fixture on public transport and it be happen on a   much more regular basis the football regulator be much need and i be sure that be something that it would like to focus on 
 i thank the hon gentleman for all his work on the backbench business committee and for welcome week of business nothing make i happy than to come to the house and announce that he know that i take very seriously our obligation to provide the backbench business committee with time to have its debate on the floor of the house i hope to update he shortly on when we can give he some additional time 
 the hon gentleman raise an incredibly important point about football and i find it amazing that it have be allow to endure for some time it be probably very unfair on not just the player but the travel public i will make sure that the secretary of state have hear his concern and he will know that the next culture media and sport question be on   february 
 collect food waste from domestic property be an expensive service both to set up and to carry out every local authority in west london have have the service for a long time certainly before march in west london the department for environment food and rural affairs be provide £ in funding for hounslow £ for brent £ for ealing and a massive £ for hillingdon in my borough of harrow we have have yet we provide food waste collection to flat and the borough want to roll out the service to over more flat it be clearly unfair that harrow have be single out it be not get the funding it deserve and have not for many year could right hon friend arrange for the defra secretary of state or a minister to make a statement on the floor of the house on how that funding be allocate and why harrow do not receive its fair share 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for give i advance notice of it it be helpful and diligent of member to do that i have uncover an administrative saga that i will not bore the house with but i will update my hon friend the fact that he have put the situation on record will help it to be resolve i have receive some reassuring news from the department

 i write to the justice secretary as a matter of urgency back in december but i have not have a response can the leader of the house help i to find way in   parliament to co ordinate all those across the north who have be affect we expect there be hundred if not thousand and to get a response so that we can look after those people some of whom be among the most vulnerable and have receive extortionate bill tell they that they owe thousand of pound

 the household support fund provide grant to household struggle to make end meet but local authority still do not know whether funding will continue past the end of march more than organisation have warn that there will be devastating consequence if the fund be not extend can we have a statement to clarify the future of the household support fund 
 i thank the hon lady for her word about his majesty the king many member will know the merit of the household support fund which be give to local authority to provide they with the flexibility to respond to particular situation where   people have fall through the crack for other type of support that be why we have provide the fund it be still in operation and i know the department for levelling up housing and communities and the treasury will want to ensure that member be give good notice about what will follow i shall ensure that both those departments have hear what the hon lady have say today 
 local plan be the foundation on which planning authority make their decision despite the fact that they shape our village and town across the country few people take part in the consultation that take place ahead of their production can we have a debate in which to exchange idea about how we might involve more people in the formation of those plan 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this matter and for all the work he do to empower his community to get more involved with shape their local plan he will know that our revised national planning policy framework address some of those concern and the weakness in the planning system the next question to the secretary of state will be on   march where my hon friend can raise this matter directly with the minister himself 
 the life expectancy for the less well off in south east northumberland barely scrap year of age due to the industrial heritage and legacy in my region like many other right wing think tank be moot the idea of increase the pension age to which would basically mean that people in my constituency and other constituency would pay in all our life and get absolutely nothing from the pot can we have a debate in government time to discuss the huge discrepancy in life expectancy and the potential for people to receive no pension for a lifetime of contribution 
 the hon gentleman raise a good point there be clearly legacy issue in certain part of the country because of the industry that be there people in certain profession in the modern workplace such as shift worker be also at a disadvantage in term of their health all of that need to be feed in when policy be make which be why it be important that we have evidence base policy and a system across government so that every department be involve in the formulation of policy give that the question session to the relevant department be not for some time i will ensure that the secretary of state for work and pensions have hear the hon gentleman ’s point today 
 since be elect i and many colleague have spend much time raise issue that affect man and boy however this house have barely raise the importance of dad and the challenge they face they play a vital role in bring up their child support their family and support our country too many be block unfairly from see their child after a divorce and too often their role in bring up child be not see as important yet we all know family need their father daughter need their dad and lad need their dad do the leader of the house agree that we should have a debate on the vital role dad play and the challenge they face 
 i thank my hon friend for the campaign he have be run on this issue and his diligence in hold all departments to account for what they be do to recognise the vital contribution father make not just to their family but to wide society that would be an excellent topic for debate and he will know how to apply for he will also know that he can continue to raise this issue directly with ministers at question time it be highly appropriate that he have speak about this issue as i say in my opening we be start a celebration week of the family we know that when family have strong father figure and role model they be strengthen 
 the leader of the house promise that she would table a motion on risk base exclusion for member it be publish last week the future business be light and there be plenty of parliamentary time available so will she tell we why she have not schedule the debate yet and why there be no sense of urgency in ensure that parliament be a safe workplace and its reputation be restore 
 i refer the hon lady to the answer i give to the shadow leader of the house i think that if she be to ask colleague about their awareness of the motion and the detail within it many will not have register it what i and other member of the commission be do be talk to colleague about it i have have meeting with colleague who still have some concern about aspect of it i want to bring it to the house and for it to be understand when the house make a decision on it i will do that very shortly after recess but i do want to allow right hon and hon member the time to study the motion and understand what the scheme be i think it stand a well chance of gain maximum support in the house if that be the case i will keep the hon lady update 
 farmer in my constituency be in uproar and my welsh conservative colleague across wales tell i that they be hear the same thing the source of farmer distress be the new proposal from the welsh government for a new farming subsidy scheme to be introduce in an independent economic assessment publish with the proposal say that the scheme will result in a reduction in livestock and an reduction in labour a number that the national farmers union in wales say be equivalent to about job i know how important farming be where i be even if the welsh government do not seem to appreciate how important it be in wales give the close tie within the farming community across the uk and give the fact that we enjoy a single uk labour market will my right hon friend consider provide time for a debate on the vital contribution of farming to the uk economy when the house return 
 i thank my hon friend for all the work he continue to do not just to champion the interest of farming community in wales but to highlight their critical importance to our resilience as a nation when we study the potential job loss and the potential reduction in livestock number the assessment of the nfu in wales that the plan be catastrophic”—is right on the money i will certainly make sure that the secretary of state have hear my hon friend ’s concern   i encourage he to keep campaign against the plan he will know that the next environment food and rural affairs question be on   march 
 i respect the leader of the house and i note that there be a write ministerial statement today but what the house need be an oral statement from the cabinet office minister so that we can ask question about what the government be do 
 i also want to raise a separate issue the devolution deal that be be consult on in my area of east yorkshire and hull apparently we be to receive an extra £ a year over year share between the council in the area constituent have point out to i that the government ’s economic development deal with rwanda average about £ a year over year they be wonder why the government be put that amount of money into rwanda give that they be elect in on the basis of a policy of level up and why my area be receive so much less 
 let i thank the right hon lady for her kind remark about i and say to she that the feeling be entirely mutual she will know that i keep in close contact with the paymaster general regard infected blood and i will ensure that he have hear what she have say today i understand that he meet she this week and i know that the whole house will want to be keep inform and update about the progress that he be make 
 i will also ensure that those at the department for levelling up housing and communities have hear what the right hon lady have say about the devolution deal such deal be a vital tool along with the many other source of funding that we be put into community that need it and will do something good with it however as she will know the devolution deal be not the only source of the fund that her constituent will receive they will be get many more stream of funding in many other area and from many other department 
 however the government have a finite amount of money and it be important that we be direct it to where we want to spend it and alleviate pressure on public service that we do not want to see where we have porous border and people for example economic migrant who be not flee persecution be for understandable reason abuse our asylum system we need to close those loophole the rwanda scheme be design to be a deterrent and if it be stand up and successful it will benefit the right hon lady ’s constituent 
 for some time i have notice a grow sense of frustration among member who ask a question and be give an answer that bear no relation to it it be as if ministers be apply some sort of jedi mind trick to suggest that this be not the question they be look to ask will the leader of the house arrange for a statement to be make on what step the government will take to ensure that ministers actually answer the question that they be ask 
 i think that when be present with a question like that it be quite hard to answer it if the hon gentleman would like to furnish i with some example any example of where that be happen i will of course respond to they this be business question so his question be in order but i would point out to he that it be actually quite difficult to answer 
 i want to pay tribute to my constituent loyd who be in the public gallery this morning he be a remarkable young man every time the ellesmere port wombles have a litter pick he be there come rain or shine i also want to record my appreciation of another young constituent heidi who be year old and who on sunday will complete her cycle ride the equivalent of london to paris to raise fund for alzheimer ’s research uk and macmillan cancer support she have already raise nearly £ which be a fantastic achievement 
 there be so many other young people in my constituency and i be sure every other member ’s constituency who do fantastic thing for their community and for good cause may we please have a debate to celebrate the great work that our young people do 
 i thank the hon gentleman for afford i and the whole house the opportunity to join he in praise loyd and heidi and congratulate they on all that they be do young people in this country sometimes get a bad press so it would be very good to have time on the floor of the house or in westminster hall to celebrate all that they do 
 a recent report by london councils find that wandsworth be of the borough worst affect by fall pupil roll number with a drop in demand for reception place many parent in battersea have share with i their concern about their child ’s education it be vital that the government ensure that every local area have excellent financially viable school may we have a statement on how they will address the fall in pupil roll number 
 i will ensure that the secretary of state for education have hear what the hon lady say and i will draw her attention to that report i think that be how i can well serve the hon lady today 
 in the midst of a cost of live crisis of his own making the prime minister this week place a £ bet with a tv presenter what message do that send to our constituent many of whom be struggle to pay their bill 
 the hon lady accuse the prime minister of cause a cost of living crisis she know that the pandemic have knock on effect because of the spending we have to do include on the furlough scheme which the prime minister design when he be chancellor that scheme keep people family and business go throughout that period and enable we to make a swifter economic recovery than many comparable nation the prime minister be not responsible for the war in ukraine or any of the other geopolitical and global shock we have to endure which be cause   financial pressure on the nation and on household during this time we feel it right to stand up an enormous package of support for household to alleviate the cost of living more than £ and grow have go towards support people which show that this government understand what they be go through and will do everything we can to support they 
 the leader of the house may not know this but when i receive my cancer diagnosis just after the last election i think it be the end of the world that i would be unable to carry on my job of represent the people of huddersfield and do all the stuff i love about be an active parliamentarian may we have a debate in the house on how cancer treatment have change dramatically because of science technology and the wonderful care from the nhs include the wonderful team at guy ’s and st thomas ’s whether it be immuno- therapy or robotic surgery which i have the world be now much bright than it have be for people diagnose with cancer 
 in a way i want to send a message to his majesty that it be not the end of the world i have have a very active life since my diagnosis and i can still make myself a real pain to mr speaker and my colleague in the house of commons may we have a debate on how thing have change let we give a little good news to his majesty 
 i thank the hon gentleman for send such a positive and thoughtful message not only to his majesty the king which i be sure be very welcome but to all brits who be live with cancer there be a huge amount to celebrate include treatment our amazing research base and our fantastic sector organisation it be not just about the treatment the drug and the healthcare professional it be also about the financial advice and moral support that be often provide by our fantastic cancer charity of course it be also about the people who work in the nhs and the agency that support they i think this would be a wonderful topic for a debate and the hon gentleman will know how to apply
