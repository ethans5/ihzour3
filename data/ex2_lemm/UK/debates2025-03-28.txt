i compliment my good friend   the hon member for norwich south clive lewis   on his passion commitment knowledge and determination if i may say so i be also grateful that he mention the late great david graeber in his introduction he be a good friend to both of we an amazing young man and an amazing philosopher sadly take from we too soon i think his family will be really chuff that the hon member have include he in his speech on something so fundamental as the right to fresh clean water for we all this bill seek to protect that right it recognise that water be an essential and basic need and therefore something so universal and so essential surely ought to be completely in public hand most country around the world do not even countenance the idea of privatise water they say it be our public responsibility to ensure that we can provide clean and safe water for everybody 
 when the government of margaret thatcher and other privatise water in the 1980 many of we strongly oppose it i think i be the only member in the chamber who have the privilege of voting against privatisation at the time we predict that it would lead to a rip off of the public sector and to asset stripping of the land and other resource that the water board have build up we also point out that the water infrastructure we enjoy the   reservoir in wales in scotland and all over england the piping the sewage work and all the other hugely complex element of infrastructure be for the most part build by public enterprise and public investment we all laud the work of bialetti in produce a sewage system for london that be not do by the private sector it be do through victorian investment in a public structure to bring about proper treatment of sewage and provide clean water for the people of london we should be proud of the public investment that bring about the water system that we have and should recognise that since when water be privatise £ have be take out in dividend by the water company that amount to £ a year not invest in water not invest in new pipe and in protect the system we have those profit be extraordinary 
 the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier   rightly talk about the amount of pollution flow into our river i can not get my head around the fact that hour worth of sewage be pump into the thames in the last year alone when we add that to the amount be pump into the severn the trent the humber the mersey and all the great river across this country we realise the scale of the problem we be deal with we then realise what happen to that the sewage go into the sea and it come back in fish it pollute water which do not stop at the river ’s mouth it go into the ocean create further global water pollution 
 surely we can do much well i therefore welcome the bill and i invite member to look seriously at clause and clause set out the measure that will be require in the secretary of state ’s strategy include measure on prioritise investment collaborate with local authority and use natural flood management technique and a requirement for local authority to take into account the need for conservation all incredibly sensible measure that can only be deliver by public authority privatised water company do not have as their top line the conservation of the natural world and the environment they have as their top line their middle line and their bottom line the profit they can take out of it and please nobody tell i that the £ pay out in dividend have be reinveste in the british economy it be in tax haven all over the world we be subsidise tax haven all over the world on the back of our polluted and privatised water industry 
 clause relate to the commission on water which be a fascinating proposal the commission would include representative of water company which be privatise at the moment but would hopefully be publicly own union representative in the water industry environmental or conservation group water user which would be local business and local authority i strongly support public ownership of water but i do not envisage a situation in which the prime minister as a gift to his friend put they all on a british water board i would like to retain the exist system of manage river basin area thames severn trent and so on that make sense because that be where the primary water supply come from that would be manage through a commission that include the workforce trade union all the local authority in the area local business because they use water and supply service locally and    other who can be appoint from elsewhere we would have public buy in to the structure which would give we a much well and more democratic system 
 i urge member to look with some imagination at what the hon member for norwich south have put forward some say we can not possibly bring this into public ownership because it might cost money the labour government start by nationalise the bank of england in and go on to bring many other industry into public ownership even the ted heath government in bring rolls royce into public ownership and create rolls royce ltd because the company be fail the agree share price be set by parliament it be not set by the market in all those case we can do the same in this case 
 resolve 
 that an humble address be present to his majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there be lay before this house a return of the report from the right honourable sir alan moses chairman of the spoliation advisory panel date   march in respect of the painting aeneas and his family fleeing burning troy by henry gibbs now in the possession of the tate gallery.—(gen kitchen 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no 
 the house divide ayes noes 
 question accordingly negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests around year ago margaret thatcher ’s revolution tear up the rulebook on political and economic management she rewrote it with a single unwavering principle that the pursuit of profit would serve the public good even when it come to vital public service even when it come to water we often say that society stand on the shoulder of giant but giant cast long shadow and thatcherism ’s shadow loom dark over our water system today 
 whether we see ourselves stand on her shoulder or trap in her shadow thing be undeniable she prove that the world can be make differently and if it can be make differently once it can be make differently again that as the brilliant anthropologist david graeber understand be the hidden truth of the world it be something we create and can choose to create anew we can do it well 
 today i want to show this house and this country that water be the lens through which we can imagine something well a well way of run our economy a well way of safeguard our environment and a well way of empower the public for whom democracy supposedly exist but that require something very difficult it require we to break free from the constraint of our imagination and to let go of the idea that this economic model be all there be or all there ever could be 
 it sadden i to say that the government ’s water special measures act perfectly exemplify this failure of imagination of its lead proponent have a particular rhetorical flourish they love to use when dismiss call for public ownership of water they say i ’m more interested in the purity of our water than the purity of our ideology i love that quote i love it because it lay bare just how deeply the ideology of privatisation and all that go with it have embed itself so entrenched be it within our collective consciousness that we no long recognise it as an ideology we no long see it for what it be a systemic exploitation of a common resource for private gain instead it have simply become the natural order of thing 
 but how much long can this go on since the crash of this ideology have be falter under the weight of its own contradiction yet its grip on british politic remain vice like austerity exploitation and corporate price gouging be still treat not as choice but as inevitability why because too many politician on both side of the house refuse to contemplate alternative for those on the other side of the house on the opposition benches i get it this be their ideology they be defend their class and i would imagine they would go far still if they could but on this side of the house we have no excuse we should be stand up for our class working class people the public instead we wrap their ideology in the language of fiscal responsibility economic prudence and stewardship of the economy but it be not fiscal responsibility when we    balance the book on broken back it be not stewardship when the ship have be sell off and the crew leave to drown it be not prudence it be power maintenance 
 i hope the engineer can check that the microphone and speaker be work while i ask a quick question my hon friend mention member on this side of the house there be far more of we on this side since july last year than there be in with a very different approach take in our manifesto do he fear that the shift in tone he be suggest be of the reason that we do so badly in but so well last year 
 no i do not we have a distorted electoral system bring on proportional representation because if we have pr we would have have a different government in and most definitely in sometimes politician have to do what they believe to be right and lead from the front i think we should lead from the front 
 i compliment the hon member on his bill to help his argument there be overwhelming opinion poll support for public ownership of water in and and there still be today 
 i thank the right hon member for his point i will come on to this later and i hope other member will pick up on it but the fact that the public be way ahead of this house on the issue of public ownership be of the reason why so many people be lose faith in the party political system only have to look at some political party whose member be not in their place at the reform party for example which have a policy of public ownership of water yes its member will privatise the nhs but they understand how popular this be and they be ahead of the curve they be ahead of we on this side 
 really 
 on the issue of water yes i would say they be because whether i like it or not reform have a policy for water to be own by pension company and by the public as much as it grieve i to say it that be a policy of public ownership they be populist they be listen to a popular voice 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will make some progress and then give way and i will also try to keep the volume down a little bit 
 this be about the maintenance of a political and economic model that be never build to serve the public a model design to shield the wealth of asset holder landlord shareholder corporation and yes privatised water company but here be the great irony the very greed recklessness and contempt of the water industry its excess have crack open the door and through that crack we glimpse an opportunity it be an opportunity to shatter the myth of privatisation ’s inevitability to break free from the narrow self impose rule that have   cage our government ’s economic choice to expose its failure to challenge its dominance and above all to show this country that there be an alternative an alternative that be democratic sustainable and run in the interest of the many not the few we can do it well 
 my hon friend be make a typically impassioned speech he say the general public be ahead of we where might that same public be when face with the bill for bring in the nationalisation he be clearly wed to furthermore in the event that we do not have to buy the water industry but seize it the implication of that seizure will cause an economic collapse at what point will he take responsibility for either of those scenario when confront a public who be he say ahead of we on this issue 
 i will obviously come to many of those point later in my speech but let i make this point now i do not believe in nationalisation and this bill have nothing to do with nationalisation this be about give the public a say over their water it be about governance standard and democracy 
 will my hon friend give way 
 no my hon friend have make his point 
 on this point 
 no i be go to carry on and make some progress you make your point let the public 
 order mr lewis i do not believe i be make a point at all 
 my apology madam deputy speaker i should have say that my hon friend make his point 
 the clock be tick the climate crisis be no long a distant warning it be our lived reality rise drought creep desertification deplete aquifer wildfire systemic collapse these be no long projection they be the forecast turn fact prepare for this future and adapt to what be now inevitable have never be more urgent 
 the evidence be sober the uk ’s water resource be under mount pressure and not just from the climate emergency but from rise demand and population growth expert now project that england could face significant water supply deficit as early as unless we act decisively that be not a distant horizon it be a little over a decade away 
 but while the threat have grow our resilience have shrink because while the climate crisis have intensify our water infrastructure have stand still or bad be sell off hollow out and leave to rot in the year before privatisation almost reservoir be build in the year since privatisation not major english reservoir have be build but it get bad because in that same period private water company have sell off reservoir without replace instead of invest in resilience they have extract value £ pay out in dividend while pipe leak river choke and the public pay the price my hon friend   the member for bury north mr frith   ask how we can afford it how    can we not afford it that be not mismanagement it be a betrayal if scientist tell we the climate crisis be an existential threat to humanity and to this country 
 will my hon friend give way 
 
 if scientist tell we the climate crisis be an existential threat to humanity and to this country we must treat it as such an existential conflict in that context the action of these company sell off reservoir fail to invest pollute our water be not just negligent they be act that actively undermine our national water security in any other existential crisis we might call that what it be sabotage and in a time of national peril sabotage have another name treason 
 let i explain why this matter to i personally when i serve on tour in afghanistan back in not in a boy band i experience something utterly alien to i the gnawing fear of thirst not the mild irritation of forget a water bottle but the deep physical worry that there may not be enough clean water to get through the day in britain we have be bless water fall from the sky it fill our river it soak our field and we joke about it it be part of who we be but in afghanistan there be no humour only heat dust and desperation there i see child trek mile through the desert not for food not for money but to beg for clean bottled water once we have see that and once we have feel that fear we can never take water for grant again we never again believe it be something we can waste or pollute or privatise without consequence 
 that be why i have bring forward this bill because anger be not enough outrage no matter how justified will not fix the pipe stop the sewage or fill the reservoir we need a plan we need a strategy we need a future we can do it well 
 my water bill deliver that it set out the high standard our country deserve and the democratic governance our water system desperately need it establish clear ambitious target to stop the sewage in our river and on our beach to restore our water to high ecological and chemical standard and to deliver universal affordable access to water as a basic human right a right we have never have before in this country it demand a system design not just to extract profit but to adapt to build resilience in the face of climate change and to harness nature base solution that work with the environment not against it 
 secondly it transform governance the bill introduce representation for worker and local community on the board of water company it give voting right to employee and customer so that those who use and maintain a system have a real say in how it be run water be not a commodity but a common good and those who depend on it and pay for it should help govern it 
 thirdly the bill lay the foundation for a democratic future it establish a commission on water ownership to advise the secretary of state on long term strategy look at international good practice especially in oecd country where public water ownership be the norm not the exception crucially it create a citizen assembly on water ownership to bring the public into the process to deliberate debate and decide how we can govern this most precious of resource 
 the public care but how do i know that i know because a small fraction of they be in the public gallery today have travel here from all over the country i know because of the thousand of email that have be send to mps across the house and i know because those people will never stop campaign until this injustice be resolve they know that we can protect something not by sell it off but by stand up for it involve people in its care and ensure that it serve the public today tomorrow and for generation to come 
 my bill offer a pathway out of crisis it offer control resilience and democracy it be not just about clean up our river but about clean up the system that allow they to be pollute in the place privatisation be not just a problem it be the problem we can do it well i can hear some people on the labour benches thinking but we have just pass 
 you can hear think 
 i can now for my next trick i can hear think i can hear they think but we have just pass the water special measures act clive so what be you talk about yes we have but i be afraid to say it have be water down—[interruption sorry i have to get that in it be all go so well the act do not live up to what be promise it do not deliver what be need and it certainly do not live up to its name do not get i wrong it be a start 
 i congratulate my good and hon friend on make an excellent speech and on advocate for public ownership of water and the opportunity to make thing well do he agree that the mismanagement of the water company under privatisation be a huge indictment of the whole principle in my area bill be way above inflation and huge dividend be be pay by borrow money at the very least should our government not be look at stop the payment of bonus and share dividend while sewage pollution continue and we have appal mismanagement of the industry 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i agree with he wholeheartedly and i be just about to come to that point in relation to what the water special measures act do and do not do it address some of those point but as we have already discuss privatisation be not just a problem but the problem and it be a big part of why so much have go wrong 
 unfortunately the water special measures act do not live up to what be promise or what be need and it certainly do not live up to its name however it be a start and i praise my colleague on the front bench include the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy who have do so much work in this area unfortunately the act be not a solution 
 remarkably my government ’s water special measures act do not even define what clean water mean there be no standard or target just vague intention hand over once again to a regulatory system that have already fail we and to the company that cause the mess in the place it say nothing about well governance   and absolutely nothing about the big fat humongous elephant in the room who own our water if we do not deal with ownership we can not deal with accountability if we can not deal with accountability we can forget clean water no we must go far on clean water standard corporate accountability and what happen when company fail 
 do my hon and gallant friend accept that there be increase accountability in the water special measures act through the fact that many company in the industry be now rewrite their article of association to ensure that they be accountable not just to shareholder but to the customer and user of water 
 after year of abject failure it be too little too late my bill would put the final nail in the coffin of this sorry chapter of our country ’s water and water system 
 stick with the pun i commend my hon friend on his gallon of passion he be always make wave he criticise the government ’s legislation which be obviously not yet in effect but do he think that the cunliffe commission will go any way towards address some of the concern he have outline 
 unfortunately i do not because again the elephant in the room who own our water have be rule out of the cunliffe commission ’s operational process it can not actually look at that issue i have no issue with sir jon cunliffe but let we not forget that he originate from the treasury he probably have treasury brain that economic orthodoxy be part of the reason why we be in the place that we be i do not have so much confidence in the cunliffe commission but i do have far more confidence in the people ’s commission on the water sector which be be run by academic and which will report at the same time i will be very interested to hear what it say 
 will my hon friend give way 
 those be the reason why i have bring forward this bill the government ’s act do none of those thing but my bill do take just example 
 order i believe mr lewis probably can not hear intervention because he be so loud himself member should intervene loudly if they wish to intervene 
 i do hear the intervention but i want to make some progress 
 take this example under this bill if a water company breach the term of its licence with a major sewage discharge it can forget shareholder payout and pile on more debt if it do it twice it be in the last chance saloon after strike it be out licence terminate and on its bike and those price gouging asset stripping river kill vulture capitalist outfit will be roll into the sunset without a penny in compensation what about those water infrastructure asset that they have be sweat for private gain they go back into   the public realm thank you very much if they start whine about debt do not worry we will do a full audit of what they invest what they rack up in debt what they pay out in dividend and what they stuff into bloated executive pay packet i will tell you this madam deputy speaker i be yet to see a single privatised english water company walk away with anything other than a well earn spanking and a sharp haircut for its creditor those asset will belong to the public once again and we will not pay a penny more than they be worth 
 i can hear people think where will the money come from how will you invest in publicly own water without the private sector i will tell they where it have not come from in these past year i be mind read again 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will just make some progress and then i will give way i be on a roll let i tell the house where the money have not come from for these past year it have not come from private shareholder or long term thinking and it certainly have not come from some mythical well of benevolent capitalism the private company have put in less than nothing in fact they have rack up more than £ in debt thames water have pay more than £ in dividend since privatisation and be now £ in debt and counting work that out now it be try to plug the hole with a £ emergency loan that will cost in annual interest that be more than half a pound a year just for interest payment courtesy of our bill that money will not build a reservoir fix a pipe or clean a river but it will keep a rotten system afloat for a little long 
 my hon and gallant friend make an impassioned case for public ownership something that in the right context i be sure member on all side of the house can celebrate on the point about the cost of financing to the public though do he agree that while there be some serious indiscretion in part of the industry such as in thames water ’s case this conversation about the appropriate financing model would be well entertain at a time when the cost of capital in the private water industry be not low than the cost of public sector borrowing on which of course we be in a very difficult situation 
 the cheap borrowing in the country without a doubt be public sector borrowing the private water industry which have have year to sort this mess out be not go to find investment it be up to its eyeball in debt it be rely on a increase in our bill by if we include inflation and that be in the middle of a cost of living crisis how can we justify that the answer be that we can not 
 the day after the seizure of public asset that my hon friend be describe billion and billion of pound of debt will come with it what do he propose to do with that debt other than refinance which be exactly where we be at now with the industry   requirement to refinance the debt to try to keep bill down instead he be advocate that the public purse take on that private debt 
 at the beginning of my now seemingly rather long speech i think i refer to a failure of imagination ask what margaret thatcher would have do when she be face with similar problem she would have fight her way through it she change the very fabric of our economy our democracy and our politic and she make it work we can do the same because the public be behind we they want this to work 
 rise 
 rise 
 i will make some progress let we recap because i do not want to go on too long i want to conclude if i can that money from thames water that half a pound in interest payment will keep a rotten system afloat for just a little long the myth of privatisation be that the private sector will act in the long term interest of the british public because it want to turn a profit that be preposterous as be prove by the state of our water and exhibit a be thames water 
 we can now turn to the question of where the investment will come from under public ownership it will come from the only place it ever should have from we the public and every penny of it will go back into the system it will go into the pipe the river the sea we swim in and the water we drink there will be a direct relationship between what we pay and what we get with no offshore dividend no bloated bonus and no debt laden shell game just clean accountable democratic water 
 when i be in afghanistan every soldier have critical duty to stay hydrated to dehydrate be consider a military offence because it put the soldier and their team at risk if someone run out of water we do not debate market or metric we share what we have we have each other ’s back as the desert dwell fremen in james herbert ’s novel dune believe 
 a man ’s flesh be his own the water belong to the tribe 
 it be time our water return to the tribe to the people to the public we can do well we must and with this bill we will i commend it to the house 
 rise 
 before i call the next member i trust that the microphone have be adjust to their normal level 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for that hospital pass i will make a note not to follow   the hon member for norwich south clive lewis   again if i can help it i will just try to do a good job and perhaps not to speak for quite as long 
 i be delighted to be here to discuss and support this bill and i thank the hon member for bring it forward it will be no surprise to anyone here that i be   absolutely in favour of this bill to fix the despicable situation of our waterway to do that we need to bring water back into public ownership this issue be so important to i and my green colleague that we table the early day motion of this parliament on the public ownership of water we highlight that sewage be 
 be discharge into english waterway for more than hour in that water company in england have incur debt of more than £ and pay out £ in dividend 
 note the similarity of those number 
 since they be privatised debt free in 
 we point out that 
 water company pay out £ in dividend in even as of they be fin in the same year for miss performance target 
 privatisation be just not work the experiment have fail we be of the only country in the world with a fully privatised water system which show that it be a bad idea water be a natural monopoly for example people who live in the south west as i do can not choose to be supply by yorkshire water i be not sure that they would want to but my point be that when their provider give a poor service and charge extortionate sum they can not take their business elsewhere there be no fair competition you get what you get and you can not get upset about it but we be upset about it because sewage be be pump into our water and we be pay through the nose for the privilege all while shareholder profit 
 on the point about take business elsewhere do the greens have a policy on how to perpetually nationalise an industry of the difficulty be that if we nationalise now a future government can do something very different what be the greens position on that 
 of the reason why i support the bill bring forward by the hon member for norwich south be that it use the tool of a citizen assembly to ask the public how they think the system should work and to explore different option rather than predetermine the exact model for clarity the green party and i support public ownership of public service but that do not necessarily mean nationalisation before the water company be privatise they be own regionally and i think that would be a sensible model this time i also think that the citizen assembly could look into other form of public ownership such as co operative 
 rise 
 rise 
 i will make some progress rather than have a long back and forth 
 we be pay through inflate bill pay with our health and now we may be pay with our public money as the government have say that they be ready to bail out thames water which be privatise in with no debt since then it have rack up £ in debt and at the same time note the similarity of these number pay out £ to its shareholder if that be not a scam i do not know what be privatisation   be suppose to keep price down but it have do the opposite more than of people ’s bill be use to pay interest on debt or to pay dividend to shareholder 
 the government be take some step to improve the situation i absolutely welcome those step as far as they go but these issue be not likely to go away without our consider the option or look into the possibility of bring water company back into public hand that be why i be disappointed to learn that the government ’s supposedly independent commission on the water sector regulatory system be not be allow despite be independent to consider public ownership as of the option though i note with interest the establishment of the people ’s commission on the water sector which will look into this option as part of its broad scope 
 this be a subject on which i value the hon lady ’s opinion my great concern about this bill be the people ’s commission and i wonder if she could assuage my concern i fear that set up an alternative representative body impinge on the right of this chamber which be the prime expression of democracy in the uk and that the could be bring into conflict it be a big concern for i be there anything that she can say to assuage my concern 
 if hon member of this house feel threaten by the setting up of a citizen assembly in order to gather view that may be an indication of the weakness of the democracy that we have in this place i really value the contribution that citizen assembly can make they have be use in other country notably ireland they be not a replacement for the house of commons but they can add valuable extra detail 
 rise 
 i think my hon friend be about to chip in with an example 
 do my hon friend agree that we have the example of the citizen assembly on climate change which be establish jointly by select committees of this house a couple of year ago 
 i agree with my hon friend and i would also point to the citizen assembly set up by bristol city council citizen assembly be particularly strong at look in depth at detailed specific question rather than broad topic to do with how the entire country be run i see citizen assembly not as replace the role of the house of commons but as supplement it valuably 
 will the hon lady give way 
 i will make some progress 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker may i ask for your direction this be a debate and there be no time limit be there any way of press a member to answer a question during a debate or to at least allow a debate to occur i have a follow up question that the hon member seem reluctant to allow 
 the hon gentleman know that it be entirely up to the member who be speak to decide whether they wish to take or reject an intervention just as it be up to member attempt to make an intervention to either persist in the attempt or not we will let the debate continue but the hon gentleman be right to say that there be plenty of time 
 the provision of water 
 will the hon lady give way 
 last time though the hon member be push it 
 i be very grateful the reason why i persist be that the issue of a citizen assembly have come up my previous question be how could a government any government bind the action of a future democratically elect government a citizen assembly do not have the power to do that i be intrigue how can the greens believe that a citizen assembly could bind a future government of any political persuasion to not re privatise our water industry 
 of course a current government can not bind a future government on a decision like that indefinitely and i be not suggest that they could but as i point out as england be of very few country on the entire planet with a fully privatised water system i suspect and hope that if we return to a public system it would be more likely to stay public as both elect representative and the public would see that the system perform well when the profit motive be remove 
 people talk about whether something can be take out of public control and put back into privatisation of course parliament be sovereign and that can always happen but there be a point about give control to the public let we take the nhs which be a public service any government in the post war period could have take the nhs back into privatisation why do they not do so they would not have dare because it would have be so publicly damaging and politically destructive that be what would happen with our water do the hon member agree interruption 
 order may i remind people in the public gallery to remain silent 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i thank the hon gentleman for that helpful reminder about the analogy with the national health service 
 public ownership be not just essential for social and environmental justice it be also in this situation a pragmatic necessity it just make sense which be why almost everyone else do thing that way with water back in public hand the government could invest in fix the crumble infrastructure and clean up our river or prevent they from get into such a state in the place without haemorrhage money to shareholder and allow it to spill over sorry i could not resist into fat cat salary 
 people be struggle to put food on the table and heat their home we can not allow water company to contribute to that situation by hike up the bill that everyone have to pay without real change we will not stop sewage flow into our river and profit flow into the pocket of shareholder there be an obvious answer that make both people and the environment the winner if they so choose the government could bring water company back into public hand to end the profiteer drive down bill protect our river waterway and coastline and catch up with the public who as the hon member for norwich south point out be way ahead of the labour government on this issue and much else 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for norwich south clive lewis   on introduce the bill whatever my position on its detail and on the history of what have happen with our water industry we would all agree on how important it be to have a proper debate about water 
 unlike many of the member present today i have the privilege of have serve in the previous parliament during which water and sewage discharge be constant topic of conversation it be absolutely right that we talk about that and that we act i be now proud to be in the party of a government who have begin to act on the big challenge face we when it come to water 
 i congratulate my hon friend too on the enormous passion that he bring to all the issue that he care about nobody could say that he do not believe passionately in what he be talk about today he be right to shine a light on the failure of the water industry the profit that people be make while organisation such as surfers against sewage have to deal with the very real issue of paddle through sewage i be try to be polite 
 we have to go right back in time to see why the system be set up the water company be privatised to avoid taxpayer investment and to get the private sector to pay that of course mean the need for dividend and we have see how that have work my hon friend talk about the last chance saloon—“two strike and you ’re out”—for the water company his bill suggest that on the occasion the state would take the company ’s asset and run it but the taxpayer would still pick up an enormous bill for that 
 it be important to reflect on the context that we find ourselves in today whether we be talk about investment in water our railway the pupil in school not fit for purpose or in our crumble hospital include the build with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete which i visit during the last parliament those will be unfit for purpose within the next year and need money to be invest in they 
 we need to invest money in our road it be great that the government be put money into pothole that be a start however we know that we need more than that i cycle and pothole cause i enormous grief i be constantly break a spoke a speak be only about £ but get a wheel true i be not expert enough to do that myself cost a lot of money these   be issue that be actually hit the pocket of our constituent it be not about i many people have these problem 
 i have have the opportunity to spend a lot of time in northamptonshire and i commend my hon friend   the member for wellingborough and rushden gen kitchen who have fight a tough campaign against pothole in her constituency underline how poorly the council have manage its road she have do excellent work to highlight the problem and to challenge and look at the council ’s contract and that have lead to the government ’s announcement in just the last week about invest in pothole they have take her blueprint from wellingborough and be apply it to the country 
 however all this cost money we have road railway the water industry school and hospital all in dire need we need that money to go into the nhs to reduce waiting list which have reduce for month in a row we be see those waiting list go down constituent of mine be in desperate strait anyone who have a bit of money be pay privately to have their hip replace the constituent i visit who do not have that kind of money be on a long slow waiting list while their health deteriorate unable to work or go about their life 
 we have to see this issue in the context of all the money that need to be spend a year ago i produce a list of what i call the big nastie i have highlight some of they the list also include the fact that we have not yet in this country decommission a single nuclear submarine which be not just a monetary cost it need to be do but we be find it hard to bring submarine into port to repair they it have be leave for decade and have now fall to this government to resolve i gather that the be now be decommission thank again to a labour government be in power 
 we have real problem at the animal health centre in weybridge where we do not have space to deal with zoonotic disease at the same time to deal with these difficult disease the centre have special facility so that no contaminant can escape if we be hit by zoonotic disease in this country we would be in a catastrophic situation this situation be leave by the previous government who do not deal with it for year 
 then we have porton down in it be go to be move and rebuild again the facility deal with some of the most difficult scientific issue there could be catastrophic effect if it be not there to deal with they what have happen there have be no movement at all again it have fall to this government to spend something around £ have be spend but nothing have be achieve this government have pick up the piece 
 i thank my hon friend for make a powerful speech in this debate there be a few thing to say about the cost we would control the asset the asset would come off the balance sheet which would be mitigating factor secondly throughout the post war period with british leyland railtrack in coal steel gas civil aviation and even the bank of england we pay less than the market value as i explain at the beginning this be about a mindset we can do an audit of what the company have take out what money they have extract from our economy   and then we can pay they an appropriate rate and return it may well be that they be pay nothing but they may get something their creditor may take a haircut but frankly that be well than our constituent take a continuous haircut with their bill 
 i thank my hon friend for that point i hear his passion and his helpful iteration of those historic example however i would also say that we need to be clear about who the shareholder be very often they be our pension fund pension fund trustee have a fiduciary duty to ensure they be maximise the income for those pensioner if that do not happen we know that effectively the taxpayer pick up the tab a reality of privatisation be a drive to have a shareholder society we can argue about whether that be the right or wrong thing to do and i think we would probably agree in many respect on that however that be the reality of the situation now 
 early today before the house be sit i be on a call about constituent who have lose money in an investment and be in a desperate situation in that case it be because of criminal activity by a fraudster their life saving have go the people who have invest and buy those share often very humble family who have work hard all their life need some compensation a student debate society might be tempt to say let ’s take it all back and forget about the impact but we can not forget about the impact because it often fall on low pay hard work people who be taxpayer too they would end up pay a double whammy 
 i thank the chair of the treasury committee for her wise word about the risk that shareholder take when they invest have she consider the alternative at the moment we be talk about privatisation versus nationalisation but the alternative be mutualisation where a water company ’s customer would own and control the company on their own behalf 
 it seem there be an awful lot of mind reader in the chamber today because the hon gentleman anticipate my comment i be proud to be a labour and co operative member so i have thought on how day we may be able to move to that nirvana of co ownership 
 we have see too often that dividend and bonus be pay without investment in infrastructure which be where my hon friend and i would agree we have a privatisation model that be suppose to deliver investment on the back of people invest in share in return for get a dividend there would also be an investment but we have not see enough of that 
 of course under ofwat rule water customer bear a share of the cost in hackney under thames water which have be a poster company for the problem in this sector bill be go up by more than a a number of constituent who be very worried about their water bill have write to i just in the last fortnight when we talk about money in this place we sometimes talk about million or billion of pound but £ a month be a great deal of money for many of my constituent 
 to set that in context i have a number of fantastic street market in my constituency one where people can buy fruit and veg and clothe and underwear at a reasonable price and i also have the lovely broadway market where sourdough bread cost about £ a loaf i have constituent who do not have £ leave at the end of the week let alone at the end of the month those be the margin that people be work with water bill be therefore a significant issue which be another reason why i be delighted to be here today support by colleague of all party who want to talk about the challenge of water 
 on the face of it the argument for nationalisation sound appeal to many but there be a cost and it be not a hidden cost to those who buy share in good faith to those pension fund that be invest and in the upheaval of turn around these company where would we get the people to run a nationalise water company it be likely to be the same executive if they would take the pay cut there be not a wealth of expertise 
 i spend a decade examine the work of whitehall and there be some excellent civil servant in this country who have do amazing work many of the civil servant who do not do such amazing work appear before the public accounts committee but find somebody overnight with the technical and management expertise to run a major water company be a challenge 
 to take the corollary i be passionate about see insourced service in our hospital but after have intense conversation with executive at my local hospital i know that when the public sector have not do something for many year it take a very long time to build up the expertise let we take catering if hospital do not cater well they could kill patient so they need to make sure they have the management structure in place to deliver those skill it be the same with water company it be not as easy as say day it ’ private and the next day it ’ national no problem at all the upheaval would be immense so we need a measured plan and i think this government have begin to develop that plan for all the reason i will outline 
 i will talk a little about what the government will do to improve the situation and then i will talk about the bill but i want to touch on the comment of   the hon member for bristol central carla denyer i be very interested in her passionate commitment to citizen jury she have be elect which be a privilege as we all know to represent her constituent in this place yet month after her election she want to pass responsibility for this big difficult decision to a citizen jury rather than take responsibility for that decision as an elect mp 
 i think it be important to correct the misapprehension among some government members which may arise from an inadvertent misreading of the bill clause on the citizen assembly on water ownership at subsection simply say 
 the commission must publish the recommendation of the citizens assembly 
 it do not say this house will hereby delegate responsibility for make decision about water sector ownership to the citizens assembly it simply suggest set up a structure which as i say have already be use by the house to provide the opportunity for the general public to consider in depth an issue of complexity 
 my point be clear just as many year ago a certain mr ratner famously talk about the price of a prawn sandwich in marks spencer and the price of earring in his store people do not want to be on the board of marks spencer to get a decent prawn sandwich they just want to be able to buy a decent prawn sandwich and while my political foundation be in devolution neighbourhood structure work and listen to people ultimately we must responsibility ourselves 
 i be look at clause as the hon lady highlight i have be around for many year but of the challenge about citizen jury be that while we can have this engagement they be lengthy and costly and we know that not everybody attend the whole time how would we select people there be many challenge in set they up 
 rise 
 order i remind the hon member that intervention should be short 
 i remind the house briefly that all these issue be well investigate and understand and the house have previously use this mechanism effectively 
 well in my experience of year in the house this system have be use once and that be in by a selection of select committees not by the government of the day i be aware that the debate about citizen jury be or so year ago and there be many challenge to deliver they 
 do my hon friend agree that of the concern with citizen assembly be about gain the confidence of the public when some people see opinion poll they say well i be not interview so i have no confidence in it secondly there would be no power to compel someone to be on a citizen assembly so how could people have confidence in a body that contain only those who be willing to take part 
 absolutely i think we would all agree that we talk all the time to constituent whether on doorstep or at public meeting and other forum because that be our job i say to constituent every week when i be on their doorstep i be here because i need your expertise i can not do my job without you but it be a cumbersome task to be on a citizen assembly as it require people to devote a great deal of time and only a certain subset of society have the time to do that many of my constituent be work or job and struggle to survive they do not have the time to do that but their voice need to be hear too 
 i declare experience in this area in that through herefordshire council i set up a citizen assembly a process call sortition be use to ensure a fully representative sample participant be pay for their time so that people of all socioeconomic background can participate and additional effort be make to ensure that under represent group can participate will the hon lady acknowledge that such an institution might be more representative of the general public than this house in which third of mp be elect by only a of the electorate 
 i will be careful not to try your patience madam deputy speaker we could have an endless debate about the difference between select people through the sortition process i be well aware of how that work and how our electoral system work but in the end we face our electorate and they can reject we many colleague have be sack on television at o’clock in the morning because the electorate reject they or their party there be no same power over a citizen ’s assembly 
 let we be clear perhaps i should talk in a bit more detail about clause of the bill as propose subsection say 
 within month of be establish under subsection the commission on water must establish a citizens assembly on water ownership to consider different model of water ownership and make recommendation for reform to water ownership and governance 
 it be deeply patronising to suggest to my constituent that they would be guarantee the same job after serve on a citizen assembly we can not force or compel mcdonald ’s to retain people on hour contract which thankfully the government will scrap but be it not typical of the green party to shirk responsibility to a citizen assembly on housing wind farm and onshore energy we see the green party shirk responsibility in bristol brighton and the east of england and this similar situation be a classic example 
 i certainly recognise the point about job security many of my constituent work or job and be struggle to survive 
 i would like to inform the house that the employment rights bill outlaw exploitative hour contract and that be something that member especially government members should talk about constantly 
 absolutely and that be a yet another example of why it be good to have a labour government 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight clause 4(1)(a in particular i be quite disappointed by the response from   the hon member for bristol central carla denyer   to my very sincere intervention i think we have hear that many member have make their mind up about the form of ownership and they be determined to have nationalisation so if the citizen assembly come to a conclusion that be not in favour of nationalisation i would have to ask people whether they agree with the citizen assembly in which case what be the point of this house?—or whether they would ignore the citizen assembly in which case what be the point of the citizen assembly 
 that be of the challenge we can set up this lengthy and expensive process and then it do not necessarily hold any sway 
 i be go through the provision in clause and as we get into the detail of the citizen assembly i sense that there be an appetite to discuss that perhaps i can continue my remark before i take any further intervention or we will be here all day but i suppose that that be what today be for the commission would support the work of the citizen assembly clause 4(2 state that 
 the commission on water must undertake a public consultation on water ownership in which all individual who use water and sewerage service in england and wales can participate 
 hallelujah to that to a strong well found public consultation we can all go out to our constituency and do roundtable knock on door and ask people what they have to say about water however i think that most of we have have quite a strong indication about that from our constituent in our mailbox and from our time on doorstep i have not get into all the issue in the waterway in hackney which be utterly appal in relation to sewage discharge we need to make sure that we have that public consultation 
 if the hon member be so aware of the overwhelming public support for public ownership of water as she just indicate from the level of concern in her constituency i be confused about why she be so dogged in her pursuit of continued privatisation 
 i urge the hon lady to listen to what i say i do not say that i have people say overwhelmingly that they want public ownership certainly not they be say that there be a problem and say you lot be in government you need to sort it out over the last year that i have be in this place and particularly in the last parliament there have be endless discussion about how to resolve this situation and stasis in the government we now have a government who have act to begin to tackle some of these huge challenge i give real credit to the minister who have engage massively with member across the house on this she be absolutely aware of the issue partly because many of we across the house have lobby she because our constituent have lobby we i do not think there be doubt about the problem the issue be about the solution 
 we should absolutely have a big public consultation but that be to inform the work of the citizen assembly clause 4(3 state that the citizen assembly must 
 be compose of a randomly select representative sample of user of water and sewerage service in england and wales and consider any matter which the commission refer to it in relation to water ownership 
 i want to be clear that that will be a randomly select representative sample of user and the bill be silent on the model i appreciate what   the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns   highlight that there be a science to do this but the bill be silent on how it would be do 
 to return to the construction of citizen assembly i take on board the point about the concept that be be use locally but when have to travel minute to a meeting on an evening after work it be a very different order of magnitude 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 member can not intervene on an intervention 
 be you near your point 
 i be on the cusp of it there be cost implication of ask member of the public to travel to another part of the country and these thing be   inevitably in london as somebody whose constituency be mile from london i would be concern about member of my community be leave out of such a consultation 
 order before the hon lady respond to that intervention i know it be friday but you do not intervene on an intervention and intervention be short they be not speech 
 i think my hon friend make some important point we have see from citizen jury include in ireland which have a well wear route for use these for their referenda that people do drop out and do not always attend because life get in the way that be why we be elect to make hard decision and defend difficult issue we can not make the world like the land of milk and honey certainly not after the inheritance we receive from the last government after year of mismanagement 
 we have very big challenge and we need to tackle they it would put heavy pressure on citizen jury to do that the key point here be that whatever the good practice the bill do not go into the detail of it so we can not assume that the good practice that the hon member for north herefordshire have highlight from her constituency be necessarily what would apply let alone the challenge that other hon member have raise 
 turn to the hon member for bristol central i would be surprised that a member of her party be so willing to pass responsibility over but then i look at what happen in brighton when the greens control brighton council i will put aside the rubbish collection issue and the infighting and look at the issue with the i360 the tower that be now a tourist attraction the company behind it go bust with over £ of debt it be the green run council that provide £ of public money to pay for that vanity project and in the end taxpayer in brighton and hove be leave £ out of pocket and brighton and hove council be leave to pay £ a year for the foreseeable future 
 i do not think we need to take any lecture from the green party about how to manage public money because when they have be in power they can not do it no wonder they want to pass responsibility over to a citizen jury rather than take responsibility themselves 
 i have be divert but i think it be useful before i move on to my next point i will take more diversion 
 it be not just the green party in this country that cause such significant challenge the demand of the green party in germany on the then government to stop use nuclear energy directly contribute to the reliance on putin and germany be struggle as a result today the greens should not be trust with any economy anywhere 
 madam deputy speaker i do not want to try your patience so i will move on from the green party because the subject of the debate be the water bill that my hon friend the member for norwich south have put forward 
 i want to talk about the challenge that we be see in water nobody would argue that there be not a problem we be have to deal with i take the example of my wonderful constituency of hackney south and shoreditch and the amazing resource that be the river lea it run through my constituency start far up beyond london we do not have the figure for yet but in there be instance of sewage discharge into the river lea that amount to hour of sewage discharge from storm overflow if that be not bad enough it be almost double the figure from when sewage be discharge into the river lea for hour it have be get bad we have be raise this issue in the house and in the last parliament not enough happen to tackle it now thank goodness we have a labour government who be begin to act and make sure that water company be take into account 
 the water quality of the lea have have a damn assessment an overall classification of bad fail on chemical standard and bad ecological health it be a tragedy that we work so hard to get our waterway clean up during the run up to the olympics which be a major boost to east london but we now have bad ecological health 
 on a hot sunny day on hackney marshes sadly no long in my constituency after the boundary change people can be see swim in the river and that be not a place they should be swim it be of the most polluted river in the country but it should be a blue lung for east londoners we need to get this problem tackle 
 the hon member be make an important point about river pollution and she be absolutely right would she agree that there be also a planning issue there be too many paved space and not enough run off be available to go into the ground water we need a holistic approach that include much more assertive planning policy on drainage otherwise we end up with sewage in our river during period of heavy rainfall 
 i thank my right hon friend for that i say friend because the right hon gentleman and i serve very effectively together in islington when he be the mp and i be a junior councillor for year in his patch so i know his passion in this area 
 on run off it be interesting that some council be still behind on planning issue so in some area people be still allow to pave over their front garden and in other they be expect to put in block for the tyre of vehicle with drain away or soakaway around they we need much more of that i have be involve in that debate for year and the right hon gentleman have be involve for even long i bow to his experience yet we still see challenge in the planning system not allow for that we await the full detail of the planning change but i really welcome the government ’s move to look at plan differently ensure that we be build this sort of resilience into our area 
 we have small area of flood risk in my constituency around the lea valley so we need to ensure if it be appropriate to build home there that we manage that risk through some of these mitigation that be very important because what also happen be that rubbish be   wash down from the street to the canal side we have just talk about the river lea and many of my canal dweller be concern as i be sure be the right hon gentleman ’s about the rubbish that have to be collect 
 research by thames21 and university college london show that the amount of faecal e. coli bacteria in the river lea regularly exceed international standard it pain i to have to say this because i love my constituency and think that part of my job be to big it up and tell everyone the great thing about it but sometimes we just have to call out the problem unfortunately and this be a real concern 
 my constituency be serve by thames water of course thames water discharge sewage into the thames for more than hour in but what be really shocking be that only year early sewage be discharge for just under hours—18,443 hour we think that be bad and it have exponentially increase and there be more sewage than in when sewage be discharge into the thames for hour london be an international city it be unbelievable that our river be so dirty and we need to get this resolve 
 nationally none of our river be consider to be in good chemical health accord to the rivers trust that mean every river in england contain chemical that be know to cause harm and figure publish just yesterday by the environment agency reveal that untreated sewage include human waste wet wipe and condom be release into waterway for more than hour in in just year before that datum the comparable figure be hour we be see a really big deterioration and that be why we need to act i look forward to hear from my hon friend the minister about some of the action the government be take to tackle this 
 if sewage on its own be not a reason to look at how we tackle water the problem of security of supply be a very big concern i have the privilege of chair the public accounts committee for year have also serve on the committee for long and in we find that there be a serious risk that the country will run out of water in the next year we be not a committee that tend to use hyperbole we be look at the fact we would build our report on work by the national audit office and we would question witness about it the timescale for that risk be year so we be already year into that programme my hon friend the minister and the government face a great challenge to try and resolve this in such a short time because year be not as long as it seem when we be deal with such big issue 
 security of supply be threaten by increase demand and diminish supply relevant factor of course include population growth in part of the country and urbanisation and development the point of how we deal with this in planning have be raise and it be absolutely vital that water supply be build into new development and the new town the government be propose and all the housing development that we hope to see 
 climate change have obviously be a factor as well as be unsustainable abstraction when water be remove from the natural environment i will not try your patience madam deputy speaker but the issue of chalk stream in this country be a scandal and once damage they be   go forever we have be rap our environment for water company profit and that have to stop we have also see growth in water intensive industry such as datum centre which be cause issue for electricity but also for water and we need a proper planning process for that so a lot of this do come back to the government ’s stance in take a genuinely proactive approach make sure that planning be not a blocker but actually help deliver the solution we need 
 in the government update ofwat ’s strategic policy statement to include an objective for the regulator to increase resilience in the long term in the national infrastructure commission recommend that the government and ofwat ensure that water company plan be sufficient to increase water supply to meet demand for an additional megalitre per day by the number be all very well but we know there be a big challenge now 
 the government will be publish an update national framework for water in the summer i do not think my hon friend the minister ever get a holiday with the amount of work that she have to do basically we have water but not in the place that we need it we have not build a reservoir for decade as a child of the drought unbelievable but true i remember the impact that have on behaviour in my case we do not have standpipe in the street but many family in this country have to go with a bottle to a standpipe in the street to get their water water be always a precious commodity but we really learn that then we be tell not to leave the tap run when wash up or clean our tooth i do not want to lecture people but we should all keep to those habit i learn those habit about water preservation at the age of i will admit it and they have never leave i that be a serious crisis in but here we be in face many of the same challenge i do not envy my hon friend the minister for the challenge she be seek to address 
 the government be act the water special measures act have be introduce and include quite properly criminal liability for water executive they can not hide behind the corporate body and say it be someone else ’s fault we have to have people step up in over a decade on the public accounts committee i learn that failure be always an orphan we use to call it public account tennis we would say who be in charge who be responsible and people would all look at each other wait to see who would jump forward introduce criminal liability sound draconian and it be but it be vital that those who be head up operation of this importance and be pay the pay that they be to deliver they take real responsibility and ensure they have system in place in their organisation if the buck stop with they they will take it very seriously the criminal liability include imprisonment for water executive when company fail to co operate or obstruct investigation 
 the act also introduce a bonus ban for chief executive and senior leader unless high standard be meet on protect the environment consumer and financial resilience we can talk more about thames water in relation to that in a moment it also introduce automatic penalty for environmental pollution it ensure that pollution be be measure in real time because during   the last parliament it be discover that for all the talk about measure sewage it be not be measure in real time a lot of the indicator be not there so it be easy to dodge the real number that we be now see with the exponential increase in sewage discharge 
 the act introduce an independent water commission as a regulator which i welcome the commission be launch in october last year and be chair by the former deputy governor of the bank of england sir jon cunliffe it be intend to deliver a reset to the sector and be expect to be the big review of the water industry since privatisation i say to my hon friend the member for norwich south who introduce the bill today that the commission will be the platform for discussion about the future tempt as it may be for he to want to get his bill pass today it would not deliver in the timeframe that he would want it to as that would take a while let we take a measured stand and look closely at the independent commission as i have warn my hon friend the minister i will be watch it very closely and ask question about it because we need to see that overview from every angle sir jon cunliffe be an independent individual who will be very tough with the government on this issue 
 my hon friend have criticise the proposal for citizen assembly say that we should have the confidence to make political judgment in this house for the future of our water company will she explain why she support have an independent water commission but do not support the proposal for citizen assembly 
 i will not repeat all of the issue about people ’s attendance at a citizen assembly the difficulty of achieve it and of people come to it i be not sure whether sir jon cunliffe be be pay to do the job quite often people be not but he have be give time to devote to it and also have access to a lot of technical expertise and datum i have spend more than a decade look at these sort of review and how they collect information they have power to receive that information and the expertise to analyse it i have have the privilege of work with the national audit office for a long period of time and i know the level of expertise that go into analyse that information which be quite intense and immense especially when we be deal with money infrastructure and water 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i will give way final time 
 i thank my hon friend for give way and i will be very brief there be a crisis of democracy and as my hon friend   the member for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff   have just mention we be reject a citizen assembly such an assembly could have the technical support and technical capacity as well but it would give a voice to the public instead we have decide to give that voice to sir jon cunliffe a lifelong treasury insider who work in the city of london and who will make a decision base on its interest can she not see the problem here and the lack of confidence the public have in the democratic decision that be be take by people like that 
 my hon friend be be particularly personal about sir jon cunliffe i have to say that i have not meet he but the point be that he will not be make the decision they will go to ministers 
 i be aware that time be march on madam deputy speaker but i would like to say briefly that there be key area in which the commission be seek view that be the point it be not just sir jon cunliffe i will rattle through those key area and then sit down they be the strategic management of water the overarch regulatory system economic regulation environmental and drink water regulation water company ownership model and asset health and supply chain each of those area contain a degree of technical challenge any of we and any of our constituent i hope we be all ask our constituent to contribute to this process can put in but there will be a lot of technical expert in those area that will also need to provide input sir jon cunliffe will then have to put that to ministers 
 another point be that minister do not have to accept what sir jon say but if they want to go into any of it in more detail my hon friend the minister would presumably have the power of course she have the power she be the minister to seek further information i be aware that when commission be set up badly they can be a problem for government but this be a very thorough approach which be the right approach after all these year of privatisation and the recent extensive challenge particularly with sewage discharge 
 it be easy to think that we can just rush in and sort this out but we need to do it in a measured way i be always impatient we all get elect to make change tomorrow but i have look at fail project for over a decade if we rush in and do not plan right we spend more money and it often result in failure i could list those project madam deputy speaker but i will try your patience no far 
 i compliment my good friend   the hon member for norwich south clive lewis   on his passion commitment knowledge and determination if i may say so i be also grateful that he mention the late great david graeber in his introduction he be a good friend to both of we an amazing young man and an amazing philosopher sadly take from we too soon i think his family will be really chuff that the hon member have include he in his speech on something so fundamental as the right to fresh clean water for we all this bill seek to protect that right it recognise that water be an essential and basic need and therefore something so universal and so essential surely ought to be completely in public hand most country around the world do not even countenance the idea of privatise water they say it be our public responsibility to ensure that we can provide clean and safe water for everybody 
 when the government of margaret thatcher and other privatise water in the 1980 many of we strongly oppose it i think i be the only member in the chamber who have the privilege of voting against privatisation at the time we predict that it would lead to a rip off of the public sector and to asset stripping of the land and other resource that the water board have build up we also point out that the water infrastructure we enjoy the   reservoir in wales in scotland and all over england the piping the sewage work and all the other hugely complex element of infrastructure be for the most part build by public enterprise and public investment we all laud the work of bazalgette in produce a sewage system for london that be not do by the private sector it be do through victorian investment in a public structure to bring about proper treatment of sewage and provide clean water for the people of london we should be proud of the public investment that bring about the water system that we have and should recognise that since when water be privatise £ have be take out in dividend by the water company that amount to £ a year not invest in water not invest in new pipe and in protect the system we have those profit be extraordinary 
 the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier   rightly talk about the amount of pollution flow into our river i can not get my head around the fact that hour worth of sewage be pump into the thames in the last year alone when we add that to the amount be pump into the severn the trent the humber the mersey and all the great river across this country we realise the scale of the problem we be deal with we then realise what happen to that the sewage go into the sea and it come back in fish it pollute water which do not stop at the river ’s mouth it go into the ocean create further global water pollution 
 surely we can do much well i therefore welcome the bill and i invite member to look seriously at clause and clause set out the measure that will be require in the secretary of state ’s strategy include measure on prioritise investment collaborate with local authority and use natural flood management technique and a requirement for local authority to take into account the need for conservation all incredibly sensible measure that can only be deliver by public authority privatised water company do not have as their top line the conservation of the natural world and the environment they have as their top line their middle line and their bottom line the profit they can take out of it and please nobody tell i that the £ pay out in dividend have be reinveste in the british economy it be in tax haven all over the world we be subsidise tax haven all over the world on the back of our polluted and privatised water industry 
 clause relate to the commission on water which be a fascinating proposal the commission would include representative of water company which be privatise at the moment but would hopefully be publicly own union representative in the water industry environmental or conservation group water user which would be local business and local authority i strongly support public ownership of water but i do not envisage a situation in which the prime minister as a gift to his friend put they all on a british water board i would like to retain the exist system of manage river basin area thames severn trent and so on that make sense because that be where the primary water supply come from that would be manage through a commission that include the workforce trade union all the local authority in the area local business because they use water and supply service locally and    other who can be appoint from elsewhere we would have public buy in to the structure which would give we a much well and more democratic system 
 i urge member to look with some imagination at what the hon member for norwich south have put forward some say we can not possibly bring this into public ownership because it might cost money the labour government start by nationalise the bank of england in and go on to bring many other industry into public ownership even the ted heath government in bring rolls royce into public ownership and create rolls royce ltd because the company be fail the agree share price be set by parliament it be not set by the market in all those case we can do the same in this case 
 the right hon gentleman and i stand for election in on a manifesto of public ownership of the utility and water company it cost i my job and the public decide to give labour the bad electoral thumping in our history will he take some responsibility for that do he reflect on the point that what he be advocate have already be reject by this country 
 i thank the hon member for that incredibly friendly and helpful intervention i be most grateful to he for the collegiate way in which he put that i could not put it well myself that manifesto include public ownership of water and other service because those industry need to come into public ownership they be fail the policy in that manifesto be all well in the plus category more than support public ownership of water this might be uncomfortable for he but the labour party actually receive more vote publicly and nationally in than it do in the recent general election we have an electoral system that be unbelievably unfair and which bring about an enormous majority on a very low total vote we can all play with the number 
 i do not resile from what be in that manifesto because it be put there by people who work in the industry the gmb and other union take part in the consultation that bring about that policy on water i urge the hon member to consider the bill put forward by my friend the hon member for norwich south and to recognise that it be an opportunity to do something different 
 there have be a lot of to ing and fro ing about have a commission or a citizen assembly why be everybody so scared of a citizen assembly what be the big problem with it be it something in member head what be go on why would anyone be so worried about it citizen get together and put forward a proposal we do not have to agree it or accept it and it do not take away the power of parliament it give an opportunity for randomly select ordinary citizen to put forward a point of view that be do a lot in scotland when we be talk about devolution it have be do in other place in chile it be do to develop a new constitution some of which be ultimately reject in a referendum do these assembly take away from or diminish the principle discuss no i believe they do the very opposite 
 i have not yet hear a response from anyone in this house to my legitimate concern about regional variation if there be no ability to compel the right hon gentleman be a member for islington in london where a lot of meeting like this be hold i be a member for gateshead mile away attend an assembly would require a lot of travel how do he suggest we deal with the lack of compulsion and the regional variation in involvement in citizen assembly 
 since the hon member use to live in islington he be well aware of how great the connectivity to the area be obviously we live in a country where the capital london be in the south east that be maybe not an ideal geographical location but i do not think it be go to change any time soon if we have a national commission it have to meet somewhere it do not have to be in london do we have to pay the cost of get people to the meeting yes of course obviously we do i envisage a more localise form of consultation in regional water area such as severn trent humber and so on i think that would meet the concern that the hon gentleman legitimately raise about the overly centric nature of our political structure in this country 
 be there not an inherent contradiction here i be not against the principle of citizen assembly my concern be the idea that they need to be form by parliament secondly do the right hon gentleman not see an inconsistency between a party that have a mandate for deliver nationalisation and hand these matter over to a citizen assembly for deliberation do he not see that there be an inherent contradiction between the 
 i do not think there be a contradiction at all i think it be mature grown up politic to say we have the objective of public ownership we want you to consider what the good form and structure of it would be it could be that people do not agree with it at all we would then have to discuss and debate the matter with they obviously ultimately parliament have to make the decision i know everyone in the house be brilliant the intellect be superb and the knowledge amazing and they be infallible in all their judgment but be it just possible that there be some people who be not member of parliament who also have enormous knowledge experience and ability perhaps we should listen to they too 
 rise 
 i will give way for the last time 
 how long roughly do the right hon gentleman think it would take to ensure that the citizen be skilled up enough to contribute effectively to the full consultation that he be talk about as he be so precious about the intervention from my hon friend   the member for bury north mr frith i will do he a favour by point out that the bill require the commission to report within month 
 some people would not require any training or skill development at all other might and of course a short period would be need for that this   be more a question for the promoter of the bill if the hon member for norwich south wish to intervene i would be happy to give way on this point 
 may i make a more general point if the bill go into committee we would look at this in far more detail but a big part of the bill be about a mission and our direction of travel it be about tackle the crisis in democracy and trust our fellow citizen to give a point of view with guidance from expert so that we can make a decision when the founder of the renaissance or capitalism sit down do they know that the renaissance would happen or that capitalism would end up like this no this be about head in a certain direction and have some imagination 
 order intervention should be short 
 i thank the hon member for norwich south for that helpful reply to   the hon member for bermondsey and old southwark neil coyle i be just do my good to facilitate debate here and i hope that you madam deputy speaker will appreciate the congenial atmosphere that i be try to create i do not know whether it be work please let i know later 
 it be work for we 
 well there you go thank you very much indeed 
 i will finish with a couple of point this country now suffer serious flooding almost every year we have all experience the pain that our constituent and other face as a result part but not all of that be bring about by unusual weather pattern and excessive rainfall we also need to think seriously about natural river management and natural flood prevention that be specify in the bill and be important the city of york for example be at a confluence of river it have always be in danger of flooding because it have these river flow into it there could be a combination of solution be yes flood defence wall concrete barrier and so on to protect central york from flooding however there be also the management of what happen upstream 
 if we deforest far upstream build on floodplain and prevent the river follow its natural course we end up with flooding there be lot of small scale natural defence can have against flooding such as not build on floodplain have river meander rather than flow in straight line and let beaver build their dam on stream and so on there be a whole lot of solution all of which add up to something valuable and good that will not be think about by water company it be do with imagination farmer in shropshire be promote exactly that kind of solution likewise what happen with the river parrett which have excessive flooding have partly be resolve but not completely by the environment agency recreate peat bog up in the hill there be a lot of thing that we can do but they require imagination a water company whose sole interest be in make money out of the water industry will not be interested in that that be why the public must have a voice in this process and that be what the bill ensure 
 the level of pollution be truly shocking the sewage that flow in and the danger to all of we the water we drink be not pure and it be not clean because there be a limit to how much scrubbing of water can be do to make it clean we end up drink all kind of foul thing in our water not to mention the microplastic that exist because of the excessive use of plastic water bottle as people do not trust the water supply it break my heart every day i walk up sisters road and outside every shop be a great stack of plastic bottle of water because people do not trust the water would it not be nice if we totally trust our water and do not feel the need endlessly to buy plastic bottle of water to keep we go through the day 
 last saturday i take part in a local people ’s forum in my constituency we invite people to come to discuss water and the water supply the hall be completely full and the forum be also follow online by a number of other people we have excellent speaker johnbosco nwogbo from we own it and laura reineke from friend of the thames they both speak with passion knowledge and interest we then throw open the discussion for question and ask each table to come up with their idea the commonality be clean water ownership and control the cost of water and anger and irritation at thames water ’s lack of investment in the pipe network include the lack of re sleeving of the victorian main in so many place 
 we have have major flood on isledon road stroud green road holloway road and sisters road in the recent past not to mention in the constituency of hackney north and stoke newington not the constituency of   the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier who have be speak today which flood into our area the sobell leisure centre near where i live be flood out it be now and a half year later and the restitution work for the damage do be just be complete that be the irresponsibility of thames water not invest in the network waste money in the short term by dig up short section of road replace the pipe fill it in again and come back the next month to dig up another bit of road metre away to do exactly the same thing we need a much more coherent and comprehensive approach
