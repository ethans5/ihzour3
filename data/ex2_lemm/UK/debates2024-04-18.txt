 what discussion her department have have with the music industry on take step to help reduce ticket price 
 our department speak regularly to industry stakeholder about how to make sure that live music continue to reach a wide range of audience ultimately ticket pricing strategy be a matter for event organiser and ticket platform but they have to comply with the relevant law to ensure price transparency allow consumer to make a fair and informed decision 
 whether it be on music or other entertainment this government have consistently fail to act in the interest of fan when it come to ticket touting last year   they reject the recommendation and warning of the competition and markets authority to strengthen legislation and protect consumer from illegal reselling practice in the secondary ticketing market will the minister concede that the problem have get much bad for fan when will the government finally put a stop to that 
 i disagree with the hon gentleman the government bring in the consumer rights act which be strengthen by the digital economy act which bring in anti bots regulation that deal with some of those secondary ticketing issue it be a tricky problem to solve we be try to do so through those regulation but if there be more that we can do we will look into that 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 rise 
 order the hon member complain about the other question but it be not my fault that no government members have stand to ask a supplementary question i keep a political balance and i be not go to break that for he i call thangam debbonaire 
 ticket tout be a scourge on our live music industry secondary ticket website inflate price and pocket the profit which make cultural and sport event unaffordable for many family and damage the relationship between fan artist and venue while the government fail to act labour have commit to tackle soar ticket price on the secondary market surely the minister agree that only labour will put fan back at the heart of music and cultural event 
 surely the hon member would not expect i to agree with such a ludicrous statement we bring in law and we have anti bot regulation and we have have ticket tout arrest for their activity i know that labour have bring forward its own proposal effectively a price cap on resale which we do not think be workable we have see that in ireland and it simply increase fraudulent activity it do not deliver for fan we simply do not believe that what she be propose will make any difference 
 what step her department be take to help the heritage sector reach net 
 early this year we publish a review of the barrier face by owner of historic home to reduce their energy consumption it make a number of commitment across planning skill and finance to assist the heritage sector on its journey to net include consult on the role of local list building consent order to drive change at the local level 
 in north tyneside ’s world heritage site segedunum be successful in access fund through the museum estate and development fund for urgent   repair that will contribute to reduce the site ’s carbon footprint currently other than the heritage fund and potential regional government funding there be no other source of funding that would help cultural and heritage site meet climate change target what be the government do directly to ensure that heritage site can be resilient against climate change and have sustainable future 
 i thank the hon member for raise that issue she talk about of the substantial fund that we have to help repair and restore museum heritage site and other activity i be glad that that be make a big difference in her constituency we have be look into the important area of how historic building can reduce their energy consumption it be obviously difficult since of building in the uk be list we want to help they to reduce their energy consumption which be a particular challenge for owner of historic home historic england have guidance to help museum and we will look at what more we can do 
 when it come to valuable heritage asset i be really concerned about those house in the ground of our many military estate which be not bind by any of the obligation to maintain and care for they in many case the ministry of defence and other be pursue a policy of manage decline which be allow those valuable heritage asset to rot under our very nose may i encourage the minister in fact the secretary of state to speak with ministers in the ministry of defence to challenge that policy and see what can be do to address it i give her advance warning that i be keen to look at that as part of a select committee inquiry 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important point it be something that we support when an asset be in the community rather than on the exist military estate i recently visit the battle of britain bunker at raf uxbridge where there have be an amazing partnership with the local council she raise an issue specifically about mod site that be still in use which we shall be very happy to look into for she

 i share my hon friend ’s concern about the financial issue face torquay united i urge all party to find a swift solution to this distressing situation the government be seek to support the professional game through the football governance bill which will establish an independent football regulator 
 as the minister know recent week have be difficult for torquay united fan with the club enter into administration follow year of fan struggle to get answer from the owner and a completely flawed plan for a new stadium which make no progress whatsoever what role will prevent the circumstance that have drag down torquay united and other club play in future development in how the game be govern 
 i agree that meaningful engagement with fan be crucial i want to put on record my thank to the torquay united supporters trust for its action to support the club and the fan i share the concern about the financial situation right across the game that be exactly why the bill will give power to the regulator which will be able to monitor and enforce financial regulation and deal with club ownership fan engagement and club heritage issue to ensure that club be protect for the very fan who be their bedrock

 if she will make an assessment of the potential merit of bring forward legislative proposal to regulate the use of national symbol by commercial and other entity 
 the correct use of many national symbol such as royal name state emblem the royal arm and the government coat of arm be already subject to government regulation 
 i think many people would be quite angered by the way certain national organisation have try to change our national flag the cross of st george and the union jack be it not time that we protect and cherish our national symbol by appoint a minister of the crown from the cabinet office to oversee that will the minister also look at the union flag bill of which would enshrine in legislation the protection of our cherished national flag 
 the union jack should be a unifying symbol for the whole country it have look the way it have for the past several year and i see no point in mess around with it i be not sure that we need legislation we just need some common sense 
 would ministers be equally keen to prevent organisation such as political party use image of his majesty the king in their propaganda 
 i do not know how to answer that question if i be honest laughter our party have always be proud to use the union jack because we be a proud unionist party and we will always be proud to support the royal family 
 what step her department be take to support charity and voluntary organisation in the context of increase in the cost of living 
 the government be invest million to support charity across england with cost of living pressure and that include the community organisations cost of living fund which be award critical support to frontline service 
 what do it say about the state of the nation when during the bad cost of live crisis in live memory charity and voluntary organisation such as calmer therapy in the wansbeck constituency be struggle simply to make end meet like many other charity calmer therapy be have to do more with less it be face more pressure and continued pressure with crumble building and excessive bill what conversation have the minister have with the chancellor about plan to support charity and those who be desperately rely on they to survive 
 i want to put on record my thank to the charity up and down the country that have do some incredible work over some of the most challenging time i recognise that when cost be rise and donation be fall demand for their service often increase that be why i have conversation with my right hon friend the chancellor and why we secure a significant package of £ to support those charity it be welcome by the sector i be grateful to the national lottery community fund for help we to get that money out as quickly as possible to so many charity around the country 
 what recent discussion she have have with representative of football club and association on ensure the wellbeing of football player in the context of their increase risk of dementia 
 i have discuss the issue of dementia with the professional footballers association specifically around the premier league ’s promise to allocate funding towards the new brain health fund for football player impact by dementia i be pleased that the fund be launch in september last year and i will be write to the pfa shortly to seek its assurance on the current working of the fund and how the pfa be engage with former player 
 my constituent be the former celtic chelsea blackburn and more importantly norwich city football legend chris sutton he have recently bring to my attention the very distressing fact that former professional footballer be time more likely to die of cte chronic traumatic encephalopathy dementia than the wide population due to repeat head impact chris be just of a group of former player who be champion these issue and push for well provision to support the wellbeing of ex player and their family can the minister reassure i that the football industry will create a properly finance dementia fund to help player and of course their widow who be affect by the cte dementia scandal 
 my hon friend be right to raise this incredibly important issue and i want to record my thank to chris sutton and all those involve in this important work we welcome the practical support that those involve in sport give former player in these circumstance the pfa and premier league ’s brain health fund have an initial amount of £ in financial support for former player and their family to improve their quality of life the fund will remain in place until the pfa and the premier league establish a charity that will involve a great many football stakeholder so we can provide a much long term support vehicle i can reassure he that i take this area of work incredibly seriously and will continue to put pressure on those involve 
 i be grateful to the minister for that answer and hope we will hear more in that regard 
 the number of child who be vape continue to rise at an alarming rate statistic from show that current use within the last day among year old be but the percentage will obviously be significantly high now we know about some of the harm to which vaping lead which should cause we grave concern but we certainly do not know about all of they in that context do the minister think it be a good thing that the strip of football club such as blackburn rovers be sponsor by vape company if not will he join i in seek to change that 
 i know that there have be many discussion about sponsorship within various sporting body it be for the individual club and the football authority themselves to set guideline of that kind but the hon lady have raise an interesting point and if she will allow i i will give it further consideration 
 i call the shadow minister 
 everyone deserve to feel safe play the sport that they love in the context of sadly too many former professional player suffer from dementia what step be the department take to ensure that sport governing body have the guidance they need to ensure the safety of professional player 
 the hon lady have raise an important point as have other member the government be lead work on concussion in particular we have work with stakeholder and develop the guideline to   be distribute to the grassroot which have also aid professional sport the evaluation of this be ongoing and will be invaluable in help we to improve sport relate education and health we have also convene a sport concussion research group to identify the question that still need answer as well as an innovation and technology panel whose member be look at the practical technical solution that will aid safety and mitigate concussion however as i have say this be an incredibly important area and on which we will focus 
 what her plan timetable be for respond to the consultation on the statutory levy on gambling operator 
 the statutory levy represent a generational change in funding arrangement and we have to consider properly the evidence provide during the consultation we will publish a response set out our final decision soon but we remain on track to introduce the levy via secondary legislation this summer 
 it have be month since the consultation close with no response and about other consultation relate to the white paper be also await a response be the minister try to kick change into the long grass and if not will he please confirm when the response will be publish 
 i reject that accusation there be proposal in the white paper half of which will be finalise as a result of the consultation or be complete a further consultation have end and we be now analyse those the levy be a priority because we want the fund to be direct where they be need most on the basis of evidence and we be work at pace to ensure that happen i also point out that it be this government who introduce it 
 if she will take step with relevant stakeholder to help provide space for artist to create and display their work 
 high quality affordable workspace be essential to ensure that we can retain our fine creative talent the government be commit to encourage local authority and property owner to make space available for cultural activity arts council england be already support artist space through funding and broker partnership the national portfolio boast numerous workspace that receive revenue funding such as spike island and yorkshire artspace which offer space for artist to create work and gallery space for exhibit new work 
 leighton buzzard dunstable and many other part of my constituency be bless with an abundance of artist painter sculptor and other but they have very few place where they can create their   work they need more studio space and more workspace and even few place in which to exhibit provide such space should be essential it aid economic activity increase footfall and increase wellbee so how can we ensure that it be essential as the minister say and not an afterthought it really do matter 
 i thank my hon friend for raise his concern about the creative community in leighton buzzard it sound like a buzz creative community as i say we support creative industry primarily through arts council england which have initiative that look at workspace i encourage organisation in his constituency and community to make application for grant because there be specific fund available 
 art venue be vital to our local culture and our community but they be also hotbed for new talent to display or perform their late work which be critical to the uk ’s creative sector pub be increasingly use for show artwork as much as they be for perform music think of pub such as the crown inn back in the day or the hope and anchor in islington that be why it be so important that we save pub such as the punch bowl in warwick which a developer want to convert into a house last year be the bad year for the closure of music venue what be the minister do to stop that rate of closure 
 we share the hon gentleman ’s concern about grassroots music venue which be why we have a specific fund set aside to help save some of the most treasured community venue we also have the localism act which allow community to designate a particular community asset of value give community time to raise fund to save those kind of asset it be something that we be talk about a lot with music venue group and we be also look at give they help to buy the freehold of property so that those kind of asset can stay within community and remain a talent pipeline as he suggest for many year to come 
 what recent discussion she have have with the premier league and english football league on the financial stability of football club 
 as my hon friend will know the football governance bill be introduce to parliament last month and it will help with the financial sustainability of football as a whole i have meet the premier league the english football league many stakeholder and parliamentarian to ensure that the legislation be appropriately draft i have meet over club and senior executive from the league many time 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for that answer we do not have to look too far across the east midland to see that club such as nottingham forest derby county coventry city and leicester city have find themselves in some form of difficulty so i welcome the government ’s plan to introduce a regulator to bring some stability to the football pyramid   however how do we ensure that we strike a balance so that we do not strangle and over regulate the good league in the world the premiership 
 as my hon friend mention the premier league be world lead it be worth £ and we absolutely want to ensure that it stay and world class that be why the legislation take a proportionate approach it take on board the fact that the regulator will have to work very closely with the league include the premier league we call it an advocacy approach and have work very carefully with the team i be very confident that the legislation take a balanced and proportionate approach 
 football be nothing without the fan and the secretary of state may recall that a while ago i mention to the sport minister the idea of a postponement promise that be in response to a spate of fixture that have be cancel at very short notice the minister say that he would raise it with the efl and i understand that he do so i be grateful for that but i wonder whether the secretary of state agree that we need to keep the momentum go forward will she and the minister continue to work with the efl to come up with a solution that work for fan 
 the hon member be absolutely right about the importance of fan and community to football which be why the government be bring forward legislation to protect fan across the country my junior minister be a value colleague who support i and work very hard across his portfolio i know he have raise this issue with the efl and i will talk to he about it 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 this government recognise just how important the art be which be why the chancellor use the budget to extend introduce and make permanent a range of tax relief to drive growth and investment in our creative industry we have provide tax relief worth £ over the next year for museum gallery theatre orchestra independent film production film studio and the visual effect industry in addition as sunday draw near i want to wish all those run and take part in the london marathon the good of luck in particular the shadow secretary of state   the hon member for bristol west thangam debbonaire

 tragedy chanting be absolutely abhorrent and have no place in football or indeed in any sport the government fully support the football league and the   police in their effort to identify and deal with the culprit tragedy chanting can be prosecute as a public order offence with guilty individual be issue with football ban order prevent they from attend match in the future

 we will always look at suggestion i can reassure the hon member that our catering team recently achieve the high mark in the sustainable restaurant association food make good rating of the area that we be assess on be our commitment to reduce food waste but clearly we will look at the hon member ’s suggestion and we will act on they if they have merit 
 i call theresa villiers not here 
 the hon member for south west bedfordshire represent the church commissioners be ask 
 to ask the hon member for south west bedfordshire represent the church commissioners what step the church have take to support family relationship parenting and marriage since the establishment of the archbishops commission on families and households 
 the report of the joint archbishops commission on families and households be enthusiastically receive by the general synod at its meeting in february the archbishops council be now incorporate the report ’s recommendation into the work programme 
 the key message from the archbishops commission be unambiguous family relationship and love matter the no action point from the commission be 
 to maximise the protective effect of family 
 what step be the church of england take to achieve that in kettering and across the whole country 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his interest in this important area i can tell he that the commissioner have have meeting with departments and with the child ’s commissioner to work alongside government to strengthen family relationship parenting and marriage the church itself want to play a more active role in this crucial area and be produce new resource to help parish do so i be sure he will know that in his own constituency st andrew ’s church be already exemplify much of this good work under the excellent leadership of the reverend tom houston who train as a youth worker prior to ordination 
 same sex couple be able to show love and be a good family as well so why will the church of england not recognise same sex marriage 
 the hon member will know that this be an issue with which the general synod continue to be involve through the living in love and faith process we be work through these issue and the church will have hear very clearly what he have say and i can assure he that that work be be take forward 
 to ask the hon member for south west bedfordshire represent the church commissioners if the church will publish a statement on its position on amendment table to the criminal justice bill relate to the decriminalisation of abortion before report stage of that bill 
 the church of england believe that the foetus be a human life with the potential to develop while recognise that there can be strictly limit condition under which abortion may be morally preferable to any available alternative the church also believe that every possible support especially by church member should be give to those who be pregnant and in difficult circumstance the church would support new clause and and believe that while woman should not face criminalisation anyone coerce a woman to have an abortion or provide beyond the legal limit or supply an abortion kit for a late term use should be prosecute 
 i welcome the support for new clause and i think the church estates commissioner have give implicit opposition to the new clause in the name of   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson but i be gobsmacke not to have have a clear statement on the criminality of terminate a pregnancy up to the moment of birth by whomsoever be the intention to drive we into the arm of rome be he as gobsmacke as i be 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for his interest in these serious issue which give their importance i be sure the house will want to treat sensitively i will convey his comment to the leadership of the church but just to repeat the church be support the week reduction in the age of viability from to week base on the late available evidence that foetus do survive from week onwards it be also support protection for down ’s syndrome child to make the case that abortion beyond the legal limit should not be acceptable for such child the church support the continue prosecution of medical practitioner who assist with abortion beyond the legal limit 
 to ask the hon member for luton south represent the speaker ’s committee on the electoral commission whether the committee have have recent discussion with the electoral commission on the potential impact of disinformation on the integrity of election 
 the committee have have recent discussion with the electoral commission on the matter raise the commission recognise the   risk pose to the integrity of election by disinformation and misinformation it run campaign raise awareness of the voting process so voter have accurate information on which to rely the legal regime that the commission regulate be focus on ensure that political finance be transparent and that campaigner material include an imprint show voter who have produce the material it do not have a role in regulate the content of election campaign material but encourage all campaigner to undertake their role responsibly and transparently 
 i be grateful for the hon lady ’s answer recently we have see a decrease in the effectiveness of search engine such as google with material generate by ai which be design to produce only thing that sound like information poison the well so to speak with a marked impact on search result with this automation of fake news and fake oracle what plan do the electoral commission have to put out guidance on ai produce material 
 the commission encourage all campaigner to undertake their role of influence voter responsibly and transparently and indeed encourage voter to think critically about the campaign material that they see it expect anyone use ai generate campaign material to use it in a way that benefit open and transparent political debate and to label it clearly so that voter know how it have be create campaign material must also carry an imprint tell voter who have publish and pay for it the commission ’s role be to ensure that the financing of campaign be transparent it do not have a role in regulate the content of election campaign material such as prevent the use of deepfake 
 whether the church have take recent step to support the armenian church in the old city of jerusalem 
 the bishop of southwark have raise this issue repeatedly in the other place over the past month and it remain an ongoing and very concern issue only day ago an unlawful eviction be lead by the israeli police within the premise of the armenian patriarchate with no court order or permit present 
 those of we who be good friend of israel need to call out the violent activity of the settler movement the armenian christians have enjoy the good part of year in their part of the old city in tranquillity the appalling incident on   april   be lead not just by thug but by an israeli officer call assaf harel frankly there be downright intimidation and an attempt to force out armenian christians the christian population in the old city have decline from a century ago to just will the church of england stand up for christians in the old city 
 i be extremely grateful to my right hon friend for his sustained interest in this really important issue it would be an absolute tragedy if there be to be no christians leave in the holy land the house will have hear the figure that he have just present the pressure face the armenian church exemplify those face by other church in jerusalem and the west bank the armenian patriarch of jerusalem be of the custodian of the holy land and overseer of the quarter of the city the church of england be absolutely clear that the historic settlement and the status quo of jerusalem need to be maintain the lack of any call for restraint from the israeli government be escalate tension in jerusalem and that remain a great concern 
 whether the church provide guidance to parish on the sale of land where there be local opposition to that sale 
 when the church commissioners sell land they seek to engage all those who be affect by a sale or development the commissioner be not aware of any land that they own be for sale in north east bedfordshire 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his response the word engage be interesting in this context it be the case that there be a church in my constituency where there be local opposition to the sale of allotment land discussion be hold initially with the diocese and then at church house in westminster my hon friend will be aware that in such discussion there be an imbalance of power so can he assure i that there be adequate guidance to enable parishioner and local community to combat effectively pressure to sell land where there be clearly local opposition 
 i particularly agree with my hon friend about the importance of allotment for which there be often a very long waiting list the land at henlow be own by the diocese of st albans and i will ask the diocesan secretary to contact he of course he can also speak to the bishop of bedford and the bishop of st albans whom we both know well charity law place a fiduciary duty on organisation to gain good    value from the sale of their asset that may be an issue that my hon friend would want to raise with the relevant government minister in the context of what be happen in his constituency 
 what recent assessment the commissioner have make of the contribution of church school to education in a harrow east constituency and b england 
 the church of england educate more than child in its school which include of all primary school in england church school in harrow east do incredible work and among they be st john ’s school in stanmore which have many child for whom english be not their language and who be from disadvantaged background that school achieve a reading progress score of compare with the average score in the rest of the local authority of that excellent achievement be to be warmly commend 
 i be very proud of the fact that parent in harrow east have the option of a church education or the religious ethos education of their choice however as we all know the birth rate be drop as be the number of child who need primary place in harrow there be therefore a direct threat to the roll at st john ’s and other religious base school which may become unviable what action be the church take to enable young people particularly those who have recently come to this country who may be of a christian faith but not necessarily of the church of england faith to identify with a church school and get that sort of education 
 it may surprise my hon friend and the house that there be some church of england school in which all the child be from other faith that be because church school be community school and welcome all i will draw his concern about fall roll number both to the diocese of london and to the national education department of the church of england however in my experience parent have a pretty good nose for find their way to a good school the result at st john ’s about which i have just tell the house should help in this case

 the attack by iran on israel have rightly be condemn by all side of the house thankfully its intention be thwart and we join together in call for restraint and de escalation in the aftermath we can not let those recent event deter or distract from international effort to bring about a sustainable ceasefire in gaza and create the condition for a lasting state solution 
 as global conflict increase it be unacceptable that the government have reject recommendation from the cross party procedure committee for the foreign secretary to be accountable in this house it be simply not the case that he or the government have be   forward lean in that regard as the leader of the house have say statement by his now deputy the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office   the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell have be few and far between and his appearance at select committees have all but dry up 
 many time in these exchange the leader of the house have assure we that member would have the opportunity to question the foreign secretary say that 
 when the procedure committee bring forward measure i be sure those measure will be put in place”—[official report   november vol c. 
 so why have she now block that or do she lose the argument in government she seem to struggle to be hear in government lately i know that she be keen to talk about defence spending too although apparently no block she do she want to take the opportunity today i know that she like i will be concern to hear that the uk now spend less on defence as a percentage of gdp than when labour be last in office 
 the leader of the house be not listen to when it come to legislative business before the house either i be really puzzled that she be unable to support a flagship piece of government legislation as she apparently think it be unworkable forgive i madam deputy speaker but be it not the job of the leader of the house to ensure that any government legislation table be well draft think through and will achieve its aim she chair the government ’s legislation committee do she not she have more influence than nearly anybody else on the drafting of a bill so what go wrong 
 after our easter break we have return to groundhog day it might be a new term but it be the same old story more decent conservative members announce that they be stand down treasury ministers hit the airwave and get the number wrong a weak prime minister who can not face down his own party run scared from his own legislation and refuse to say how his cut to national insurance will be fund the former prime minister   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss still unable to show any contrition for her action directly cost mortgage holder hundred of pound a month cabinet split and rival faction all on open display with ever more extreme position and platform take and yet more tory sleaze and scandal 
 today ’s revelation about   the hon member for fylde mark menzies   be extraordinary they raise very serious question about the misuse of fund and the pressure put on other to facilitate it perhaps more importantly they also raise question about how these issue be handle by the conservative party there be a worrying pattern of cover up and inaction so can the leader of the house shed some light what do the chief whip the prime minister and the party chairman   the right hon member for north west durham mr holden know and when why do it take the publication of the story today for the whip to be remove have this matter be refer to the police and if not why not 
 it seem that yet again like with   the hon member for hazel grove mr wragg   and so many other recent case of sleaze and scandal the government be too weak to act decisively and instead choose to brush thing under the carpet the truth be that they have give up on governing and give up on win the next election it be all about save their own skin and   the inevitable leadership battle i can tell the leader of the house that we on the labour benches have be there before and it do not end well the public do not easily forgive politician who put party before country and do not focus relentlessly on fix the problem they face 
 i join the hon lady in formally convey my sympathy to mr speaker on the loss of his father i have speak to he privately and write to he as well i also congratulate dad walk on be award the petition of the year by the petitions committee for their important work on suicide prevention and wish all colleagues—18 of they in total and everyone else run the marathon good luck 
 on monday evening the very special jewish festival of passover begin like their ancestor before they jewish family around the world will gather around their seder table to retell the story of the jewish people ’s exodus from egypt however this year many of they will be leave an empty seat open at those table for those still hold captive by hamas in gaza i hope this will be the last jewish holiday where they be unable to celebrate with their family and wish chag sameach to all those celebrate i also thank all hon member for their resolve and support with regard to israel ’s security that be an important message that we send from this house 
 the hon lady mention the issue of the foreign secretary and the government ’s work in that regard be accountable to this house since the foreign secretary be appoint we have have foreign commonwealth and development office statement prime ministerial statement on foreign affair a general debate in government time on the situation in the red sea and westminster hall debate respond to by fcdo minister as well as oral question in both houses we be stick with the usual precedent of both houses 
 the hon lady ask i to comment on defence and i be very happy to compare this government ’s record with the last labour government ’s record we have have the large uplift to the defence budget since the end of the cold war when we come into office we inherit a defence budget and equipment programme with a £ black hole on royal united services institute figure i remember from my own constituency that portsmouth faslane and plymouth be have to state the case to continue to be naval basis in this country the previous labour government know their record with member of the armed force be poor because in they disenfranchise all of they by change the rule on voter registration 
 the hon lady point to the vote on smoking i think free vote in this place on such matter be good however whatever our difference of opinion in future year i be hopeful there will be few fag packet around on which labour economic team can do their sum and i think that be a jolly good thing 
 labour members seem to be continue to push their line on national insurance contribution good look to they in that respect but let i just point out some of the reason why it will not get traction national insurance contribution receipt do not determine the nhs budget or pension it be only the labour party that have cut the nhs budget and it be actually labour ’s policy at least   it be when i come into the chamber to support our tax cut i hope that be helpful information for the hon lady 
 the hon lady mention some very serious allegation and other incident that come to light during the recess these be very serious matter and some of they be under police investigation so she would not expect i to comment on they but we take these matter very seriously we have take action again this week to improve online safety and other matter 
 the deepfake phenomenon be more widespread than we might think and the public may well be fool into think that something be the case when it be not or that a person they know be manifestly different and we need to expose such scam the hon lady talk about defence and someone might be tempt to believe a person be commit to this nation ’s nuclear deterrent but note that in reality the same person be content to serve in the cabinet of the last labour leader and that of his front benchers vote to end our nuclear deterrent they might think that the labour party be the party of the nhs but as we know it be the only party that have cut the nhs budget they might be tempt by the sound of securonomic only to discover that that be build on unfunded pledge and unspecified tax increase 
 someone might be tempt by the look of the shadow chancellor ’s commitment to end unpaid internship only to find that she have use they herself or of labour ’s campaign against fire and rehire only to discover that that be exactly what labour hq do under the current labour leader they might be suck in by talk about its wanting to protect pensioner and then learn that it will not commit to our triple lock and that hundred of thousand more pensioner be live in absolute poverty under the last labour government business might be flatter by email and online ad from labour unaware of the new regulatory burden that would be pile on to they under a labour government 
 my advice be do not be tempt people should not be fool by a shadow foreign secretary who nominate   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn   to be prime minister a shadow international development secretary who want to turn our armed force into a hippy hit squad a party that until last year have a shadow minister for disarmament a shadow energy secretary whose poor judgment on national security and our interest lead to disaster and to op shader a shadow deputy prime minister who hold other to standard she do not think should apply to herself or a party that talk tough on border but as of yesterday have vote time again strengthen they 
 the leader of the opposition have spend year in office post picture to his profile of neil kinnock tony blair and margaret thatcher do not be fool behind that profile sit a man with no plan for this country except the vested interest of militant union and support for the argument of those who would do this nation harm it be deepfake labour lead by catfish keir do not fall for it 
 rise 
 order before we proceed may i on behalf of mr speaker thank the leader of the house and the shadow leader of the house and all other member who have express their sympathy to he on the loss of his father lord hoyle   doug hoyle be a dedicated parliamentarian an inspirational kind and amusing gentleman and a very proud father he will be very greatly miss and i be sure the whole house will join i in send our sympathy to mr speaker and his family our thought will be with they as they make arrangement for lord hoyle ’s funeral 
 i call the father of the house 
 we will remember doug hoyle ’s smile we will remember he with a smile and i remember that he get elect month before i do 
 question on the cass report in this house be follow yesterday by those in the other place and the lords minister say that he would respond to a number of point in writing if information be give by the minister that be not give to this house could it be put in a write statement or put in the library many of the point especially those make by baroness hayter be important we need an inquiry into how thing get into the state that have to be expose by the year review by dr hilary cass for which we all thank she 
 thing that have not yet happen but may happen in the next week or be the publication of the report from the select committee on the holocaust memorial bill through its hybrid procedure it be come later than we anticipate and may contain some interesting recommendation or decision will the government say as soon as possible whether they intend to go on try to ram this proposal through they have already spend more than £ achieve nothing in the last and a half year so will they have a roundtable and consider spend £ get a memorial up in the next year during the lifetime of some of the holocaust survivor and move the learn centre to the imperial war museum 
 i thank my hon friend for that question and i will certainly ensure that his request about the cass review be undertake he know that a process be be go through at the moment for the memorial and i will again ensure that the relevant secretary of state have hear what he say today there be also question to that secretary of state on monday and he may wish to make use of that opportunity 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 may i associate myself with the remark about passover and about mr speaker ’s late father and send my sincere condolence to he and his family 
 since we last meet for business question the leader of the house have be keep busy and i think that of her social medium post on x during the recess be particularly eye catching indeed it be unique because it ask her constituent to contact she directly so outraged be she by a burn injustice it start 
 damn right i know many people will have strong feeling on this email i and i will make sure your concern 
 be hear those be such strong feeling that you may wonder madam deputy speaker what cause that righteous anger which be not just from the leader of the house but from member across the chamber 
 be it child get sick swimming through human faece in the river of england or perhaps the endless strike in the nhs in england be it arm sale to israel or an economic crisis that be trigger by a former prime minister now saviour of the west be it the cruel immoral illegal and ruinously expensive rwanda scheme perhaps the angry post be just a response to the leader of the house ’s constituent in portsmouth who be now furious rightly enough about the likely demolition of the brand new border control post in portsmouth which be among a herd of such white elephant around the uk and a direct result of the right hon lady ’s ongoing brexit confusion that will cost a fortune no that be not what prompt the outburst the leader of the house and many of her colleague be furious about england ’s new football top—“damn right they be 
 so no the farce of the doom border post on the right hon lady ’s doorstep have not figure in the busy social medium output we see from she her government ’s disastrous brexit import charge be none the less come in on   april cause even more costly confusion and raise very real concern about food shortage as well as her own local difficulty may i ask the leader of the house for an urgent debate on these new brexit charge and the ongoing catastrophe of brexit which scot reject yet be force to suffer the ill effect of her constituent will be interested to hear an answer ideally before she waste more time launch into another anti scotland video script 
 i should thank the hon lady for her concern about portsmouth port which be do very well we have a brand new passenger terminal and an enormous number of new ship visit which be project to increase our local economy by £ over the next few year that be in addition to massively increase and diversify the freight come into that port i hope she will welcome the news that the united kingdom be export more and have just become the large exporter in the world we be do very well 
 i be always keen to facilitate my constituent who wish to make complaint to all sort of organisation in their ability to do that i just say to the hon lady that our nation ’s flag be important to the people of portsmouth i suggest that she might like to think twice before she mock that view these thing and these tradition be important they be not the worship of ash but the preservation of fire 
 the hon lady have be busy too during the recess pen article about how much my colleague and i hate scotland and the scottish people she have do it again in her opening remark and her question to i at some point she will have to say why she think that be the case i know that the scottish rugby team have be do well against england but that be not ground to justify her accusation against i the snp seem hellbent on expose hate where there be none i understand that of the hate crime report under the snp ’s new law with make on   april   alone only will qualify under this new law and of those have now be dismiss police scotland deserve our thank and our sympathy i be sure that those police officer join the force to do something much more helpful for their community it be only the conservatives   who have stand against this lunacy and we will continue to do that other party have the opportunity to repeal this law and choose not to we on the government benches know that law and movement base on hate and division always try to curtail freedom and we know that in the end such movement always fail 
 i associate myself with your remark madam deputy speaker about the late father of mr speaker
