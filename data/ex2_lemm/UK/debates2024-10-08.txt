madam deputy speaker it be a genuine honour to address you and the house today it be a privilege not just to represent the derbyshire dales but even to be there because it be truly an area of outstanding natural beauty know to many hon member i be sure because it be a destination for million but its great appeal also present a problem particularly for young people who be look for housing the little house building that take place be more or less match by the number of property lose to home holiday let and airbnbs that result in the high house price in the region which put house out of the reach of many young people they end up move to other area to find more affordable housing that in turn mean few young family few child and school with fall number on roll small business include farm pub and restaurant suffer as well as they struggle to get staff due to the lack of affordable accommodation nearby it be vital that we address this housing crisis 
 i pay tribute to my predecessor sarah dines who stand up for the farming community in the dale something that i very much hope to continue i have have the pleasure of meet her predecessor lord patrick mcloughlin who be in the other place and i hope to benefit from his vast experience of the constituency 
 the main industry in the dale be unsurprisingly tourism leisure and hospitality quarrying and agriculture i be hopeful that the new government can secure a veterinary agreement with the european union to give our struggle farmer a boost i have spend much of my few week in the role speak to farmer to try to understand what the key issue be for they food security in an increasingly unstable world must be a high priority 
 the dale have great historical significance accord to the anglo saxon chronicle in the century the northern king meet edward the elder at the bakewell burh and choose he as father and lord effectively create the entity that we call england arkwright ’s mill at cromford be the birthplace of mass production and of course it be power by renewable energy i recently meet the arkwright society which be restore the site for the benefit of future generation and do a great job i also recently meet jamie needle who have take on masson mill another of arkwright ’s mill he   be also concern with the delivery of hydroelectric power from the derwent what go around come around stone from derbyshire quarry be use in the reconstruction of parliament in the century and the founder of modern nursing florence nightingale live in the constituency at the family residence at lea hurst she say 
 nursing be a progressive art such that to stand still be to go backwards 
 today ’s health service be barely stand still we need to reduce the waiting list and to get working age people back to work as soon as possible 
 i know from my time as the mayor of derby that so much of the good be do daily never make the headline good deed do not appear to sell newspaper or attract advertising but in my few week in this role i have already meet some remarkable people and organisation who be make a difference in the constituency and far afield aquabox be a cromford charity with over volunteer who supply clean water solution to people in disaster zone terry eckersley at river network provide social housing and a chance to people in need bakewell youth theatre have be lead and inspire by sue stones for year i appreciate that this be on a different scale but chatsworth house no less have give invaluable opportunity to child and young people in the area by have a takeover day at the world famous stately home i must mention ben woodroffe our world champion toe wrestler yes it ’   a thing as well as be a great bloke and a champion he have raise valuable fund for the mental health charity mind 
 i hope the day of have a reasonable expectation that ’s child will do well in life be not over but they seem at least to be on pause a lack of housing a reduction in opportunity due to political decision making unrestrained social medium and a climate crisis mean that my child be enter adulthood with much great uncertainty than i do as a foster carer of teenage child for year i know how tough thing be for young people in general but they be much hard for young people leave care now than they be just a few year ago local authority be run on fume so the support have diminish and unfortunately the prejudice against care experience young people still persist the new government must work towards fix the broken child ’s social care market address the lack of placement sufficiency and end the profiteering from vulnerable child that be drive our local authority to the brink of bankruptcy 
 i do not even bother to check with the commons library but i be very sure that i be the former singer of a progressive metal band to be elect to this house although my gig day be behind i i think i be extremely pleased that the labour government will seek a deal with the eu to help our touring act who suffer no end of red tape when try to get to the continent to ply their trade the uk music industry have be an enormous success story over many decade and we need to support all of it not just the multimillion selling act but the one play to a couple of people who will hopefully be tomorrow ’s multimillion selling act 
 during my campaign i be strike by the sheer number of constituent whose no priority for an incoming government be either the climate or nature   so i feel empower to say that as influencer and maker of law we have a duty to think not just in the short term and until the next election but about those who have not even be bear yet and to leave behind a habitable planet i be particularly proud to campaign under a banner of public service service to our constituent and the nation country party we be here not for the status but for the people who elect we i will try to keep remind myself of that we must deliver on our commitment but we must also treat the staff here the staff work in our office our colleague in local government and in the civil service and our constituent with the respect that they deserve if we can do that we will move this great bastion of democracy a little close to the people it serve 
 i be delighted to take part in this debate as i be always grateful for the opportunity to praise and defend our public service particularly our state school and the million of people include the vast majority of my constituent who rely on they 
 the opposition motion 
 regret that the government have decide to impose vat on independent school fee 
 well i regret that the last tory government do all they could to deliberately and carefully dismantle defund and destroy our public service include state school for years—[interruption there be a huge amount that i could say but we be push for time and many member want to speak include lot of government members i know there be more of we here 
 every day 
 indeed 
 there be a lot that deserve to be say about our school we have hear many conservative members ask about the impact they suddenly care about the impact of decision make in this place but where be their talk of impact over the past year in st helens north    of school have have real term funding cut since over £ in real term or £ for every pupil where be the consideration of impact when the last government cancel labour ’s building schools for the future programme and watch our state school crumble where be the talk of impact when the last government preside over a send system that be fail over child and that their own education secretary describe as a lose lose lose where be the concern for impact when standard fall which   they do 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i be honour to speak for the time in this house as the member of parliament for tipton wednesbury and coseley i represent the village of coseley in dudley as well as the town of tipton wednesbury and hateley heath in sandwell in the last parliament shaun bailey be a tireless advocate for this special corner of the black country and i wish he well as he resume his legal study 
 let i tell you about tipton wednesbury and coseley we be an industrial constituency shape by factory foundry mine and canal we have beautiful park lay out for the leisure of work people and civic building of grace and gravita such as the grade ii list tipton central library and the century st bart ’s in wednesbury but more than anything we have the people of the black country creative ingenious hard work and down to earth people like thomas    barratt bear in coseley he stop the enemy advance and save his patrol at ypres he be a boilermaker award the victoria cross posthumously at just 
 the worker of tube town the metal finish capital of the world go out on strike for long month in for a decent wage they be back all the way by their wife hero in their own right who somehow keep family feed amid near destitution they win i be proud to say that their union become my union unite worker have come to the constituency from ireland the caribbean bangladesh kashmir and punjab they leave their home to provide for their family face racism but prevail build church temple mosque and gurdwara and see their child succeed we be a proud working class community too often people have stand in this place and talk our area down i will never 
 of course the name black country be for the smoke of heavy industry there have be coalmine steel fabrication metal finishing and nail brick and chain making we be where the industrial revolution start james watt ’s steam engine haul coal in tipton at the bloomfield colliery today despite everything a quarter of all worker in our area be still in manufacturing we may be the black country but modern manufacturing be clean high skill and high wage in sandwell firm with job make everything from street furniture to hinge to lock to the precision metal form for aeroplane and power plant i be proud to wear the make in britain badge and to back our new deal for work people 
 if we be to have a new industrial revolution here in the uk as we meet the challenge of climate change let we make it with our hand and our brain in the place that be the crucible of the industrial revolution the black country i stand for no more and no less than this prosperity for every family my friend at the tuc work out that if wage have rise in the last decade by the amount by which they rise between and the average worker in my constituency would be £ a week well off that be nearly grand a year more in people ’s pocket in the black country we work hard but force big than any individual deindustrialisation thatcherism and the cruel austerity of these last year mean that good folk there earn less and have few chance and few choice than people elsewhere 
 fully half of our kid grow up below the poverty line in infested b&b in home with damp drip down the wall or in flat make for but home to time that for many most week the money stretch just about until the week when it do not i want to turn the thought of those in this house to the young people in my constituency almost none of whom go to fee pay school in kid in my constituency do not get grade gcse in math and english last year that have to change and we will change it 
 as i stand here today the obstacle to deliver prosperity and more than that comfort security leisure to every worker and every family seem almost insurmountable but we take heart from our history from ernie bevin who forge the working class woman and man of the uk into an industrial machine that from a stand start equip our country for victory in my area those in saucepan factory make grenade   and car maker build the machine to defeat fascism that be a reminder that once we turn our mind to something the ingenuity and drive of the british working class can rarely be equal it be for we here to set   it free 
 i will always stand against decline and for progress after all i grow up in a world where people like i could not get marry but now our beloved daughter have both her mother name on her birth certificate to believe in progress be to believe that once again this country can work for work people it be time madam deputy speaker so my final word be to the people of our town tipton coseley wednesbury hateley heath i be here to serve you always 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent progress he have make on meet his target to have a carbon electricity system by 
 what recent progress he have make on meet his target to have a carbon electricity system by 
 in week this government have hit the ground run for our target by end the onshore wind ban in place for year under the conservative party consent to more nationally significant solar project than in year of the last government and oversee the most successful renewable auction in history compare with the conservatives disastrous auction round that crash offshore wind this be a government in a hurry to meet our mandate from the british people and we be just get start 
 i thank the secretary of state for his really rapid action to reach our sustainable goal by it have develop a real excitement in this country and the people i speak to are genuinely behind this action in stroud we be develop a community energy programme of put solar panel on every school and public building that agree to it what step be he take to support solar on school and public building and can he ensure there be no barrier to progress 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of both rooftop solar and ground mount solar i can tell he that as part of great british energy ’s plan we want to work with local school local hospital and indeed local leader to have a solar panel programme because this be a way to rapidly decarbonise and to save money off bill 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer cantonian high school in my constituency of cardiff west will be the cardiff school to be   operationally net in line with welsh government standard while the building work itself will feature a significant reduction in embody carbon fairwater community campus will be a collection of highly energy efficient building that be power from renewable energy source help cardiff to deliver on its planet strategy which outline the city ’s ambition to mitigate climate change will the secretary of state join i in celebrate the development and agree with i that this sort of collaborative vision be require to deliver on our net commitment both here and in wales 
 order just to help everybody the hon gentleman be mean to go through the chair but he be look at the secretary of state as good look as the secretary of state be it be easy if the hon gentleman speak to i and then i can pick up what he say 
 thank you very much mr speaker and you too if i may say so laughter 
 i congratulate my hon friend but particularly the fairwater community campus on the work it be do i think he highlight a very important issue by help to decarbonise public building include school we help not only to cut our carbon emission but crucially to save money for those school that they can then use for frontline service 
 the previous secretary of state commission the department to produce a full economic costing for get to a fully decarbonise renewable base grid by as the secretary of state want that be obviously the sort of information that should be place before the house so that we can have an informed discussion it may be a good thing to do but we should obviously know what the cost be when will the secretary of state publish that information 
 of course that work be ongoing in fact i think the right hon lady the shadow secretary of state have write i a letter about it and we will be announce our plan in due course 
 in my constituency major offshore wind farm be currently be develop morgan and morecambe i recently meet nearly farmer who will be directly affect by the cable corridor and the substation plan for the cabling route to connect to penwortham i be work with   the hon member for blackpool north and fleetwood lorraine beavers   on a potentially well route through her constituency which would mean a major economic development revitalise an industrial area that have be look for a major energy project for some time we be jointly write to the secretary of state and may i ask if he would commit to work with we on at least assess that potentially alternative route for the cabling corridor 
 the hon gentleman and he know this will obviously want to stand up for what he see as the good benefit for his constituency i will be cautious about what i say because there be proper procedure for planning decision include my quasi judicial role i will make this general point to the house because i   think this may well be a recur theme during question but if we want to get off the dangerous exposure to international fossil fuel market which we be leave with by the last government we need to build the grid every solar panel we put up every wind turbine we put up and every piece of grid we build will help to deliver energy security for the british people 
 i call the shadow minister 
 not only be the secretary of state a very good look fellow but we in this house all know that he be an incredibly hard work and very open minister as indeed be his whole team so i know that the reason he have not reply to my letter of   september   be that he and his team will be work their sock off to get a full and open answer to all my question he have already make reference to of my colleague and say that he will produce in due course a full system cost analysis may i stress that it be incredibly important that we in this house have that system cost analysis as soon as possible so that not only can we analyse his ambitious plan for carbon neutral target but we can also explain to our constituent exactly how much it will cost they in their bill to deliver his target 
 let i tell the hon gentleman a little about the situation that we inherit from the last government because it be very relevant obviously he be not a minister in that last government we inherit a situation where there be no plan no plan for their target of clean power by no plan for their target of clean power by and no plan to avoid a repeat of the bad cost of live crisis in generation this government be develop a plan and will publish it in due course 
 what step he be take with his international counterpart to tackle climate change 
 what step he be take with his international counterpart to tackle climate change 
 what step he be take with his international counterpart to tackle climate change 
 this government believe that we can only ensure climate security for further generation in the uk if we lead globally that be the message of the prime minister at the united nations general assembly with our world lead clean power plan no new oil and gas licence and play our part in reform the global financial system next month i will be attend the cop29 talk in azerbaijan to stand up for britain ’s interest 
 it be brilliant to see the secretary of state commit to put climate diplomacy back at the heart of cabinet and i know he will bring a great amount of experience to that role sir david attenborough   have repeatedly warn that our planet hang in the balance so will my right hon friend explain to the house what he will do to ensure that britain be once again a main player on the world stage in tackle the climate emergency will he meet i and representative from my constituency of paisley and renfrewshire south to discuss the work that they be do on rewilding in an effort to play their part in tackle the climate emergency 
 it sound like my hon friend ’s constituent be do important work she be absolutely right the last government use to say that we have only of global emission as if that be a sort of excuse for inaction on the world stage we see it differently we see that only by lead at home can we provide the platform to lead internationally this government have in a few short month put britian back on the world stage on climate and we will be work with our good endeavour to ensure that we tackle the situation we have inherit i be afraid the world be mile off track for keep global warming to ° 
 i call chris vince 
 thank you mr speaker i’ve do the training i welcome the secretary of state ’s warm word about our leadership on international climate issue which be in stark contrast to the previous government ’s failing i also publicly welcome his recent visit to harlow college less say about the racing game which he win the well do he agree that it be only thank to the commitment show by the new government to drastically deliver on climate change issue that we can lead on a world stage 
 neatly do although it be a little long come on secretary of state 
 my hon friend do very well and i agree with he part of the problem with the last government i do not doubt that there be people make good endeavour be that when we do something different at home to what we preach internationally such as say we be go to power past coal by open a new coalmine people say well you be say thing and do another consistency be the absolute foundation for global leadership 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s commitment to our international obligation whether that be clean power line or our own strong domestic climate policy that will help area such as rochdale with billpayer in recent year face the grim possibility of high bill this will make a huge difference and the obvious comparison with the previous government be there for everyone to see will he outline to the house what further step he be take on the global stage at both cop29 and cop30 to increase our global reach on climate 
 i will say thing in particular to my hon friend the prime minister say at the united nations general assembly that we will be unveil our nationally determine contribution our target for at cop29 we be do that because the danger be that the world settle into a low ambition equilibrium when   it come to tackle these issue by have a 1.5º align target we hope to set a good benchmark and a good example for the world 
 the climate change committee have say that there should be no more than a increase in airport capacity compare with level if we be to achieve net by yet current plan and recently approve airport expansion will allow for a to increase in demand can the secretary of state explain why ministers in the department for transport be consider give a green light to a runway at heathrow how on earth will that allow the country to meet its net target 
 the beauty of carbon budget and the system that be introduce when i be last in government to be fair it be carry on by the previous government of the past year be that they do at least in theory constrain what the government do it be very important that we take carbon budget seriously in our plan the plan we inherit from the last government be way off track for meet our carbon budget which be what this government will do 
 i very much welcome the secretary of state to his place climate change be real it be not a myth the quick that everyone understand that the well can i pose a question to the secretary of state on rewilde there be some suggestion among expert that rewilde by plant tree on moor and heather might not be the most constructive way of utilise rewilding have he have an opportunity to look at the issue of rewilde on moor and heather which i understand that many expert think be detrimental 
 i take the hon gentleman seriously on these issue and i undertake to write to he or to have of the ministers write to he i make the general point that rewilding and nature base solution be an essential part of tackle the climate crisis 
 international trade deal be a great way of use our leverage to make sure we advance our agenda on thing such as tackle climate change the previous government let britain down massively conduct trade deal that let we down on farming on food production and especially on climate change will the secretary of state ensure that this government use the creation of new trade deal to advance our agenda on tackle climate change 
 yes and that be something i be already discuss with my right hon friend the business secretary 
 i call the shadow minister 
 may i congratulate the secretary of state on his appointment of rachel kyte as his climate envoy to support his work with international partner before her appointment do the secretary of state declare to official her link with quadrature capital which donate £ to the labour party also do he declare her link to the green initiative foundation which give he £ a yes or no answer will suffice 
 all the proper process be follow by the foreign office which be in charge of the appointment i have to say that this be a very sad reflection on the conservative party rachel kyte be an esteemed person who be recognise for her leadership and all the conservatives can do be fle around baseless allegation 
 what step he be take to help increase level of onshore wind energy production 
 after year of the disastrous bill raise ban on onshore wind in england this government overturn the ban in our hour in office we have also set up the onshore wind taskforce to restore the pipeline of project destroy by the last government in the recent renewable auction almost gw of onshore wind be secure at price that make it among the low cost power source to build and operate 
 when will the secretary of state bring forward proposal for community benefit for those live alongside wind and solar farm to great incentivise the permitting of wind and solar farm include ham solar farm in my constituency will that include a minimum level of compensation for the community affect 
 i be sympathetic to what the hon gentleman say we be work on proposal on community benefit i believe that when community host clean energy infrastructure they should automatically get benefit from it i be also sympathetic to what he say about minimum level of support we be discuss that with industry at the moment and will come forward with proposal soon 
 what step he be take to improve energy security 
 the energy shock of recent year have lay bare the exposure of our energy system to the international fossil fuel market that be why we have start a mission to reach clean power by to end that reliance and ensure that the british people never again go through the sort of cost of living crisis that they have face in recent year under the conservatives 
 people across hendon have pay the price for the previous government ’s failure over the last year to invest in our energy system do the minister agree that the only way to get we off the rollercoaster of high bill be to invest at pace and scale as the government be do through our clean energy mission 
 i completely agree the only way to permanently protect hard work family and business from the high energy bill from which many be still   suffering be to get ourselves off our reliance on the volatile fossil fuel market that be why we be roll out at pace and at scale the clean power necessary to do so which not only give we energy security but create good job bring down bill and help we to tackle the climate crisis 
 the secretary of state will be aware that of the uk be situate on top of coalmine which can provide geothermal energy to heat house and business in place like ashfield will the minister meet i to discuss how we can make that work in coalfield community 
 i very much welcome the hon gentleman ’s question which i must say be somewhat of a surprise i will absolutely meet he to discuss that we have be clear that any technology can be part of the solution and if that can be part of the picture i will meet he to discuss the option and the technology more generally 
 of the way in which we can increase energy security be through community own and co operative energy scheme they give great control to local people who get a say in where profit go and crucially they build resilience from international energy market will the minister say a bit more about where community own energy will fit into the energy security plan 
 i thank my hon friend for that incredibly important question community energy have so many benefit in our energy mix include give community a stake in our energy future we also know that there be many social and economic benefit that come from that we be committed to our local power plan which will deliver investment in community own project great british energy will have a key role to play in support community capacity building and in that initial funding to help they deliver these project 
 could i invite the minister to meet a cross party group of mps from the east of england to discuss how the review conduct by the electricity system operator can contribute to energy security and in particular to look at how undergrounding high voltage direct current cable could be cheap in the long term than pylon and more efficient for achieve net will he agree at least to have a meeting with we on that basis 
 i be always happy to have meeting with any right hon and hon member across the house on a range of issue so i will take that away the evidence suggest that undergrounding be to time more expensive and that actually it can have more of a damaging impact on nature and natural habitat than pylon the important thing with all of this be that this be nationally important structure which be necessary for we to get to the target that we want to get to i know that the hon gentleman take that seriously and i will meet he and other but we have be clear as a government that we will build this infrastructure if it be necessary 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on job creation in industrial community 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on job creation in industrial community 
 the government have key mission to become an energy superpower and to grow the economy great british energy will help we deliver on both those mission the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks will be take the great british energy bill through committee today and i be excited for the job creation potential in our industrial community from engineer to welder and from electrician to project manager great british energy will be power by people across all the nation and region of this great country 
 i welcome the minister ’s response and last week ’s fantastic announcement about track carbon capture investment in teesside teesside have extraordinary potential for green job whether in sustainable aviation fuel with alfanar or in carbon capture hydrogen and so much else do the minister agree that only with labour ’s plan for clean power by great british energy and our national wealth fund can we create well pay long term job in the industry of the future 
 i agree with my hon friend and i thank he for his support i doubt anybody would disagree with he on the benefit of our announcement on carbon capture and storage which will create job in the short term with carbon capture more broadly create up to job over the next decade or so interruption the opposition front benchers chuckle but i wonder whether instead of dismiss that number of job they might welcome they alongside government member alongside carbon capture great british energy our national wealth fund and our british job bonus we be put in place the lever to encourage growth across our country and the climate change committee estimate that up to net new job could be create in low carbon sector by 
 do the minister agree that gb energy be a fantastic opportunity for wolverhampton north east to capitalise on the opportunity for research and start up on our forthcoming green innovation corridor and to put wolverhampton north east back where we belong at the heart of industrial growth and british industry 
 i agree with my hon friend it be a fantastic opportunity publicly own great british energy will partner with industry to help we to deliver our mission of clean power by i have be read about the green innovation corridor and i be interested to see what it will deliver work in partnership with the private sector we can rebuild job across the west midland and far beyond 
 do the minister agree with the head of the gmb union that the government ’s plan to ban new licence for oil and gas will result in export job and import virtue 
 i agree with the gmb in its warm congratulation for our announcement yesterday to deliver carbon capture and storage across the country we be of course work closely with our trade union colleague it be interesting in opposition the conservatives suddenly quote the union when they refuse to even meet they in government we work very closely with the gmb and all our trade union to ensure that we have a just energy transition and that we be create the job and skill of the future by become a clean energy superpower 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of introduce energy social tariff 
 we know that people be worried about their energy bill go into the winter and that for a grow number of people energy be simply unaffordable we be absolutely determined to take this affordability issue and tackle it head on there be many different idea about what a social tariff could look like and it mean different thing to different people we be clear that we will tackle the affordability question and look at the full range of option available to we but our priority my priority this winter be to ensure that family struggle with bill have support through our warm home discount scheme and to work with energy supplier to provide support 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her response i absolutely recognise that energy price over the last few year have escalate put particular pressure on household with low income and also those with high energy need such as disabled people and pensioner i agree that the warm home discount scheme be valuable but it be limited and i be concern for people with high energy need but on low income who might fall foul of the system as it stand 
 we have be work flat out with energy supplier to ensure that they be provide additional support to family who will struggle with bill this winter in august i meet all the supplier and there be a shared commitment to do everything we can to support vulnerable household we have be work with they the industry body ofgem and citizens advice to ensure that there be a proper package of support in place this winter so that we can support family who we know be struggle with their bill 
 would it not have be well to put that proper package of support in place before the government withdraw the winter fuel allowance from so many pensioner 
 we be have to clean up the mess that the opposition leave we yes we have mean test the winter fuel payment but we have also be clear that we will do everything we can do to support vulnerable household that be why we have extend the take up of pension credit and the household support fund and we be work flat out with energy supplier to provide additional support to all vulnerable household this winter 
 i thank the minister for her work warm home prescription can target that support towards elderly people and those with underlie health condition save our nhs as well as keep people warm over the winter the pilot have show real benefit will she meet i to discuss that and other option to keep old people warm this winter 
 we want to work with anyone who will help we reach vulnerable household i be very happy to meet my hon friend to look at the full range of option available 
 ofgem ’s review of standing charge option paper close for submission on   september can the minister offer any hope for bill payer in scotland that they will stop be penalise with the high standing charge on these island when will we see low charge 
 we as a government be commit to get down standing charge ofgem have consult and will report back in due course 
 what step he be take to introduce his warm home plan 
 what step he be take to introduce his warm home plan 
 what step he be take to introduce his warm home plan 
 we be run to deliver our warm home plan which will upgrade home across the country to make they warm and cheap to run we will set out the full plan in the spring but at the heart of it will be an offer of grant and low interest loan to support family to invest in insulation low carbon heating and home improvement critically alongside that we be commit to boost minimum energy efficiency standard for private rent home and social housing to tackle fuel poverty 
 i thank the minister for her answer and for her commitment to the warm home plan i congratulate she on the announcement over the conference recess to end the scandal of cold draughty home in the rental sector which particularly affect people in my constituency in town such as haltwhistle throckley newburn hexham and elsewhere do she agree that often the    very poor in our community be force to live in those cold and draughty property and it be important that we cut bill and give those family energy security 
 i agree in household in the private rent sector be in fuel poverty we need to bear down on bill our commitment to improve and boost minimum energy efficiency standard will lift renter out of fuel poverty we be determined to do this alongside our big package to deliver clean power by which will drive down bill for everyone 
 people across my constituency be worried about how they will afford to heat their home this winter i be shocked to hear the former energy minister now shadow minister admit that his government should have go far and fast on insulate home which will certainly help do the minister agree that this be an admission of failure by the previous conservative government who have leave work people to pay the price can she reassure my constituent that this government will do well 
 i completely agree the legacy leave to we by the last government be woeful ordinary people family across the country have pay the price of that legacy we be clear that we will do and must do well our warm home plan will kickstart the upgrade that we need across the country so that we can deliver warm home that be clean to heat 
 million of cold draughty home need update uk wide so it be great to hear that there will be a proper plan rather than the itty bitty approach of spray bit of money here and there in the plan will the minister look at the fact that there be no national retrofit advice service in the uk can the government rectify that they could take a leaf out of sadiq khan ’s book because his service in london have help household 
 i agree with my hon friend there be a critical role for national advice to ensure that people can access support and know the range of intervention available to they we will be look at that as we look at our warm home plan we be very clear that it will be a comprehensive plan that will deliver the upgrade we need to see across the country 
 of my low income pensioner constituent have a solar panel instal on their home through a government scheme however they be now face an issue with bird nest in it which be cause a huge amount of problem because the scheme do not come with protection will the minister agree to meet i about this constituency issue because it be really affect of my old constituent who sadly have also just lose her winter fuel payment 
 yes i will agree to meet to discuss the range of thing we can do 
 i very much hope the secretary of state and his ministers agree that if we be serious about energy security and net we must be serious about energy efficiency what step be they take in addition to work on insulate exist home to ensure that the promise    new home be build to net standard have solar panel on the roof and be fully insulate so that every new home be a warm home 
 we have an ambitious plan to build more home we want those home to be fit for the future we will put out information in due course on the standard we want across those home but we have an opportunity to do insulation energy efficiency and home that be fit for the future at the same time as build the home we need 
 local authority play an important role as trust source of knowledge and expertise and guide householder for example to trusted installer but they need the resource to do that will the department devolve some resource to local authority to fulfil that important role 
 we see local and regional government play an absolutely fundamental role to reach home that we need to upgrade but also to help we deliver the scale of ambition we want local and regional government will be a key part of our warm home plan 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 keep vulnerable people warm and lower their energy bill be i be sure something we can all agree on across the house insulate home be a key part of that puzzle we welcome the news that we will see the warm home plan in spring however do the minister agree that ahead of this winter we need an emergency home insulation plan particularly for the vulnerable along with allocate funding do she have any idea of the amount and allocation of funding in this parliament that there will be for insulate home 
 we be really clear that as we develop our plan we absolutely need to get on with the job of upgrade home we have announce our warm home local grant and our warm home social housing fund which be target at low income family because we know there be a job of work to do we be commit to an additional £ to invest in our warm home plan over the course of this parliament 
 what step he be take to ensure a just transition for worker in high carbon sector 
 we be committed to accelerate the just transition for worker in britain to boost our energy security and ensure good long term job especially in north sea community we will work with they and other industrial region to develop a plan ensure those worker be the people who decarbonise our country 
 i thank the minister for her response unfortunately the unjust transition we be see in grangemouth and port talbot be a damn indictment of the lack of a proactive approach to a just transition   over the last few year tomorrow at the treasury over major union and climate group will be call for a new approach to the energy transition where instead of just de risking private profit there be a governmental ringfence funding package for north sea oil and gas worker include help with skill and job creation will the secretary of state or ministers please meet the chancellor of the exchequer to ensure that those ringfenced fund be secure so that we can stop bet on the industry to do the right thing 
 last week be the historic week when year of coal fire electricity generation come to an end and this week we have announce the new era of carbon capture and storage we will work in a different way from the last government adopt a proactive approach to ensure that the transition work for people and that we create new job as well at grangemouth we provide a package of support for worker and at port talbot we manage to negotiate a well deal than the last government we will use all the lever that we have great british energy the national wealth fund the british job bonus and the office of green energy job that we have set up to ensure that we get the transition right 
 the secretary of state and the minister will know that civil nuclear have a high employment multipli than any other form of or low carbon energy generation as part of the transition from high carbon sector what specific measure be the government take to retrain worker and transfer skill into the nuclear energy industry thus ensure that they benefit from job creation in this grow sector in my constituency and throughout the country 
 obviously the last government do nothing about nuclear in year apart from come up with a plan we will ensure that nuclear be an important part of our country ’s future and we will be work to provide the right skill and job in the right place to deliver that 
 what step he be take to increase grid capacity 
 we be halve the development time for new transmission infrastructure through reform of planning supply chain and other area deliver the grid capacity that be need to achieve clean power by and meet a doubling of electricity demand by 
 community be do their very good and lot of people be try to help each community to power itself my own village have its community solar project which be fully fund by local resident there be non profit organisation which have deal with local scheme by put solar panel on school with an element of community ownership and there be individual who try but be face with extortionate cost for connection to the grid the grid be really design for big old power station rather than small power creator try to plonk power into the system what can the minister   do to encourage national grid to pivot and help community and individual to create their energy nearer to their home 
 the hon lady be right to draw attention to the importance of community energy project throughout the country we want to see many more of they but we have inherit a grid that need significant upgrading and we be now work apace to ensure that that happen part of the work that i have be do with national grid and other involve try to identify the next step that be need to shorten the connection queue and also to make it more affordable for small community project to connect there be an important role for partnership as well with some of the big renewable project give part of their connection queue to small one and that be already happen in some part of the country there be no doubt that there be much more to do but we be as i have say work apace to try to move this forward after year of inaction 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as we have hear from my hon friend   the member for wells and mendip hills tessa munt the lack of national grid capacity be hold back the uk ’s push towards renewable energy there be numerous example of project that have be delay because they be wait to be connect to the national grid or because connection be too expensive in my constituency we can not even connect the solar panel and battery for the ambitious plan to decarbonise and electrify the refuse fleet for south cambridgeshire district council the project that have be delay include the building of new home which be crucial at present can the minister explain to we how we be to reach this stage on the scale and at the pace that be need 
 the hon lady be right to highlight those issue the connection queue in particular be a huge challenge with more than gw wait to join it the last government do some work to establish how the queue could be prioritise and we will now implement that but we need to go far it be clear that by we will need to build time as much new transmission network as have be build since this be a project to rewire the entire country to improve the current connection availability and to work with everyone include the new national energy system operator on the road map towards 
 what step his department be take to increase clean electricity generation 
 the late contract for difference round secure a record renewable electricity project across great britain this will deliver a total capacity of gw enough to power the equivalent of home the energy secretary will continue to work with industry to explore how the contract for difference scheme and other energy policy can be expand even far 
 i commend the secretary of state for his excellent work since he take office in accelerate clean electricity generation in the uk and i commend the fantastic team he have with he the minister be right to say that there be a clean energy imperative if we be to tackle the climate crisis boost our energy security and reduce our bill what step have the minister take to ensure that this government encourage and take advantage of the significant opportunity around community energy and will he meet i and representative from my constituency of sheffield central to discuss how we can boost the growth of community energy 
 i thank my hon friend for her question she be absolutely right to say that in order   for we to meet our ambition we will need a whole range of different option community energy be a critical part of that help to deliver energy security and low bill crucially it also give community a stake in the energy future that be why of great british energy ’s objective be to support the delivery of a local power plan which put local community combine authority local authority and other in the drive seat in restructure our energy economy i be happy to meet my hon friend and other to discuss this issue far 
 contrary to what of the ministers say early the last government bring about of the large revival in nuclear energy in year in order to provide clean electricity generation yet we hear precious little from the new government on their plan for nuclear we hear only their plan for inefficient technology that will destroy the countryside why be they so anti nuclear and when be they go to get on with deliver nuclear energy 
 i will give credit to the conservative government on thing they be very good at make grand announcement on delivery however they be much poor look at a whole range of thing carbon capture be a very good example they have lot of warm word but no delivery whatsoever on nuclear they have lot of warm word but no delivery whatsoever in year how many nuclear power station be build under the conservative party none we will get on with do the work 
 if we want to see an increase in clean energy generation we need more announcement such as the we see last week on the development of carbon capture usage and storage although that be incredibly welcome and a sign of determined action from the new government there be still more to be do perhaps the minister can give an indication of when he anticipate he will be able to announce progress on track extension and share some information on track because that would secure thousand of job in the humber region 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to say that in the and a bit month that we have be in government we have move at pace to deliver the large renewable auction in history and to make last week ’s announcement on carbon capture we be   work through the next stage of the process at pace and we will have further announcement in the week ahead 
 do the minister agree that it would be well to have the right electricity system in or than to have the wrong because of an artificial target which may be undeliverable by 
 i could be wrong but i think the right hon gentleman previously say that his own government ’s plan on onshore wind in england be not the right approach to take i agree with he which be why we lift the onshore wind ban the reality be that whereas the previous government use to talk the talk on climate action we be the one now deliver and deliver an energy system fit for the future 
 i call the shadow minister 
 way to increase clean electricity generation in the united kingdom would be to invest at pace in new nuclear we leave government with a clear plan to get to gw of nuclear power by do that target remain 
 this be the whole point about the conservative government and it be why we have inherit such an economic mess they make a series of announcement with absolutely no funding to back they up as you would expect mr speaker i pay close attention to the conservative party conference and the hon gentleman make a very astute point which i be happy to repeat for the benefit of hansard and the house after year of conservative government we be now in a position where it ’ more difficult to build critical infrastructure than it be when we come into power i could not have put it well myself 
 our record on nuclear speak for itself we launch the small modular down selection process and great british nuclear and invest £ in new advanced nuclear fuel we consult on a new route to market for advanced modular reactor and new technology and grant a development consent order for sizewell c. there be concern that there be a go slow in the government right now so when can we expect a final investment decision on sizewell c will it still   be this year 
 i be not aware when my right hon friend the secretary of state change the title of the ministerial portfolio that we have move away from have a minister for consultation but it seem that all the hon gentleman be do in his time in office be launch consultation we be go to get on with deliver and we be move at pace on the whole of the electricity system include on nuclear and deliver on the thing that he fail to do 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 as well as our measure on onshore wind solar and renewable this government have begin legislate for great british energy and set out our plan for proper standard for private and social renter to take family out of fuel poverty and on friday we announce deal to kick start britain ’s carbon capture industry all of this will deliver our mission to make britain a clean energy superpower it be right for bill right for energy security right for job and right for climate leadership 
 i welcome the action outline by my right hon friend particularly the recent announcement that gb energy will be headquarter in aberdeen with satellite office in edinburgh and glasgow can he outline the role that he expect the satellite office to take give the investment already under way in the port of leith for a number of renewable company as well as the prospect for the supply chain and manufacturing will he consider leith as the location for the edinburgh site 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to our announcement on aberdeen as the headquarters of great british energy and the important role that it will play and also to the importance of the satellite office i know from my visit to her constituency of the huge potential of her area on these issue and we want to drive job throughout the supply chain through great british energy 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the secretary of state promise in the general election to cut everyone ’s bill by £ by a pledge he will not repeat now that he be in office in fact of his act have be to snatch the same amount away from million of pensioner in poverty the right hon gentleman like to preach to politicise and dare i say it to patronise but i have simple question for he to the million of pensioner who be worried about their heating bill this christmas will he apologise 
 the people who should be apologise be the last government who leave this country in a total mess a £ black hole i have to say to the right hon lady that she do have a brass neck she say   of   the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch whom she be back in the leadership contest that she tell the truth and what do the right hon member for north west essex say she say 
 i have people in my constituency tell i that they do not need the winter fuel payment why do we not have a mechanism for mean testing 
 that be her position 
 there we have it no apology no recognition that it be the right hon gentleman ’s government ’s decision that be go to leave pensioner in the cold this winter he have to acknowledge this from the trade union to the cbi from blue labour to blairites and from the left to the right of his party people be sound the alarm that his ideological approach will see job lose and bill go through the roof even his old pal ed balls do not think that gb energy be go   to deliver the green transition and i read this morning that the prime minister ’s brand new chief of staff be a sceptic of the secretary of state ’s approach the secretary of state be increasingly isolate in his party so when will he do the decent thing and set out the full system cost of his approach so that the british public can see what he be go to do to their bill 
 oh dear oh dear the truth be that after month of this government people have breathe a sigh of relief that there be finally a government with a plan for the country interruption i think the right hon lady should listen to what her own ministerial team have be say about she the former network minister have say that their infrastructure approach be hopeless the former energy minister say that the onshore wind ban be always mad and lord callanan say that the right hon lady have kick the solar consent into the long grass if i be she i would be hop for just thing from the next tory leader a shadow cabinet reshuffle 
 grid capacity and the slow speed of new connection be a major issue in west london it be hold back house building and it be hold back business exciting new green business such as allye energy in my constituency the conservatives do absolutely nothing in year to tackle the issue what be my right hon friend ’s strategy and will he meet i and local business to discuss how we can tackle this issue together and meet our mission around growth and good clean energy 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to say that that issue be hold back project across the country which be why we have tackle it from day we be attempt to release network capacity which can then be reallocate to accelerate the connection of viable project there be a lot of work to do and we be build on what the previous government do to prioritise the queue and to build the necessary infrastructure that should have be build over the past year 
 do the secretary of state accept that the only way we will both meet our net target and keep energy bill down be by press ahead with a new generation of nuclear power station will he therefore accelerate exist project such as hinkley point and sizewell c and press ahead with small modular reactor and advanced modular reactor technology 
 i agree with the right hon gentleman nuclear be an essential part of the energy mix we be mainly go to have a renewable system but nuclear be an essential accompaniment i fully support all the project he mention 
 the previous minister of state for energy security and net have admit that the last government could have go far and fast on insulate home but say that he would wait to see how the new government tackle the issue when it come to insulate million   more home across the country and reduce bill for million of family will we simply take a wait and see approach 
 whether it be our ending of the onshore wind ban the ccus funding we announce last week our plan for great british energy or our warm home plan we be hit the ground run to deliver our clean power mission the conservatives spend year dither and delaying leave ordinary people to pay the price but we will get on with the job of deliver energy security so that we can secure financial security for family good job and climate action 
 to achieve net we will need widespread micro generation alongside large scale project however as a local farmer who want to install an anaerobic digester tell i grid connection be both costly and subject to long delay what do the secretary of state plan to do to address these issue particularly in rural area such as my thornbury and yate constituency 
 the hon lady raise a question about the problem of grid connection that be familiar to many member we be build on work do by nick winser the former electricity network commissioner and we want to go far to tackle the problem of grid connection once and for all 
 the great turbine of the rampion wind farm be off my beautiful coastal constituency although the uk have do well on offshore generation the job in this sector have not always be here in the uk what plan do the government have to expand offshore wind and to ensure that uk worker and supply chain benefit from that expansion 
 my hon friend ask an important question of course we and the opposition have fundamentally different view we believe in an industrial strategy that will help to deliver our supply chain we believe in great british energy and we believe in a sovereign wealth fund which so many other country have and the previous government fail to deliver we will make sure we have resilient supply chain that create job deliver energy security and maximise the economic benefit of the transition 
 what guarantee can the secretary of state give to steelworker in scunthorpe that the grid connection require for a new electric arc furnace will be ready on time next year 
 the hon gentleman raise a very important issue that i be afraid be not solve by the last government we be work at pace with national grid and i be sure the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks will be happy to talk to he far about the work we be do 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment to increase renewable energy generation an important component of that be the development of associated infrastructure include battery storage facility such as those propose in cullingworth in my constituency how do the government plan to ensure that the safety of resident be not put at risk by such development and that there be clear community benefit from any renewable energy plan and the associate infrastructure 
 battery will play an important part in the short duration storage require for the energy system we be build for the future it be a question of balance community will be engage in the consultation process and i will be convene a roundtable with provider of battery technology and other short duration storage in the next few month to learn both from project that have work well and from project on which we could do well in future i will happily share any information from that with my hon friend 
 will the secretary of state commit to ensure that large energy supplier work with community energy organisation to generate and sell electricity locally at discount rate and provide fair community benefit as propose by the liberal democrats 
 the hon lady raise the important issue that as a country we be massively underpowered on community energy as part of the gb energy local power plan we will be try to change that learn from country such as germany and denmark which do much well than we we will certainly look at the issue she raise 
 the clean power by mission show the clear intention of this government to get on with the just transition energy worker in falkirk grangemouth and across the central belt be rightly concerned about job between and under the previous government job in the uk oil and gas sector halve unfortunately some of the opposition party have oppose the stream of funding for clean infrastructure and job of the future that will come from an increase in the energy profit levy on the record profit of oil and gas giant do the secretary of state agree that it be time opposition party start put their own plan forward on how they would get on with the just transition and deliver clean energy job at a critical time for worker and the climate 
 my hon friend raise the important issue that what will define the future for north sea worker be whether there be a plan for future job in offshore wind carbon capture and hydrogen there be no plan from the previous government this government be absolutely determined to ensure a just transition for those worker use the power of government and a proper industrial policy to make it happen 
 on petrol price for the past year the government freeze fuel duty they cut it in and then froze it again the government instruct the competition and markets authority to carry out a review and we   come up with the pumpwatch scheme a consultation be undertake in january but when i write to the government in september to ask about its result they say they be look at it and would consider it in due course be the scheme a priority for the government if not in what other way will they ensure petrol price be keep low at the pump be they go to freeze fuel duty 
 i will not comment on the budget obviously we be very sympathetic to pumpwatch it be important that there be a fair deal for consumer at the pump 
 exeter city council have work hard to install solar panel on council home to ensure that social tenant can benefit from low bill and participate in the green transition can the minister set out what more we can do to ensure that all tenant benefit from new green technology 
 my hon friend raise such an important issue across the house we can have different view on ground mount solar but we need to do more on rooftop and to ensure that tenant for example council tenant benefit from such technology that be a huge priority for we and we be work on it with colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government 
 what discussion have the secretary of state have with the scottish government regard the major planning application for an offshore wind farm between scotland and northern ireland which may well have significant implication for the giant ’s causeway world heritage site 
 the hon gentleman will understand that i have to be careful in what i say about planning issue but he should rest assure that i have frequent conversation with my counterpart in the scottish government and no doubt that be issue we will be discuss 
 warwick and leamington must be of the sunny place in the united kingdom give the flurry of application we have have for solar farm there be a loss of amenity cause by application but if that community be prepared to welcome onshore wind turbine of which we have none in warwickshire rather than a solar farm would the secretary of state or the minister agree to support that will they meet i to discuss the issue 
 every planning application and development consent order be assess on its merit importantly the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my right hon friend   the member for streatham and croydon north steve reed be polish a land use framework which have long be need in this country it will set out the balance between food security the use of renewable energy the restoration of nature and the role of farming i hope that will help with some of the issue that hon member be face 
 the secretary of state and the under secretary of state   the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks have speak passionately about the need to upgrade the national grid but do they recognise the concern of people across the east of england include in the witham constituency about what that mean for their local community the under secretary have say that he will meet members of parliament but i ask he very politely whether he and representative and ministers from the department will also meet member of the community that be affect by this matter 
 i know from the question that i have receive from the opposition that the right hon lady have be a tireless advocate on these issue i do understand the concern of local community about clean energy infrastructure which be why i be so keen on the idea of community benefit it be important that community receive benefit for host that infrastructure we must have a discussion about this matter in the house and across the country if we be to end our exposure to international fossil fuel and the kind of the cost of living crisis that we have see over the past few year which have devastate community across britain this infrastructure do need to be build 
 last week ’s announcement on carbon capture and hydrogen in my constituency demonstrate that we now have a government of substance not of hollow slogan what discussion have the secretary of state and ministers have with the trade union to ensure that we build those facility with unionised labour 
 i thank my hon friend for his question after year of failure and inaction we now have a government who believe in work with our trade union who have the backing of our trade union and who want to work to create good job in the industry of the future our announcement on carbon capture which be groundbreake and world beat will deliver just that 
 the institution of civil engineers have call for a spatial energy plan to utilise new and emerge technology to facilitate future net infrastructure planning will the government look to bring forward a spatial energy plan and meet i to discuss that 
 yes we will be bring forward a spatial energy plan that be of the responsibility of the national energy system operator the hon gentleman make an important point we need a plan for the system we can have a plan for the system do by the neso and indeed a wide strategic spatial energy plan which will be crucial for the country 
 the warm home plan be excellent and much need in town such as mine but on warm home grant for insulation during recess i meet a large number of constituent who have be victim of fail insulation and cowboy workmanship under such government scheme some be live in horrific condition with useless warranty be the minister    aware of their plight will she ensure that regulation be strong enough and will she meet i and victim to make sure that this never happen again 
 i thank my hon friend for his question we be aware of those case of bad insulation and we be clear that we need to get a firm grip on they to persuade everyone that we should be insulate and upgrade all of our home we need the high standard possible i agree to meet he to discuss this matter far 
 in my constituency a new solar farm at barkham be be deliver that will provide clean energy for more than home and provide a funding boost for wokingham borough council it will be connect in but there be concern    that connection to the grid could be delay by year what step will the minister take to reduce similar delay and do he think that the government can meet their net target if the new renewable energy infrastructure can not be quickly connect to the grid 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question a similar point have be raise by many hon member across the house this issue affect area right across the country we be do what we can at the moment to prioritise the connection queue so that the most important project or those most able to be deliver can move forward there be much more that we can do on that but fundamentally we need to build much more network infrastructure in the place so that we can speed up and reduce the cost of these connection for scheme such as the he mention 
 on a point of order mr speaker i be concerned that the government have not always be consistent with the explanation that they have give of their policy in relation to arm export to israel in particular some of the explanation that minister have give in this house be inconsistent with account that have be give elsewhere include in the other place my noble friend lord howard be also pursue this matter in the other place this be a critical foreign policy matter involve a close ally mr speaker have you have any indication that the foreign secretary intend to come to the house to make a statement on this matter and to clear up any misunderstanding that might have arise as a result of discrepancy between what we have be tell and what ministers have say elsewhere 
 i be grateful to the right hon member for give notice of that point of order as he well know the chair be not responsible for the accuracy of ministerial remark either in this house or elsewhere but i be sure that those on the treasury bench will have note his comment and i be sure they have be take on board i do not think we have hear the end of this yet so i be sure as i know the right hon member well that the opposition will not give up at this stage 
 i beg to move 
 that this house regret that the government have decide to impose vat on independent school fee believe that educational provision should not be tax regret that the government be rush to implement this change part way through an academic year call on the government to exempt from the vat charge fee pay in respect of child of military and diplomatic family all child who have an education health and care plan or who be in the process of apply for all child on sen support centre for advanced training and school in the music and dance scheme all child at school whose fee be low than the average per capita funding for a state school place and child at religious school of denomination for whom there be no faith school provision in the state sector further call on the government to postpone imposition of the vat charge for school in area where state school in the relevant key stage be already on average over full also call on the government to postpone imposition of the vat charge for fee pay in respect of child who have start a public examination course to september for pupil currently in year or year and to september for pupil currently in year or year and call on the government to publish a full impact assessment of the effect   of this policy on independent school and the state sector ahead of the budget 
 there be day to go until the introduction of labour ’s education tax and we be still in the dark many question remain for parent for child and for school when i say school that be both independent school and state school and also for the local authority that be responsible for special educational need provision and generally for ensure that everyone can get a place at school 
 this be a huge change which be be make in a headlong rush there be big worry about child with special educational need or a disability about military family about the talented musician and dancer of tomorrow about small religious faith and about the wide impact of all that on state school because this mean disruption big class budget overstretch and ultimately parent be less likely to get their preferred choice of school even those who do not necessarily object to this in principle be say it can not be push through this fast from the chartered institute of taxation to the nasuwt 
 it be a long stand principle that you do not put tax on learn a principle all but universally observe around the world on the conservative benches we believe in that principle and we believe in the sanctity of parental choice the vast majority of child of course go to state fund school and we defend the right of parent to choose those school and defend the diversity of those school a small number of parent choose home schooling we defend that right too and yes some choose the independent sector 
 parent be the educator of their child the state set an expectation of a suitable education for all child and beyond that parent should make the choice of what be good for their child parent might decide to opt out of state education for any or   many of several reason quite often simply because they have find the school that they believe be right for their child and where their child be most happy 
 rise 
 rise 
 i be spoil for choice i give way to my right hon friend 
 during the election in the monks walk pub i meet a constituent who have stay in his small home and have car for the family because they decide their bully daughter need to go to another school they have sacrifice with the support of wide family so that that child with special educational need can go to a private school it be child and family like that who will be the victim of this spiteful policy do my right hon friend agree 
 my right hon friend be right to identify that many parent make great personal financial sacrifice to do what they believe be good for their child some parent whose child go to independent school be rich and some be definitely not i include in that latter bracket most of the parent send their child for example to small religious school in hackney salford or birmingham very many more be in the middle include many professional work in our public service 
 the shadow minister have rightly underline the issue for those who send their child to faith school or independent school many constituent in strangford have tell i that they have save and persevere have not be on holiday have not buy a car or have even continue to use their old car long than they should so that those money can go into their child ’s education do he like i find it impossible to understand how it can be that it be the labour party the party of conscience i would say that have let we down on this issue and be go to penalise people who be hard pressed to find education for their child 
 the hon gentleman be right about the financial sacrifice some make let we be clear it be possible to tax wealthy people or people with a high income more but the government should be honest about it the way to do so be through the income tax system not through a choice that people make to have their child in an independent school the hon gentleman do not mention this but i might add that because the situation in northern ireland be different from that in england by the way the situation in scotland be different too the government need to think carefully about how the policy be apply throughout the whole united kingdom because vat be a reserved matter and about what it mean for the hon gentleman ’s constituent and other across these island 
 my late mother and dad use to run a pub and they pay their taxis it be a private business that make a profit why should these business not pay their taxis why should they not pay what be owe 
 this be a completely different situation independent school do pay tax 
 indicate dissent 
 no independent school do pay tax on supply no tax be charge on education whether in an independent school or in other setting and that be a very long stand principle 
 let i clear up very important definitional point which i ask colleague to reflect on there be no tax break involve it would be a tax break if a person who have a child at an independent school and be not take a place at a state school be charge less tax as a result that do not happen in the united kingdom everybody contribute to state sector education whether or not they take up a place 
 the principle of no tax on learn be a fast and once we loosen it we do not know where we will go where might the treasury look next private nursery perhaps music lesson private tutoring what be the philosophical difference between independent school education and private tutoring 
 let i make a point to demonstrate how rush and ill thought through this policy be my understanding be that if a child in a nursery have turn but the other child in the class have not all the parent in that nursery year will have to pay vat on their child ’s nursery fee that be how badly this have be think through 
 my hon friend be right that come from the rush nature of the legislation the sloppy drafting mean that child who be not of school age get drag into this tax if they happen to be in the same room as child who be and there be concern about what might follow in other borderline case 
 the government claim that the policy be about revenue not politic but have read the secretary of state ’s twittering i think hon member could be forgive for mistake the motivation it be entirely spurious for multiple reason to link this tax to teacher mental health support or anything else the money will go into general exchequer receipt and anyway teacher be not that many in the scheme of thing give the there be now that be a compound growth rate of over year and by the way a lot few teacher than we recruit in the last year mental health support team be already be roll out and they cover primary school as well as secondary school it be not clear what the difference be in the new government ’s policy on mental health support other than that it will not include primary school 
 to the extent that the vat revenue could be hypothecate it look a lot more like that revenue would reduce cut to education resourcing rather than increase it if the policy be about revenue not politic the government could easily commit to simple thing today they be confident they tell we that the policy will raise a large sum of money and not create large cost will they commit to measure and report back on that and if it turn out against expectation that they be wrong will they reverse it 
 i thank my right hon friend who be give an excellent introduction to the debate be it his understanding that our military personnel and those serve in our diplomatic service will also be hit by this tax 
 my hon friend be absolutely right as thing stand those who get the continuity of education allowance would be hit in part by the tax 
 in the calculus that my right hon friend rightly ask the government to publish can we include the foreign receipt that the independent sector generate the roll of a school in my constituency include a very large number of child from overseas whose parent pay directly into the uk economy that school be now under threat the loss of that revenue will be substantial and the local impact huge may we have that factor in give that so far we have not see any figure on the loss of money and reputation that the closure of many such school will entail 
 my right hon friend be correct substantial export earning come from the sector and from a globally mobile set of family but i would go far in addition to the direct export earning effect there be also an indirect effect for company decide where to site their european headquarters english education be a big factor that be partly because of our brilliant state school which have improve so much over the past year but the availability of independent school be also a factor 
 the shadow secretary of state make a strong point about the sanctity of rating vat for education i be concerned that child ’s clothe which be currently exempt from vat may be the next target notwithstanding the impact that the change to vat will have on individual family do he agree that private and prep school my constituency have be enormous employer of people involve in build maintenance such as electrician and plumber and that the impact on the wide economy could well be profound 
 order i remind member to look towards the chair when they be speak or what they say will not be pick up by the mic i then struggle to hear they i know that the minister be struggle as well if member keep the chatter down it will help we both 
 my right hon friend be of course correct about the economic contribution that school make locally and the large number of people they employ that point be also make by nasuwt which be worried about teacher be inadvertently push out of the profession if redundancy be make mid way through the school year 
 my youngster have have a mix of excellent learning include in nursery and in state education as have youngster in many family i have a personal and constituency interest in want all education setting to thrive so i agree with my right hon friend the economic and employment impact of this new tax will be devastating for bus driver and maintenance team it will impact on so many livelihood and community the people pick up the unknown impact will be   in the state sector the policy will just deliver more of the unknown 
 my hon friend make a very good point 
 rise 
 i will take more intervention before make progress so as not to try your patience too much mr speaker 
 it be not that my patience be be test but i do worry when shadow secretaries of states cover a subject at length i understand but we need to get on because lot of back benchers be desperate to get in in fact we have a very eager opposition whip come in now 
 you will find out mr speaker that i will not test your patience i want to take my right hon friend back to the point he make about the education secretary ’s tweet which i think be disgraceful hon member where be she the divisive language behind that tweet be a disgrace give the many independent school that work hard and play by the rule do my right hon friend agree that the embossed notepaper that the secretary of state focus on be send to many child who be be sponsor through bursary or scholarship and whose parent work hard to give their child the good education the education secretary should apologise for that disgraceful tweet 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who as ever make important point i too be disappoint that the education secretary be not with we for this important debate i will make progress mr speaker because i do not want to go on long than i should 
 to be clear we want to talk and foremost not about revenue but about education school and child all child interruption no i have be talk about school and child throughout if the government insist on plough on with this divisive policy they must at least exempt certain group of child for whom it would be especially unjust or counterproductive to impose this tax surely school that charge the same as or even less than the average cost of a school place be not in the government ’s sight when they devise this scheme there be small religious group that have no state sector provision for their denomination why should they be disadvantage the continuity of education allowance exist expressly to support family who be serve our nation in the armed force surely they should be protect 
 the government acknowledge the role of centre of advanced training and perform art school that come under the music and dance scheme because again there be no equivalent specialist schooling available in the state sector then there be the many child who receive special educational need support include those with an education health and care plan whether or not they be at the school name in the plan and those child who be apply for a plan 
 rise 
 i ask my hon friend to forgive i as i must make progress 
 as for child whose parent be price out of a school or face its closure disruption to learn can be difficult at any time but it be even more problematic when pupil have start a public examination course their next school might not even offer the subject that they be take or the exam might not be mark by the same exam board we need to think about those child the tax levy should be postpone until pupil who be now in year or or in the low and upper form have finish their exam until or 
 the wide impact of all will be feel by state school minister have say repeatedly that there be no problem because there be plenty of space in state school we have repeatedly point out that that be of no help at all if those place be in the wrong place or the wrong year group they need to be where and for whom they be require 
 state school in my constituency be burst at the seam there be no spare space to move into for the more than child be educate in independent school there the fee charge by those independent school be a quarter to half of the cost of state school provision per pupil 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman 
 in buckinghamshire we do not have the place we have a lot of child in special education need and disability school faith school and other private school we can not cope with the capacity loss we have parent who be sacrifice everything to send their child to a send school there be no provision in the county for they the policy will result in a crisis   of transportation and place and child will suffer as a result 
 i be grateful to both my hon friend and   the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed   for their intervention indeed there be many place particularly at secondary school level where there be insufficient space available to accommodate a significant minority be displace from independent school place such as bristol and bedford salford and richmond worcester and wycombe and bury north and bolton north east 
 let we be clear local authority have a duty to find space for child they take that duty very seriously and a number of they be considerably worried about what may happen in year admission can be especially complicated in any case they can involve not only governor but the fair access protocol panel and ultimately a secretary of state direction all of which can add up to month out of school create additional physical space in school obviously take time and build new school take long still time be need to adjust which be why our motion far call on the government to 
 postpone imposition of the vat charge for school in area where state school in the relevant key stage be already on average 
 almost full 
 this government barely have their foot under the table and already they be a government in chaos that chaos be exemplify by this destructive disruptive and divisive education tax that will interrupt learning create place demand where it can not be accommodate put far strain on the send system hit specific group that we ought to be try to protect likely generate much low revenue than anticipate and quite possibly even end up as a net cost to the public purse in their headlong rush to make a political statement the government appear simply to not have think through the consequence we call on they now to announce immediately that they be abandon the unrealistic january implementation date to publish a proper impact assessment and then to entirely rethink this entirely counterproductive tax
