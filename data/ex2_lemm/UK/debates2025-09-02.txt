i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests i want to raise a few issue all of which i know be very much on my constituent mind 
 i want to emphasise the importance of ensure that borough such as reigate and banstead which have be manage well and be not load with debt be not leave foot the bill for the failure of other council that have be less prudent with their finance reigate and banstead borough council have a commendably strong record of financial prudence so please will the secretary of state reassure my constituent that protection will be put in place to safeguard our community asset such as the harlequin theatre and our community and leisure centre 
 on the harlequin theatre specifically i emphasise how important the asset be to the people of redhill and beyond it have now be close for more than year follow the discovery of raac and resident and community group notably the harlequin support group have be resolutely campaign for its repair and reopening i be delighted that under the leadership of councillor shelly newton who be of the most tenacious local councillor i have ever come across it have now be confirm that the £ need for repair have be allocate all be well the theatre be expect to reopen by christmas i mention that because my constituent would appreciate hear directly from the secretary of state and ministers that the local government reorganisation will not hamper such project which have be agree but will take some time to complete 
 i also make the point that the reorganisation be not the only challenge face by reigate and banstead borough council which have just have its housing target more than double by this government at a time of great uncertainty and transition a recipe for disaster 
 i want to focus mainly however on the future of the civic mayoralty in reigate and banstead reigate have have a mayor since great history and tradition be associate with the role and the importance place on it can be see physically in the mayoral robe the chain of office and the mace which be still very much in use the government have be clear that their intention with the bill be to provide a consistent model for how local government will be structure across england what be rather less clear i hope that the minister or secretary of state will be able to provide clarity be what that mean for borough such as mine where a borough council be intermeshe with a long stand tradition of civic leadership in the form of a borough mayor 
 unlike metro mayor the mayor of the borough of reigate and banstead be no kind of political executive the role be that of a civic figurehead non partisan ceremonial and community focus we have a truly outstanding mayor councillor rich michalowski and before he councillor eddie hughes be another dedicated and hard work public servant in the past civic year alone the mayor respond to more than engagement request host town hall tour for school and community group and oversee civic and charity event attend by nearly people not include the thousand more who attend remembrance sunday   the position of borough mayor do real practical good their attendance at an event bring that extra sparkle which resident so appreciate 
 through the mayor ’s trust fund family in my constituency have already be support with grant this year a single funding workshop lead by the mayor ’s team unlock more than £ for local charity through sustained community engagement the mayor help connect employer with jobseeker donor with good cause and school with mentor they promote local artist support care home champion the armed force covenant and offer practical help to resident in crisis i hope that ministers will agree with my constituent in recognise the great value of a borough mayor and that they will provide clarity on whether such role will be preserve under the bill and if so how in practical term that will be achieve 
 bill read a time 
 i have receive a letter from   the hon member for north dorset simon hoare   ask for permission for an issue to be give precedence as a matter of privilege it concern a legal case that could potentially have the effect of prevent the parliamentary commissioner for administration also know as the parliamentary and health service ombudsman from lay a report before parliament under section 10(3 of the parliamentary commissioner act   standing order no   give the public administration and constitutional affairs committee the task of examine such report 
 the free flow of information to parliament be essential to its work and in the past attempt to prevent communication to the house or its committees have be treat as contempt accordingly i have decide that this be indeed a matter for which i should allow the precedence accord to issue of privilege the hon member can therefore table a motion to be debate on thursday the motion will be take after any urgent question or statement and before government business it will be available to member once it have be table which i expect will be before the rise of the house today 
 the secretary of state be ask

 more than palestinian child have be hospitalise for acute malnutrition this year alone amnesty international have condemn israel ’s use of starvation as a weapon of war and the un deputy relief chief have call the aid blockade a human make crisis will the minister move beyond word of condemnation and commit to concrete action include stop all arm export to israel and immediately and unconditionally recognise the statehood of palestine 
 the hon lady raise vital question the ipc integrate food security phase classification report over the recess be truly horrify people in gaza be face famine we continue to take the action that we discuss in the house yesterday afternoon in relation to recognition and the suspension of arm that could be use in gaza 
 i share many of my constituent despair and anger about the intolerable suffering in gaza last year i have the privilege of meet of my constituent becky to hear about her heartbreaking experience of deliver medical aid in palestine devastatingly a year on the situation be much bad with gaza now the child amputee capital of the world and thousand more family push to starvation there have be some welcome move from the government in recent month but clearly not enough have yet be do nothing can be until the suffering have stop what far urgent action can we take to finally secure access to the aid that gaza desperately need and end this intolerable suffering 
 i thank my hon friend and his constituent becky over the recess i meet doctor who have serve in gaza hear their hand account of the injury that child be suffer there be truly horrifying we continue to press the israeli government they must act urgently to lift restriction open up aid flow and enable the un and international non governmental organisation to carry out their lifesave work without obstruction the foreign secretary deliver that message to foreign minister sa’ar just last week and over the past month we have deliver strong co ordinated message with partner through joint statement 
 the minister will know that médecins sans frontières have refer to the location use by the gaza humanitarian foundation as site of orchestrated killing what pressure be the government bring to bear on both the israeli and us government to stop use the foundation and reinstate the united nations lead system of aid delivery 
 the hon lady be absolutely right the foreign secretary set out our very clear view yesterday afternoon the ghf be not work and have lead to thousand upon thousand of injury and many many death at its site i have hear of the considerable looting that be associate with the lack of un machinery machinery that be function effectively i be glad to tell the house that there do appear to be more aid get into gaza in total and the cost of flour have slightly reduce but there be still considerable looting the aid operation be not work as it should the uk support the un and its agency the ghf be not work 
 the un have now confirm famine in gaza city more than half a people face catastrophic condition of starvation destitution and death this be a man make disaster describe by the un secretary general as a failure of humanity at least daily truckload be need to avert further famine relate death yet israel continue to block aid will the government commit today to concrete action to pressure the israeli government to lift the obstruction include sanction all member of the cabinet include netanyahu who be complicit in the illegal aid blockade 
 i have be clear already about our view on the vital urgency of lift aid restriction i have go myself to the border to see our aid in al arish i have speak to our partner uk med for example have be chase consignment since march we make these point with force to the israeli government and we have already take far reach sanction action as discuss by the foreign secretary yesterday afternoon 
 in famine condition new mother often eat last and eat the least this time next year around pregnant and breastfeed woman in gaza could be at risk of death by starvation that be man make follow belgium ’s announcement today of new sanction and a review of contract with israeli company can the minister say what consequence israel will face if it continue to starve the population of gaza 
 my hon friend have a long track record of raise such issue and she be absolutely right to highlight the fate of pregnant woman and those who have recently give birth in gaza i be pleased to tell the house that we be still able to get some supply relevant to those challenge into gaza but clearly in a famine of this nature pregnant woman and recently bear child suffer the bad we have allocate a furth £ via the unfpa the un population fund to try to provide the service need we will continue to do all we can with the israeli government to ensure that they provide the access require 
 president trump and envoy steve witkoff play an important role in secure the previous ceasefire agreement at crucial moment netanyahu have be receptive to trump ’s wish we see that early this year when israel and iran step back from the brink as the white house have a defining role to play here will the foreign secretary with our ally urge the us to apply its full weight to its leverage 
 i agree very much with my hon friend the us of course have a key role to play in secure a last peace in the region as the foreign secretary say yesterday he have raise the issue directly with his american counterpart as have the rest of the ministerial team i confirm the government ’s full support for the us qatar and egypt in their vital work to secure a sustainable ceasefire 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 and day ago the foreign secretary describe the netanyahu government ’s aid blockade of gaza as a breach of international law before correct himself to describe it as only risk a breach yesterday the foreign secretary tell the house that gaza face a   man make famine and that he be outraged by the israeli government ’s block on aid so do the government now accept that israel have breach international law 
 yesterday the foreign secretary set out the long stand position of ministers on such determination under the previous government the threshold that this house set government be whether there be a real risk we have apply ourselves to that test and we have find that there be a real risk our action from september onwards have flow from that determination 
 what discussion he have have with his international counterpart on the chagos islands 
 the diego garcia military base be essential to the security of the united kingdom and our key ally and to keep the british people safe the treaty be test at the high level of the united states security establishment which support the deal the agreement have be back by our key ally and international partner include the us and all our eyes partner india japan and south korea have make clear their support for the deal 
 by not even try to go to court or argue the case the government have cost the taxpayer £ do the minister agree with the defence minister who say that the deal represent good value for uk taxpayer 
 as i have explain many time in the house those figure be completely misleading the net present value of payment under the treaty be £ the average cost of the deal in today ’s money be £ per year that be just a fraction of our defence budget and represent a few hour of spending on our nhs this government will not scrimp when it come to the national security of the united kingdom and our ally 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 give that the foreign office have not agree with mauritius a define financial allocation for the chagos marine protect area give that no additional money have be secure or ringfence for environmental protection give that no who would be involve in the administration of the marine protect area have so much as visit the archipelago give the very little communication between the mauritius government and the british scientific community who currently protect the area give that the capacity of mauritius to patrol the archipelago for poacher be unknown and give that it be not clear whether the dispute mechanism set out in the treaty can even be use if the uk deem that mauritius be in breach of its marine protection commitment what be the minister ’s hope for this absolutely unique and priceless marine protect area can that all be fix by the memorandum of understanding 
 order sorry but i have a lot of member to get in i have give the chair of the select committee a lot of leeway it might be worth her put in for an adjournment debate if there be so much to say on the subject i would be more than happy with that 
 i thank my right hon friend for her interest in this important issue which she and member of the foreign affairs committee have raise with i previously the government have secure a deal that will help to protect the unique environment of the chagos archipelago support by an enhance partnership between the uk and mauritius under which we will support mauritius ’s ambition to establish a marine protect area to protect the globally significant ecosystem to which she refer the agreement of the term of the technical support and assistance be a priority within the ongoing implementation process with mauritius i have listen very carefully to what she say and she can be assure that i have already be ask question about many of those issue 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government have now be force to admit the real cost of the catastrophic chagos surrender deal it be not £ oh no mr speaker it be a mind blow £ which be time more that we be tell no wonder mauritius be plan tax cut of its own and it be british business and family who will pay the price this deal leave our country poor our defence capability damage and our standing in the world weaken will the minister now apologise to the british people for this epic failure in diplomacy withdraw his chagos surrender bill and keep the island british 
 how ever many time the hon gentleman   the right hon member for witham priti patel   or the conservative party in its email to supporter make this claim about the cost it do not mean that it be true it be not the £ figure be inaccurate and misleading it be wrong to ignore the cost of inflation and the change in the value of money over the real cost of a deal that last year the figure be verify by the government actuary ’s department draw on long establish methodology i have set out the cost we will not scrimp on national security quite frankly the brass neck from conservative members after they disinvest in our armed force and our defence over the entire time they be in office be quite extraordinary 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help protect democracy in georgia 
 we be deeply concerned about the situation in georgia as i have discuss with my hon friend on a number of occasion we be work closely with european ally to protect democracy in georgia in june i convene a meeting of european partner to discuss and address the democratic backsliding in georgia and on   july   the foreign secretary condemn the detention of opposition leader   in a statement with european foreign ministers we remain committed to georgia ’s euro atlantic path and democratic norm 
 may i join you mr speaker in congratulate the minister on his nuptial i thank he for the lead he have take on georgia he will know because he have recently be in georgia that over the summer the situation have dramatically worsen opposition leader have be jail young democracy activist have be give life change prison sentence and the civil society organisation that be try to protect democracy have be threaten with prosecution the complaint of the democracy activist i use to work with be that all of this brutality be happen while the regime ’s money be wash through business associate in london will the minister target the people who be responsible for this brutality and hold they accountable 
 my hon friend raise important and serious issue he know that the foreign secretary and i prioritise tackle illicit finance more broadly i will not comment on future potential measure but he will know that we have impose a number of sanction on georgian dream ministers on police chief and on georgian judge under the global anti corruption sanction regime indeed in april we also sanction the general prosecutor the head of the special investigatory service and other official i can not comment on future step but he can be assure that i be follow this issue daily

 i set out the position on the change to our aid budget early i can assure the hon gentleman that we recognise the important work that civil society do in georgia and indeed more broadly in ensure a free society he will appreciate that the situation there be very difficult we have suspend all our programme support for the georgian government restrict our defence co operation limit our engagement with georgian dream representative and freeze the annual strategic dialogue in response to the very disturbing direction of travel that we have see in georgia i also thank the hon gentleman for his kind comment 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be indeed time for a step change in the uk ’s response to the sinister crackdown on freedom and political opposition in georgia it be welcome that the minister be assess asset ban and freeze on those responsible for this wholly unacceptable situation may i ask that he step up effort for the georgian civil society counter destabilisation hybrid activity especially in the information space and the actor that might be involve in that   what discussion have he have with the us administration in the light of the megobari bill go through congress 
 we engage regularly with international counterpart on georgia and on wide stability in the south caucasus the right hon gentleman mention the importance of medium freedom he will know that we condemn the disproportionate and politically motivated sentencing of mzia amaglobeli in august she have be sentence to year in prison and we call for her immediate release i also discuss the wide situation with georgia ’s president president zourabichvili on her recent visit to the uk and i express my support for her work support democracy in georgia the right hon gentleman will understand that i will not comment on further measure but he can be absolutely assure that i be closely follow matter as be other colleague across government 
 what progress his department have make on the evacuation of uk scholarship student from gaza 
 i have be work closely with the home secretary to ensure that student from gaza include chevening scholar can secure their uk visa we be expect chevene student to start their course soon i be pleased to say that we be extend this support to student in gaza with full scholarship 
 yara be a year old student from gaza city her ambition be to study international law and global justice and early this year she win a scholarship at the university of sheffield to do just that yara be of more than scholarship student trap in gaza today displace again and again with all her belonging pack into a small bag and ready to move at a moment ’s notice this scholarship offer she a chance to escape israel ’s genocide famine and bombardment which have flatten more than building in yara ’s neighbourhood in just week can the foreign secretary guarantee that yara and other student like she will not be leave strand and will be immediately evacuate by the government in time for their course to start this month 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for bring yara to the attention of the house of course we want to see bright student like she able to achieve their ambition we be reliant on israeli permission and on student have a full scholarship but what i can do be ensure that the minister for the middle east meet my hon friend to discuss this case in detail 
 along with thousand of other child my young son be today go back for his day at school unfortunately more than gazan child those who have not be butcher or maim irreversibly by the israel defence forces be be deny schooling for the consecutive year that be not surprising give that of school have already be virtually destroy   what be the secretary of state do to ensure that the next generation of palestinians can access education alongside launch a bespoke visa system that enable student to come to study here in the uk if not why not 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise with the house the plight of child in gaza yesterday i mention my concern about malnourished child and what that do for their educational outcome yesterday he will have hear the home secretary and myself undertake to do more to support student with full scholarship to come to our country of course as the hon gentleman would expect i press the israeli foreign minister on these very same issue 
 what step he be take to support a ceasefire in gaza 
 what recent step his department have take to help secure peace in the middle east 
 what discussion he have have with his israeli counterpart on civilian death in gaza 
 what step he be take to help restore the ceasefire in gaza 
 the situation on the ground in gaza be horrendous and we urgently want to see a deal do to end the suffering on all side an immediate ceasefire be our overwhelming priority alongside the unconditional release of all hostage and a large scale delivery of aid the ceasefire must be sustainable and lead to a wide peace plan which we be develop with our international partner 
 my constituency of watford be a richly ethnically diverse community when i speak to resident there about the conflict in gaza the overwhelming desire be for the killing to stop for the hostage to be release and for the people of gaza to be able to live in peace will the secretary of state further outline what step the government be take to aid international effort to broker the ceasefire and what be frustrate it 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue diplomacy not bloodshe be how we get security for both israelis and palestinians and get to a ceasefire be the immediate priority i will be in the region again in the come day discuss with they the prime minister ’s framework for peace which be the only plan and how we govern gaza and move forward once we get to that ceasefire build a consensus around a sustainable end to the conflict 
 i reiterate the concern raise last night by my fellow journalist and hon friend   the member for earley and woodley yuan yang   in highlight gaza as the deadly war for journalist over have be kill since october despite   reporter be categorise as protect civilian under international law israel seem set on a deadly campaign to silence journalist in gaza while refuse entry to other international journalist can the secretary of state join i in condemn that strategy and in pay tribute to those who be risk their life to get news out of gaza and also commend our own domestic broadcaster include the much malign bbc for keep we inform on what be go on there 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for bring this matter to the house ’s attention i strongly condemn all violence direct against journalist and call on the israeli authority to make every effort to ensure that medium worker across the region can conduct their work freely and safely deliberate target of journalist be entirely unacceptable international humanitarian law offer protection to civilian journalist during any armed conflict and those law should be abide by i call for all attack to be investigate and for those responsible to be prosecute 
 last week ’s nasser hospital bombing murder many innocent people include journalist and the double tap method use be particularly barbaric article of the geneva convention state that journalist be civilian during war and article of the rome statute make it clear that attack civilian in a hospital be a war crime i agree with the guardian ’s editorial yesterday when it state that 
 israel want to stop the world from see what it ’ do 
 do the foreign secretary agree that the nasser hospital bombing be a war crime and what action will he be take against israel 
 on   august   the uk join a media freedom coalition statement call on and urge israel to allow immediate independent foreign medium access and afford protection to journalist operate in gaza there must now be a full independent investigation into what happen at the nasser hospital and my hon friend be right to call to mind the importance of abide by international humanitarian law 
 the world have watch in horror as humanitarian aid have be block from reach gaza lead to a famine that be claim the life of those who survive the bomb meanwhile in the west bank the israeli government turn a blind eye to rampant settler violence and openly approve new settlement that could end the very possibility of a state solution can the foreign secretary assure the house that he be do everything he can not only to end the mass killing but to secure a last peace between equal state in israel and palestine 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue the confirmation of famine be utterly horrifying i be appal by the shocking level of settler violence and i have be clear that israel must clamp down on that violence the government have introduce round of sanction relate to settler violence include the july sanction on ben gvir and smotrich for the incitement of violence against palestinian community the only way to deliver long term peace and security for palestinians and israelis alike be through a viable state solution 
 the remain hostage in gaza those who be still alive be be starve persecute and prevent from get any form of medical aid when the foreign secretary visit the region will he force the international red cross to seek the hostage and ensure that they be give the medical attention they need 
 the hon gentleman have always bring the issue of hostage to mind in this house and i applaud he for that work i meet with hostage family just before the summer recess and i will again in the come week the recent photo show hostage malnourish and starve be obscene and i will do all i can to ensure that they get the aid and support that they need underground in those tunnel 
 it be clear that the state war goal of many element of the israeli government be not a ceasefire and a last peace between community live side by side in peace but ethnically cleanse gaza and prevent a viable state in the west bank will the secretary of state therefore commit to sanction the head of the israeli government benjamin netanyahu 
 the hon gentleman should look closely at the package of sanction that we have have since come to office he will see that there be no other country in the world with the range of sanction against those who incite in particular settler violence and expansion 
 israel have breach ceasefire to date its bombing its killing and now its starvation have continue for month it be not just the hostage who be not get food it be also baby child woman and man the impunity that israel have to continue to perpetrate war crime after war crime atrocity after atrocity when will the uk and the international community say enough be enough and take real action to put an end to the killing and to help the hostage be free 
 it be not enough to assert it or say it that be why we restore funding to the united nations relief and works agency that be why we have have package of sanction that be why yesterday i announce an extra £ of aid that be why i have speak to my israeli counterpart nearly every week certainly every month that i have be in office it be why we have corral the international community with the statement we have make it be not about word it be about action to bring this to an end 
 the secretary of state be very clear yesterday that if we want peace we must ensure that the hostage be release if we want peace we must ensure that hamas be oust from gaza if that happen we will have a peace that will last i know that he be committed to that for he say so yesterday but will he reiterate that for the chamber and those who be here 
 the hon gentleman know a lot about stand up to terrorist hamas be a proscribe organisation there can be no role for hamas we need the total demilitarisation of gaza those leader who   be there must leave and exit the country so that the palestinian people can be free from the plight of what hamas be rain down on they 
 what discussion he have have with his international counterpart on the recognition of a palestinian state 
 we have be clear that we will recognise a palestinian state by the united nations general assembly in september to protect the viability of the state solution unless the israeli government take substantive step to end the appalling situation in gaza and commit to a long term sustainable peace 
 the united kingdom government should never have place condition on the recognition of the state of palestine there be no place for it in international law however give that it be clear that israel have fail to comply with these condition can the secretary of state confirm that the uk will unconditionally and immediately recognise the state of palestine at the un general assembly next week 
 high level week be not actually next week it be in week time may i say to the hon gentleman that it be most bizarre to say to a responsible government that they should not attempt to change the situation on the ground to encourage israel to commit to a ceasefire and to a process of course we should use all diplomatic effort to do that notwithstanding what we say about the assessment we will make on recognition at the appropriate time 
 we all want to see an end to the suffering and progress towards a state solution but what assurance can the foreign secretary provide that in the recognition of palestine there can be no role for hamas in the governance of a palestinian state 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue let i be crystal clear hamas must never be reward and we will not reward it by the uk ’s recognition of palestine if we reach that point our demand of hamas be absolute and unchanged it must immediately release all the hostage who be cruelly take on   october   and hold in the most atrocious condition which we have already discuss in the chamber this morning 
 what step his department be take to increase economic sanction on russia 
 until putin stop his barbaric assault we will keep tighten the screw on his war machine with even more sanction since come to office we have sanction more than individual entity and ship more than double the number of designation make in 
 vladimir putin be in beijing this week where he have hail the unprecedented level of tie between china and russia for once i hope that the government will actually take he at his word before china build the super embassy in our capital 
 china have cease export of drone component to ukraine and both xi jinping and kim jong un be prop up putin economically i commend the prime minister for unite a coalition of the willing but what tangible action be it take to ensure that ukraine win against adversary 
 i think that of our proud moment be watch president zelensky walk up the step of no and reflect on the role that the prime minister have play in corral the global community around the coalition of the willing the hon gentleman will have see the prime minister with president zelensky again in washington dc just a few week ago in all that we be do on the oil price cap in raise the issue of russian sovereign asset with our g7 and european partner to try to resolve that issue and through sanction we be lead the world 
 may i join colleague in send my warm congratulation to the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office   the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty on his recent nuptial 
 over the summer recess report emerge that the russians have launch an online catalogue of the child whom they have steal from ukraine this grotesque database allow russian family to search for ukrainian child by hair and eye colour the russians be advertise their war crime in real time what further action be the government take on this issue and can the foreign secretary assure i that it will be the high priority in discussion with the president of the united states during his visit later this month

 do the foreign secretary agree that of the bad aspect of the action of the israeli authority be the continual stripping away of the dignity of the palestinian people in jerusalem and the west bank only last week the greek orthodox patriarch learn that for the time in history israeli authority launch a property tax on greek orthodox church there be international outrage at the freezing of bank account that have make a difference can this house and this government stick up for the right of the palestinian people not even the ottomans try to impose a church tax 
 i be grateful to the father of the house for bring to mind the situation in the west bank of course it be important that israel have its full security but the violence the expansion the denial of fund and the chilling effect on civil society be all of huge concern which be why we fund and support organisation on the ground and work with civil society

 it have now be some week since president trump invite the leader of the russian federation to the united states of america since then putin have increase his assault on the civilian population of ukraine and show no sign whatsoever of reach the ceasefire that be desire so trump ’s initiative have fail will the foreign secretary use his visit to the united nations next week to call again for real united states sanction on russia 
 we applaud president trump ’s effort to bring about a sustained and sustainable peace and there be detailed discussion go on about security guarantee and what role the united states may play as a result of the summit but our assessment be that putin be not up to seriously negotiate we condemn the killing and the loss of life that have continue and the injuring of a security guard at the british council

 there have be important commitment about the future nature of any palestinian state include from president abbas who say that any such state would be demilitarise there be absolute clarity in new york where we make the announcement about the recognition decision that hamas can have no future role in gaza and that a future palestinian state must pose no threat to an israeli state state require state live in safety and security and pose no threat to each other 
 i welcome the sanction that the government have put in place on the israeli government as in their current form they be not a reliable or trust partner have the foreign secretary order a review of the uk ’s relationship with the israeli government over the last month if not why not 
 i set out the detail of the sanction to which my hon friend refer and the foreign secretary have announce a review of some of the element of our bilateral co operation with israel include a number of step in relation to free trade agreement and so on 
 i be grateful for the leadership that the foreign secretary and the minister for the middle east show over the summer in their visit to syria and in engage with the syrian government especially on the violence that take place in suwayda as uk special envoy for freedom of religion or belief i be particularly worried to see that the violence especially affect the druze and christian minority in that country what more can we do to work with the syrian government to ensure that they protect all their citizen regardless of their religion 
 my hon friend ask a vital question which i raise directly with the syrian minister of justice and the syrian foreign minister last week the violence in coastal region target alawites and in suwayda in the south target druze and other be deeply concern the syrians have conduct an investigation relatively independently in relation to the violence at the coast i call on they as the foreign secretary have do before to do everything they can to ensure that minority in the new syria feel safe and protect by the syrian government 
 despite the strategic dialogue refer to by the foreign secretary the government have decide to veto the uk morocco power project so what be they do in practical term to maintain the momentum in our relationship create by the association agreement sign with morocco in 
 there be no veto it be right that the government look at all project through a value for money lens i be very pleased to be in morocco i remain engaged with its foreign minister and i will build on that strategic visit there be much to do over the come month 
 i be pleased to read that the government be finally take step to rejoin the erasmus+ programme something for which the liberal democrats have be call for some time will the minister now set out a timetable mandate and expect term for uk reassociation with that programme 
 i do not want to go into the detail we be involve in many different discussion with the european union follow our historic summit on   may i attend the gymnich with foreign ministers in denmark last weekend we be progress this alongside the paymaster general and minister for the cabinet office and we will provide detail in due course 
 save the children report that of pregnant woman and new mother in gaza be malnourish in early august a sharp rise link to the blockade and health system collapse will the government consider enable the medical transfer of pregnant woman need specialist care to the uk and outline their strategy for support gaza ’s long term recovery stability and maternity health these child be the future of the state solution 
 my hon friend be right as be my hon friend   the member for luton north sarah owen to raise the fate of pregnant woman in gaza and indeed of those who have recently give birth i be happy to meet she to discuss these issue in great detail 
 i would like to make a statement regard the insolvency of speciality steel uk ltd which be part of the liberty steel group hon member will have see that the high court grant a compulsory winding up order against liberty speciality steels on   august and the company have now enter liquidation 
 and foremost let i say this the government stand with the affected steelworker in rotherham in sheffield and in wednesbury we stand with their family and the community who will undoubtedly be worry at this difficult time i would like to reassure they and all those employ by liberty speciality steels that we be stand by with our rapid response team to give immediate support on the ground if require that we be work with the trade union and the south yorkshire mayor and that we be work with the council and hon member from affected constituency to offer all the help we can 
 i also want to stress that there will be no immediate change to the current operation of the business include to employee job follow the appointment of special manager the company ’s site have be secure and employee payroll process within hour other liberty steel company outside speciality steel such as liberty dalzell and liberty hartlepool be not affect by this action 
 follow the company ’s liquidation the official receiver have be appoint as liquidator by the court hon member will know that the official receiver operate independently of government with a statutory duty to act in the good interest of creditor 
 yesterday i lay a departmental minute notify the house of the contingent liability associate with this intervention i regret that due to the liquidation take place during recess we have not be able to follow the usual notice period of parliamentary sitting day however a copy of the departmental minute will be place in the libraries of both houses in addition the government have agree to fund for the official receiver who will now stabilise operation the official receiver will gather company information and report to we on the likely next step include option for the company ’s business and site the total cost will depend on market condition and the strategy adopt by the official receiver however that will be subject to close scrutiny by my department and the insolvency service 
 as the house will be aware the company have face severe financial and operational difficulty since liberty speciality steels have fail to file account for over year a failure that have lead to a separate prosecution by companies house of its parent company i be sure that the official receiver will want to gain a well understanding of the company ’s business and the conduct of its director lead up to the liquidation i also inform the house that the director of the company be currently under investigation by the serious fraud office for suspect fraud fraudulent trading and money laundering give that i be sure hon member will agree that it would have be wholly inappropriate for the government to enter into commercial arrangement with the company 
 this government will always take difficult decision when they be in the national interest that be why in april we act to prevent the pre emptive closure of the blast furnace at british steel in scunthorpe in the case of liberty steel the lack of transparency the legal and financial risk and the complete absence of reliable corporate information mean we have no credible route to act before insolvency it be worth note that liberty speciality steels use electric arc furnace technology that can be power up or down as need although it should be note that those furnace have not be operate since july of last year that be the situation this government inherit 
 the circumstance in scunthorpe be fundamentally different british steel operate the uk ’s last remain blast furnace asset that once shut down can not simply be restart allow those blast furnace to be close pre emptively would have remove our ability to make strategic choice about the future of steelmaking in scunthorpe and that be not a position this government be prepared to accept scunthorpe be therefore a truly exceptional situation and that be why we take the unprecedented step of implement the steel industry special measures act to maintain the safe operation of the blast furnace 
 the situation with liberty speciality steels be not comparable the company be issue with a winding up order by the high court due to longstanding financial issue spending taxpayer money on a company operate in such a way would have expose taxpayer to hundred of million potentially billion of pound in hide cost 
 with all that say i very much believe that the steelmaking site in rotherham stocksbridge brinsworth and wednesbury have a future i be keen to see they return to production but that have to be achieve through private investment by an owner who can invest in the workforce and in the future of the business so that they put it on a long term sustainable footing we know that the business environment have not be good enough for the uk ’s steel industry which be why we have already make substantial change to secure a strong future for it i will say more about the step that we have take shortly 
 in the case of liberty speciality steels it go without say that the company ’s hardworke employee be key to turn the site around their skill and expertise will be essential in deliver that bright future however in its current state produce only minimal volume of steel and with many employee still on furlough we know that some tough choice lie ahead it be now for the official receiver to determine the next step in the insolvency process but let i be clear this government will stand by this workforce and do all we can to support they through this period of uncertainty 
 despite the challenge face the steel sector today after year of neglect under the previous government we believe that this industry will bounce back and grow strong tomorrow this government be do everything we can to make that happen we be press ahead with a bold steel strategy for the uk set to be publish later this year that strategy will set out our vision for a competitive decarbonised and resilient domestic steel industry our approach be clear we want the uk steel sector to thrive with strong private investment and commercially sustainable operation at its core 
 under our new industrial strategy we have already announce some major policy change to increase the future viability of the steel industry we be reduce electricity cost for steel producer by increase network charge discount through the supercharger from to we be change government procurement rule via the publication of a new steel public procurement notice to ensure that uk make steel be consider for all public project we be also strengthen current steel safeguard measure ensure that uk steel producer will not be undercut while still ensure that the uk have a steady and reliable supply 
 hon member will know that we have also secure a much improve deal for the worker of port talbot something the opposition repeatedly say could never be achieve and we deliver it alongside a £ grant to support the transition to low carbon electric arc furnace production i be proud to attend the groundbreaking event for this in july with the chair of tata group we will continue to work hand in hand with this vital british industry to ensure its long term success 
 let there be no doubt that for liberty speciality steels we will pursue every option to keep steelmaking in rotherham sheffield south yorkshire and the west midland we will offer all possible support to the independent official receiver on the all important next phase and we will continue to work with hon member across the house to ensure that the uk remain a proud steelmaking country now and for many year to come i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be grateful to the minister for give i advance sight of her statement today but here we be again another day another government takeover of a key british manufacturing plant another jobs—1,500 people face an incredibly uncertain future and the prospect of significant job loss alongside the wide economic impact across supply chain and in aerospace defence and power generation that would result from the collapse of this specialist steelwork 
 despite so many warm word about the steel industry despite so many labour promise to the people who have work their whole life in that industry and despite the impression of superiority while in opposition this labour government be fail british industry they be fail to provide certainty of policy and the economic growth that they say be their central mission and they be fail to get a grip on the issue that affect thousand of work people ’s life the minister say she want to provide certainty to the steel industry and the people who work in it she say that we can expect a bold steel strategy for the uk but where be it the government be not new any more they have be in power for a year now and there be still no clarity on this supposedly bold strategy 
 the british steel industry face a fierce dual set of pressure new us tariff and continue high energy cost we all know that the energy cost in this country be too high yet they have be drive only high by   this government ’s ideological obsession with prioritise decarbonisation over economic growth back in may liberty steel warn that it face significant challenge due to soar energy cost but instead of focus on tackle the underlie cause of expensive energy the energy secretary be back windmill while leave britain ’s oil and gas industry in the doldrums he be leave our amazing british oil and gas our great energy source trap under the north sea this be economic illiteracy aim at satisfy their own green obsession from steel to chemical to car builder and maker across britain be pay the price of this government ’s socialist green agenda and it be their worker and investor who will lose out 
 on tariff despite the economic prosperity deal agree by the prime minister and president trump the agreement ’s provision lower us tariff on uk produce steel and steel derivative product have still not come into effect the government have repeatedly avoid answer question in this house on when the agreement will come into effect we hear no mention whatsoever of it in the statement today or in the note yesterday so i ask again when will the provision lower us tariff on uk steel come into effect 
 of course even if those provision do eventually come to fruition steelworker should beware of this government who have overpromise and under deliver before with devastating impact for worker just look at jaguar land rover the prime minister look worker dead in the eye and promise that he would protect their industry and save their job he then use those worker as a labour propaganda photo opportunity across television and the front page when the uk us deal be announce but little over month later jaguar land rover announce it be cut job the very same worker who be promise everything by the prime minister be leave out in the cold by this labour government ’s inability to secure a well trading relationship with our close ally 
 let we today try to get some clarity on what exactly this minister have do and will do for the british worker impact at liberty steel she announce that the government have agree to fund the official receiver and that total 
 order—[interruption no it ’ no use nod at i i have not go over time it be the shadow minister himself i be sure he be now come to a conclusion 
 i be mr speaker although i have lot of question i will ask just very quick one if that be okay 
 you must ask they now otherwise i be go to stop you 
 i will mr speaker 
 what be the budget for the official receiver the minister have not lay out any cost she have say that it be relate to market condition but have not set out any estimate she know that the treasury will have approve estimate so please will she set those out the government have make the national wealth fund allocate £ to british steel can she assure we that they will follow the investment allocation that assure its operational independence 
 order please it be not acceptable on either side of the house to take advantage of the back benchers who want to get in you have a set amount of time if the minister can stick to it i expect the shadow minister to do so if the minister go over time i do then grant time the other way please do not do this again 
 let we come to the chair of the select committee 
 thank you very much mr speaker 
 order the minister need to respond it ’ be that long that i have forget 
 thank you mr speaker i shall just explain to the shadow minister how the system work the government have not take over control that be not the process of the official receiver the official receiver be appoint follow a court case which begin in it have be a very long and arduous case 
 the hon gentleman will hopefully understand that i can not set out the cost of the official receiver at this point because the official receiver have only just begin his work it be very early day and we can not be specific we know the number will be in the million as oppose to anything more substantial because the company be not operate in and of itself what we be do be ensure that the salary be pay which i hope the whole house would agree be the right thing to do company will be come forward and express an interest in buy part of the company and it will be for the official receiver to look at that and see what process we should go through but i can not give the hon gentleman the actual number on that i hope the whole house will understand why not 
 on the shadow minister ’s wide point if this government have not intervene thousand of people would have lose their livelihood in scunthorpe that be a fact if this government have not intervene we would not have have a well deal for the worker in port talbot we would not have be there support they in the transition and we would not be there support the building of the electric arc furnace which begin back in july 
 the shadow minister ask what this government have already do we have already change the rule on procurement i have work closely with colleague in the cabinet office on that to ensure that where government be spend money we be spend on british business where we can something his government fail to do on energy price we have commit to lower price through the reduction in cost that will come from the expansion of the super charger something his government fail to do we be work on a bold strategy which we will publish this year that will build on that whether on trade protection on which we have already take measure our scrap policy r&d job apprenticeship or skill we will have a bold strategy because we believe in steel unlike the previous government who say that manufacturing be a victorian pursuit well leave to the chinese we do not agree with that approach 
 i will try again i call the chair of the select committee 
 i congratulate the minister on save britain ’s real engineering from year of financial engineering which be not in the good interest of this country and be more in the interest of the self enrichment of the people behind it the question for we today though be what step the government will now take to ensure and safeguard a grow thrive industry will the minister reassure the house that she will use we on the committee to oversee the liability that the department have take on crucially will she set out when she expect those low energy cost to kick in when she expect the tariff barrier in the united states to come down and when she will tie together the steel strategy which i hope she will publish as soon as possible for the house to debate 
 i thank my right hon friend for those helpful question he remind i that the shadow minister have ask about the us of course we be in a position where the world have tariff of on steel and aluminium we have we be work with our us counterpart to reach a conclusion to those negotiation my right hon friend will know that the president be due to come to the uk and of course we will be do all we can to get that negotiation conclude at pace 
 my right hon friend ask about energy cost we be seek to ensure that there be a viable steel industry into the future and that those company currently talk to the official receiver about want to take over and invest in liberty can do so in a way that will make they money on the charge we be reduce the to super charger extension for network charge relief to give an example it will mean about £ to £ relief per tonne of steel produce we know that liberty be not produce what it can at the moment but or year ago it would have be produce about tonne of steel per year so it would have save up to £ on its energy cost that be a substantial reduction and something that i be sure he will welcome 
 on the liability of course we want to be as honest open and transparent with the house as we possibly can a lot of the liability be with the creditor at the moment we want to come to the house as soon as we can to ensure that we be set out the cost that we incur my right hon friend be right that the steel strategy this year need to be bold and we will of course look to the work that his committee have do to help we in that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 may i start by associate the liberal democrats with the minister ’s remark in support of the employee family and community who be affect by this late development we welcome the minister ’s come to the house today to provide some clarity 
 steel be a sector of huge strategic importance for our country it provide vital material for our national infrastructure from defence to renewable energy and it create thousand of job across the uk the neglect of the steel industry in recent year be just another part of the previous government ’s disastrous legacy with putin ’s barbaric war in europe and donald trump ’s damage tariff cause economic turmoil secure the future of steel production in this country be more important than   ever that be why the liberal democrats firmly believe that nothing should be off the table in support this critical sector 
 for too long our steel industry have be neglect the conservative government oversee a string of near collapse and last minute deal they scrap the industrial strategy which be so vital to our manufacturer and put in place new trade barrier which constrain our exporter in the light of this late insolvency will the minister set out what action the government be take to set our steel industry on a truly sustainable footing what reassurance can the government provide that job loss can be avoid in the future what progress have be make in bring down industrial electricity price through the measure announce in the industrial strategy what be the government do to press president trump to finally drop his damaging tariff on our steel export finally what step be the government take to treat steel as the nationally strategic asset that it be ensure that more british make steel be use to power our national infrastructure and other major project here in the uk 
 i thank the hon lady for her remark she be right to ask about how we ensure that this nationally strategic asset be protect and we be do that i have just set out the reduction in energy price that the steel industry as a whole will benefit from extend the super charger from to to give network charge relief which will bring significantly low cost for energy price for our steel industry we be prioritise the procurement of british steel where the government be spend money because we believe that that be the right thing to do we have already introduce protection for steel trading and we be ensure that we do everything we can talk to our us counterpart all the time about reach a conclusion on the negotiation on the steel tariff i be optimistic about those conversation 
 of course i speak to official and other ministers and to the steel industry about these issue all the time we be lucky to have the steel council that we put together trade union industry and other who be help we to develop what we think will be an ambitious steel strategy that will ensure that the steel industry will not decline the strategy will ensure that we will not be in the position we be currently in where only of the steel we use in this country be make in this country and that we will be in a position where we can protect those good experienced job and those good people who we want to support and make sure the industry grow 
 you will be aware mr speaker that as long as i have be an mp i have be come to this chamber argue for support for speciality steel in my constituency i politely say to the shadow minister that the difference in response from this government be night and day from what i have under the conservatives i personally thank the minister and the secretary of state for have such an open door policy to i and my hon friend   the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball i know the minister be do everything she can to save this speciality business 
 of the action of the official receiver be to release approximately apprentice who be due to start their training in the next few week can the minister reassure the house that the government will not only commit to the business but acknowledge that it can survive only with its highly skilled committed professional staff and that she be as commit to they as she be to the business 
 i thank my hon friend for those remark they be gratefully receive and we will continue to do all we can to support the steel industry she be absolutely right that a number of apprentice be due to start this week but the official receiver take the decision that give that the month continuation of the apprenticeship could not be guarantee it be right to try to find they other placement i be take a close personal interest in what happen to those people i know the local authority and the department for education be try to ensure that we can find other place for they i want to make sure that we can do so because of the thing this government be passionate about be ensure that our young people have the apprenticeship to give they support for the job that we know we need into the future 
 the minister be obviously incredibly committed to the steel industry as we all be but manufacturing will continue to struggle in this country when it pay energy price that be so much high than competitor in germany and france can the minister assure the house that in a year ’s time follow the government strategy manufacturer whether ceramic or steel will be pay the same amount for their industrial energy price as their german and french competitor 
 the right hon gentleman make a good point of course our energy price be too high and it be difficult for company to compete we be take action to address that in the instance by expand the super charger which will make a significant difference to industry that use significant amount of energy we will also introduce an electricity scheme in it be a complex process and will take time to bring in mean that around company across the country will also have significant reduction in their energy cost we be take what we believe to be the right measure in our industrial strategy through those intervention to ensure that our energy cost come down and that we can be competitive among our european counterpart 
 liberty ’s speciality steels uk have fail its highly skilled worker this ongoing situation have be deeply concern so i be delighted that the minister have offer her solidarity and the government ’s support for the incredible workforce at the site in south yorkshire it be hugely positive and a great contrast with the year of conservative government that this government have step in and appoint an official receiver to protect the plus job at the site include stocksbridge speciality steels in my constituency the secretary of state have acknowledge in this chamber the strategic significance of those site to national security and we must ensure that those business be support in   fulfil their capability and have as the minister have recognise a strong future will she take adequate time to find a responsible buyer with the right deal and during that time will worker be keep in employment with salary continue to be pay while effort be make by she and the official receiver to resolve the outstanding pension issue 
 my hon friend and i have speak many time about this she be such a champion for the industry as be many colleague she be right to point to the importance to the country of the work at stocksbridge of course we will do what we need to do through the process of the official receiver to ensure that people get the salary that they need for the past couple of year so many of those people have be on furlough we want to turn that around we believe that this viable industry be languish unnecessarily the government will provide the right support through intervention such as our energy reduction measure and work with the official receiver i can tell she that multiple company be interested and come forward and we need to establish how viable those offer be and what the good situation be of course the official receiver must think of the good outcome for the creditor but we take a close interest in that my hon friend be right to point out the pension issue i know that there be uncertainty the official receiver and teneo be consider these issue now to see exactly what have and have not be pay so that we can unpick the pension issue 
 this be the crisis in the steel industry in the past year it impact other commercially operate industry that be critical to our national security in lancashire the failure to place an order for typhoon jet be risk thousand of job in the critical defence industry of bae systems there be also a lack of join up between department which do not realise that the whole life cycle of nuclear fuel manufacturing be equally critical for our national infrastructure and impact on hundred of highly skilled job in lancashire at the westinghouse springfields site will the minister update i on her work with the ministry of defence to ensure that commercially operate industry that be critical to our national defence capability and security be strategically support to be sustainable in the future 
 the hon gentleman be right to point out the importance of our defence industry and the need for we to support it of course the industrial strategy outline growth drive sector that we believe can be turbocharge with government support defence be of they we have publish those sector plan apart from the defence which will come shortly he should look out for it we have significantly increase funding for defence which will lead to thousand of job across the uk i will work closely with my colleague in defence particularly the minister for defence procurement and industry to ensure that we procure uk job where we can and support our industry to grow
