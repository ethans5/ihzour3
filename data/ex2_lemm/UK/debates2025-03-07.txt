i could not agree with my hon friend more edinburgh have a thrive space sector as do scotland my hon friend have for many year be heavily involve in work to grow the economy in edinburgh and the borders and i pay tribute to he for that 
 i must however take this opportunity to pick a minor bone with my hon friend he mention that glasgow do not have a castle and i wish to correct the record we have a fine ruin castle call crookston castle it be the old building in glasgow the old building in glasgow be the beautiful cathedral i will not indulge in a dispute about whether edinburgh or glasgow be the well city they be both beautiful great city glasgow be slightly well but there you be i be oblige to my hon friend for his intervention and i be also glad to be able to correct that point 
 there be another reason why it be important that we have a thrive space and satellite industry space be critical to defence and we must have a thrive space sector to protect our country the united kingdom work with ally to ensure that our interest be defend in space however the world be become more unstable and it be essential that we have our own capability to launch and operate satellite from the united kingdom   and this bill be important in that regard too it will help to secure a vibrant end to end space industry in the united kingdom and that be important for defence to take example have our own domestic launch capability be important and a vibrant civilian sector will help to cover the cost of that launch capability this bill also have a national security theme 
 owe to much hard work include by the last government the uk space agency and many other the united kingdom also have a firm foundation for a thrive space industry in the time available i can not provide a complete survey of the vibrant and grow space industry but here be some key point key task we have have be to develop our own launch capability to put satellite up in space and then to get they back down that be why there be so much chat about spaceport in my life at least 
 saxavord the uk spaceport in the shetland islands be of only license vertical launch spaceport in europe that be at the far end of the north of the map of our family of nation down in the far south west we also have an operational spaceport in cornwall that illustrate that space be an opportunity for our family of nation from the very top to the very bottom i mean that only in a cartographic sense i be not look to offend any member from cornwall 
 there be also spaceport under construction and plan in sutherland on the far north of the coast of scotland to the west of thurso north uist a wonderful place which i commend as i spend much of my honeymoon there glasgow prestwick spaceport machrihanish on the southern tip of the argyll peninsula which i would also recommend for a visit to scotland and snowdonia some may wonder where those place be they be all wonderful place and they illustrate that space be an opportunity across the united kingdom 
 let we turn to the satellite or as lou reed sing satellite of love the uk have incredible talent in manufacturing satellite and satellite technology as a scottish mp i focus on scotland and as a glasgow mp i focus on glasgow but let we start in the moray firth where my mother come from it have a fine tradition of engineering for those who follow highland league football i suspect i be in a minority of in the house today the fact that forres mechanics be of the old football club in the north of scotland point to a tradition of engineering there the jones shipyard in buckie be another great engineering industry in the north of scotland 
 of significantly more relevance to this debate be that forres be home to orbex which be develop a rocket call prime it will be the uk manufacture and uk launch orbital rocket prime be set to take off from saxavord in prime be set to take off from saxavord in the uk government have recently announce a £ investment in orbex an important investment that demonstrate the opportunity be bring to the north of scotland for which we need to redouble our effort to secure economic growth and prosperity 
 my home city of glasgow have a rich history of innovation and an incredibly promising cluster of space expertise as a glasgow mp i be determined that it should have a bright future in space glasgow be build more satellite than any other city in europe there be    fantastic company in the area include alba orbital which specialise in pocketqube satellite aac clyde space which have expertise in small satellite technology and spire global which be a lead provider of space base data analytic and space service this year be glasgow ’s birthday the bill will help secure the prosperity of glasgow for the next year create job and economic growth in my great city of hard work innovation and enterprise 
 there be clear economic analysis that show that the space industry be an important opportunity area for growth and job the late size and health of the uk space industry report estimate that organisation in scotland generate a combined income of £ in almost double that of in real term about people work in space in scotland and the figure for the uk be between and income amount to between £ and £ there be more than job in the supply chain as well 
 let we pause for a moment on that we have only just get go on this and we have or more job there be much potential here for many more good high pay job of the future which be what britain need 
 the deputy chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no 
 the house divide ayes noes 
 question accordingly negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 i begin my career as a teacher i enter the classroom in at the time we be just begin to see the use of smartphone among teenager there be the odd phone in the classroom and the odd instance of a child be bully through their device but neither i nor any other teacher at the time could have imagine the impact these device would come to play in childhood 
 from speak to child and parent today it be clear that child ’s excessive screen time and unhealthy social medium use be fuel family dispute childhood unhappiness and parental concern the length and breadth of our country the problem be grow and voice of concern be get louder it be now time to act 
 today the average year old spend hour a week on their smartphone which be the equivalent of full day of school teaching a week of to year old be active social medium user and of teenager spend most of their free time on their screen this be a fundamental rewiring of childhood itself and it have happen in little over a decade 
 child be spend less time outside and less time reading exercise explore meet people and communicating in person all the thing that make childhood special and be necessary for healthy childhood development instead many of our child now spend their time capture by addictive social medium and smartphone use often sit alone doomscrolle be bombard by unrealistic representation of life communicate through asynchronous large group chat rather than by look at facial expression eye contact and body language or learn to interact move less smile less learn less and grow increasingly anxious and depressed 
 this rewiring of childhood have only winner the balance sheet of social medium company their business model the very essence of their business be build around monetise attention as their understanding of our consumer habit and technology improve the encroachment on childhood be set to get bad and bad 
 what have be the impact of this transformation on childhood the use of smartphone and social medium have grow in parallel with a sharp increase in depression and anxiety among teenager the trend have be reflect around the world and the trend line everywhere have tightly follow another great time spend on social medium and smartphone have run in parallel with high rate of anxiety and depression what be the credible explanation for this phenomenon for the worldwide explosion in adolescent mental health problem if not social medium and smartphone use 
 i be sure that nobody here need i to highlight the crisis face by child and adolescent mental health service our nhs be desperate for any action that might help to address this the threat pose to our child by excessive screen time be not limited though to just their mental health there be increase evidence of a strong association between screen time and childhood obesity smartphone   use also affect sleep child be more likely to sleep less than the recommend hour if they use their phone some of teenager nearly half stay awake beyond midnight most week this of course also have an effect on learn in teenager admit that their smartphone be distract they in school and from the grade that they could achieve 
 for some child the ubiquitous use of smartphone have force they into a world of round the clock inescapable bullying and abuse over of girl and young woman have experience online harm in the last year the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children have report an rise in childhood online grooming crime in the last year and ofsted find that of girl and nearly half of all boy have be send explicit picture or video 
 this bombardment on childhood have not go unnoticed outside of this building across the country the number of incredible campaigner who have build huge community call for change have directly lead to today ’s debate that be why i need to take a moment to thank all those who have contribute in some way to the development of this bill and this debate many of whom be in the public gallery i must reserve my big thank to ben kingsley of safe screens and joe and daisy ryrie and everyone else at smartphone free childhood i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests to see the value of the contribution in kind that they have make to get we here today i be extremely grateful for all their hard work and dedication to this cause their continued leadership on this issue give i enormous confidence that law will ultimately change to tackle these issue 
 i also put on record my thank to the ten of thousand of parent who write to their mps via smartphone free childhood and i apologise to the member of this house who get extra email to respond to in the process 
 i would like to associate myself with my hon friend ’s warm word about daisy and joe who be both constituent of mine do he also recognise the impact that their ambition have have and will continue to have long after this debate their dedicated work have help to start real and meaningful conversation about smartphone usage in school across the uk 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the campaign they have start will only grow over time 
 i agree with the hon gentleman ’s comment so far but the email i have receive from constituent who support his campaign make reference to raise the age of internet adulthood from to and to help support the ban on phone in school be bring by mp josh macalister he will forgive i for say that nothing he have say so far require legislation the bill he have bring could all be achieve by the minister just decide to ask the chief medical officer to produce a report or the minister produce a plan what have happen to the legislative action that be clearly in early draft of his legislation and which campaigner clearly want 
 i will get to that in my speech i be keen to get on to those point and i will address the question the hon gentleman have ask 
 the smartphone free childhood campaign have grow from member to over in less than a year which show the strength of feeling in the country on this issue 
 it would be remiss of i not to start by thank my hon friend for the leadership he have show on the issue he have start a big conversation not just in this chamber but right across the country that be certainly true in my constituency where we have a fantastic local smartphone free childhood campaign group and lot of the young people i meet on my school visit and in campaign conversation across the constituency have real concern about this topic as always the view of parent and young people on these thing tend to lead the way do he agree that as well as be ambitious about gather evidence we will need to become more comfortable with the idea of legislate in this area with the same precautionary principle that we apply in every other aspect of child ’s life to ensure that we protect they from the harm they be express to we 
 i completely agree that progress be inevitable give the strength of feeling in the country on the matter 
 i be grateful for the substantive research document pull together by rachel tom and the team at nesta which clearly demonstrate why action be need and for the polling and focus group research do by the new britain project and more in common which show how popular take action be among child themselves as well as parent thank also go to arabella skinner and dr becky foljambe at health professionals for safer screens and all the health professional they mobilise to engage with the development of the bill who witness at hand the impact of excessive screen time on the physical and mental health of the nation ’s child 
 our teacher and school leader be also on the frontline of see the impact on child in their care i thank in particular the headteacher of the john wallis academy damian mcbeath who organise hundred of his colleague in support of the bill teach the ambition institute all the school and academy trust leader who back the bill and the teaching union the association of school and college leaders the national association of head teachers nasuwt and in particular the national education union which be lead a big campaign on social medium and smartphone use with a report out just this morning 
 child ’s charity be alive to the detrimental impact of smartphone and social medium use on this generation and i have be delighted to have the backing of the big barnardo ’s the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children action for children the national children ’s bureau and the children ’s society that be in addition to datum and testimony provide by uk youth onside the scouts girlguiding coram and the king ’s trust they have make their mark on this debate a special mention go to the current and former children ’s commissioner for england for their backing 
 organisation represent parent have be vocal about the need for further action and i record my thank to sue rhiannon and the wonderful team at mumsnet for all their coverage and for the debate they have instigate on the topic i also thank parentzone and parentkind for their contribution to the bill hearing i also thank all the other member of the public and professional who come to the bill hearing process there be too many to mention but they certainly make an impact on the members of parliament who attend 
 finally i thank the 5rights foundation and member of the bereaved families for online safety group who i meet alongside my hon friend   the member for darlington lola mcevoy they experience the most devastating consequence of smartphone and social medium use they have do what many would find so difficult to do and have turn personal tragedy into a campaign for urgent change i want to thank ellen roome mariano janin lisa kenevan ruth moss lorin lafave amanda and stuart stephens and esther ghey for their bravery and for engage with the development of the bill 
 with the problem so stark and the call for change so loud what be be do to respond to those issue around the world just this week the republican governor of the conservative state of utah have pass america ’s law mandate age verification for app store to ensure that child use only age appropriate app when their parent be happy for they to do so australia have legislate for an outright ban on social medium below the age of which will come into force later this year and last week denmark move to ban mobile phone in school and after school club last year norway increase the minimum age limit on social medium to by change the age of consent for datum sharing france have do the same and have push for measure to be take across the eu will it be just british child who be leave unprotected against addictive harm of smartphone and social medium we can not let that happen we must act 
 it be time that we catch up that be why i be so pleased to be debate this issue today follow month of engagement across government and beyond with hundred of health and education professional child ’s youth and online safety charity parent and young people themselves i introduce the bill because of the stark difference between conversation take place out there in the country and the debate that we have here in the nation ’s parliament it be fair to say that the public be well ahead of politician on this issue today mark progress towards parliament finally catch up with the mood of the nation 
 the bill have be draft to secure explicit government backing it have be write to achieve change rather than just to highlight the issue that be why it be narrow than where i start when this campaign begin month ago i hope that the minister will confirm in his response that the government will take forward the measure in the bill what do the bill do most importantly it commit the government to come back within a year with a decision on whether to raise the digital age of consent from to under general datum protection regulation the standard age of consent be set at however country can choose to vary it to as low as which be what the uk choose to do at the time the appropriateness of that decision must be    assess give the way in which social medium company be now use teenager datum to keep they hooked to their platform 
 i thank my hon friend for all the work that he have do on this issue when decision maker choose to set the age at rather than what evidence do they use and what detailed work do they do to ensure that the decision be ground in evidence and good for child 
 i thank my hon friend for that important question most country land on the age of as a result of a protract negotiation in the us senate about datum and online safety many year ago that policy be not base on evidence it be base on the compromise of a committee in another country we must base such decision on evidence and there be no firm evidence for pick over any other age 
 alarm bell on the question of datum and consent be already ring just this week the information commissioner announce an investigation into how tiktok use the personal information of to year old in order to make recommendation to they change the digital age of consent would give parent more control over who access their child ’s datum and it would dumb down the powerful algorithm that feed child addictive content 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman on introduce the bill in the way he have and on become a parliamentary private secretary do he support the bill go into committee i think there be consensus across the house that it should be give its reading if it be not give its reading however it will not go into committee and we will not be able to discuss in further detail the point that he be make 
 the hon member be of course a connoisseur of private member bills and have be know not to be keen to see many of they make it to committee i be sure he will not mind i gently make the point that i be here today as so many member be to make a difference and ensure that the government take action 
 the bill also commit the government to instruct the uk chief medical officer to update and reissue guidance for parent and professional about the impact of excessive screen time and social medium use on child it be nearly year since that guidance be last issue and we have see the positive impact of recent guidance elsewhere such as in america where the surgeon general advice have state more recently 
 social medium have not be prove safe 
 and that 
 child and adolescent who spend more than hour a day on social medium face double the risk of mental health problem include experience symptom of depression and anxiety 
 that advice lead to call in the us for cigarette packet style health warning on social medium website 
 i thank the hon gentleman for this important bill and the way in which he be present it this week in the education centre at michael hall school i meet a level   student who be very concerned about the addictive nature of what they be see they absolutely want to see action i applaud he for listen to uk youth girlguiding and other who feel exactly the same they want action now all power to he we need to push the government for change because a year or month in childhood be a long time for that addiction to grow and not be challenge 
 i completely agree that there be an urgency to this issue and the strength of feel out in the country among not just parent but child themselves show that we should take action 
 i thank my hon friend for the national debate he have stimulate about this we should all be grateful to he for that i wonder what advice be already available to parent from the national health service particularly in scotland i could find no guidance on screen time on the nhs scotland website on the website for my health board nhs lothian i find guidance for parent with the very young child in glasgow which be scotland ’s city i have to stress it do not even have a castle the health board offer guidance that date from thing have move on since then and surely parent deserve to have the very late guidance when it come to consider this matter 
 i thank my hon friend for make that point update advice from the nation cmo be so important because it can cascade through health system to guide professional and parent 
 finally the bill call on government to conduct more research and far develop the evidence and guidance that be so important for future action give how rapidly these device and service be develop it be vital that parent and carer be give up to date advice on the harm their child might be expose to 
 why have this not be do before the technology company that be profiteer off this rewiring of childhood be incredibly effective at cast doubt over any evidence of a link between screen time and negative impact on child this be not the time an industry have fight against a tide of evidence in order to keep peddle their product in the 1960 the tobacco industry be lobby hard against the link between smoking and cancer in the absence of evidence of a causal link they cast doubt on the overwhelming correlational evidence available 
 in the end our government act on the basis of correlational study use criterion set by the epidemiologist sir austin bradford hill the criterion attempt to help policymaker to make decision when causal study do not exist his criterion include that 
 consistent finding observe by different person in different place with different sample strengthen the likelihood of an effect 
 for example the fact that student across the western world begin report feel increasingly lonely in school from be important another criterion be that 
 great exposure should generally lead to great incidence of the effect 
 essentially the dose response effect 
 study of multiple large dataset include the uk ’s own millennium cohort study show that teenager who be heavy user of social medium be more likely to suffer from depression anxiety eat disorder body dysmorphia and other mental health harm it could take year for evidence of a causal link through scientific study to be establish in the meantime our child ’s mental and physical health degrade their education continue to be affect and evidence of a correlation get strong and strong as lawmaker we must use tool such as the bradford hill test to make the good possible decision with what we know now we must act on excessive screen time today in the same way that we act on smoke back then like debate that be have on smoking and car seatbelt it take a process of legislation rather than big bang event that be why start with these initial step today then follow they through with major action soon will be so important 
 let i address head on the argument make against take action to curb social medium and smartphone use by child as i see it there be common argument against action be that there be not enough evidence to act over the past few month i and other have have a number of evidence session and engagement with expert that have show that that be plainly untrue even so where should the burden of evidence sit should it sit with parent and campaigner who have notice the damage be do to their child with child themselves who be call for more support or with the company who be sell they product and service that be design to be addictive and have completely transform the nature of their childhood 
 when it come to protect child from harm a precautionary approach be surely advise for almost any other product company would have to prove that it be safe before sell it to child rather than be free to sell that product as they wish until the evidence of harm become so overwhelming that something need to be do it be instructive that the us surgeon general advice state that social medium have not yet be prove safe 
 be the argument that this be simply the late in a line of moral panic people use to fear that watch too much television would turn their eye square in the victorian era that read novel would degrade intellect or in the century that play violent videogame would turn all our child into thug but for every example of overblown moral panic we have many more example of genuine public health crisis that we take too long to address but eventually be force to tackle research that have come out this morning from more in common demonstrate that this be not an issue of luddite old generation bemoan shift social trend concern about social medium and smartphone use be dominant in every generation and half of generation z regret the amount of time that they be spend on social medium 
 the argument i hear be that the genie be out of the bottle and it be too late to do anything now phone and social medium be undoubtedly here to stay but their harm do not need to be regulation can find a way of allow child to experience the benefit of this technology without be expose relentlessly to its harm as introduce seatbelt law save thousand of life from road traffic accident without kill off the car industry introduce a virtual seatbelt can protect   child from excessive screentime action in other country and our experience with the online safety act early though it be have show that tech company be not beyond the power of government 
 the argument which tend to come from big tech be that proper age verification be too difficult and age restriction unproven that the technology do not exist or be imperfect as company such as yoti and many other age verification platform show that be no long the case i be also a technology optimist the reason why this technology be not yet pervasive be insufficient demand introduce the regulation and technology will have to catch up we will see that in australia later this year 
 there be some suggestion that it be not the government ’s job to get involve and that this be an issue of parental responsibility that miss the point that this be a collective action problem parent and child alone be not able to establish new share rule for something that be addictive at a societal level the reason why smartphone and social medium be cause so much stress and conflict in family be that we be give parent the unenviable choice of either remove device and ostracise their child or give into demand for access and live with the health sleep and learn consequence 
 additionally not only be parental control at device operating system and app level confusing and opaque but our own exist datum law give child as young as the power over their datum that mean that they can opt out of those parental control in year of secondary school we disempower parent on a problem that be common across society then when they ask for help we say that it be a matter of personal responsibility i hope that today ’s debate can bury the argument that responsibility for this problem lie with parent struggle with that impossible challenge 
 i just think my hon friend might like know that i will not be make any of the argument that he be argue i should not argue 
 i welcome the minister ’s intervention and i be glad to have box off those 
 there be moment when politic fall behind the public mood the process and tradition of our democratic system make it difficult to keep up with the rapidly evolve world of tech and social medium but this parliament work well when it be a reflection of the problem and concern of the people and a chamber for earnest problem solve and action over the last few month i have be encourage by the sheer volume of support for this bill and this debate which come from across the country across the age and across the house my firm belief be that unless we as politician be able to be the disruptor on this issue and solve it we will be leave be disrupt by it act assertively together and soon will bring benefit for our tech industry and public service the quality of family life in the uk and most importantly the opportunity for our child for those reason i commend this bill to the house 
 the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister from the far and beautiful north west have make an extremely strong case for the original bill that   he envisage bring before this house i be afraid that today i will speak not to celebrate progress but to lament the gutting of what could have be a landmark bill 
 sadly this government like the last notwithstanding the online safety act have dither diluted and capitulate and i be afraid that what remain be a hollow out gesture and an opportunity miss as the hon gentleman say the evidence be strong the damage be profound and the public support be overwhelming documentary after documentary detail the significant damage be do to our young people on a daily basis parent after parent in million of home across the land be scream for help and assistance from the government as the hon gentleman rightly point out we be allow smoking for the brain in our young child with the long term impact that that will have i be afraid to say that in the face of all that overwhelming evidence and momentum the hon gentleman have be do over in bring forward this bill when we look at what we be present with as i say we have nothing more than a gesture 
 the point be that the cmo should bring forward guidance as the hon gentleman surely know there be already plenty of guidance out there for parent the nspcc have online guidance as do internet matter lot of organisation include school themselves be issue guidance for parent in truth the cmo produce guidance within month will be no more effective than those organisation have be and possibly less as the hon gentleman himself point out we be deal with a collective action issue an organisation can issue guidance and a small percentage of parent may pick up that guidance and observe it but if the percentage be below so strong be the peer pressure and so addictive be what we be deal with that those parent end up in scream match with their teenage child on a daily basis 
 by explain that there be so many fragmented and no doubt contradictory source of information surely the right hon gentleman be make the argument for there to be a single source of advice to parent right across the united kingdom surely this bill will create an authoritative set of guidance for parent that they can share with their child 
 i be not convince that the guidance create by this bill will be any more authoritative than that create by the nspcc or by internet matters the point i be make be not necessarily that the guidance be go to be pivotal but that we need to get to a critical mass of observance before guidance be likely to have any impact the original bill be likely to do that not least through the ban in school which create a nucleus of clear space for child that could be translate into home many member may have hear on the bbc this morning a short piece on the fulham boy school which have an absolute ban on even bring a smartphone to school that ban during the school period have result in the period before and after school also be phone free and therefore much more social and beneficial to those pupil 
 i urge the right hon gentleman to be slightly less sceptical about the value of cmo advice as he know i have campaign for many year on   acquire brain injury particularly in relation to concussion or sub concussive event in sport it be a very significant change when under the previous administration the british government bring forward specific advice in relation to concussion in sport that have change practice in lot of sport around the country and i be hopeful that authoritative advice of this kind could make a significant difference 
 i would be willing to accept the hon gentleman ’s encouragement if this be advice to school but it be not it be advice to parent and carer if there be go to be authoritative advice for school as well as other organisation that have charge of child scout troop child ’s club and other publicly fund organisation that look after child i would have say possibly even though there be to be a month delay before the cmo tell we stuff we already know as the hon member for whitehaven and workington point out 
 the step be for the government to publish a plan for research within month that be not the conclusion of research and there be no time limit just a plan a vague aspiration that we should have a plan with no commencement no sense of budget and no idea of when it might come i be sorry to say that the hon member for whitehaven and workington have be sell a cosmetic pup 
 the and final point be that the government have to publish this assessment”—whatever that may be which as far as i can see be fundamentally to tell we something we already know and which the hon gentleman have illustrate extremely vividly we should all be furious about the delay and prevarication that be be inject into what could have be a huge step forward for parent and child 
 i be of the people who be very angry about this and my right hon friend be a co sponsor of this bill so his disappointment must be even great however do he agree that way forward would be for this bill with its present inadequate drafting to get its reading and go into committee the people ’s representative in committee would then be able to restore the bill into something close to what they expect 
 i be go to come on to that later but my hon friend be completely right 
 i support very much what the right hon gentleman be say about the need for urgent action what conversation be have before   july   last year about tighten up legislation around smartphone because this problem do not start on the day of the general election but be there when his party be in government 
 as i say at the start of my speech i lament the dithering and delay by the previous government too there be attempt by back benchers and i be for the last year of the government to change the online safety bill to take exactly these sort of measure that be rebuff by ministers at that stage and i regret that completely to i this be a national if not international emergency about which we be be   far too passive and complacent i be not necessarily make a political point about this it be about the weight of government and frankly the weight and influence of big tech against the health and welfare of our child that apply to government of all stripe in all country across the world 
 it be not just we in this chamber who should be furious there be plenty of people out there in the country who should be furious because key thing be promise in the original bill the be an absolute school ban all members will know that when they go to visit school of the feature come through strongly when we talk to headteacher be the increase in parental aggression towards school the source of conflict at the school gate be around all sort of issue not least the use of phone in school by advocate a complete blanket ban on phone in school we would be remove at stroke a source of conflict between parent and teacher as well as at the same time create completely clear space for those kid to concentrate on their education in school upon school across the country they be bring in their own policy often in the tooth of opposition whether parental or from child their life be make immeasurably more difficult by not have an absolute ban 
 the thing that be promise and the reason why we should be furious be the raising of the digital age of consent by not include that in the bill we be consent to those tech company as they have admit in meeting in the run up to this bill use child ’s datum to addict they to their service we know that happen and we see it happen anybody who have a teenage child and have try desperately to move they off from cradle this precious phone at the dinner table or even from watch tv at the same time will see how they can not get away from their phone and will realise the addictive nature the fact that neither of those step be now in the bill be i be afraid deeply lamentable 
 it feel to i as though the government have capitulate to big tech i have a look online to see i be not cast aspersion but it would be helpful if the minister could tell we in his remark what meeting he have with big tech company in the run up to this bill and whether he have consult or speak to they interruption the minister be indicate and that be useful to know but i can not then understand why the government have pressure the new member for whitehaven and workington to produce what be frankly a cosmetic pup betray our child and capitulate to big tech i be afraid that this bill be a shell of what it could have be and as a result be yet another miss opportunity to improve the life of our young people 
 i start by pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   for introduce this bill and for his work to advance the debate on the need for action to halt the harm cause by mobile phone and screen time to our child and young people 
 less than a year ago in the previous parliament the education committee publish a report on the impact of screen time on education and wellbeing base on a careful examination of the evidence the committee conclude that 
 the harm of screen time and social medium use significantly outweigh the benefit for young child whereas limited use of screen and genuinely educational us of digital technology can have benefit for old child 
 it be worth restate the evidence that the committee look at we see a increase in child ’s screen time between and and it have continue to rise since that time per cent of child and young people use their phone in a way that be consistent with behavioural addiction a staggering statistic in child age between and have their own mobile phone in child have their own phone by the age of and almost all year old have their own mobile phone this be a very rapid change in behaviour which have happen without any corresponding policy or regulatory framework 
 there be substantial evidence of the negative effect of the rapid increase in the use of smartphone by child research by the children ’s commissioner find that of child have encounter violent pornography online by the age of girl and young woman be particularly affect by the pressure to conform with the unrealistic body image that they see on social medium it be not only girl and young woman eat disorder and body dysmorphia be also rise rapidly in boy and young man 
 per cent of girl age to have experience some form of threaten or upset behaviour online mobile phone use be fuel a rapid increase in sexual crime commit against child online up since in child age to have experience at least type of bully behaviour online and quarter of they say that this have happen either at school or during school time 
 there be impact on learn at home and in the classroom too it can take up to minute for pupil to refocus on what they be learn after engage in non academic activity on their phone child have bad working memory processing speed attention level language skill and executive function the sheer amount of time spend look at screen be also contribute to our child become more sedentary and less active 
 as with all harm affect child it be those with the great vulnerability who suffer the most child in care care leaver young carer child live in poverty and child with additional need be the most susceptible to online harm vulnerable child be also at risk of criminal exploitation when use their screen social medium and online gaming have be describe by those lead the work to tackle county line exploitation as the foundation of county line recruitment 
 the crisis in the mental health and wellbeing of our child and young people be well document we be raise a generation of child and young people who be struggle with anxiety depression body image issue and eat disorder 
 every generation of parent have to help their child navigate a set of challenge that they do not have to face themselves screen time and social medium be surely the parenting challenge of our generation we have ample evidence of the harm that be be do we also understand much more than previous generation about child ’s brain development and the way that    the vital building block of their brain develop rapidly during childhood and we know that screen time be quite literally rewire young brain 
 the hon lady ’s speech be fascinating what she be say be reflect by correspondence in my inbox from parent say we need help and from youngster say we know our concentration level at school be affect we know it ’ an addiction this issue be unite family in that way and i hope that the hon lady who chair the education committee can push the government on behalf of both parent and child for a change in outcome 
 the education committee will certainly continue to take this issue extremely seriously and to monitor what happen and i will say a little about that in a moment 
 we know that screen time be quite literally rewire young brain result in low cognitive ability and affect language acquisition critical thinking social skill and attention span 
 when the government have evidence of harm they have a duty to act the point of legislation in this case be its power to change societal norm in a way that will make a difference to parent and professional who be currently struggle to limit the harm of screen time but lack the back up to do so there be many comparable example with smoking and seatbelt be the most obvious in which the evidence of harm become clear but the debate rag for many year with counter argument against legislation 
 as the hon lady say   the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   have do an enormous amount of work and it be obviously desirable for the government to act in the face of evidence do she think that the bill as negotiate with the government constitute action 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for help i out at a difficult moment i have now find the correct place in my speech and i will tell he what i believe should happen next 
 the debate about both smoking and seatbelt rag for year with much controversy at the time some be demand high and high level of proof while other argue that the matter could be deal with simply through guidance and through individual choose to change their behaviour 
 do the hon lady recognise that unlike the indoor smoking ban in particular the regulation of mobile technology and social medium be very much not a off event when the bill that be to become the online safety act be publish it be genuinely world lead in many respect but as   the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   point out many country have now introduce measure that go far should we not be take action now and then continue to develop it rather than just introduce a series of review 
 if the hon gentleman will bear with i for a moment i will come to some of the point that i think he want to emphasise in the end in both those case seatbelt and smoking legislation have   the effect of change behaviour and change societal norm and in both case decade on from the introduction of legislation it be hard to imagine that the regulation be ever controversial 
 last year the select committee recommend action across department to protect child from addiction online harm and the mental health impact of excessive use of smartphone it support a ban on mobile phone in school and recommend a formal monitoring mechanism for a ban introduce through guidance potentially lead to a ban in legislation it recommend guidance for parent whom it find to be lack in confidence when it come to know exactly how to tackle this issue affect child and young people and recommend that the guidance should include particularly for parent of baby and very young child an emphasis on the importance of face to face interaction with their child and guidance on the impact of screen use by parent while care for very young child that be an aspect that we do not debate enough in this place the select committee support an increase to as the age of digital consent and recommend among other development the promotion of a child ’s class of phone that can be use for parental contact and for gps location but not for internet access 
 i share the worry express by many member that the government be not act with the urgency that be require in the face of the evidence they already have the bill will deliver even in the form in which it have be present today some positive intervention that will make a difference but i fear that the government be do too little too slowly parent want strong legislation school want strong legislation and strong legislation will help to change societal norm in the way that be need to protect child and young people and to stop the harm 
 the education committee will take a close interest in what happen from now on the impact of the measure that the government be introduce but i urge the government to get on quickly with the review and the guidance to which they will commit themselves today and to go far and establish with urgency and speed a framework in law that can help parent school and professional work with child to deal with a challenge that we all need to get to grip with 
 i be pleased to speak in support of the bill i must start by declare an interest i be a mother of child who enjoy nothing more than star at their screen day in day out if they could they would be on they no long be our child clamour to go out and play or to see their friend instead they want to do everything through a screen they want to watch endless youtube video i never realise that the unpacking of a toy or slime making could hold such interest it seem that they take their joy in watch other do thing online even rather bizarrely play computer game instead of actually do they in the real world 
 i would be a hypocrite if i do not call out my own behaviour on this front i too be addicted to my phone yes i need it for this job so i can justify some of my   use but i often find myself endlessly doomscrolle and i be too embarrassed to tell the house how many hour i spend star at it every week at least my addiction start when i be a fully develop adult after a childhood of play and socialisation when i learn much need life skill this generation of child be not so lucky 
 the huge amount of time spend online be incredibly damaging in so many way it be no coincidence that we see a mental health crisis in our young people at the same time as mass adoption of smartphone and access to social medium some may underplay the importance of social medium and screen in the challenge we face as a society and indeed it can be difficult to conclusively prove the role of particular factor in the effect we be see but i suggest that when it come to our child we should always err on the side of caution and protect they from potentially harmful influence in a recent survey social medium and excessive screen time be rank as the top issue affect child ’s mental wellbeing to put that in context it be rank high than alcohol and bullying 
 another significant risk to mental health be exposure to harmful online content i be incredibly concerned about that especially give the proliferation of extreme pornography harmful content and unrealistic body image if child spend all their time in this fantasy world that be completely disjoint from reality of course it will change how they view people relationship and the world in general that be support by ofcom ’s research which show that old teen be find it hard to distinguish the real from the fake online the more mundane thing in life that do not trigger a dopamine hit seem an even less appealing way to spend time to a child jack up on like and share child ’s attention span be get short and they have an ever increase need for high level of stimulation be it any wonder that our child seem less interested in read a book or bake a cake nowadays 
 the evidence from health professionals for safer screens show that child who routinely spend extended period on their smartphone have poorer eyesight inhibited speech and language development interrupted sleep and rise rate of anxiety we be allow our child to become addict social medium be design with exactly that in mind it be mean to be addictive and compelling it want user to stay online for prolonged period and to keep engage with content those of we who use it ourselves know this all to be true so how on earth do we expect our child to manage and moderate appropriately 
 ofcom ’s research show that the overall use of social medium site or app among to year old have increase year on year online gaming among that group have also increase significantly as have the watching of livestreamed content under current datum protection law the age at which child can access information society service iss be iss include most social medium platform and content streaming service it be important to acknowledge that the online safety act introduce protection for child by ensure that online platform will have to remove illegal content such as child sexual abuse material prevent child from access harmful content for example that encourage suicide self harm or bullying and introduce age check measure to    restrict access to pornographic material those be all very welcome improvement but they need to be put in place at pace and be effectively enforce 
 i commend   the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   for all his work on this important topic i will do all i can to support he in make the online world safe for our child the bill be an important precursor to the myriad change need in this area and i know that many parent will support he in call for the digital age of consent to be look at again while the bill do not call for the age limit to be raise to it do call for the uk ’s chief medical officer to look at this important issue in detail and ultimately issue a statement on whether it should be raise 
 some of brits now back raise the minimum age from to as per a recent survey by more in common for all the reason that have be raise today and people sign an e petition call for social medium company to be ban from let child under create social medium account it be past time for tech company and member of this house to take responsibility for keep our child and young people safe 
 i be not normally in favour of blanket ban and i often talk about the importance of parent and carer take responsibility for their child however in this instance i deviate a little as a parent who be wrangle with this exact issue myself i know how difficult it be to tell a child that they can not do something that every single other child in their class be do if their group of friend interact only online what be the consequence for my child if i prohibit they from join in isolation loneliness loss of self esteem there be very real cost that should not be underestimate which be why the state need to step in member will not often hear i say this but the state need to step in and remove the option for all help parent across the country who want the good for their child without the downside 
 my hon friend vividly illustrate the problem with this kind of collective action and peer pressure have she reflect on the fact that it be not just the addictive nature of the application that be pull in our kid but the fact that they be free and therefore everybody be encourage to get they we then get coverage and it be very hard to deny they to our child if they will be the only child without 
 i concur with everything my right hon friend say it be completely accessible to all our child so it be very hard for child to be keep separate from it that be why it be important that we address it 
 however increase the digital age of consent be just the step we have so much more to do we also need to ban smartphone in school for child under the age of on a typical workday of old teenager say their smartphone be distract they from schoolwork and half say that social medium have distract they enough to impact their grade notably only of school be genuinely smartphone free and child at these school get gcse result to grade high so there be clearly a big upside to ban smartphone in school i urge the government to seriously consider implement this much need restriction which would be a game changer protect child and improve   educational outcome in fell swoop our school need this ban in statute not just in guidance in order to be able to effectively police and enforce it i pay tribute to smartphone free childhood for all its work to raise awareness on this important issue 
 in closing i hope that member will support the bill today which would move we forward in our mission to protect our child from an increasingly insidious online realm that they be simply not equipped to navigate i also hope that this be just the beginning and that in move forward we will see the digital age of consent raise to and a ban on smartphone in school the value of those change alone would be huge for our society and would safeguard the wellbeing of this and future generation of child i can not think of anything more important 
 i come to this debate as somebody who buy their mobile phone year ago at the age of i be hop member would look more surprised at that laughter 
 division 
 i thank the minister for that i remember clearly the joy of phone the landline from bed and ask my housemate to bring i a cup of tea the excitement of send and receive my text message and the infantile joy of play snake while wait for a train no could have predict where we would be by this point 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   for introduce the bill which be an essential step forward for online safety it demonstrate his genuine commitment to address this critical issue and raise awareness in this place and across the country of the press need for a legally recognise age of internet adulthood to correspond with the very adult content available online for too long tech boss have move forward unchecked while our child have bear the consequence of algorithm that at well be design to create a generation of screen addict and at worst expose young people to harmful and disturbing content 
 year ago many tech leader claim that the rise mental health crisis among child and young people be unrelated to screen use however emerge datum refute that a study from king ’s college london reveal that nearly 25%—one in for those who still use old money of child and young people engage with their smartphone in a manner consistent with behavioural addiction indeed we be not deal with the same passive tech boss who be satisfied in just promote that addictive quality to sell their platform to child even in the past year the digital landscape have shift so much that some tech boss be actively refuse to remove violent material and eat disorder content from their platform under the guise that do so would infringe those individual free speech as we all know there be a considerable disparity between the which be why i strongly support raise the age of digital adulthood 
 this issue be particularly urgent in my constituency of the isle of wight west where young people face some of the high rate of under-18 mental health and   self harm relate hospital admission in the south east they be also among the high in the country access the necessary support be make even more difficult by the island ’s isolation the high cost and limited availability of ferry travel hon member be wait for i to say that create significant barrier leave many young people struggle without the help they need already face the pressure of an increasingly connect world they be far disadvantage by transport restriction that make seek specialist care on the mainland far more challenging 
 tech company have prove time and again that they see kid as nothing more than pound sign the more time that platform can keep child glue to their screen the more money they make and they achieve that by maliciously harvest their datum and use it to push content design to keep they hooked prioritise what be most addictive over what be safe by prohibit tech company from collect datum from under-16 the bill would aim at the heart of the exploitative algorithm design to keep young user online for long it would ensure that child be no long target with addictive content design to prioritise profit over their wellbeing i therefore support the bill 
 i congratulate   the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   on bring his private member ’s bill to the house i be proud to be of its sponsor it have clearly be a complicated journey to get to this point and the bill may not resemble quite what he originally have in mind but the sheer fact of introduce the bill have light up a national conversation about the impact of smartphone use and social medium on our child the conversation be grow ever louder but it have now spill over passionately into the inboxe of nearly every member of the house 
 the bill may not be as ambitious as some would like and the wheel may turn slowly in this place far slow than the lightning pace of modern tech but i assure every of my constituent in south devon who write to i about the bill and who campaign loudly on this topic that their voice have be hear within the bound of our political system we as mps parent and grandparent not only have hear they but share their concern i hope that this be just the step on a journey that will be far reach and fairly swift 
 i know that i be not alone in be somewhat disappointed that the bill be but a shadow of its former self and that the government be so timid in what they be willing to do to try to save our child and young people from something that be clearly cause they considerable harm that be why the liberal democrats have decide to pick up the baton and table an amendment to the data use and access bill call on the government to bring uk datum law into line with many other european country by raise to the minimum age that a user must be before an internet company can collect process and store their datum without parental consent 
 i look forward to see the guidance from the uk chief medical officer on the impact of smartphone and social medium on child year be a long time in the   tech world and we know that much have change since the guidance be last write in i also welcome funding for more research into the impact of social medium and phone use i expect the new research will not differ too much from what have already be write follow study from various develop country include the uk japan canada and australia that over the past year a period in which smartphone usage have explode the number of mental health admission to hospital in teenager have rise by that admission for eat disorder among girl age to have go up by a staggering that childhood myopia be up that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis be up and that more and more child be struggle with difficult speech and language challenge no we can not say for sure that there be a direct causal link but we can see the trendline in the graph we know they start rise before the pandemic be ever hear of and we know it be not just the uk that be experience such troubling development 
 we do a lot to protect our child in this country and that be down to a mixture of practice custom and legislation we generally do not let our child smoke or drink and we certainly do not let they drive car we put baby in ever more sophisticated car seat and we know that it be not a good idea to put fizzy drink in baby bottle yet a recent ofcom report say of year old have a mobile phone of to year old have and most worrying still of to year old have yet medical professional from all discipline tell we of the harm child be experience from long hour spend glue to a screen 
 as a proud co sponsor of the bill i too have hear from health professional who have give evidence to we on mental health obesity eyesight and more we hear heart rend story from parent whose child have be subject to the most horrific online abuse and from some who have unbearably lose their precious child as a result of harm in the digital world while their story be extreme and deeply troubling somehow incredibly it do not even seem that shocking that the online world have work such devastating harm to real life 
 what be happen online be clearly impact the everyday life of child and teenager and we as responsible adult and legislator have a duty to try and mitigate those harm i be think particularly of the horrible dangerous misogyny of the like of andrew tate which be be lap up by boy who be under his influence boy who then spread his misogynistic hate speech i be think of the violent pornography which be be access and view by child as young as or pornography that be not just naked picture like you would find in an old fashioned top shelf magazine i ’m tell 
 you ’re not old enough 
 thank you 
 we know that violent pornography that celebrate assault and rape be lead to an increase in harmful practice such as strangulation that it warps the way young people view sexual relationship and that it be directly impact on health and wellbeing particularly of young woman across the country 
 yesterday this chamber hear some brilliant and impassioned speech from many woman hon member time to coincide with international women ’s day tomorrow and on a day that celebrate woman we think about girl too i do not want our girl to think they have to share nude photo to be like or to worry themselves sick about the shape of their body to the point that they stop eat 
 we have hear about the rise in the number of child who have speech and language challenge it be know that stick a baby in front of an ipad will not help it learn to communicate baby need interaction with human face and voice to learn we hear about how child ’s eyesight be worsen because they spend so many hour look at a closely hold screen we all know about the incessant rise in poor mental health anxiety and depression among teenager parent across my constituency of south devon be desperate to protect their child but overwhelm by the digital world and the power it have over young people they want we to support they with legislation so that they can push back against the might of the tech giant we must not let the tech giant lobby we in the way that tobacco company do so successfully for decade 
 child be addict to screen because of wicked algorithm that lure they in and keep they hooked struggle with their body image because they do not look like the influencer they be watch depress at their life because they do not resemble the doctored airbrush instagram image of perfection they see on their screen and brainwash by influencer who spew toxic message through their page they know this but they find it hard to counteract it and we know that the bright brain in the tech world have design social medium app to do exactly that former facebook employee say 
 you have a business model design to engage you and get you to basically suck as much time out of your life as possible and then sell that attention to advertiser 
 we must unlock the potential of technology by design it with child and young people in mind our amendment to the data use and access bill would not ban child under from social medium instead and more importantly online service would need to change how they deal with child ’s datum and create a less addictive more child friendly online environment our amendment call on the government to prioritise robust standard for digital technology so that right and privacy be uphold by design and default 
 in devon parent have sign the pact say that they will not buy their child a smartphone yet we know that tech use be of the big cause of friction in family and parent need our support to back that choice it be a public health matter the liberal democrats be open to the idea of a legal ban on smartphone use in school enshrine exist guidance into law we hope the government will look seriously at that this measure should not be about restrict freedom it should be about create an environment conducive to learn and free from distraction we also understand the need for discretion and exception must be make for young carer or child who use smartphone to monitor health condition ensure fairness and practicality 
 parent must be empower to protect their child online include through digital literacy education and advice and support for parent on good practice be key i also want to see a public health programme similar to those we have see on seatbelt and smoke over the year so that no parent can be leave unaware of the potential harm of let small child become addicted to a device that will cause so much harm as they grow 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   for the huge amount of work that he have put into this legislation i be proud to be a co sponsor of the bill in support of his tireless effort in this area his leadership and his lifelong commitment to safeguard child from harm 
 over the past month the bill have be a lightning rod for the conversation about child ’s access to smartphone and social medium the bill do not mark the end of that conversation rather it mark the start of a national debate on what childhood in the online age should look like i be glad that the government have positively engage with the bill and that through this legislation we can now see a path towards ensure that we give child the good possible and crucially the least harmful start in life 
 between and there be a increase in the number of child with a probable mental health condition include depression anxiety eat disorder and body dysmorphia the impact be particularly acute for young woman as many have mention screen time also have link to poor physical health outcome such as childhood obesity i be particularly concerned to learn in of the hearing on my hon friend ’s bill about datum link screen use to shortsightedness and bad eye health a report from the college of optometrists in find that case of myopia among child age to have rise by over the last year in the uk 
 heavy smartphone use also impact sleep pattern and the ability to fall and stay asleep as many of we will know study find that child be less likely to get the recommend hour of sleep if they use their phone that clearly have an effect on their attainment and life outcome indeed in teenager admit that their smartphone be distract they from schoolwork 
 clause require the uk chief medical officer to publish advice for parent and carer on the use of smart phone and social medium by child which we welcome this be particularly key because the issue of young people ’s smartphone and social medium require a public health focus as have be argue we know that almost all child have a smartphone by the age of and that as my hon friend say it be vulnerable child who be spend significantly long on their phone it be our duty in this place to protect child who be vulnerable and the most vulnerable child 
 for almost a quarter of child smartphone use have become a behavioural addiction and that be not accidental tech company have create product without the input of child development expert and we know this because they tell we that they do not have any child development expert on their product board when they come to a   session organise by my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington these algorithm seek to get young people hook before they can even properly comprehend it and like a drug they keep come back for more 
 child have sadly lose a love of reading with level at their low in the uk among our child and of the outdoor as jonathan haidt argue in his book the anxious generation childhood have cease to be play base and have become phone base this simultaneous over protectiveness offline and under protectiveness online have create a perfect storm for inhibit child ’s development for example we be witness a marked increase in referral for delayed speech and language ability there be now pram adaptation for baby and toddler to watch smartphone rather than learn from the stimulus of the real world around they i hope that the chief medical officer ’s remit extend to work with early childhood and speech and language organisation to issue guidance for parent in the very early year 
 the online world that we be send our child out into be not a world we would send they out into in real life and yet this be their real life child as young as be stumble across and be currently freely able to access pornographic content online the children ’s commissioner find that key area where child access pornography be perhaps surprisingly the social medium platform x. in child have encounter violent pornography online by the age of and that be have serious consequence desensitise young boy and girl and warp their perception of healthy sex and relationship 
 my hon friend make a very important point in this debate we be focus a lot on child but the reality be that these scar will endure for the rest of their life this access to pornography will scar their relationship and their ability to form relationship for the rest of their life which be another reason why the bill be so very important 
 i be incredibly grateful for my hon friend ’s intervention that be very true we have see a huge increase in the use of strangulation of woman in sexual relationship and there be much to suggest that this be relate to more and more young people watch strangulation in pornography online that be another subject but i would definitely like to see that go as well 
 it be really important that the commencement of age verification in the online safety act which be introduce by the previous government and support by those on the labour front bench at the time must be uphold and to the most robust standard i look forward to the minister say that that be exactly what the government will do 
 that be exactly what the government will do 
 i be grateful to the minister 
 social media be fuel the rise of extremist misogyny online and normalising harassment and violence against woman and girl in real life as my hon friend   the member for kettering rosie wrighting   so bravely   recount in this place yesterday we be not immune to that in this place some of girl say they have be send an explicit picture or video the new britain project more in common and the national education union recently run a focus group in my constituency with parent about their child ’s access to smartphone in the group a mother speak of how her daughter be so regularly send dick pic that by the age of she be use to draw a little sombrero on the picture send it back and block the sender the mother say 
 no child that age should be see male penis it be quite traumatic be n’t it for a kid to be witness that kind of thing but it be everywhere 
 child should not be force to find a way to cope with funny picture because something incessantly traumatise they we would not accept our child be flash in the street so why be it different online why do we not expect the tech company to act their product allow this to happen to our child all day every day yet we still do not have any movement from they 
 we know that the problem be only get bad particularly with the use of al and the rise of nude deepfake thankfully the government be now take strong action on deepfake but i urge they to go far by consider age verification for app store so that our young people know that when they access app store the content be right for their age and level of development 
 online sexual crime commit against child have rise by since a generation be grow up chronically online raise by the internet and we can not stand idly by in the name of freedom or freedom of speech there be no freedom in addiction in be harm or in child be underdeveloped because they have not experience socialisation the great outdoors the pleasure of book or simply not be harm by be send horrible thing that they should not have to see 
 child in the online world be teach to look up to role model with unhealthy opinion unrealistic beauty standard and conspicuous wealth beyond their dream child be be market to and sell to all day every day when they can not afford or look like what they see they feel worthless child be cyber bully they be expose to content that encourage self harm and competitive anorexia and romanticise suicide that have already cause untold harm for parent who have see their child take their own life after engage with such material our child be become infect by an epidemic of loneliness 
 at some point we in this place have to say enough be enough as a parent of young child i know that parent can not and should not be expect to do this alone we need a decisive legal and cultural shift that reclaim childhood for the real world every month there be a how to detox from social medium article about take ourselves away from toxic social medium just like how to detox after christmas we read that content as adult because we also struggle to stop look at social medium so why do we expect our child to exercise self control that we ourselves do not have 
 the uk must follow country such as australia by raise the age of online consent from to some of gen z and of parent in the uk support that idea and people recently sign a petition on the uk parliament website to that effect i also believe that we need to create a new watershed of social   norm by ban smartphone at school too many of the headteacher i speak to who be do the right thing by ban smartphone in their school tell i that they get complaint from student and parent who see that other school do thing differently it make it hard for parent to enforce rule and norm in their own home when they can not point to principle that the whole country adhere to 
 will my hon friend join i in congratulate anas sarwar the leader of the scottish labour party on announce week ago that he would ban mobile phone in school across scotland 
 of course i join my hon friend in those remark 
 parent and future generation will not forgive we if we do not act swiftly in the government ’s assessment under clause i hope that we will finally see a recognition that the status quo be not work for child or parent and that radical action be need only then can we work to ensure that child can grow up and develop without trauma without harm and without be addict to be harm and traumatise this bill get we close to that and i be happy to support it 
 our child ’s use of phone and social medium give we many thing to worry about but broadly speak they be group into category 
 the be about content go from pornography and violence and the insidious effect of curate life influencer and celebs on our child and their sense of self worth their body image and so on through to dodgy news and view propagate across the internet not by worth let alone veracity but by engagement and like all of those thing have vortex that child can get suck deeply and deep into 
 the be about contact contact include in the bad case child abuse and the generation of child sexual abuse material and go through to at a low level contact that can be from other child such as what we call in this house cyber bullying although no child ever use that phrase they just talk about people be very mean to each other online 
 the be about the sheer amount of child ’s time that get suck into these activity it be the compounding factor because it be the thing that make the other thing content and contact bad and more risky it also have an effect on child ’s sleep on their concentration and even on their physical development and it crowd out the other thing that we want child to be do and that child themselves want to be do when they do actually do they if we ever do get a child away from their phone for a full weekend they talk about how wonderful the experience be with their friend 
 the online safety act do some good thing on content and on contact there be more to do but it make some good progress we have a lot more to do in particular on the topic of time and the addictiveness of social medium and that be where i think the work of   the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   have be incredibly valuable i commend   he on all his work in the lead up to this point and his use of convene power to bring together so many individual and organisation those conversation some of which i have the opportunity to attend cover a huge range obviously the bill we have in front of we today be shall we say somewhat thin than the bill envisage 
 i also attend event that the hon member for whitehaven and workington pull together do my right hon friend agree that the strong characteristic that come out of all of they be deep and profound anger among parent about what have be allow to develop 
 i think that be right the other thing i be strike by in some of the session be the great unity of view whether it be trade union charity parent group doctor or parent there be a great commonality of view about what need to be do 
 i understand what happen sometimes with private member bills and the need to make progress and to have government support but i say to the government that this be a huge miss opportunity if the minister look behind he he will see all his colleague who have rearrange their fridays and rearrange their surgery and all their appointment because they believe in this subject he should heed the list that his hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington read out of all the organisation that come together in support of action in this area it be so worth do and we have make good progress with the online safety act but there be furth to go 
 there be thing we can do with a private member ’s bill that it be hard sometimes to do with government legislation because of the party political controversy that come in this be a miss opportunity because this may well be the only private member ’s bill with a good chance of success in this area be at the top of the ballot in this entire parliament 
 the bill as draft be unlikely to require this house to divide because there be not much in it that anyone could disagree on i will if i may focus my comment on the thing that the bill envisage such as the cmo ’s advice for parent on the use of smartphone and social medium and the plan for research that the secretary of state will prepare on the effect of the use of social medium on child and the appropriateness and effectiveness of the so call digital age of consent i will say very simple thing to the minister about that research the evidence be not perfect today it will not be perfect in year it will never ever be perfect if we hang around wait for perfect evidence we will never act in the way that we should why be it not perfect because this be a phenomenon that have happen across the entire world at the same time there be no control group 
 give that this be such a huge topic the study that there be which try to narrow it down to something manageable tend to end up look at either facebook or twitter neither of which be particularly relevant for teenager when we have proxy study they be generally inadequate for phone use in school study tend to look at a school that have a phone ban and a school that do not that be a totally invalid scientific comparison because there could be all sort of other thing go    on and the sort of school that be likely to do well in gcses be also likely to bring in a phone ban so we can not prove the direction of causality 
 people will also tell we that there have not be enough time because the technology be constantly develop it may have be around for year or so but the current version of it have only be around for month so there have not be time to say conclusively what the effect be none of that be about to change the evidence will continue to be imperfect 
 however the evidence that we do have be pretty clear we know as   the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes who chair the education committee mention that there can be some benefit from relatively small amount of screen time the programme for international student assessment pisa study cover this in some detail look at multiple country it talk about a goldilocks effect whereby about an hour of screen time a day seem to be correlate with increase wellbeing but the same study find that in almost every country study with the fascinating exception of the dominican republic high level of internet usage be associate with low level of life satisfaction there be lot of other study which colleague have refer to that look at happiness quality of relationship eyesight sleep concentration and so on 
 then there be the rise prevalence of mental ill health in young people often when people look at the number on mental ill health particularly in teenager they reach immediately for their preferred explanation for why teenager be have these difficulty and sometimes it get quite political it be important to note that the rise in teenage mental ill health be not a uniquely british phenomenon on the main measure of mental wellbeing use in the unicef gallup change childhood study—“how often do you experience feel worried nervous or anxious and how often do you experience feel depressed or have little interest in do things?”—the uk be broadly in line with the average of country include france germany and the us actually it be slightly well on most of the measure 
 there be ample other study from around the world include the world health organisation ’s multi country health behaviour in school age children study france ’s edc i will not attempt the language study which be quite a long time series and the short time series in the united states trends in mental wellbeing the good study of all be the nhs ’s mental health of children and young people in england i say in pass to the minister that i do not think we have yet have a commitment from the department of health and social care to carry on with that time series it be incredibly valuable and that be a relatively simple thing that the government could do 
 i have say that the rise in teenage mental ill health be not a uniquely british phenomenon it be also not only about covid a lot of the study in recent year have set out to answer the question what happen to child ’s mental health during covid that be a perfectly legitimate question but if we look at the shape of the curve it look very unlikely that it start in covid and in the nhs study it carry on grow long after covid up until the most recent wave 
 the minister say this in a debate in westminster hall the other day and he be right that it be entirely invalid to infer causality from correlation but the bradford hill criterion which his hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington mention be relevant particularly the criterion of consistency strength plausibility coherence and analogy as well as temporality in any event it seem odd that we allow something to happen to our child because we can not prove that it cause harm rather than because we can prove that it be safe that be not the way in which we deal with child ’s toy food or medicine 
 i turn the question around and say to people who query the direction of causality with something like self harm be you honestly try to tell i that incident of self harm in our country be nothing to do with the prevalence and normalisation of imagery around self harm on social medium as i say i worry that if we continue to seek perfect information we simply will not act as we should i have page more to say but i will not say they because i know that many colleague wish to speak 
 i begin by thank my hon friend   the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister who i have now start call the patron saint of the smartphone free childhood campaign he often come up on the doorstep in beckenham and penge when i speak to parent 
 this topic have prompt a huge response both in my own constituency and across the country i welcome elizabeth sarah and other constituent who be here to watch this debate i also pay tribute to crispin raj and all the brilliant local parent and campaigner i have be work with on this i will spend some time explore the wealth of feedback i have have from my constituent before talk about the type of change we need to see across the country that change need to be cultural to put child and parent and to place the onus on social medium company and manufacturer to prove that their product be safe while ensure that we do not miss out on the many benefit of technology 
 ahead of this debate i engage extensively with key group in beckenham and penge young people parent and school leader despite be the reason we be here today young people be the group that we most risk exclude from the conversation which be why i hold a focus group at a local secondary school harris academy beckenham and speak to student from a range of year group about their view on how smartphone be change childhood in that focus group half of the student say that smartphone and social medium overall have a negative impact on their mental health the majority of student tell i that they would feel panicked without their mobile phone and some speak to i with quiet self awareness about how they know their mobile phone have act as a barrier to interaction with their family this be time that they be not spend build meaningful relationship through face to face conversation and develop the social and communication skill that they will need in life 
 the group teacher offer another perspective on monday i be delighted to bring together a group of primary and secondary school headteacher from right across my constituency we discuss the impact   of their student smartphone use in and out of school what stand out the most from that conversation be the sheer amount of time that they as school leader have to spend week after week deal with issue that have take place on their student phone cyber bulling sexte the sharing of graphic video or explicit photo often of the student themselves all those and more be cross our teacher desk and demand hour of their time every day pull they away from their core and crucial job of educating 
 finally there be the parent in beckenham and penge concern about smartphone and social medium use easily fall into the top issue that constituent have contact i about since my election to this house last july last friday i put out a survey ask parent in my constituency for their view within   a week i have receive well over response some of respondent agree that smartphone and social medium have a negative impact on their child ’s mental health but what make that figure more shocking be that of those who agree with that statement be parent of primary aged child that be child under the age of
