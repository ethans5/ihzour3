the chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no and negative 
 reading 
 relevant document e petition ban import of hunt trophy of endangered animal 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 often in debate that have have a long genesis and be consider many time in the house there be that hackneyed phrase everything that need to be say have be say but not everyone have say it can not even use that phrase now because everyone have say what they need to say many time over of course that be not true in this case not least because of the bill table and pioneer very ably by   the hon member for crawley henry smith   in the last session of parliament the clear and overwhelming view of this house be that the legislation should go forward we all know that that bill be subject to extend delay in the other house without wish to cast aspersion could almost suggest delay tactic and eventually time run out i have to say that in this regard even if in no other i welcome the postponement of the general election until the autumn as i hope that will give we more than adequate time not only for the bill to go through its stage in this house but to ensure that the majority in the other place be not frustrate by the few who take a different view of it 
 in some way what be happen down there be slightly reminiscent of the debate on the house of lords in the early part of the last century when the lords be very much divide between the hedger and the ditcher between those who accept that some reform be necessary and be therefore go to hedge their bet and allow reform to take place and those who be go to die in the ditch i hope very much that the hedger in this case triumph in the other house so that this matter which be very important not just to we but to the public make progress 
 about this time last year on report we reach somewhat of a compromise consensus on the bill that leave this place and go to the lords be i right in think that the right hon gentleman have reintroduce the exact same bill on which this house reach consensus last year the bill technically do not stop hunting it simply stop the import into this country of any animal protect by the convention on international trade in endanger specie of wild fauna and flora 
 i thank the right hon lady for those comment and for the work that she undertake as the secretary of state to support this legislation give that we wish to speed the progress of this legislation i hope that colleague will not be prone to make long speech on this issue indeed possibly not even medium or short speech subject to madam deputy speaker i intend to be very generous with my taking of intervention because right hon and hon member want to ensure that the strong feeling of their constituent which be make very clear every time this issue come up be express in this house so that those constituent know that parliament be listen and undertake a course of action 
 will my right hon friend give way 
 i will just finish my comment to   the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey   before i take an intervention from my hon friend from bebington 
 the right hon member for suffolk coastal be absolutely right in the last parliament there be concession and discussion in committee and a consensus be bring about which be express very solidly that be why i stress that this be the overwhelming view and message from this house to the other house and it be regrettable that the lords choose to ignore that i understand that the other house have a role in revise legislation particularly when there be deep division in this house but that be not the case with this provision it be absolutely clear that the overwhelming majority include the overwhelming majority of our constituent the figure be or so but i will come back to that be in support of the bill the hon member for crawley skilfully put it together which show the bipartisan nature of the legislation that be why it should go through today and why it should be speed through its passage in both houses of parliament 
 the bebington element of the ellesmere port constituency leave about year ago but i know my right hon friend have be here a long time so it probably be correct when he enter this place 
 i want to make the point that he have just make namely that there be overwhelming public support for this measure a number of constituent have contact i to express their support as he say time and again survey show huge public demand for this do he agree that it be important that we get the bill through as swiftly as possible so that those in the other place be able to do as much as they can as quickly as they can 
 i make no apology for be regularly re elect to this place over a number of decade i be sure that my hon friend speak effectively for his constituent in ellesmere port and i suspect resident in bebington probably hold similar view that be important sometimes issue come before the house that reflect view from certain part of the country there be often argument that reflect the view of those in the metropolis or the inner metropolis and the metropolitan elite but this issue run across party across class and across region this be a universal view across the country people want this country to have no part in this vile trade 
 my right hon friend make an important point like many hon member i have receive hundred of email from my constituent in batley and spen who be appal at the vile trade of trophy hunting do he agree that the bill will not only prevent the importation of hunt trophy to the uk but it will also send a powerful message to country around the world that hunt and kill endangered animal for trophy be always unacceptable and that much more must be do to prevent that atrocious act wherever it occur 
 i thank my hon friend for that contribution and for the work she have be undertake on this issue quite apart from the bill she be absolutely right other country include australia france and belgium i think there be a couple of other have already show the way by ban the trade in hunt trophy and i hope that what we decide here will start to send a message to other country that this be an international movement as we always realise society and opinion evolve this country have the bullring in birmingham but we no long torment bull with dog in a public arena or engage in bear baiting or cock fighting we have move on from that and we need to move on from trophy hunting not least because of the decline in specie 
 some of the argument relate very much to africa but i remind colleague i pay tribute to the campaign by the daily express on this that other region of the world be also involve such as polar bear in canada the bill demonstrate that the public do not want those magnificent creature to be slaughter not only for a bizarre form of pleasure but to decorate people ’s house they do not understand it 
 i congratulate my right hon friend on bring this bill forward be it not the case that this legislation be support by campaigner in many country include in africa they love their animal and recognise that there be much more to be gain and it be much more profitable to keep these animal alive rather than to allow this barbaric practice 
 my hon friend be clearly speak on behalf of her constituent in nottingham in express those strong view in a number of programme yesterday i point out that for the long term sustainable future of tourism in these country it be much well to have tourist shoot animal with camera rather than with rifle and crossbow we need to look towards a future of sustainable specie and people be able to enjoy these animal not just through historical video from david attenborough but by visit themselves that give rise to a great and long term industry 
 i agree with everything that the right hon gentleman have say as well as pay tribute to my sussex colleague my hon friend   the member for crawley henry smith for have persevere with this issue for so long we should not be here this legislation should have go through already i have be strike by the number of email i have have from my constituent about how important this matter be so may i make a practical offer to member of the house of lords who be minded to   try to sabotage the bill again i speak as the chairman of the all party parliamentary group for photography and we will have a special category in the exhibition this year for wildlife photo so that those member can show how brave and manly they be by get up close with camera rather than gun be that a deal 
 i be not sure their knee could take it but that be a further matter i absolutely take the point that the hon gentleman make and he be right about expand the scope so that people can show their skill in photography and show these magnificent creature in their natural environment that be the record they should have not some grisly trophy on the wall i fully understand his point 
 i be also pleased that the hon gentleman raise the question about colleague be here today i realise where we be in the electoral cycle and that we have election everywhere across england and wales in may many colleague will therefore want to be out campaigning so i thank colleague who be here today and hope they will be able to participate to put across their constituent view i hope that constituent understand the effort that sometimes have to be make to be here on a friday give constituency pressure 
 i think it be the distressing case of the killing of cecil the lion that alert many people to what be happen i too have many constituent in chipping barnet who want this bill to go through that be why i be here today to support it 
 i thank the right hon lady for come in today particularly because there be even more important election take place in her part of the country she and i might take a slightly different view on they but we be unite on this issue today it be important that we stress once again the cross party support for this important measure 
 i early highlight the role of the hon member for crawley but i also pay tribute to many of those who play a part in keep this campaign go over many year i think of my old friend bob blizzard the previous member for waveney he be a comrade in the labour government whips office back in the day before the election he be a great friend and also a great enthusiast both for jazz but also very much for this cause after he have leave parliament he encourage i to take up this issue and his involvement in the campaign to ban trophy hunting be enormously important along with the campaign ’s current director eduardo gonçalves who be sadly not well i hope he will be cheer by the progress of the bill later today that be along with a number of celebrity sir ranulph fiennes have most notably be a stalwart in the campaign as have dr jane washington evans and peter egan who initiate the e petition 
 lord mancroft in the other place say 
 what the government be do today be pass socialist legislation which be an odd thing for a conservative government to be do ”—[official report house of lords   september vol c. 
 do my right hon friend agree that this be not socialist legislation or conservative liberal democrat scottish national party or plaid cymru legislation this be humane and compassionate legislation 
 well we be a broad church if member on the government benches wish to join the cause of socialism i welcome they my hon friend be absolutely right some issue divide we on non political ground and member from different party end up in the same camp and many of those issue be subject to free vote this issue unite we and it unite we with the british people it should have be sort out age ago it be really a shame that we have to be here today i do not in any way resent it because this be the right thing to do but this legislation should already be on the statute book 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for give way and i pay tribute to my hon friend   the member for crawley henry smith today feel a bit like déjà vu we be back here again but that send a message to our friend in the lords that we will not give up this legislation be the right thing to do it be an abhorrent act to go to another country and kill an endangered animal in order to stick its head on a wall it seem like something from a totally different century the fact that we be back again fight for the right cause and stand on the shoulder of the giant who have go before we send an important message to both the house of lords and the country 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that he express particularly well his point that trophy hunting be like something from a previous century its time have pass life move on and society move on 
 as i be describe it be interesting in the interview i do that none of the commentator could respond when i ask how can you defend someone who want to travel a distance to shoot a giraffe stand on its corpse and bring part of it back to this country nobody seem to be able to answer that question i be not say it be ever right to do that but what be absolutely clear now be that the british public be certain that they do not want any part of it 
 my right hon friend make a very valid point some in favour of trophy hunting argue that it lend itself to support conservation in the country which seem to i an entirely spurious argument we have just see really promise figure on tiger there be in the wild now that be actually a tiny number there should be many thousand more but it show that conservation effort can pay off if we focus on certain specie trophy hunting be not about conservation as my right hon friend say it be about people shoot animal take picture of themselves parade around the corps and cut the animal head off to take home it be an abhorrent act 
 i absolutely agree my hon friend have be campaign on this in bristol and here in parliament for many year from the day when we work in the whips office she make a very strong point 
 the argument that say we be kill these animal in order to save they be a bit like say we create a desert and call it peace i really do not buy into that and importantly neither do the british public 
 there have in the past be the argument that trophy hunting perform the role of cull for protect specie we have always be able to negate that argument there be time when there be a strategy for cull certain specie but that be do on the basis of scientific fact rather than inhumane delight at the killing of animal 
 my right hon friend make an important point vastly excessive number such as in certain part of this country where there be problem with deer have an impact on woodland and the very proper campaign by the government to reforest the country in many case professional hunter do the cull rather than have people fire crossbow at animal which can then linger for several day cecil the lion be mention that case catch the attention and imagination of the british public and it focus they on this issue and they make it clear that they do not want this practice to continue 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right but there be another factor to consider the elephant take out be the big leader of the tribe that have a significant effect on the gene pool there be already some evidence that elephant with small tusk be survive and therefore contrary to natural selection change be take place to their appearance also some hunter do not seem to accept that although some be solitary many animal live in social structure we see that with the death of cecil the lion and we see with elephant that the social structure and cohesion of elephant herd be completely disrupt that apply to other creature as well hunting be to the detriment of gene selection and the development and maintenance of group of specie 
 i wholeheartedly support my right hon friend ’s bill as in the title of the bill these people be after trophy they will not select the weak in the herd or the pride they will go for the that look the most magnificent on their wall or wherever they want to display it therefore they be take out the strong weaken the gene pool and have exactly the opposite effect on conservation that be another reason why we need to send a strong message and support my right hon friend ’s bill 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the negative impact on the specie as a whole have to be consider especially as my hon friend   the member for bristol east kerry mccarthy   say because we be see real reduction in some specie we be get below the critical mass necessary to sustain the genetic variation of a healthy specie 
 will the right hon member give way 
 i will just make a little progress because i mention of the campaign organisation and if i take intervention before i mention the other they might think i be leave they out 
 i pay tribute to the many campaign that have maintain interest in this issue over the year bring we i hope to the culmination today humane society international lionaid paw and bear free have all play a prominent role in contact member and campaigning there be also the coalition against trophy and canned hunting which include action for primates a law animal defenders international animal aid animal interfaith alliance catholic concern for animals the conservative animal welfare foundation again show the bipartisan nature of the support international wildlife bond labour animal welfare society onekind people for nature and peace protect african lions quaker concern for animals the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animal voice4lion world animal protection wildlife conservation foundation and zimbabwe elephant foundation if i have miss anyone out they can text i and i might include they in the wind up those organisation have work together successfully to highlight the issue and we pay tribute to they 
 i totally agree with the right hon member on that point i support the bill because i stand with many of my falkirk constituent who have write to i on the issue he mention many of the non governmental organisation i have be heavily involve with paw in the uk which have provide so much useful information to i on the subject over a long while as we all know this be a non partisan issue mp from all corner of the house have speak at great length and passionately on the totally incomprehensible nature of this brutal sport enough talk the time be to make this actually happen do he agree that kill animal for sport be just not an acceptable practice 
 the hon gentleman make that point strongly and stress once again the all party support for the measure 
 i congratulate my right hon friend on bring the bill forward i fully support it and will be vote for it today he outline an impressive list of organisation i do not think anybody have mention that apparently out of of the british public support the ban and that be something the house of lords need to take note of i have just be look through the list of email i have have on the subject from right across my constituency from chorlton didsbury burnage and withington from all kind of different demographic group and area around the country the british public be absolutely united in want this trade ban 
 i thank my hon friend for that point and for highlight the level of support of course that be reinforce by the government themselves in january in their response to the petition instigate by mr peter egan which say 
 we will continue work to deliver our manifesto commitment to ban the import of hunt trophy from endangered animal which have overwhelming support from mps and the public we recognise that this be an issue that the public feel very strongly about and over of response to our consultation support   further action in the previous parliamentary session the government fully support the hunting trophies bill during its passage through parliament the bill pass the house of commons in march with strong support from mp but do not progress through committee stage in the house of lords we will continue work to deliver this important manifesto commitment 
 i hope the minister will be able to back that up far in her contribution later on that be reinforce in a reply at the end of january to a letter from a number of member across the house that the hon member for crawley organise in which the minister once again say that there be considerable debate and that the government support the bill and share the hon member ’s disappointment that it do not pass through the commons it be absolutely clear that whatever our other division we be unite in support of a ban 
 there be particular aspect that i want to highlight we have talk a lot about hunting in the wild but there be the even more deplorable business of so call canned hunting where animal especially lion be breed in an enclosure to be shoot by depraved individual who want a trophy i pay tribute to lord ashcroft again someone with whom i might disagree on other issue who have spend a considerable amount of time campaign on and instigate research into that appalling trade i hope the bill will help reduce the attraction to such trade firm involve in that dreadful trade advertise that 
 your hunt be never complete until you receive your animal at home for you to reminisce and re call your experience for the rest of your life 
 do we really want to be associate with people who take that sort of attitude 
 i have take a fair amount of time and a number of intervention we could go on a lot long and in a lot more detail but i recognise that the house will want to make progress and that colleague will want to make what i hope will be brief contribution 
 will the right hon gentleman take we through the clause of the bill clause be incorporate as a result of the acceptance of of my amendment when this bill be last debate clause have not yet be explain and i would be interested to know whether the right hon gentleman support it and how he think it will work in practice 
 i thank the hon gentleman who sit with i on the british american parliamentary group we be joint officer i consider he a parliamentary friend i thank he for highlight the fact that the bill be amend to take account of various view it be carry forward without dissent in this house and be forward to the lords that be precisely why the bill should be vote on again send back to the other house and incorporate into the law of this land 
 it be a great privilege to follow   the right hon member for warley john spellar i pay tribute to he and to many other member from across this house who have work so hard not only in support my bill when it be before the house last year but in campaigning to end the importation of hunt trophy the body part of endanger specie to this country it have be a fantastic effort as we   have hear the bill enjoy the support of well over   fifth of the british public indeed there be a commitment to do what the bill propose in a manifesto on which i stand for election and a half year ago and i understand that that commitment have be reflect in the manifesto of many other party represent in this house 
 last march the hunt trophies import prohibition bill that i introduce pass through this elect chamber unanimously as we have hear from my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope we accept compromise amendment to make sure that it reflect as many view as possible when it go to the other place a very small minority of peer act discourteously in the way that they seek to block the legislation that be why we have have to bring it back and i be grateful to the right hon member for warley for do so 
 i mention the widespread support for this legislation in this country but it be also extremely popular in other part of the world southern africa have be mention last year i be in a number of southern african country where there be a clear desire among the majority of people to make sure that such legislation be enact in this country and as the right hon gentleman say in other country as well hunt for trophy be not a natural practice for people in southern africa it be a colonial import to the continent from the time of colonisation it be not native the ending of this practice enjoy widespread support across the world 
 as the right hon member for warley say the practice that we be discuss be not unique to africa claim have be make that somehow this be racist legislation that tell country around the world how to act and conduct their hunting policy let we just remind ourselves that this bill be import legislation it say that we in this country by a clear majority choose not to allow the importation of body part of endanger specie slaughter by hunter to great britain that be the territorial extent of this bill and what it be design to do nevertheless it would send a strong signal that these practice be deeply damaging to conservation as he eloquently say damage be do to the gene pool by take out the top animal in a pride of lion or the big tusker from a herd of elephant that be begin to damage the ability of those animal to survive let we remind ourselves of what this bill be about it be not about ban hunting although i might have a view on that it be about protect endanger specie before it be too late 
 in my hon friend ’s tour of africa do he have the opportunity to meet president masisi of botswana who have describe western intervention as a racist onslaught he have say 
 it ’ racism they talk as if we be the grass the elephant eat it startle i when people sit in the comfort of where they be and lecture we about the management of specie they do n’t have 
 i have not meet the current president of botswana but i have meet the previous president khama on a number of occasion he be passionate about end trophy hunting because it be not typical african community who benefit from it but the big industry that support it botswana be a good example because in such country there be a huge difference of opinion over whether trophy hunting should go ahead 
 i pay tribute to the hon gentleman for the work he have do on this issue be not the answer to the point make by   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope   that the bill deal with the import of trophy to the uk and say nothing about botswana 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely correct as i say this be import legislation its territorial extent be great britain it be about what we choose to import to this country and a clear majority of the british people do not want the body part of endanger specie import here because they care about these majestic specie and want they to continue to exist for the sake of their child grandchild and many generation to come the idea that kill an endanger specie save an endangered species be absurd and should be call out for what it be 
 i too pay tribute to my hon friend for the work that he have do on this issue i reiterate that it be absurd that we be back here because this house agree unanimously to take this bill through my constituent who be very far away from many of the country in which this practice happen be absolutely passionate about end it however as have be state this bill be not about the practice in those country it be about what we import to our country if we do anything we should make sure that we end this abhorrent act of import the carcase of endangered animal for people to stick on their wall 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who have be stalwart in support i in this campaign he be absolutely right to remind we again about what the legislation do it be about what we choose to import or not to this country 
 the bill apply to the importation of endangered species body part no matter where in the world the animal be hunt so it would also prohibit the importation of trophy hunt from polar bear in canada as the right hon member for warley say we do not hear people claim that we be be racist against the canadians because we choose not to import endanger polar bear we need to remind ourselves what the legislation do 
 i could speak with passion on this principle for hour but i be conscious of parliamentary procedure and i do not want to detain the bill ’s passage any far i once again call on hon and right hon member from across this elect house to send a clear message we in this country choose not to import the body part of trophy hunt endanger specie to great britain 
 all of we here be familiar with the term trophy hunting we have come to recognise the evil act that those harmless sound word represent but for those watching who may be less familiar with the term animal welfare organisation such as spca international define it as 
 the hunting of animal for sport not for food usually the animal be stuff or a body part be keep for display 
 they go on 
 many hunter claim that trophy hunting be not bad for animal they say they be support animal conservation the opposite be true live animal support the population of their specie 
 the league against cruel sports say 
 we believe this multi pound industry be unjustifiable from an animal welfare point of view but also for conservation as it be responsible for endanger several specie around the world 
 as for sport that word be usually reserve for activity that revolve around the more positive aspect of life fitness healthy competition teamwork friendship personal achievement endeavour and endurance not a single of those could be attribute to an activity that involve an individual choose to photograph themselves grin triumphantly as they celebrate kill a once gentle and graceful giraffe whose lifeless body now lie slump and twist at their foot pump full of deadly bullet my good friend the vet and animal welfare campaigner dr marc abraham obe agree he say 
 anyone with an ounce of compassion and kindness despair at see these image of cowardly pathetic trophy hunter grin over their still warm kill exploit animal use as pathetic prop to maintain even elevate an online self image of superiority without any shred of guilt or conscience 
 he describe those take part in these killing as have 
 a tragic lack of empathy and the high form of narcissism 
 and say that 
 to be complicit in this most extreme callous form of animal cruelty plus then to harvest the body part and ship they back home to the uk could not be a clear indicator of violent antisocial behaviour 
 every member of this house will have have email and letter from and meeting with constituent who love and value animal and loathe those who exploit harm or kill they there be so many british people who show such kindness who campaign on behalf of animal charity who volunteer who make donation or fundraise and who share a love for our planet and the incredible breathtake wildlife that we be so fortunate to benefit from how dare a few wealthy individual decide that they have the right to buy and cause the death of a lion polar bear or elephant 
 alongside our constituent there be those who use their fame and public platform to fight for the protection of animal those campaigner include frequent visitor to parliament whose passion be infectious people such as the wonderful peter egan friend to many in this place who for year have fight hard to raise awareness and keep a ban on trophy hunting import at the top of mps agenda peter work with the fantastic campaigner eduardo goncalves who we talk about early and who be support by many across this house include my right hon friend   the member for warley john spellar who have never give up fighting to protect animal during his time here he step down at the next general election but it be vital that we carry on his compassionate work i absolutely pledge to do that to the good of my ability 
 no speech about animal welfare should leave out top animal champion ricky gervais he could spend his day polish his many award but instead he choose to condemn trophy hunting and shame those who consider the murder of animal to be a hobby he support the ban and have call trophy hunting 
 humanity at its very bad 
 the murder of animal for fun be also condemn by chris packham bill bailey joanna lumley and sir ranulph fiennes as well as mp and activist across the political divide and those with no political affiliation whatsoever the legendary jane goodall say 
 trophy hunting be utterly cruel utterly unnecessary and utterly disastrous from a conservation perspective it inflict pain and suffering on animal for no other reason than to boast of some ephemeral prowess there be no material human need meet by it it be a hobby pure and simple and a deeply wrong at that 
 i urge colleague to support the bill i sincerely thank my right hon friend the member for warley for bring it forward i echo the word of the humane society and say that there be no excuse for trophy hunting so let we get the ban do 
 the thing that unite the house be that we all want to see successful conservation but this bill have always be about racism and neocolonialism this bill be question by science and by african country if anybody no matter how much they think they love animal be think about write to i or contact i about trophy hunting i insist that they seriously consider what african representative have say about both the bill and the people who support it 
 over the last year cite list specie of animal have be import as hunt trophy in the same period the pet industry have trade in over list specie if hon member care about cite then perhaps the bill should include pet as well 
 i do not believe anybody in the house intend to be racist but this bill cross the line the namibian environment minister pohamba shifeta have write to our environment secretary denounce the bill as 
 regressive step towards neo colonialism your bill imply that your judgment supersede our insight and expertise such unilateral action make without consultation and collaboration with we challenge the sovereignty of nation like namibia 
 we have talk about botswana and i will quote what president masisi say it be worth remember that botswana have elephant it now have elephant the population increase year on year by about elephant some trophy hunting licence be issue but those licence have never all be take up when president masisi describe intervention in africa ’s wildlife as a racist onslaught 
 on that point will the hon gentleman give way 
 i be in the middle of a quote but i think the president will forgive i for allow the hon gentleman to intervene 
 do the hon gentleman agree that the house be perfectly entitle to make decision have consider all the fact not just selective fact it can then decide that it do not want hunt trophy to be bring into this country and it be perfectly entitle to make that decision 
 if i do not respect the house i would not have bother to turn up today so i do not think that be a valid point we must consider how we would feel if botswana namibia tanzania zambia south africa or zimbabwe be legislate on what we do here awkwardly for the hon gentleman we   be not ban trophy hunting in the uk we be target cite list specie but we do not seem to care that there be such specie of which only a handful be actually relevant 
 to continue the namibian environment minister pohamba shifeta say this be 
 regressive step towards neo colonialism 
 whether it be mean that way or not he go on to say 
 your bill imply that your judgment supersede our insight 
 those of the people who actually look after these animal he say 
 such unilateral action make without consultation challenge the sovereignty 
 president masisi say that this be a racist onslaught from people who 
 sit in the comfort of where they be and lecture we about the management of specie they do n’t have 
 he be not just speak for himself last november the times the telegraph and the daily mail report that ordinary africans share the president ’s view the paper quote from a survey of people in botswana malawi mozambique namibia south africa tanzania zambia and zimbabwe who say that the uk legislation be racist and neocolonial that be what they be say about we although i respect the sovereignty of this house i would not like it if they say thing like that about we and i be astonish that the hon gentleman do 
 i do not read the times very often but the hon member say that the african community leader and conservationist he refer to rightly argue that it be not for we in the west to decide how they should manage their wildlife and that that be why he can not endorse the bill i be not tell they how to manage their wildlife or demand that they do it in a certain way what i and many member in this house be say be that we do not want those disgusting trophy in this country it be simple 
 the african country find it appal that british politician show no concern for the african life threaten by these animal they be furious with the virtue signal proposal which lack scientific credibility time and again they return with the fact and they be completely ignore by hon member in this debate 
 i will come on to what oxford university say about the fact and figure give by   the right hon member for warley john spellar this week botswana ’s minister for environment and tourism along with the high commissioner of namibia south africa zambia and botswana come to this house to express their dissatisfaction with the bill this be significantly different from when my hon friend   the member for crawley henry smith   bring forward his bill there be no pushback from african country then now we be see significant unhappiness from those country about the bill defra ministers and their labour shadow know that the high commissioner of the african nation have jointly condemn the bill as inexcusable meddling in africa ’s democratic affair 
 there be in the uk ten of thousand of trophy hunting animal that the bill do not cover if the uk hat trophy hunting it should ban it here i do not particularly want to see that but that be what people in africa feel 
 on reading of last year ’s bill that propose such a ban the minister tell the commons that its purpose be to reduce the impossible pressure on africa ’s wildlife other mp argue that the measure would save thousand of animal from the barbaric and savage african practice of legal hunting indeed   the hon member for canterbury rosie duffield   use other such adjective but this be misleading in fact mps statement on reading be analyse in an oxford university study and be deem to be factually incorrect 
 the bill cover specie and most of those be not threaten by trophy hunting since the uk have import about of the specie in the bill that be in year at least specie that the uk import may be or be benefit from trophy hunting rural africa welcome control legal hunting as it help to manage excessive herd and rogue animal furthermore the fee that hunter pay bring significant amount of cash into remote area where tourist and photo safaris can not get to this create incentive for villager to refrain from poisoning snare or shoot the animal 
 between and of concession fee usually go towards community land african know that legal hunting reduce illegal hunting it be the poaching often fund by chinese criminal gang that put at critical risk the survival of the specie that we all treasure those brutal gang be indiscriminate in how many animal they kill by contrast legal hunting estate need and want to grow their herd to ensure the future of their business and that be why they invest heavily in anti poaching patrol they provide the armed guard that be vital to protect these animal from gruesome death this legal hunting operate under strict quota agree by national governments and the international regulator as a result the herd have flourish paper find that in kenya where hunting have long be ban there have be a dramatic fall in wildlife number another study find that botswana which do ban hunting see a horrific surge in human wildlife conflict with a increase in the discovery of elephant carcase that disaster lead to a quick reversal of the ban 
 in briefing from the international union for conservation of nature state that 
 legal well regulated trophy hunting program can and do play an important role in deliver benefit for both wildlife conservation and for the livelihood and wellbeing of indigenous and local community 
 in a letter to the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs namibia ’s minister for environment and tourism say 
 we be most concerned about how this propose law would undermine the finance of our protected areas and conservancy the lack of dedicated land and the protection which protect hunting pay for would critically undermine the survival of specie which we all love 
 he go on to say 
 the implication of this legislation therefore extend far beyond what have become know as trophy hunting potentially impact the livelihood of rural community that rely on the revenue it generate 
 a joint statement from southern african government representative in the uk oppose the bill 
 i think the hon gentleman indicate that only of trophy have come to this country if it be only enact this piece of legislation will not make that much difference to those country will it 
 it would make enough difference for the hon gentleman to turn up for the debate and for i to do so it would also make enough difference for all the representative of those southern african country who care about the creature that we all purport to care about to say that the bill be wrong in fact they say 
 if income stream from trophy hunting be substantially reduce as would be the outcome of this bill land would be abandon and subject to poach or convert to less biodiversity friendly us such as agriculture and livestock production local community who live near and with wildlife would suffer 
 i think it be pretty clear that they do not think that the hon gentleman be right the statement end 
 southern africa ’s track record on conservation be world lead and we use trophy hunting to do it let we continue to do so 
 i recognise that that be awkward for opposition members who care about animal but the people who be responsible for those animal be tell we that we be wrong 
 botswana be the top country in the world for large animal with namibia and tanzania all country have pay hunting which finance protect space and armed guard for those animal the country that be in the world that be we be in the word of david attenborough of 
 the most nature deplete country in the world 
 we get rid of the last brown bear year ago and our last wolf year ago 
 africa ’s human population have rise eightfold during our lifetime cause immense pressure on the land available for wildlife that mean that africans increasingly come into conflict with big animal which may eat their goat threaten their child or trample their village last year botswana ’s minister for environment and tourism start an article publish in the daily mail by say 
 last month i attend the funeral of villager in my homeland botswana both be in their teen tragically kill by charge wild buffalo as they travel to school and work sadly this be not an isolated incident 
 she go on to say 
 believe i i do understand the horror people feel when they see a photograph of a trophy hunt person pose beside a recent kill lion killing in particular seem to cause outrage among britons especially after the notorious shooting of cecil the lion by a us trophy hunter in zimbabwe in the widely circulate picture of walter palmer stand over cecil ’s body become emblematic of man ’s destructive relationship with nature reasonable though this reaction be it be a knee jerk it fail to acknowledge that for many africans trophy hunting be vital for the local population it be a wildlife conservation measure that generate income use to combat illegal poaching support community development and enhance habitat protection sadly 
 she say we 
 all too often focus solely on animal welfare at the expense of human life in africa 
 i have think carefully about the amendment that i intend to table the bill do not need to keep come back in the way in which the right hon member for warley have bring it back my amendment will ensure that the bill protect certain specie while recognise that other country may be even well at manage conservation than we be it will allow the secretary of state to add or withdraw country from a list of those that issue hunt licence and show sufficient level of concern for conservation any hunting trophy obtain   under licence in a country that be on the list would be exempt from the ban kenya would not be on the list as it do not allow hunting and its wildlife number sadly have decline but country that do allow it and be do a good job should be allow to continue 
 this bill be be question by science and by african country and there be no excuse for blunder into inadvertent racism if we want africa ’s big animal to survive into the future i ask the house not to ignore the science and the misinformation that endanger the animal that we care the most about 
 it be an honour to follow   the hon member for north herefordshire sir bill wiggin but i can not say that i agree with a single word of his speech he quote david attenborough but david attenborough have describe trophy hunting as incomprehensible and certainly do not support it i pay tribute to my right hon friend   the member for warley john spellar   for present the bill to   the hon member for crawley henry smith   for his early work and to our depart friend bob blizzard who do an enormous amount of work on this issue when he be a member 
 i want to make this short contribution because i have the privilege of go on safari when my wife and i visit africa it be the trip of a lifetime if i ever have the chance to go back and do it again i do not think it will be the same trip because the experience of see these magnificent beast in their own habitat be something you never forget i want to impress that on the people who seek what i suppose be the thrill of murder these beast 
 within hour of arrive at our camp we be in a truck be take to look at the wildlife as we sit in that open sided truck a lion walk past the bottom of it i could look down and see its back as it walk past i i sit there and think what the hell be i do here there be no cage around the truck but you trust entirely the stranger you have just meet the guide who take you around while a wild beast only a couple of metre away walk calmly past the truck 
 the experience of get close to those animal be something never to be forget but the most memorable experience be see beside the chobe river in botswana a herd of elephant feed at dusk talk and grumble to another as they eat the reed on the river bank we get quite close to these huge beast and feel entirely safe indeed we feel that we be privileged to be so close to they in their natural habitat 
 the idea that anyone would go into that environment with a gun and slaughter those animal be beyond i if you want to experience wildlife do not go murder it get up close to it and experience it in that way i ask members to imagine this for a minute there be probably about a dozen people in our truck if every of we have a gun and go out slaughter these animal the effect across the specie would be enormous but when large number of we go to these country arm with camera rather than gun the effect on their economy be enormous 
 we have hear argument today about be racist towards african country but it be not just about african country i have not hear anyone say we be   be racist to canadians by not want polar bear to be import in the word of david attenborough this be incomprehensible 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 i be go to give way once but i do not want to take up too much time 
 the canadian government have not write to object it be the african country that object to this i hope that be clear from what i say early 
 i be sure it be but the hunting fraternity only contribute to a very tiny bit of those country economy what we seem to have hear today be an argument that without the enormous wealth of the people who go trophy hunting conservation can not be afford i just do not accept that that be a reasonable argument of course people can pay i would pay an enormous fee for the privilege of go to see these animal in their own habitat and leave behind that fee in order to pay for conservation there be way that we can contribute to conservation that way outstrip the money that member on the conservative benches have be talk about 
 let we be honest the majority of the people who talk the bill out in the other place be hereditary peer that be the truth of it the enormously privileged wealthy call this idea which have enormous support from all the people socialist well because it have the support of the people it have to be socialist do n’t it it have to be socialist because commoner want it how could the conservative party possibly support a measure that be so socialist in its fundamental objective it be complete nonsense but there be a specie that perhaps we should be metaphorically hunt to extinction the position of the hereditary peer and their ability to vote on law in our country that be an outdated anachronism that have to come to an end and the person who start that hunt will have my full backing 
 it be a pity that in a debate that should be about fact   the hon member for eltham clive efford   have allow his prejudice to come to the fore i do not think that help his cause indeed my hon friend   the member for north herefordshire sir bill wiggin   and i agree that it show that we be win the argument because the hon gentleman and some of his colleague be have to resort to smear member of the other place those members table perfectly reasonable amendment the problem be that they run out of time for discussion 
 the previous bill be amend in this place that be only because my hon friend the member for north herefordshire and i table a large number of amendment which put pressure on the promoter of the bill my hon friend   the member for crawley henry smith and the government to accept some of those amendment of the amendment be to add what be now clause of the bill and another be to remove from the bill a henry viii clause allow the subject matter to which the bill would apply to be extend by statutory instrument without any proper consultation this bill be a well bill than the that be introduce into this place by my hon friend the member for crawley but it   be still very defective certainly i think it would be a much well bill if the amendment suggest by my hon friend the member for north herefordshire in his excellent speech be to be incorporate into its text 
 rise 
 i will happily give way if need be 
 i be most grateful sorry i be a little slow to intervene as always my hon friend be make an excellent speech the purpose of the amendment be to ensure that we take any risk of racism away from this legislation because at the end of the day we be unite in want well conservation 
 that be what unite we the disagreement across the house be on the mean to the end everybody want to have well conservation of endanger specie and wildlife in africa like the hon member for eltham i have have the privilege of go on safari in africa indeed in south africa on separate occasion be in about when it be pretty hard to find the wild animal we be look for in the game reserve when i go again about month ago there be an abundance of rhino giraffe elephant lion leopard and so on we have the most amazing experience people use their camera and they rely on the protection provide by the excellent team that look after and conserve that safari park or game reserve 
 we could see with our own eye that people be try to poach the animal that be be look after and the cost of anti poaching measure be incredibly high how will that cost be fund unless it be pay for by the people who be engage in the conservation small mean by which they raise fund be by allow the collection of trophy and almost all the trophy that be not keep in africa be import into the united states spain or germany very few be bring into this country 
 whatever happen to this bill trophy hunting will continue but it may not include the import of a small number of trophy into this country under a licensing and regulatory regime that have stand the test of time instead of regulation we will have an outright ban why be we do that the impact assessment in respect of an early bill say 
 why be government intervention necessary government intervention will address public concern about import of hunt trophy from endangered animal 
 essentially the government ’s impact assessment admit that this be about presentation virtue signal and pander to public opinion whether or not that public opinion be sound 
 let we take ourselves back to when the government and parliament take the view that we should abolish capital punishment at that time a vast majority of the population take the view that we should keep capital punishment if we have apply the principle that be be apply to this bill we would still have capital punishment because it would address public concern about people be murder we in this house need to rely on science and fact rather than allow prejudice and ignorance to prevail which be of the reason why i hope the bill will be improve if it receive reading today 
 section of the impact assessment from paragraph onwards refer to the cost of this propose legislation which be the point that my hon friend the member for north herefordshire and i be seek to get across to the government 
 the impact assessment say 
 a letter from researcher describe how in african country that practice trophy hunting more land have be conserve under trophy hunting than under national parks with hunting area contribute to landscape connectivity some argue that restrict the import export of trophy from hunt risk land conversion and biodiversity loss and other alternative area management strategy must be in place to promote conservation protect endangered specie and support livelihood furthermore many question remain on whether alternative such as wildlife tourism can effectively replace trophy hunting especially in area with poor political and economic stability and area with less aesthetic appeal 
 that be not what i be say it be what the government say about the cost of this legislation when they do their impact assessment which go on to say 
 wildlife conflict with local people can impose serious cost include cause physical harm and death damage crop predate livestock and compete with livestock for food where wildlife provide few benefit to local people and/or impose substantial cost animal be often kill for food trade or to remove problem animal 
 that be a welcome recognition by the government of some of the reality surround this subject rather than the prejudice of people who have be ill inform by certain organisation 
 in paragraph of the impact assessment the government also concede that 
 evidence suggest that trophy hunting can provide a value for animal which incentivise their protection for the purpose of hunt rather than indiscriminate removal e.g. land use change to agriculture without trophy hunting an income stream link to positive conservation outcome could be lose and other option need to be in place to address this conflict 
 that be what the government say in their impact assessment so i hope we be go to hear from the minister how they will address the concern that they recognise if indeed they be still hell bent on push this legislation through to try to get it on to the statute book 
 the government also concede in their impact assessment perhaps this be a point that my hon friend the minister could refer to that 
 a ban in the legal movement of animal trophy could have the unintended consequence include increase the illegal trade in wildlife part which be unregulate it could also reduce the amount of protein available to local community as meat be often a by product of trophy hunt after a hunting ban in in botswana village lose the provision of tonne of meat so less protein be available to the community this result in an increase in illegal poaching and document decline in wildlife 
 those be fact what be the government ’s response to the fact to which they refer in their own impact assessment in 
 the issue of cost be discuss in paragraph 
 of the major argument for hunt for trophy be that it provide financial benefit to local community and without trophy hunt these benefit could be lose however the extent to which local community truly benefit be widely debate 
 of course that be the debate we be have today let we not take a view that all the people who support this bill be lover of animal and all the people who be against   it despise animal nobody could be a strong supporter of animal than i be indeed my wife and i be proud that we have produce a daughter who be now a veterinary surgeon can adduce any more evidence of the importance of inculcate into ’s child a love of animal that their parent share let we have none of this nonsense suggest that this be not a vile activity and that those who be against this bill should be subject to some sort of vilification that be completely ridiculous 
 let i also refer to the letter to which my hon friend the member for north herefordshire refer from the namibian association of community based natural resource management support organisations the letter be send to all british mp and i be disappointed that more of my parliamentary colleague who will have see that letter be not present ask rhetorically what have they do as a result of the point make in it mr louis say 
 please do not regard africans as be incapable of decide our domestic policy the reason we have legal hunting be that it pay for protect land for our big animal as our human population grow it be crucial for our lion and elephant to have such space 
 our rhino also require armed guard to safeguard they from ruthless poaching gang finance by chinese criminal when there be no guard massive number of the animal get kill by these brutal gang legal hunting pay for the guard and kill far few 
 when we as a family be in south africa we see the consequence of what happen with rhino to try to disincentivise the illegal poaching of rhino the rhino be de horn but such be the value of rhino horn now even from dead animal because of ill conceive ban on its use rhino be now be poach just for that part of the horn that be no long visible which be part of an extension of the head that be a consequence an unintended consequence obviously of the restriction on country export the rhino horn from dead animal that be why this be a very nuanced debate and i be not sure we be get as close to that today as their lordship be when they be debate the legislation on report in their house 
 this very important letter from maxi louis go on to say 
 the evidence for this be in the peer review science which show how successful africa ’s system be at defend our precious animal people who have read this science and back legal hunting include the eu commission 
 i be not sure that be his strong argument 
 and george monbiot 
 which be a strong argument he continue 
 so do the global regulator the international union for conservation of nature we use legal hunting to manage our big animal because they be a mortal risk to we and our child african life be at stake 
 you do not have any dangerous wild animal britain get rid of its last brown bear year ago and its last wolf year ago 
 in his conclusion he say that 
 wildlife in africa be flourish because of our management we ask for no more virtue signal it be arrogant ignorant and racist 
 i could not have put it well myself that be why i be disappointed that the government continue to pander to those who would fit into the description give by maxi louis 
 i turn now to the amendment that be make to the bill introduce in the last session by my hon friend the member for crawley in introduce this bill today   the right hon member for warley john spellar   do not refer to that except to say that that amendment be in the propose legislation and that it show how we have pass a bill to the other place as a result of a consensus that be interpretation of what happen on that friday when we be debate amendment on report essentially what happen as you may recall madam deputy speaker be that there be a large number of amendment and a deal be do whereby of those amendment be accept and all the other be reject new clause about set up an advisory board on hunt trophy be now in the bill and i wish to speak briefly about the importance of that and the background to it 
 who will decide on issue relate to hunt trophy i think we should have expertise rather than people who be prejudiced clause state 
 the secretary of state must appoint an advisory board on hunt trophy 
 the advisory board 
 the advisory board appoint under subsection may have up to 
 member 
 the role of the advisory board be to advise the secretary of state 
 a on any question relate to this act which the secretary of state may 
 refer to the committee 
 b on any matter relate to the import to great britain of hunt trophy derive from specie of animal which appear to the secretary of state to be or to be likely to become endanger 
 that be an improvement on the original bill because it would require the secretary of state to take advice instead of just listen to the mob so to speak and i be pleased that that measure be in the bill clause 4(4 state 
 in appoint member of the advisory board the secretary of state must have regard to their expertise in matter relate to the import of hunt trophy 
 thing we discuss previously which i do not think we have discuss today be the extent of the bill the bill extend to england wales scotland and northern ireland but the prohibition on import apply only to import into great britain why be that and why do the right hon gentleman in limit the bill to import into great britain think that that will help meet his objective do it not show that we be no long nation of the united kingdom but that there will be a different regime in northern ireland compare with the that prevail in the rest of our country i hope the minister will be able to explain why if the government be in favour of the bill and if they purport to be a government for the whole united kingdom rather than just great britain they be propose to restrict the import of hunt trophy into great britain and not into northern ireland perhaps it have something to do with the fact that there be an open border between northern ireland and ireland and that ireland be in the european union which have a much more benevolent approach to the import of hunt trophy than this government seem to have that important issue need to be address in the bill and i hope that if it go into committee we can ensure that its provision apply equally to all part of the united kingdom 
 there be no need to speak at great length on something like this when the argument against the bill be so strong but we should not vilify those people who engage in conservation measure in the way that some have be seek to do the proof of the pudding be in the eating if we compare kenya with other country in southern africa we see that kenya ’s well intend ban have be totally counterproductive whereas in southern africa there have be tremendous progress on the conservation of endangered specie 
 on a lateral point be the collection of rare and endangered butterfly specie illegal in this country no with very few exception if we be free to pin butterfly to the wall or put they in display cabinet do it suit we to preach to people in africa about their conservation measure i think not we talk about the importance of cull which be essential to control the number of a species in the restricted area of a wildlife park we cull in this country particularly deer that culling can include the use of rifle to shoot the deer that people think have the fine antler those antler be keep as trophy that be not my line of business at all but i respect that other people might like to do that it be all part of cull to ensure that we do not have too many deer to manage 
 this complex bill be worthy of far detailed consideration but i be worried that the government may have a secret agenda they may try to use the parliament act on this legislation i would be grateful if my hon friend the minister could assure i that under no circumstance will the government seek to override the parliament of this united kingdom by seek to use the parliament act on a bill that be reject in the other house not because it be vote down but because not enough time be give for it i be not sure that there be any precedent for the parliament act be use when debate in the other place have be curtail through lack of time the bill have be bring back in the next session and the government ’s failure to provide time be use as a justification for use the parliament act i would be grateful if the minister could respond to that point when she wind up the debate 
 finally let i put on record that i be against this bill have a reading in its present form hopefully i will have the opportunity to vote that way later 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be pleased to speak on this important bill the importation to the uk of trophy produce during the barbaric sport of trophy hunting should have end a long time ago i thank my right hon friend   the member for warley john spellar   for introduce the bill follow the early bill from   the hon member for crawley henry smith we need to get this sorted today because we have have warley and crawley and i be not sure there be another constituency that rhyme 
 i thank animal welfare charity nationwide include paw humane society international world animal protection and ban trophy hunting they have work tirelessly for year to ensure that this legislation be pass and have produce the most helpful briefing   note for this debate i also pay tribute to the former president of botswana ian khama who have be a tireless and passionate campaigner on these issue 
 however for all the praise that our campaigner be due we should not have need to be here debate this bill today the legislation should have be pass by this government long ago we all know that member of the public include in my constituency overwhelmingly support the bill the wide public support for it be reflect in the fact that ban hunt trophy be both a conservative manifesto promise as the hon member for crawley say and a labour manifesto promise why be this measure promise by the government not already in law why do they fail to bring forward their own bill ban trophy hunting as they pledge to voter that they would give that an early private member ’s bill seek to implement a ban progress through the house last year why be we here again debate an equivalent bill it be because the bill we debate last year be deliberately and wholly undemocratically derail by a small number of mostly hereditary conservative peer as my hon friend   the member for eltham clive efford   point out those peer ignore the will of the public the welfare of animal and their own party ’s manifesto commitment and use the amendment process as a block device labour member think that that be unacceptable and our party want this long promise and long overdue legislation progress as soon as possible 
 when that bill reach the house of lords no peer step forward to sponsor it why do no labour peer do so 
 i thank the hon gentleman for point that out obviously there be issue go on in the other place that i be not party to at the time so i be sorry but i can not comment on his point 
 the hon lady keep refer disparagingly to hereditary peer but be it not correct to say that a significant proportion of hereditary peer be elect to that house unlike most of the other peer who be appointee 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that he say that i keep refer to hereditary peer but i have refer to they once in response to of my colleague 
 it be fascinating that some conservative members want to defend not only this completely outdated and barbaric practice of trophy hunting but the procedure by which a few hereditary peer be elect among themselves no member of the public have any say in the matter may i help my hon friend by say that in the previous session the bill be introduce by a conservative member indeed a conservative member of the house of lords be go to take up that bill but someone else shoot in and grab it beforehand with a bit of sleight of hand if   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope   want to defend that sort of jiggery pokery he be welcome to 
 order i be anxious for we to come back to the bill before we as oppose to discuss a bill that we might deal with later today about hereditary peer 
 thank you for clarify that madam deputy speaker i thank my right hon friend the member for warley for set out what happen in the lords but i will move on 
 the bill will prevent people from bring into great britain hunt trophy from the specie list in annex a which be the most endangered specie or annex b which be specie threaten by commercial trade of the principal wildlife trade regulation those list largely correspond to equivalent in cite which be an important international agreement protect endangered plant and animal and the uk be a party to it the bill also create an advisory board on hunt trophy as some conservative members highlight which will advise the secretary of state on any issue relate to the legislation or any matter relate to the import to great britain of hunt trophy derive from specie that be or be likely to become endanger 
 i can not emphasise enough how crucial this legislation be trophy hunting be not only barbaric but wholly unnecessary in this country as in most other we have long recognise that animal should not be subject to unnecessary suffering that principle be reflect domestically in our animal welfare act and align with our understanding support by animal welfare science and enshrine in legislation that animal be sentient being as such they deserve to be treat with dignity and humanity 
 there be nothing dignified or humane about the sport of trophy hunting it involve kill innocent animal for the sole purpose of turn their body into trophy the animal often experience immense pain fear and distress in the moment before they die some may be shoot by inexperienced hunter use less efficient weapon such as crossbow or spear which do not deliver a rapid death we see this with cecil the lion in who suffer for several hour follow his wounding by crossbow in a beautiful part of southern africa before he be finally put out of his misery his death quite rightly cause outrage around the world include here in britain 
 other practice that trophy hunting can involve raise further welfare concern i be horrify to learn of the practice of canned hunting the captive wildlife farming of animal for hunting it often involve inflict extremely poor welfare condition on the captive wild animal mostly lion who may have to suffer from unsatisfactory enclosure a lack of enrichment and insufficient provision of shelter and vet treatment all so that part of their body may eventually become somebody ’s trophy let we not forget the negative impact that trophy hunting can have on other animal such as the harm to offspring who may be unable to survive on their own after their parent be leave for dead that be highlight early as be the weakening of the gene pool these be important factor to consider 
 trophy hunting can have a negative impact on wildlife trophy hunter tend to target the world ’s most iconic animal include endangered wild animal specie such as lion polar bear giraffe and rhino hunter selfishly kill these vulnerable animal so that they can display their body part as some sort of perverse prize world animal protection note that british hunter have bring home approximately hunt trophy since the 1980s and approximately of these come from specie at risk of extinction the public be right to find   this absolutely abhorrent and to want to increase the protection afford to these specie which be already under pressure from habitat loss climate change poach and the illegal wildlife trade by pass this important legislation my hon friend   the member for canterbury rosie duffield   eloquently outline those issue early 
 let we not forget how unnecessary these horror be compare with the overall revenue that local economy gain from tourism income from trophy hunting be insignificant a report by economist at large that analyse african country find that while overall tourism be between and of gdp in the country the total economic contribution of trophy hunter be at most about of gdp in stark contrast to the claim make by some conservative members 
 there be more ethical and sustainable alternative to trophy hunting for conservation a recent study show that of previous or potential tourist to south africa include those visit from within africa would be willing to pay a daily lion protection fee for wildlife conservation photographic safaris which as the born free foundation put it involve shoot an animal 
 with a camera not a gun 
 be another welfare friendly alternative to hunt trophy these alternative activity have the potential to generate income equalling or even exceed the income generate from trophy hunting without cause pain and suffering to wild animal my hon friend the member for eltham highlight that when he mention the amazing experience he have on his photographic safari 
 support global effort to promote humane tourism be consistent with recent legislation pass in this house namely the animals low welfare activities abroad act however i note that the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs be yet to even consult on the activate regulation that be necessary for the act to have any impact or to give any indication of when such consultation will begin i encourage he to do so as a matter of urgency because wild animal deserve protection and that require regulatory action 
 on this and so many animal welfare issue the government be let animal and the public down by fail to act as the shadow secretary of state my hon friend   the member for croydon north steve reed point out last friday when another private member ’s bill contain a broken conservative party promise be before the house the government have completely abandon an extraordinary number of the animal welfare pledge they have make the government like to tell the public that they have progress world lead animal welfare commitment but compassion in world farming rank the uk only among european country by percentage of cage free farm animal trail luxembourg austria sweden the netherlands germany slovenia denmark and belgium 
 although the government have announce their support for private member bills on animal welfare issue put forward by their back bench mps since they abandon the animal welfare kept animals bill that be not leadership i gently say to the minister that if the government really care about animal and wish to honour the enormous public interest in pass strong law for animal they would put forward their own   promise measure until they do so labour will keep remind the government of their broken promise and put forward private member bill like this which we hope will become law as soon as possible we have see in the house today a near unanimous show of support this be not racist colonial legislation it be uk law govern what come into the uk that be our right and the bill seek to exercise that so let ’s get on with it and get it do 
 many member on both side of the house have be eagerly await the passing of this piece of legislation as have many outside campaigner who have work tirelessly on the issue and many of our constituent i have have many email on the issue in taunton deane i thank   the right hon member for warley john spellar   for introduce the bill and all those who have take part in the debate not least my hon friend   the member for crawley henry smith who do such a sterling job just year ago i think he will agree that we have a lively debate then and we have have a similarly lively debate today 
 i want to list some of the colleague from both side of the house who have speak eloquently my hon friend   the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton   make the point well about take photograph of these wonderful creature there be intervention by my right hon friend the members for chipping barnet theresa villiers and for suffolk coastal dr coffey and my hon friend   the member for watford dean russell but there have also be move speech in particular from my hon friend the member for crawley of course many opposition speaker have join in as well 
 it be clear that the issue of hunt trophy continue to divide opinion we have witness some of that today from my hon friend the members for christchurch sir christopher chope and for north herefordshire sir bill wiggin there be disagreement over the scientific social economic moral and ethical rationale for trophy hunting and that will no doubt continue for some time there be those who point to evidence of the potential benefit of well manage hunting we hear a great deal about that from my hon friend the member for north herefordshire we also hear the other side of the argument with evidence of the harm cause by poor practice 
 i want to stress something critical we face the triple planetary crisis of biodiversity loss climate change and pollution those be the great threat we face globally and as the nature minister they be in my inbox every day i be only too aware of all those threat and of how we need to tackle they about animal and plant specie face extinction much of that have occur very recently in our lifetime the abundance diversity and connectivity of specie be decline fast than at any time in human history and that include the specie target for trophy hunting we all know and love they elephant rhino lion leopard and polar bear to name just a handful 
 there be those who argue that ban the import of trophy from those animal will do nothing to improve their conservation status and i be certainly listen to   my hon friend on that but we have to ask ourselves whether import into great britain trophy from endangered animal help to tackle biodiversity loss do this trade really help to secure a sustainable future for specie on the brink of extinction many animal be under terrible threat anyway because their habitat be shrink that be happen for a range of social and economic reason but climate change be certainly part of it ultimately the aim of the bill be to ensure that import of hunt trophy to great britain do not put additional pressure on already threaten specie that be what should concentrate our mind and that be why i be pleased to confirm that the government will support the bill in do so we signal our continue determination to fulfil our manifesto commitment in this regard 
 i have hear the argument that a ban will have implication for local community and conservation effort globally which be definitely something we must consider carefully we must be alive to the unintended consequence however the bill be about import into great britain as many have say in the debate my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal remind we of that this be about listen to the british public there be a clear strong and consistent message that we need to bring to an end the import of endanger animal take as hunt trophy the wind of change be blow we in that direction and a number of country have already put restriction in place 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i be not go to take any intervention because member have make so many already and we do not want to restrict the debate on the ultra low emission zone but i will refer to some of the point that my hon friend rightly raise in a moment 
 it be important to recognise that the import ban will not prevent a uk resident or citizen from participate in hunting while they be overseas trophy hunting can and will continue around the world it be right that each country should be able to decide how good to manage its own wildlife and the bill do not change that that point be highlight vociferously by my hon friend the members for christchurch and for north herefordshire but it have to be remember that we be not prevent that country around the world on both side of the debate have have regular opportunity to discuss this issue and raise their point indeed we have have letter from the president of botswana and namibia the high commissioner be write to just yesterday 
 it be important to keep in mind the contribution that the uk trade in hunt trophy make annual import of hunt trophy to the uk be very few in number on average there have be a year over the last year even so it be essential that we play our part to ensure that community around the world benefit from conserve the wildlife that they live alongside that be reflect in the agreement of the hugely important global biodiversity framework there be now a strong and essential focus on how as a global community we finance biodiversity conservation and restoration work member will be aware of just how much the government be do on that front with our huge £ darwin initiative   and our £ darwin plus initiative all of that focus on biodiversity and conservation work with local and indigenous people 
 penultimately let i run through some of the provision in the bill the bill will ban the import of hunt trophy from specific specie with the explicit aim of ensure that import into great britain do not place unnecessary pressure on specie that be at risk for those specie an import ban without exemption will be the most effective protection as it will provide clarity and address the conservation concern arise from trophy hunting 
 clause and make provision for the import ban which will cover trophy bring into great britain from animal hunt after the legislation come into force there be strict clear line about anything that happen before that the definition of a hunting trophy in clause be 
 the body of an animal or a readily recognisable part or derivative of an animal that be obtain through hunting for the hunter ’s personal use 
 that be how hunt trophy be define in our current control under cite

 let i quickly discuss the impact assessment as i do not allow any intervention we hear some view about the impact assessment and what the government will do about it but there be side to that the impact assessment present both side of the debate but it also highlight that trophy hunting can lead to population decline and that over hunting threaten more than of endangered mammal specie accord to the international union for conservation of nature the impact assessment also note that trophy hunt quota be inappropriate unscientific excessive and over reliant on opinion and that the management of such quota be base on poor quality datum similarly a report by the university of oxford find that the damaging effect of the unsustainable trade in hunting can extend beyond hunt area 
 i hope that i have answer some of the question this have be a very positive and lively debate on both side of the house i thank the right hon member for warley for bring the bill back to the house and reconfirm that the government be fully commit to support it 
 with the leave of the house i call john spellar to wind up 
 object

 will the serjeant at arm investigate the delay in the lobby 
 the house have divide ayes noes 
 question accordingly agree to 
 bill read a time to stand committed to a public bill committee standing order no 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 the bill would overturn the expansion of the ulez scheme simply because it be a cruel cruel form of taxation it be particularly cruel to the poor in society hit heavily those people who have old motor vehicle that they can not afford to upgrade with or without a scrappage scheme it be also very unfair on business owner especially those in outer london who lose out on business that they would otherwise have secure from people travel in from neighbouring county to purchase their good and on people who live outside london who have no say in who the london mayor be 
 the border between london and the home county be not neat people in my constituency live in kent but some of they have to go into london just to exit their road the border straddle some road it be a border that can not be avoid and the mayor of london know that 
 my hon friend and parliamentary neighbour be make an impressive start he and i share road in crayford and dartford where people live on different side of the road pay different taxis some people such as gardener and plumber travel regularly from dartford to bexleyheath and crayford for work and they can not afford this it be so unfair especially as it be not in the mayor ’s manifesto when he be last elect 
 that be an absolutely valid point but i would go far about of police officer in the metropolitan police area live outside london and commute in and the percentage for all emergency worker be probably about the same these be the people who londoner rely on the most they be vital to londoner but if their vehicle be not ulez compliant they be hit with £ every single time they go to work even bad those do night shift have to pay on the way in and on the way out again because at am there might be no public transport for emergency worker to be hit with £ just for do a night shift be totally and utterly wrong 
 my hon friend be make a great speech as he know he have my full support do he agree that today we will see whose side labour member be on be they go to talk the bill out or be they go to back those emergency service worker and other in bexley who want to be rid of ulez 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for the work that he have do in this respect he be entirely right we will see today whether labour member be in favour of the worker or in favour of sadiq khan 
 i be follow the hon gentleman ’s argument with interest in bristol we have experience the year of a clean air zone which be actually impose on we as a requirement by the then secretary of state for environment food and   rural affairs   the right hon member for suffolk coastal dr coffey because the government have be take to court by clientearth for be in breach of air pollution limit and therefore insist that we should adopt the scheme in bristol if i have a chance to speak later i will comment on how successful it be but in any case that seem slightly at odd with the hon gentleman ’s argument about local autonomy 
 i be grateful for that intervention because it give i an opportunity to smash the myth that the expansion of the ulez scheme have anything whatsoever to do with air pollution if it be about air pollution the mayor of london would ban motor vehicle from go into london but he do not want to ban they he want to make money out of they if those motorist give the mayor £ they can drive all day long in london he do not give a damn take my constituency in dartford for example many people who previously use the blackwall tunnel with ulez non compliant vehicle be now have to use the dartford crossing to get across the thames it be add to pollution in area such as dartford not remove it
