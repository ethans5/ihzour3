as my constituency contain the rivers axe brue parrett and tone together with countless stream brook and rhyne it be of the utmost importance to my constituent that the water quality of our river be maintain and improve the parish of burnham on sea and highbridge be a coastal resort as be the village of berrow and brean it be important for the tourism industry as well as the local people who enjoy those beach that we improve the quality of our bathing water and i therefore welcome the bill we be tell that it have key aim 
 to block the payment of bonus to executive who pollute waterway 
 to bring criminal charge against persistent law breaker 
 to impose automatic and severe fine for wrongdoing and 
 to ensure independent monitoring of every 
 sewer overflow—“outlet 
 i welcome all those aim build as they do on the work of the last government to improve our water quality 
 i want to speak in favour of new clause and new clause entitle establishment of water restoration fund establish the principle that fine should go towards environmental improvement rather than to the treasury i be somewhat curious as to why the government would not support that but perhaps the minister can explain when she respond to the debate in november wessex water which serve my constituency be fin £ for pollute river in wiltshire and in somerset that money should be use to improve the local environment it should not be swallow up by the treasury 
 new clause state that when civil penalty be impose there should be an equivalent reduction in customer bill that be important because otherwise the water company that have be fin will simply pass on that fine to the consumer the new clause would ensure that there be no penalty for the customer i be curious again to know why the government would oppose new clause along with new clause and i look forward to hear the minister ’s explanation 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to help reduce the backlog of case in the crown court 
 what step her department be take to help reduce the backlog of case in the crown court 
 when her department expect the crown court backlog to decrease 
 the last government leave we with a record and rise backlog case be take year to be hear and the number of victim drop out at police stage have nearly double we have take step to deliver swifter justice by increase sit day to a year high and extend magistrate court sentencing power but we must go far that be why i have commission sir brian leveson to conduct a review of the court ask he to propose once in a generation reform 
 we all want justice to be serve as quickly as possible and many of my constituent have contact i recently with concern about law and order give the various medium report about unused capacity in court up and down the country what be the secretary of state ’s department do to ensure that every aspect of the justice system be work efficiently and at full capacity 
 the hon gentleman make a good point and i share his concern and those of his constituent indeed i see many such case in my own constituency advice surgery we be work at pace to ensure that every bit of the criminal justice system be work at its maximum efficient capacity that include everything from police stage right through to sentencing in the court i be sure that he will be aware of the very strained situation we inherit it will take some time for those change to take effect but we be drive forward system efficiency and sir brian leveson ’s review will give we a policy package with which to reform the system for the benefit of all victim 
 constituent across bromsgrove and the village be sick and tired of violent criminality and lawlessness creep over the border from birmingham into our constituency in the past year romsley co op and wythall post office at drakes cross both of which be on the northern fringe of my constituency have be raid and it be hard to believe that proximity to birmingham be not a factor in that what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that prosecution be pursue and custodial sentence be give in the instance to crack down on crime and make our area safe again 
 through our landmark review of sentencing this government be ensure that sentencing be fit for purpose that will ultimately put we in a position where we can crack down on reoffende thereby cut crime and the number of victim i be not sure whether the hon gentleman be propose carve out his part of the world from any other part of the country but his argument about boundary can apply to any part of the uk that be why we need a function justice system for the whole of england and wales and that be what this government be go to deliver 
 the justice secretary have say that she agree with the old legal maxim that justice delay be justice deny we currently have a record backlog of in the crown court rape case be not be prosecute for or year and in particular on any day of case do not take place for a variety of reason what be the justice secretary do to speed up the whole system 
 i agree with the chair of the public accounts committee that the backlog be far too high he will know that no matter what we do in term of system efficiency and capacity that backlog be project to rise because the demand come into the system be particularly high and be itself rise that be why i have ask sir brian leveson to consider once in a generation policy reform so that we can make the legislative change necessary to bring the backlog down that be the change that be require alongside system wide efficiency and productivity 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 the secretary of state have announce major review of the criminal justice system the leveson review and the gauke review and have say that very impressively they might report by the spring which could be   march there be a difference between report and take action so could she set out exactly when she expect the result of those review to have a direct impact on case number 
 the chair of the justice committee be tempt i to pre empt what the review will find those finding will of course dictate the pace at which change can then occur he will be aware of the acute pressure on our prison system despite the emergency lever that i have have to pull that have only buy we some time as i have say when regularly update the house the sentencing review measure have to take account of our remain problem with prison capacity   once the review have be publish we will move quickly to decide which recommendation to take forward on the court package it be likely that any measure will also require legislative reform again i will seek to move at pace on that but that rather depend on the package of measure that sir brian leveson ultimately recommend 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the court backlog be grow by case every month and the ministry of justice have not set a date for when it will come down victim be be force to put their life on hold while they wait for a trial date yet today at the old bailey half of all the courtroom sit empty the lady chief justice have say that there be additional sit day available that could be use now who be the obstacle to resolve this be it the justice secretary who be content for rape trial to be schedule for as far off as or be it the chancellor and the justice secretary have just have ring run around she by the treasury 
 what an absolutely outrageous set of remark the right hon member completely forget that only month ago his government be in charge the government of which he be part all but run our justice system into the ground i do not recall see he stand up and speak about delay for rape victim or indeed any other kind of victim when he be on this side of the house i be glad he have now realise that the system ought to try to put victim his critique would have more force be it not for the fact that this government have come to office only month ago have increase crown court sitting capacity by day 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of the term and condition for prison officer pension on the recruitment of prison officer 
 may i take this opportunity to pay tribute to our prison staff for the essential work that they do we be committed to improve the retention of experienced staff because they be vital to keep our prison run the lord chancellor have request advice from official on the pension age of prison officer and we will continue to engage with trade union as this be consider 
 i thank the minister for his warm word and encouraging remark he will know that in scotland the be too late campaign by the prison officers association enjoy cross party and scottish government support but the uk government have refuse to take action on this important issue the current retirement term ignore the reality of the frontline role that prison officer perform in prison on a daily basis across the uk it be a dangerous role and no less so than that of firefighter or the police who enjoy very different term although justice be devolve to the scottish parliament the pension of scottish prison   officer be control by the uk government so will the minister or the secretary of state commit the government to review the current prison officer retirement age of and will he meet i to hear this case in more detail 
 as i have say the lord chancellor have request advice on this matter we promote our strong employee total reward package as part of our recruitment the term and condition of the civil service pension scheme be some of the good in the public sector with a low employee contribution rate and a significant employer contribution rate of however that do not mean it be not a right and proper question to ask and if the hon member wish to have a meeting with i i be quite happy to meet he 
 what step her department be take to support female offender 
 what step her department be take to support female offender 
 what step her department be take to support female offender 
 what step her department be take to support female offender 
 this government ’s plan to support woman be clear and ambitious to reduce the number of woman go to prison and to have few woman ’s prison our woman ’s justice board which meet for the time last week will support implement this vision i would also remind the house that as the minister responsible for youth justice i have initiate a review of the placement of girl in custody on which susannah hancock will report at the end of this month 
 what family support be available for woman at foston hall prison and young offender institution 
 we know that family support be very important to woman in custody which be why grant funding have be award to the charity parents and child together pact to provide a resettlement family engagement worker in hmp foston hall as well as in other woman ’s prison 
 gaie delap the mother of a constituent of mine be recall to prison just before christmas despite comply with her curfew condition because the government ’s electronic monitoring service contractor could not fulfil its contract and find a tag to fit a frail year old woman can the minister and the secretary of state help to find a solution so that gaie delap can be release on her curfew and so that woman be not disadvantage by the failing of the contractor ’s electronic monitoring system 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this matter in this case the court ’s decision be to impose a prison sentence and neither ministers nor official can intervene in sentence pass down by our independent court i understand the frustration and can assure the house that we be work hard to find alternative approach to ensure a secure resolution to this issue 
 there be more than woman prisoner in england and wales a number that the ministry of justice project will rise to by november like many i welcome the newly establish women ’s justice board which will oversee effort to tackle this issue and ensure a tailored approach to female offender what measure be be implement to provide support through community sentence and residential woman ’s centre 
 we be award £ for the upcoming year to community organisation and local area that be already support woman in the community we be also employ option to increase the use of residential provision as an alternative to short custodial sentence that include engage with the judiciary to ensure that the option of a community order with a residential requirement be consider in appropriate case 
 i welcome the launch of the women ’s justice board which be intend to reduce the number of woman in our prison cut reoffende and well support our child will the minister work with organisation from across the country include north wales women ’s centre to ensure not only that their voice be at the heart of the work go on but that they have the resource and support need to support the most vulnerable in our society 
 i pay tribute to woman ’s centre across the country such as that in north wales for the excellent contribution that their work make i agree that short custodial sentence can be problematic they exacerbate woman ’s underlie need without allow time for rehabilitation and they separate mother from child and mean that woman be more likely to reoffend that be why the women ’s justice board i be grateful to my hon friend for welcome it aim to increase the number of woman support in the community the board will also look at how we can well support mother with young child 
 do the minister accept that allow biological man into woman ’s prison increase the risk to female offender do he far accept that only biological woman should be house in woman ’s prison 
 the vast majority of transgender prisoner be in man ’s prison we have continue the policy of the previous government but all policy be always under review 
 across the uk we face the bizarre and worrying reality that common sense protection for woman be be dismiss for example in northern ireland a motion to ensure that   biologically male prisoner who identify as woman be hold in male prison have be oppose by many elect representative in the northern ireland assembly   and it be an issue that extend across the uk what assurance we do want assurance can the minister give that woman ’s safety be take seriously and that they be guarantee single sex space in prison and other setting free from biological male who identify as woman 
 safe space for woman be crucial and a no priority in everything we do 
 the minister refer to keep under review the question of place biological man in woman ’s prison will he speak to the justice minister in northern ireland and ensure that she review that policy only last week she be defend the very policy that put woman at risk from biological man who be claim the right to be retain in woman ’s prison 
 that be a devolved matter though clearly we be happy to speak to the devolved government about any issue 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of the lesson learn follow the southport attack 
 i be sure that the whole house will join i in say that our thought today be with the victim of these horrific crime and their family last week we see a measure of justice do but over a number of year there be widespread state failure that mean that this attacker be not stop it be right that there will be an inquiry the ministry of justice will play its full part and i will ensure that any lesson for we be learn 
 when the tragedy of southport happen crucial detail about the case could not be reveal to ensure that the trial do not collapse and the vile perpetrator do not walk away as a free man however some on social medium be play by different rule do the secretary of state think that our contempt rule be fit for the modern world 
 my hon friend raise an important point the government would not say anything that would risk collapse this trial the medium follow the law and so do everyone in this house but the same be not true online as the prime minister have say this challenge clearly must be address the law commission be review contempt law we will look closely at that work and consider these issue in the round 
 but the information release shortly before the trial do not collapse the case have it be release in august it might have have a dampening effect on those unhelpful voice on social medium might it not 
 as i say in my previous answer it be clear that the fast pace of the online world have some significant challenge for our present arrangement around contempt law the government ’s approach which be to do nothing that might risk collapse the trial be the right i hope that will have support across the house it would have be in no ’s interest to take any risk with the safety of the trial as i have say the online space pose some challenge for our contempt law arrangement and the law commission be rightly look into that 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 contempt of court law be guardrail that ensure fair trial do the justice secretary accept that as the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation have say by fail to provide basic information to the public that have be disclose in previous case information that would not prejudice a trial the authority create a vacuum in which misinformation spread that misinformation could itself have be prejudicial to the trial do she agree that in an age when most people consume their news through social medium say nothing be not cost free will she commit to review this issue now rather than wait for the law commission 
 there will always be differ view among lawyer about what can and can not be say it be right that the government take their own position and that we do nothing that could risk collapse the trial i agree with the shadow secretary of state that the online world pose a significant challenge to our contempt law that be why that be already be look at as there be a piece of work already under way i do not want to pre empt where that could land the law commission have a good track record of consider major law change because of the inquiry and the fast move nature of these thing i will keep this area under close review myself 
 if she will bring forward legislative proposal to enable court to order the attendance of offender at sentencing hearing 
 by fail to attend their sentencing hearing criminal add insult to injury and deny victim and their family a vital part of see justice do iusb will be legislate to give judge the power to order attendance at sentencing hearing and i will make it clear in the law that reasonable force can be use to make sure that happen the prime minister and i meet cheryl korbel last week to discuss these proposal and we will ensure that the family of other victim be involve before the bill be put before the house 
 i thank the secretary of state for that positive response and i thank she and the prime minister for meet i and my constituent cheryl korbel the mother of olivia pratt korbel the year old who be tragically murder in cheryl be pleased that the government have commit to implement olivia ’s law without delay can the minister ensure that   cheryl be involve in the development of this law place victim and their family at the heart of the justice system 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for the work she be do on behalf of her constituent i be pleased to be able to discuss these matter with she she be absolutely right and it be crucial that we make progress in this area we have commit to introduce that legislation before the summer and i will as i promise last week consult olivia ’s family and the family of other victim for whom non attendance at sentencing hearing have cause problem 
 there be a small number of people who through due process appear in court and be convict but who decline to come up to the court room for sentencing the secretary of state have indicate her intention to move on this do she agree that the government need to show a very robust approach so that people who show disdain and contempt for the rule of law be show that there be no room for manoeuvre and that they must and will appear in court 
 the hon member be right it be already expect that defendant will attend sentencing hearing but we know that some take the opportunity not to face the family of their victim which cause huge trauma to some of the family we will clarify and put on a statutory foot the expectation of attendance at sentencing hearing along with sanction for deal with offender who still despite be compel to attend court even through the use of reasonable force seek to disrupt hearing 
 what step her department be take to help tackle hyper prolific offender 
 what step her department be take to help tackle hyper prolific offender 
 the government have inherit a situation where of offender account for of all offence we have also inherit an epidemic of shoplifting the kind of antisocial crime that blight community i have commission david gauke to review how sentence could be reform to address prolific offending reduce reoffende cut crime and ultimately make our street safe 
 i believe in chance and perhaps even more chance in some case but the excellent policy exchange report the wicked and the redeemable a long term plan to fix a criminal justice system in crisis find that hyper prolific offender those with more than previous conviction be send to prison on few than half of the occasion on which they be convict of a subsequent indictable or either way offence give that those people commit such high number of crime which usually affect our least affluent constituent what consideration have the government give to the    report ’s recommendation particularly on introduce a mandatory year sentence for hyper prolific offender who be convict of a subsequent indictable or either way offence 
 the right hon member raise an important point about an issue that blight community across the country i agree that we need a specific strategy for deal with prolific offender of course different organisation use different definition of what count as a prolific offender or hyper prolific offender and that be why i have ask david gauke to look specifically at this cohort of offender in the independent sentencing review the revolving door of prison and other type of sentence for they be clearly not have an impact we must think about the intervention that will make the big difference to the large number of those offender so that we can cut crime and have few victim 
 the lord chancellor rightly say that less than of criminal account for nearly half of crime i understand that a sentencing review be under way but any decision be for minister to make will the right hon lady please rule out here and now any possibility of allow career criminal to avoid prison even for short sentence 
 the hon member will know that i be not go to pre empt any of the finding of the sentencing review the point of have an independent review be to allow for a look at all the issue in the round i have make it clear that i be particularly concerned about the people who she rightly term career criminal and i be particularly keen to think about the intervention that could make the big difference so that we can reduce this blight on our community that be a clear statement of intent from the government show how seriously we take prolific offending but the measure that we choose to take forward will be clear once the sentencing review have report 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as the secretary of state mention the approach to manage hyper prolific offender be part of david gauke ’s review which could consider for example the wide use of gps tag and home curfew but the department have be undertake its own assessment of the effectiveness of gps tag will the government commit to publish that review before or alongside the sentencing review so that we can properly judge the merit of any propose expansion 
 as i have seek to do throughout this process i will ensure transparency in the government ’s approach when it come to not just the emergency release datum but other information that underpin future policy choice 
 i do not quite hear a yes but i will take that as an encouraging commitment that the secretary of state will publish the gps tag review ahead of any sentencing review however i be afraid that in minister discussion of these issue they risk lose sight of the fact that imprisonment also serve the   important purpose of punish offender in the interest of justice importantly how will the government decide whether any of david gauke ’s proposal that they be minded to accept sufficiently punish offender how will that judgment be make before any recommendation be accept 
 i have say on many occasion in this house that i believe in punishment and in prison prison have a core role to play in the punishment of offender however we must not run out of prison place we must balance the need to punish and imprison people with intervention that expand the use of punishment outside prison interruption the hon gentleman say build more from a sedentary position we be we be move forward to solve the prison place deficit leave by his government at the last election this government will build prison but as he know we can not build our way out of the prison capacity crisis we must consider other measure as well but let i be clear we will always seek to punish offender and prison will always have a place this government will build more prison place than the previous 
 what step her department be take to increase prison capacity 
 what step her department be take to increase prison capacity 
 we take immediate action to prevent the collapse of the prison system by implement sds40 we be build new prison place and have publish our year capacity strategy we have launch an independent sentencing review so that we never run out of prison place again 
 i welcome the government ’s action to increase prison capacity but i be worried about youth custody my local police force be particularly concerned that there be simply not enough space in the secure custodial estate many vulnerable young people be at risk of be exploit by organise criminal gang that be less to do with young offender institution and more to do with the lack of capacity in secure child ’s home that capacity have fall since the number of ministry of justice contract space be now around only for the entire country which be appalling how will the minister work with department for education to increase capacity and protect vulnerable young people and our resident 
 we certainly do not wish to reduce capacity i can confirm that we contract with local authority secure child ’s home and place child there in we contract for bed and currently we contract for that correlate with a decrease in the number of young people in custody mostly over the period when the conservatives be in government we do not currently intend to reduce overall capacity in the youth custody service estate which comprise young offender institution secure   training centre secure school and sch bed however we be recommissione secure child ’s home place and can not predetermine the outcome of that exercise but i assure my hon friend that we will not run out of space 
 december ’s annual report on prison capacity state that of the prison place available be occupy and it estimate that by we will have a prison capacity of around but the central estimate of the number of prisoner stand at what will this government do to ensure that everyone who commit a crime worthy of prison be send to prison 
 i assure my hon friend that that will be the case people who commit a crime worthy of prison will be send to prison as we have assure the house we have plan to build new prison place as set out in our year capacity strategy in month we have add prison place it take year for the conservatives to do that we have also launch an independent sentencing review so that we never run out of place again take together these measure will ensure that the country do not have more prisoner than we have space for in our prison 
 on building capacity armed force veteran concern i and many in this chamber they often live with post traumatic stress disorder and have emotional memory and nightmare of what they have do in uniform for this country what extra can be do to well look after our veteran in prison they fight with demon every day we have to look after they 
 the armed force covenant affect we all his majesty ’s prison and probation service ensure that veteran issue be properly address with the individual concern to give they the proper support that they need 
 what step she be take to support survivor of domestic abuse and violence against woman through the criminal justice system 
 this government be commit to support victim and survivor of violence against woman and girl these be abhorrent crime we be therefore fund the rape and sexual abuse support fund to the tune of £ as well as fund independent domestic and sexual violence advocate we be also strengthen the power of the victim commissioner to improve accountability where those victim need be not be meet 
 a constituent of mine from somerset be seriously sexually assault in another county more than year ago despite report the assault in she have be give a court date in december she tell i that the legal process involve both the court and the relevant police service have be more traumatising than the incident itself what well support can we offer woman who find themselves stick in these process for such length of time 
 i be terribly sorry to hear about this case we know that such case be not isolate which be why this government be bear down on the crown court backlog we be increase the number of crown court sit day and increase magistrate sentence power to free up capacity in the crown court so that we can get swifter justice for victim we be also invest in the victim transformation programme through the crown prosecution service to provide precisely the kind of support that would benefit the hon lady ’s constituent keep she engage in the process and bring those trial date forward 
 it have be reveal that just of rape and sexual offence report to lancashire police in the past year result in a charge or summon what step will the ministry take to restore confidence in the criminal justice system for my constituent 
 my hon friend will know that this government have a landmark ambition to halve violence against woman and girl and the criminal justice system have an important part to play in that while set that priority whether it be for the cps or our police we want to drive charge decision and drive up the conviction rate provide swifter justice for victim be go to require once in a generation reform to bring down the crown court backlog 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in a recent write parliamentary question i ask the government how many domestic abuser there be in prison and what their reoffende rate be under the system this government inherit from the conservatives they say that 
 it be not possible to robustly calculate the number 
 that be shocking and be in part because there be no specific offence of domestic abuse in the law to properly reflect and recognise these crime my domestic abuse aggravated offences bill would correct that loophole when will the secretary of state honour the commitment she make on good morning britain to meet i to discuss my bill and how we can well protect victim and survivor 
 tackle domestic abuse be a priority for this government the domestic abuse act set out a broad statutory definition of domestic abuse which be improve our understanding of the wide range of behaviour that can constitute this abuse while not constitute a stand alone offence domestic abuse be consider an aggravating factor routinely throughout our criminal justice system and rightly so that be the reason why that data be not collect and that be the position we will maintain 
 what step she be take to improve prison   condition 
 the right hon lady be right to raise this issue we inherit historic under investment in maintenance and a rise prison population that be why we have already publish our year prison capacity   strategy and have plan to invest £ in prison and probation service maintenance in and up to £ in 
 i rise as the co chair of the justice union parliamentary group the emergency extra money to tackle the squalid state of our prison be welcome but give the £ maintenance backlog the reality be that the extra money will not touch the side this show exactly why the privatisation of prison maintenance be a fail model private contractor may win contract on low bid but billion come in as extra cost later do the minister seriously think that current prison maintenance provider offer good service and value for money to the taxpayer 
 the right hon lady be right we inherit contract that be already well progress for good value and to move thing forward quickly we decide it be important to keep go with that process however i can assure the house that we have an open mind regard private and public sector contract in the future the important thing be to get good value for money and get the job do 
 katie allan be a beautiful and bright young woman and would have be a constituent of mine but for the fact that age she find herself after a youthful stupid mistake in polmont young offender institution where she die from suicide the fatal incident inquiry recently publish into her death and the death of william brown find that they both might be alive today be it not for a catalogue of error by the scottish prison service the family of those who have lose child in such circumstance be campaign for crown immunity to be remove from prison across britain so that there be proper accountability and more young life be not lose will the minister meet the family to discuss that proposal 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he draw attention to a deeply disturbing case i be very happy to meet he and the family concern 
 what step she be take to increase public confidence in the justice system 
 the last government give the public plenty of reason to lose confidence in the justice system include a rise court backlog and prison on the edge of collapse we have already avert a crisis in our prison and have raise crown court capacity to a year high we be now embark on reform of our court and our prison the work of restore confidence in the justice system have start it will of course take some time 
 jason hoganson be wrongly release under the government ’s early release scheme last week he be convict of assault his ex partner just a day after he be free under that botch scheme do the   secretary of state agree that this shocking case and case like it continue to undermine the public ’s trust and confidence in our justice system 
 what undermine confidence in the justice system be run out of prison place which be the inheritance the conservative government leave for this government that be the mess that we be clean up the hon gentleman will also be aware that the previous government ’s end of custody supervise licence scheme be also an early release scheme but without any of the measure on accountability and transparency or the wide set of exclusion that that we introduce with the sds40 scheme 
 on friday i meet my constituent hayley johns she have give i permission to share her story in this place hayley be a victim of domestic abuse and actual bodily harm perpetrate by an ex partner i be absolutely shocked to hear her story her ex partner be convict for year for his crime however he be be consider for release after serve just month do the justice secretary agree that give the legacy of the previous government we need to redouble our effort and the effort of this government to improve confidence in the criminal justice system can i please ask she to take a personal interest in this case 
 i will happily look at the fact of the case some of those number do not sound like they should be possible but that could be down to specific factor relate to that case if my hon friend write to i with the detail i will make sure he have a full response 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 confidence in the criminal justice system can be achieve only if support for victim and survivor be adequately fund but charity such as victim support whose service i have personally benefit from have say that for they the hike in employer national insurance contribution amount to a real term budget cut of victim need more support not less will the secretary of state fight to reverse that damaging cut and help restore victim confidence in the criminal justice system 
 the hon gentleman will be aware of the difficult fiscal inheritance for this government and that we have have to make some difficult choice we receive a good settlement from the treasury at the last budget but it be not without its challenge give the high demand in our system he will know that we have protect funding for victim of violence against woman and girl include rape and sexual offence we have seek to protect the most vulnerable victim when make decision on our victim fund package 
 what step her department be take to ensure that people convict of charge relate to groom gang receive adequate sentence 
 the right hon member raise a very important point on these heinous gang and the crime that they commit the recommendation make by alexis jay in her independent inquiry on child sexual abuse be ignore for far too long the government be work at pace to respond to they we will also legislate to make groom an aggravate factor in the sentencing of child sexual offence ensure that the punishment fit these horrific crime 
 as in bradford last week where more of the grooming gangster largely of pakistani origin who rap white girl there and elsewhere be sentence the paucity of the home secretary ’s audit whereby authority mark their own homework be make clear will the justice secretary agree to a wide range review of these matter with statutory power surely those whose life have be ruin and those whose life may yet be ruin deserve more than the weak reticence of people with power who refuse to face the fact 
 i hope that the right hon gentleman and i have a share objective in make it clear that there be a desire in all part of the house to ensure that we face the full fact and that the victim of these heinous crime receive the justice they deserve i be sorry to hear that there be concern in bradford about the audit order by the home secretary i will ensure that they be pass on to the home secretary because as the right hon gentleman will know these matter fall directly within the purview of the home department 
 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the youth justice system in prevent reoffende 
 the number of child in custody have fall significantly over the last decade but those who be detain be now a more complex and violent cohort our turnaround programme provide fund that enable youth offend team to intervene early to address child offending only of child who complete such intervention receive conviction in the year of the programme but we be continue to take stock of what more can be do 
 last week tragically year old leo ross be stab to death in birmingham as he be return home from school his year old killer have be arrest several time for violent offence in the month run up to the killing can the minister tell i what the government be do to reform the youth justice system to address and prevent the knife crime among our young people that be result in terrible tragedy like the we see last week 
 i be deeply sadden by this tragic crime and my thought and i be sure those of everyone else go to the family of leo ross such horrific event underline just how important it be to deliver our manifesto commitment to ensure that every young person catch in possession of a knife be refer to a youth offend team and that appropriate action be take we    be also pilot a new more robust form of community punishment for child involve mandatory gps monitoring and intensive supervision 
 what step she be take to reduce processing time for deputyship application by the court of protection 
 application for deputyship to the court of protection play a vital role when people need to be able to make decision for love one who lack capacity it be important to support those people through prompt and efficient process his majesty ’s courts and tribunals service have be implement an improvement plan drive down waiting time by recruit more staff enhance judicial capacity digitise application form and implement a new case management system 
 of my constituent have contact i to ask why he have be wait long month for a decision from the court of protection on his deputyship application he need to secure the deputyship in order to make crucial decision for a vulnerable love another constituent in a similar position wait for month without any acknowledgement that his application be be look into their experience be not unique solicitor and judge alike acknowledge the systemic delay plague the system do the minister agree that such long delay in processing time be unacceptable and what do she think be acceptable 
 i agree with the hon lady that such delay be not acceptable and i be sorry to hear of the distress that this will have cause it be right that we continue to invest in our improvement plan and continue to see progress with digitisation digitise the application form be a step but we want to see end to end digitisation which we know be result in decent progress and have speed up those time over recent month there be more to do and we shall do it 
 what step her department be take through the criminal justice system to help tackle violence against woman and girl 
 as i have say the government be commit to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade it be an important ambition and the criminal justice system have a vital role to play in it in november we launch a pilot promote domestic abuse protection order in select area and we have ambition to roll that out far we will also introduce independent legal adviser for adult rape victim ensure that victim have the legal support that they need and deserve 
 last week the domestic abuse commissioner find that just of report domestic abuse result in a conviction do the minister share my concern that lengthy investigation into non crime hate incident be potentially divert vital resource from the criminal justice system and from prosecute actual violence against woman and girl 
 the hon member be right to remark on the low charging and conviction rate for domestic abuse we have an ambition to drive those up that be why we be put more funding and more prioritisation into this area and call on our agency whether it be the police or the crown prosecution service to really focus on it because right now we be not do enough for woman and girl 
 the tragic reality for many woman who suffer domestic abuse and then have to go through family court proceeding on top of it be that the presumption of parental contact provide another opportunity for perpetrator of domestic abuse to prolong it the government be rightly review this will ministers ensure that we make the most of this opportunity to well protect woman who suffer domestic abuse through the family court system 
 my hon friend be right to make that point our family court should never become site of retraumatisation for victim of domestic abuse we be review the presumption and when we be ready we will publish the finding and our policy response to that review 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 this government inherit a record and rise crown court backlog and prison on the point of collapse serve as breeding ground for crime that create well criminal not well citizen the work of restore safe street in this country will be long and hard but we be take immediate action since the last justice oral we have increase the number of sit day in the crown court by this financial year and boost criminal legal aid by up to £ a year to get case move through the court more quickly we have publish a year prison capacity strategy set out plan to build new prison place to ensure we always have the space to lock up dangerous criminal we launch the women ’s justice board with clear goal to send few woman to prison we be do what it take to deliver swifter justice for victim and punishment that cut crime 
 minister have talk quite a bit today about expand power for magistrate court could the secretary of state tell i what additional funding be be make available and what training there will be for magistrate to assist they with this expand role 
 the change in relation to magistrate court sentencing power be make by the previous government due to prison capacity issue and they be work well we have restore those same power so i do not think those issue around training be necessarily engage however we will ensure that legal adviser and the full package of measure that magistrate need to fulfil their obligation be in place 
 what support have the ministry of justice put in place for those serve indeterminate sentence for public protection especially where they have additional need 
 it be right that ipp sentence be abolish last week i host a roundtable for mp to discuss their concern about ipp sentence and share the work the department be do the prisons minister in the other place host a similar roundtable for peer we be determined to make further progress towards a safe and sustainable release for those serve ipp sentence while recognise that at all time public protection be paramount 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 week ago groom gang member be sentence at bradford crown court for the most appalling rape of child but they receive only and year sentence respectively year out on licence in for the rape of a child do the secretary of state agree that those sentence be disgracefully short and will she commit to use the sentencing review to mandate full life sentence for these evil people if she will she will have our support 
 we have a share objective in make sure that these evil individual feel the full force of the law i will not comment on individual sentencing decision and the shadow lord chancellor might wish to reflect on that decision it be not appropriate to do so give our collective commitment to the independence of the judiciary however as i say in response to early question we will legislate to make groom an aggravating factor and this government will make sure that victim get the justice they deserve 
 i have write to the attorney general ask he to review those sentence as potentially unduly lenient of the man who be sentence at bradford crown court for groom gang offence be absent they be think to have abscond abroad can the justice secretary confirm how many groom gang defendant the government be currently pursue overseas and what effort be be make by the government with in this case the pakistani authority use every lever of the british state to locate these evil man and get justice for the victim 
 i will happily write to the right hon gentleman with detail on the specific case that he raise he be right to say that we have international agreement and arrangement with other jurisdiction to ensure that offender can be bring back to face justice in this country i be sure that those arrangement be be apply appropriately but i will make sure that he get a full answer on the case that he have raise 
 today we learn not only that yevgeny prigozhin a sanctioned warlord use frozen fund to make legal threat to silence a british journalist but that the enabler of this textbook example of lawfare have since go unpunished   with the solicitors regulation authority ruling that prigozhin ’s lawyer break no rule that inaction in the face of such clear cut wrongdoing show that our current framework be inadequate can the minister outline what step the government be take to create a tough deterrent against harmful lawfare tactic particularly when they be deploy by insidious individual like prigozhin 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for the campaigning work that he be do in this area journalism be the lifeblood of democracy and strategic lawsuit against public participation represent an abuse of the legal system they be use by those with deep pocket to harass and silence journalism such behaviour be intolerable my focus and the focus of this government will be on the implementation of the economic crime and corporate transparency act which introduce an early dismissal mechanism and cost protection for slapp defendant 
 last september the secretary of state confirm that foreign national offender block up our jail be be remove and deport will she update the house on how many have be remove and deport and do she agree that the fast way to free up capacity in our prison be to remove the vast majority of they 
 i agree that we need to do everything we can to remove foreign national offender from our prison between   july   and   january foreign national offender be return a increase on the same period in the previous year and we be currently on track to remove more foreign national offender this year than at any time in recent year 
 humanist marriage have be legal in scotland for year but continue to wait to be legalise in england and wales the law commission make recommendation year ago on clarify the law but when ask to set out a timetable for action the minister in the other place could only respond in the fullness of time ”—[official report house of lords   december vol c. 
 can the minister set out the timetable or alternatively say when the government will make an order to end the long wait for humanist marriage 
 i understand that humanist have be campaign for legally bind humanist wedding the government be commit to strengthen the right and protection available particularly for woman in cohabit couple we will look at the law commission ’s work and publish our response in due course 
 gambling with life be a charity that support family who have be bereave by gambling relate suicide jo from cullompton lose her son daniel to gamble suicide and speak powerfully about it what be the minister do to ensure that accurate datum be record for each death link to gambling 
 may i express how sorry i be to hear of the case of the hon gentleman ’s constituent i be happy to write to he he ask quite a specific question but it be important that we provide support to all sort of victim that be why we have the victim code which strengthen the power of the victim commissioner but i will write to the hon gentleman on that specific matter 
 last week the court of appeal overturn a instance decision regard the anonymity of a judge who preside over the tragic sara sharif case in the family court i do not expect the minister to comment on individual case and it be certainly not about that individual judge but will the government use this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to open justice and press freedom 
 as my hon friend rightly say i can not comment on that specific case but we adhere to the principle of open justice and transparency in our legal system that be why we have the publication of sentencing remark and transcript and the broadcasting of many of our hearing so that the public can see exactly how justice in this country be administer 
 we know that the attorney general have recuse himself from advise the government but he will not tell we what for and he still refuse to be transparent about potential payment by former client do the secretary of state for justice really not believe that the public have a right to know 
 the hon lady should know there be robust process in place in government to manage conflict of interest which be in place under the previous administration as well but this be not something that any government minister will be give a run commentary on 
 i call the chair of the select committee andy slaughter 
 we have just witness the chair of the criminal cases review commission be prise out of her job month after the secretary of state describe she as 
 unable to fulfil her duty 
 when will a new chair be appoint and will this be accompany by a wide review of the ccrc to restore confidence in that damage organisation 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to say that we need to restore confidence in the ccrc that be why we be take the decision not only to appoint an interim chair to steady the ship but more importantly to implement the recommendation of the henley review so that we can restore confidence in this important institution particularly in the light of the appalling miscarriage of justice in the case of andrew malkinson 
 with an ever increase prison population and monumental delay be experience in the court and throughout   the justice system what step be the secretary of state take to address the significant delay that arise from the period of time require to download and analyse digital material 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point we believe that much more can be achieve through the increase use of ai and other digital technology to speed up some of the paper process that create delay across the criminal justice system as chair of the criminal justice board i have ask for a cross system criminal justice response on this and i will update the house in due course 
 no doubt we all agree that preventable death should be prevent and tragedy like hillsborough and grenfell must not be repeat because we fail to make change so what consideration have the secretary of state give to create a national oversight mechanism to ensure that lesson be learn from every state relate death 
 the government will shortly be publish the bill that campaigner refer to as the hillsborough law which will reflect issue relate to the duty of candour which this government be commit to and i know that campaigner be make representation to the home office on the national oversight mechanism that it be currently consider 
 can the secretary of state explain to the house in what circumstance the police and the crown prosecution service be allow to deny access to evidence after a trial have conclude to a defence lawyer who be seek to appeal as have happen in the lucy letby case and i believe in other 
 the right hon gentleman will appreciate that as justice secretary i be not able to interfere in any independent decision make by the police or the crown prosecution service but he have make his point and i will ensure that it be deal with by the appropriate individual either the home secretary or the head of the cps 
 there be serious question about the transparency of the police the cps and the government in the day and week follow the southport attack in write answer to i the   government have refuse to provide the date when the prime minister be tell that rudakubana possess ricin and an al qaeda training manual can the justice secretary tell i why 
 the prime minister have respond to the other question that have be raise the appropriate information be make available at the appropriate time to either the prime minister or the home secretary it be right that the government do not give any commentary that could have collapse the trial on the specific charge relate to ricin that decision require law officer approval which be seek and immediately give 
 i know that the justice secretary be aware of the tragic case of my constituent sara sharif will she consider reform family court and end the presumption in favour of parental contact despite the fact that there be safeguard concern 
 that case of that little girl sara sharif be of the most tragic of recent time and i know that that view be share right across the house that be why a safeguarding review be under way to look at all the agency that be involve and should have be protect that little girl from those who end up kill she we be look at the presumption there be a review and we will consider the finding of that review and publish our response in due course 
 my constituent who be a british citizen and the mother of young child face the prospect of be force to return to poland to accompany those child under the hague convention on the civil aspect of international child abduction have flee escalate domestic abuse if she do her inability to speak the language or work will leave she entirely dependent on her abuser even though he be bar from contact she will the minister work with i to ensure that domestic abuse be explicitly recognise as a valid defence against return order of this type 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and i invite she to write to i about that specific case which sound like it throw up a very difficult set of factual circumstance that i would like the opportunity to consider 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the home department if she will make a statement on the government ’s extremism review report on today 
 in our manifesto the government set out our commitment to redouble effort to counter extremism include online to stop people be radicalise and draw towards hateful ideology a number of strand of activity have be establish to progress this work which among other thing have lead to the appointment of an interim prevent commissioner lord anderson to drive improvement we have publish plan to introduce youth diversion order to tackle young people at risk of terrorism 
 many document produce across government as part of commission work be not implement and do not constitute government policy this work do not recommend an expansion in the definition of extremism and there be not and have never be any plan to do so to be clear the leak document be not current or new government policy 
 as we have say repeatedly islamist extremism follow by far right extremism be the big threat we face last week the home secretary set out our plan to carry out an end to end review of prevent threshold on islamist extremism because we be concerned that the number of referral be too low ideology particularly islamist extremism follow by far right extremism continue to be at the heart of our approach to counter extremism and terrorism 
 but as the horrific southport attack show we also need more action on those draw towards mixed ideology and violence obsess young people as the home secretary set out in the house last week there have be a troubling rise in the number of case involve teenager draw into extremism include islamist extremism far right extremism mixed and confused ideology and obsession with violence this include a threefold increase in under-18s investigate for involvement in terrorism some people be refer to prevent last year for concern relate to school massacre our eyes counter terror partner have also warn about the grow radicalisation of teenager and young people 
 we will continue to drive work to counter the most significant extremist threat in the week and month ahead as the home secretary and the prime minister have already set out 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 yesterday evening policy exchange put into the public domain the home secretary ’s review into extremism or at least a version of it it contain some deeply concern proposal that i would like the minister to directly address 
 the report apparently say that the definition of extremism for the purpose of prevent and other programme could be extend to include the spreading of misinformation the so call online manosphere and misogyny do the minister agree with prevent reviewer william shawcross that we need to focus the attention of prevent and counter terrorism policing on   those with extremist ideology and not risk dilute attention with these much wide issue per cent of terrorism cause death since be cause by islamist terrorism do the minister agree that combat islamist terrorism be more important than police the manosphere the wide issue reference such as violence against woman and girl and more general violence obsession be of course serious however they be well deal with by the police the criminal justice system social service or mental health service which have the power to section people that pose a risk 
 secondly will the minister commit to retain the change to non crime hate incident make by the last government police should not be look into matter or record personal datum where there be no imminent risk of criminality to do so would waste police time and infringe freedom of speech any move away from that will enable the thought police to stop anyone tell uncomfortable truth that left wing lawyer do not like 
 finally the report the home secretary commission repeat the prime minister ’s previous smear that campaign against rape gang which we now know consist of pakistani heritage perpetrator be far right the report also say that comment on element of police policy be extremist and far right that be nonsense campaign against rape gang be not extremist or far right and comment on policing whether we agree or not with the comment be simply the exercise of free speech will the minister categorically disown those remark which be contain in the home secretary ’s report 
 let i gently remind the shadow home secretary that his remark refer to a leak report which i could not have be clear do not and will not represent government policy the work as i understand it because it be not entirely clear which version of the report be leak do not recommend an expansion in the definition of extremism and as i say to the house early there be not nor will there be any plan to do so 
 the shadow home secretary mention william shawcross again i will gently remind he that this government have implement all but of the recommendation in the shawcross review he also ask about non hate crime incident again the home secretary have be very clear about that a consistent and common sense approach must be take with regard to non hate crime incident the government have again also be crystal clear that our top priority for police be to deliver on the safe street mission rebuild neighbourhood policing restore public confidence and make progress on the ambition to halve knife crime and violence against woman and girl 
 i must be careful here mr speaker because i think you be right to allow this urgent question however can my hon friend the minister explain just exactly why we be here it seem to be 
 i think i can answer that it be because i have decide we do not need to pursue it any far 
 the shadow home secretary seem to have come here to ask question about a document that be not government policy and to stand there make   indignant statement about issue that be not government policy either do my hon friend not think that we should be take a much more level head approach to this issue than that which have be display by the conservative party 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his observation which i entirely agree with this government and ministers be always happy to come to this place to discuss and debate government policy the leak report be not government policy 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 there be no place for extremism or hatred of any form in our society it be right that the government work with community to stamp that out not least after the previous conservative government seem to seek out opportunity to sow more and more seed of division 
 from what we have hear about the extremism review report it do not bring the right answer forward and risk be counterproductive 
 now it be up to the government to develop a counter extremism strategy that be strong effective and alive to the modern challenge face our society that include address an increasingly complex online world and its role in incite extremism i would welcome more detail from the minister on how the government will do this to be effective the work must also properly engage community will the minister set out how community will be consult on any upcoming counter extremism strategy 
 i be grateful to the hon member for her entirely sensible and reasonable question she be absolutely right to say that there be no place for extremism in our society this government will work across party across government and use all available lever to ensure that we have the right resource in the right place to tackle what be an increasingly challenging threat she be right that an important element of that be the work that we need to do and be do with regard to the online space she will be aware that the online safety act will come into force soon and we have consistently say that we will look very closely at how effective that will be and that where we need to make change we will of course do so as she can imagine the conversation continue with the social medium company we expect they to do the right thing and where there be illegal content online to remove it at pace 
 the hon member be also right to stress the importance of work with community that be why counter extremism work be do properly across government with the ministry of housing communities and local government as a key partner 
 i thank the minister for his unambiguous statement i have a feeling that he be go to say something along those line because i read a similar unambiguous statement from the home office in this morning ’s newspaper therefore i do not understand how the shadow home secretary have struggle to follow the government ’s position do the minister agree that the correct way to deal with extremism be to focus on what drive it as we hear in the house last week in relation to the   southport attack weaponry include knife have a devastating effect across the country what step be the home office take to restrict access to knife and weaponry for those with extreme view 
 my hon friend raise an important matter over the weekend the home secretary announce strict age verification check and a ban on doorstep drop to protect people from knife crime these measure be set to be include in the crime and policing bill which be expect to be introduce to parliament by the spring under these new rule a step system will be mandate for all retailer sell knife online require customer to submit photo id at the point of sale and again on delivery delivery company will only be able to deliver a bladed article to the person who purchase it and it will also be illegal to leave a package contain a bladed weapon on a doorstep when no be in to receive it 
 in the early year of margaret thatcher ’s government lord scarman be commission to write a report on what be they do not use this phrase at the time concern among the black community about tier policing in response to those concern the police listen change their procedure and engage in consultative work with those community so why be it that when community complain about tier policing under this government they be brand far right extremist 
 the right hon gentleman will have work throughout his time with our police force not just as former home secretary in that great office of state but elsewhere and i very much hope that he share the admiration and respect 
 answer the question 
 i be answer the question i hope that the right hon gentleman share the admiration and respect that we on these benches have for the incredibly difficult and challenging work that the police do i have to say that those who seek to progress a narrative of tier policing do no favour to our police force all they seek to do be make it more difficult for those extraordinary man and woman who step forward to serve in our police force to do a very important job 
 in all the commentary overnight on this leak advice i be strike by comment from the shadow justice secretary   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick that be report on gb news he say 
 of course violence against woman and girl and some of the other issue raise in this report warrant attention by the police 
 warrant attention be it any wonder that sexual violence be allow to become endemic under the previous government and that the good a previous home office minister could say be that it warrant attention 
 the shadow justice secretary be a home office minister for a considerable period of time it might be worthwhile if he reflect on the record of his government while he be a minister 
 so this report that have just be leak be commission by the home secretary after the southport horror last july the truth be that it have come out and all the recommendation have basically be immediately write off by the home secretary do that not confirm that the people in her department be completely out of touch with her wish and those of the british people 
 not at all the hon member be simply not correct this work be be progress before the dreadful incident in southport i be sure and i certainly hope that he will appreciate that secretaries of state will routinely commission advice from civil servant some of the recommendation of that advice will be accept and agree some will not but it be routine practice in government to ask civil servant to look very closely at particular issue ultimately it be for ministers to decide and ministers will decide 
 as interesting as it sound i have no idea what a manosphere be as far as i be concern the only real question that the security minister need to answer be what action the government be take to ensure this kind of disgraceful politically motivate leak to a former tory adviser can not happen again especially on issue of national security we proudly have an impartial civil service so will he ask the cabinet secretary to order an immediate leak inquiry and put on gardening leave those tory adviser and civil servant who be still work in downing street and those who be regard as close associate of andrew gilligan 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his helpful point it be standard procedure in circumstance such as these that the cabinet secretary order a leak inquiry and that would be the right way to proceed under these circumstance 
 in keighley we have see how label legitimate concern around groom gang as far right have distort conversation silence victim and inadvertently give space to bad faith actor it be therefore incredibly concern to see this report write by home office official use similar language call groom gang an alleged problem and once again frame this issue through the lens of the far right rather than the eye of victim do the minister agree with the language use in the report around groom gang if not how can he or the home secretary have faith in the home office official 
 the hon member have be consistent in raise his concern in this particular area i hope he will understand that i be clear early that many document be produce across government as part of commission work that be not implement and that do not constitute government policy to be absolutely clear with he this be a leak document but the work do not recommend an expansion in the extremism definition these be not government plan this be not government policy 
 if the conservative now consider it okay for public servant to leak document relate to national security i hope they will not object if we see leak on matter relate to their time in   charge such as the risk arise from russian donor to the tory party and to our great country whatever happen to british value do the security minister agree 
 order mr shelbrooke your voice have continue even though i do not see as much of you these day 
 thank you mr speaker i be not surprised conservative members be wind up by that do the security minister agree that at least party in this house need to behave within our value when it come to security and that security leak be wrong 
 all leak be wrong but let i take this opportunity to say that i be actually very proud of the civil servant in the home office who work extremely hard day in day out to keep our country safe from a diverse range of threat a number of conservative members here have work in the home office and i very much hope that they share my view that we should be extremely grateful to those civil servant who work around the clock to keep our country safe and i be grateful for their effort 
 the horrendous event in southport show that people who do not fit the profile of islamist or far right extremism can still present serious risk do the minister agree that there be a real danger in the promotion of misogyny and opposition to feminism online and that to combat the scourge of violence against woman and girl which see woman murder almost every day in the uk the government must take misogyny seriously as a form of extremism 
 i be grateful to the hon lady she make an incredibly important point and hopefully she will know and understand how seriously this government take those issue we make an ambitious manifesto commitment to halve violence against woman and girl over year that be something that as ministers in the home office with the home secretary and the safeguarding minister my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips we be work at pace to address we take these matter very seriously and she be absolutely right to identify the particular challenge that exist online the safeguarding minister will have more to say about this in due course 
 i be grateful to the security minister for his word today he have successfully expose the report about the leak as the nonsense they be but there be serious issue here include around how we respond to the rise level of youth violence and extremism and the increase availability of online material that fuel that obsession with violence and death will he tell we how the intelligence service be approach this challenge and what more the government can do to stop young people disappear into this dangerous abyss 
 my hon friend raise an important point and the prime minister and the home secretary have both recently refer to this include during their statement on   february she be right that there have be a troubling rise in the number of case involve   youth man boy and teenager who be be draw into extremism as i say to the house early that include a range of different area include islamist and far right extremism but also there be a particularly concern rise in those draw into what be refer to as mixed and confused ideology and those young man and boy who have an obsession with violence this threat be not unique to the united kingdom it be be experience internationally but i assure she that the intelligence service and our law enforcement partner be work with government at pace along with our international partner to look at what more we can do in this particular area 
 may i echo the minister ’s point that we should be grateful to those civil servant who be work night and day to protect we from terrorist threat i suppose we should also be grateful to the right hon gentleman for denounce the document which certainly emanate from his department without make any personal criticism of those civil servant but do that document not demonstrate that a large body of opinion have completely lose its way on how we deal with extremism and terrorist threat i urge he to encourage the department to return to what prevent be intend to achieve and not get distract by all this political correctness give that most of the country have no idea what a non hate crime incident be we need to return to proper language that people understand or the government themselves will be drive people ’s disillusion and despair about these matter 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman as always for his observation and for his point about civil servant he talk about political correctness have serve together in the house over many year i hope he know the home secretary and i well fundamentally this must be about the threat we will leave no stone unturned to ensure that we have the appropriate level of resource in the right place at the right time so that the ever evolve and complex nature of the threat we face both in the united kingdom and abroad be appropriately address by our law enforcement agency i give the hon gentleman a categorical assurance that we will continue to work around the clock to ensure that we protect the public 
 i thank the security minister for clarify the timeline of when this report be commission we should remember that since it be commission we have see the brutal sadistic murder in southport and the riot that come after they clearly we be live in a time of rise and worrying extremism which should concern member on all side of this house do the security minister therefore agree that member on all side of this house should be work together to deal with extremism rather than play political game 
 my hon friend make an important point i hope the house know that it be always my default setting if you want to put it that way to try to work collaboratively with member across this house i give my hon friend and the house an absolute assurance of the seriousness with which we take these matter i think member will understand that it be right   to commission civil servant to look very carefully at the profound nature of the threat that we face and to bring forward policy suggestion and solution for how we as a government be well place to address they that be what be happen but this government will always do the right thing to ensure that we protect the public 
 we have to tread very carefully when we enter into this territory the leaking of this report have already raise alarm bell with a number of different group and have give the right another opportunity to spread division and further disinformation what reassurance can the minister give campaign group environmentalist and those who have take up campaign that they will not be include when he finally bring forward his plan in the future 
 i be happy to give the hon gentleman an assurance that this government will always approach these matter in a level headed and consensual way it be the case that previous government seek to use these issue as a political football 
 indicate dissent 
 it be the case that previous government be on occasion motivate as much by a desire to score political point that will never be the approach of this government we be motivate only by a desire to protect the public 
 i echo the concern raise by my hon friend   the member for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray just this weekend in my own constituency we have an incident in our community with young people and knife although i can not comment on that particular incident i be extremely concerned about the availability of knife particularly to our young people do the minister agree that the sale of knife be too easy particularly online and can he tell i and my constituent what the government be do to restrict that availability and the fear it spread in our community 
 the government share my hon friend ’s concern about the availability of knife online that be why as i say to another hon member a moment ago just this weekend the home secretary announce strict age verification check and a ban on doorstep drop in order to well protect people from knife crime we will do everything that we possibly can work with online retailer and the police to ensure that the availability of knife be very significantly reduce in order to protect the public 
 the repudiation of the content of this report be a step back from thought crime but the danger remain of step towards it be it not outrageous when individual be harass by the police when they have not break the law 
 the right hon gentleman be right in the sense that of course the police should and will be guide by the law as an experienced member i be sure he will have work very closely with the police over many year my experience of work closely with the   police be that they make the right judgment for the right reason but where there be issue that require further attention the government will of course look at those matter 
 it seem that advice to ministers on national security issue have be leak to a former tory special adviser and as a result of that leak the security minister have be summon to the chamber to answer question even though the leak do not represent government policy and the minister have make it clear that the advice have be reject do he agree that this set a dangerous precedent and may encourage more disgruntled individual to commit politically motivated leak and that it show that his majesty ’s official opposition be sadly sink into the mire of populism which can only undermine our national security and indeed our democracy in the future 
 as i hope i have make crystal clear i be always happy to come to this house to debate and discuss matter relate to national security i will do that whenever the house wish i to do so but on this particular occasion as i think i have also be crystal clear about this leak be about something that do not represent government policy 
 there be no place for extremism in our society or country from anyone prevent unfairly associate certain ethnic minority and religious group with extremism and the programme ’s vague definition of extremism have lead to inconsistent implementation with concern about overreach what step be the government take to address the discrimination and failing in the prevent programme and make it impartial and effective to prevent extremism and violence across all of society 
 the hon member be right to say that there be no place for extremism in this country of course that be the case but i do not agree with his characterisation of the prevent programme that programme consist of some extremely dedicated and hard work public servant but the hon member will know that the home secretary have announce the appointment of an interim prevent commissioner lord anderson he will be look very closely at how the prevent programme work and how it can be make to work more effectively in the future 
 when tackle extremism whether violent or non violent be the security minister satisfy that the current division of labour between counter terrorism policing and the security service be understand well enough by those organisation and be deliver and work well 
 i be always very grateful to the right hon member he speak with real experience and authority on these matter and he raise an important and reasonable question yes i be happy to give he that assurance i work incredibly closely with both counter terrorism police and operational partner on a daily basis of course we look at these thing very closely and keep   they under review and if we think that we need to change the balance in any particular area we will not hesitate to do so 
 if the security minister think that there be not tier policing in this country then quite frankly he need to get out more this report state that anybody who call out tier policing be a far right extremist and that grooming and rape gang be an alleged problem do the minister agree 
 the point i be seek to make early which i be happy to reiterate to the hon member be about the importance that we on the labour benches attach to support the police we think that the police do an incredibly difficult job and while the hon member might think that i need to get out a bit more perhaps he might consider spend a bit of time with police officer on the beat in his constituency and in his area if he be to do so i be quite confident that he would see that they be exceptional people do difficult work under difficult circumstance there be a real risk that seek to progress this narrative undermine the important work of the police 
 it be good to see the minister at the dispatch box to distance himself from the conclusion of a report commission by his department but report do not leak themselves why do he think that whoever leak this do not agree with he that there be nothing to see here 
 ultimately that be a matter for the leaker but as i have say it be standard procedure in circumstance such as this for the cabinet office to initiate a leak inquiry i think that would be the right course of action under these circumstance so if i be the leaker i would not be too comfortable at the moment 
 in draw up a policy the minister need to consult with representative of all community particularly those suffer the bad attack by the far right in britain so can he assure we that he will be meet the muslim council of britain and other muslim organisation and that the policy of non co operation with the mcb have be bring to an end despite statement by his office that there be no plan to do so 
 the right hon gentleman be right that the government have a responsibility to consult with all community of course that work be share across government which be why we work very closely with other department not least the ministry of housing communities and local government which be progress its own bit of work on all this on his specific point about liaison there be not a change to the government policy with regard to that 
 can the minister explain why the review appear to focus on the symptom of extremism rather than its underlie root cause can he assure the house that that mindset be not direct policy in the home office 
 i can assure the hon member that the mindset that direct policy in the home office be what the home secretary and i think be in our national interest the home secretary and i will use every tool and every lever at our disposal to ensure we keep the public safe that be what we get out of bed every morning to do and that be what we will continue to do 
 i trust the minister will agree that terrorism in all its form be always deserve only of punishment and repudiation never of glorification particularly by political leader do he therefore agree that it be beyond reprehensible that the minister of northern ireland michelle o’neill continue to attend ira celebration of the action of ira terrorist just before christmas she lay a wreath and speak at the commemoration for ira terrorist who blow themselves up with their own bomb what message do that send on extremism to future generation 
 i hope the hon and learn member will understand that i do not think that it would be appropriate for i to delve into matter in northern ireland in the context of this response but his remark at the beginning of his question about there never be an excuse or justification for terrorism be a point of consensus around which we can all unite 
 the security minister recently tell i that it remain government policy not to engage with the muslim council of britain last week the minister for social security and disability attend the mcb annual leadership dinner do that minister breach government policy or be engagement with the mcb now tolerate after all 
 the hon member ask i a question previously at home office oral specifically in the context of engagement by the home secretary and her ministers 
 answer the question 
 the shadow home secretary be chuntere from a sedentary position but i be literally show the hansard transcript before this urgent question interruption if he will allow i i will respond to the question 
 the hon member ask i previously about engagement with the home secretary and home office ministers i clearly can not account from the dispatch   box for other ministers activity however i be happy to look at the circumstance he have raise i be happy to confirm to he that government policy have not change and if there be specific point i need to come back to he on i be very happy to do so 
 extreme misogyny associate with far right ideology be a major factor in extremism it should be deal with to counteract the woman kill every day in this country and to ensure that the horrendous southport killing the killing by jake davison in plymouth and the massacre in christchurch new zealand do not happen again no want violence ideological or political do the minister agree that our obsession with focus solely on islamism have leave repeat government blindside to real threat face we from elsewhere 
 the hon member be right to say that extreme misogyny be frankly a disgusting blight on our country that be why this government make a manifesto commitment to halve the level of violence against woman and girl it be an ambitious commitment that have not be make previously as i tell the house early the home secretary and the safeguarding minister be work at pace to seek to address these issue it be a big priority for the government and we intend to make good on the commitment we have make 
 i thank the minister for his answer and in particular welcome his commitment to support the police which he have mention a few time i have great concern that the revival of non crime hate incident will mean more work for our overstretched police force and that it will mean get involve in a war on offensive word rather than the war on drug the war on terrorism or the war on violence against woman and child will the revival of non crime hate incident come with a substantial increase in police funding and if so where will that come from 
 i be grateful to the hon member as ever and i be very grateful for the support that he have provide to the police over many year let i seek to reassure he because the home secretary have be clear that a consistent and common sense approach must be take to non crime hate incident the government have be crystal clear that our top priority for policing be deliver on our safe street mission 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for transport if she will make a statement on government policy on airport expansion
