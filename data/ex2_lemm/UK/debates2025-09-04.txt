the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of climate change on food security 
 let i start by acknowledge just how tough it have be for so many farmer this year have be face with the very extreme weather condition we have have very hot weather follow on from last year when many suffer from flood it be undeniable that we be see our climate change the government be respond by tackle flooding invest a record £ in flood defence to protect home and farm help to tackle problem in rural community such as mine in the fen through our £ internal drainage board fund and invest in nature friendly farming which boost climate resilience enhance farming profitability and secure food production 
 of the uk ’s bad harvest have be in the last year and this year be look particularly concern with yield likely to be down and margin for farmer on the brink just last month the bank of england say that extreme weather be now of the key factor in drive food price inflation could the minister elaborate on what other step the government be take to mitigate food price inflation for consumer 
 my hon friend make a very important point of course consumer food price depend on a wide range of factor include agrifood import price agricultural price in general domestic labour and manufacturing cost exchange rate productivity and the extreme weather we have be see which inevitably impact growth and livestock feed supply i reassure the house that the uk have a very resilient food supply chain and as our food security report show it be well equipped to meet these challenge 
 i recently visit the dinsdale family farm to talk to the group of hard work dairy farmer who provide milk   to the wensleydale creamery to make their famous yorkshire cheese i know the minister will join i in commend their contribution to british food security and the dinsdale family for their innovative installation of an anaerobic digestion unit which turn slurry into energy could he look at what more can be do to encourage small scale on farm ad unit which not only significantly cut methane emission but significantly cut cost and increase income for our hard work family farmer 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right and i join he in commend the dinsdale family for the work they do i have speak to a number of farmer who would very much like to do that of course there be significant cost involve and we be work with farmer to try to get the circular economy that we all want to see 
 the depletion of soil health the risk of disease and climate change threaten our food security for the long term and yet we need biotechnology and science to ensure that we have a future in farming would the minister be willing to meet the bioyorkshire project which bring together fera science the university of york askham bryan college and other to ensure we have the research and the translation and scaling of that to protect the future of farming 
 i assure my hon friend that i have have numerous conversation with lead academic in her great city and i would be happy to have further conversation along those line 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 in june the scottish government make a very welcome commitment not to pursue a deliberate policy of reduce livestock number despite that livestock number in scotland continue to fall and have fall by over year so that across the united kingdom we now risk lose the critical mass we need to maintain the network of abattoir haulier vet and merchant if food security genuinely be national security be now the moment to consider include within the remit of the climate change committee the maintenance of food security 
 the right hon gentleman make an important point we absolutely recognise that food security be national security he be right about the decline in herd size but of course there be other aspect here we have see high productivity and change genetic it be a complicated picture but i be happy to have further discussion with he on that 
 what step he be take to help prevent financial reward for water company executive responsible for poor environmental performance 
 what step he be take to increase the accountability of water company executive 
 the previous conservative government quite disgracefully let water boss award themselves more than £ in bonus that they do not deserve this government be put a stop to that we have ban the payment of unfair bonus and bring in new jail sentence for pollution offence the tory era of profit from pollution be over 
 this weekend for more than hour waste water from toilet sink and drain flood the river lea affect local community and spread to east london include the wetland in stratford and bow thames water continue to dump sewage and waste water in our river at an alarming rate all while company boss pay themselves million in bonus may i thank the secretary of state for the work that this government be do to crack down on that appalling practice and ask what he be do to ensure that the british public be not pay for that failure after receive rise water bill what be he do to secure the serious investment that be need for the health of our river 
 my hon friend be a great champion for her constituent in east london on this matter as on many other with her support this government have secure a record £ to upgrade crumble pipe and build sewage treatment work across the country so that we can cut sewage pollution we have also ringfence customer money so that it can never again be divert away from investment to pay for bonus and dividend while sewage pollution get bad that of course include in the lea valley 
 this summer it be report that the ceo of yorkshire water have receive an extra payment from a parent company in spite of recent admission that it would not be appropriate to receive a bonus due to the company ’s poor performance yorkshire water have commit to improve transparency but that be of little comfort to my constituent who be face high bill do the secretary of state agree that it be wrong that those water boss receive financial reward when my constituent be face high bill and a shocking performance 
 as my hon friend rightly say that payment have outraged customer and i have ask ofwat to assess its legality as a matter of urgency i will not tolerate any company attempt to circumvent this government ’s ban on unfair bonus through exorbitant salary increase secret bonus payment through parent company or any other deception if ofwat find that the rule have be break company will face sanction include fine impose at a level that will deter future abuse 
 state own scottish water be responsible for the water supply across scotland last week thousand of resident in the scottish borders be leave without water for day and terrible communication by scottish water make matter bad we be face a public health crisis as well as an animal welfare crisis do the secretary of state agree that the scottish government should undertake a full investigation into what happen and ensure that scottish water executive be hold to account for their failure to act 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman on raise that important issue and i agree with the point he make the snp government in scotland should be take a much tough line against such situation as it be not acceptable level of pollution in england be bad enough but under the snp in scotland they be even bad and the snp government should be fully ashamed—[interruption 
 order let we carry on i call mr joshua reynolds 
 the public will have be pleased to hear recently about the bonus ban for water company boss but they would have be equally surprised to hear that a water company boss in england be award a massive pay increase to £ with the public being tell that that be not a bonus but a year long incentive plan what further step can the secretary of state put in place to ensure that water company be play fair when those be the tactic that they use to circumvent the rule 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point which have be raise in the house before that scheme be put in place and relate to year when the conservative party be in government that scheme would not be allow today 
 what step he be take to protect household from significant water bill increase 
 customer be hit with outrageous bill increase last year as a direct result of the previous government ’s failure to ensure that water and sewage pipe be properly maintain over the long term they deliberately impose a light touch approach to regulation that let the system crumble while investment funding be divert to line water boss pocket leave customer to pay the price our powerful new regulator will get a grip on the sector and ensure the regular maintenance of pipe so that hard work british family be never again leave to pay the price of under investment and weak regulation 
 in derby the propose water bill increase of about will hit people really hard over the next year it be a bitter pill to swallow because at the same time as hike bill shareholder dividend be be increase and water company continue to pollute our waterway what assurance can the secretary of state give my constituent that our government will tackle such hypocrisy head on and crucially protect our resident from the water bill increase 
 my hon friend be right to advocate so strongly for his constituent in derby at a time when they be experience the cost of living crisis as other be i thank he for his support in block the unfair multimillion pound bonus that be previously pay to water boss by ensure that customer money be spend on upgrade the water system rather than allow   it to be divert to bonus and dividend he be help to ensure that the bill hike that result from tory failure will never happen again 
 unbelievably the secretary of state have just double down in the house on the falsehood that he advance on   july   on channel news that pollution level be bad in scotland than they be in england i be sure that the secretary of state do not want to mislead the house will he take the opportunity to correct the record 
 order falsehood be not a word we would use i be sure more constructive wording could be use 
 thank you for your guidance mr speaker 
 the secretary of state have inadvertently advance the same argument that he do on   july   on channel news will he clarify that pollution level under publicly own scottish water be substantially well than those under privately own english water company will he recognise that scottish bill payer pay low bill and that scottish water ’s borrowing be sustainable and consistent with the value and quality of scotland ’s water 
 the hon gentleman be show why the problem persist if the snp do not recognise the problem there be no way that it can fix it i have publish the datum and i stand by it pollution under the snp in scotland be even bad than it be under the tories in england he should be thoroughly ashamed of what he be do to the beautiful countryside of the country that he represent 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the future of thames water be in sharp focus again affect million of people and potentially the wide uk taxpayer bizarrely the party along the benches to my left lead legal action that could have sink the company reform uk be also happy for the company to go under expose taxpayer to a cost of billion and push consumer water bill through the roof this labour government in the passing of the water special measures act repeatedly block our conservative amendment that would have enable limit to be place on the amount of money that can be borrow by water company 
 as we reach a precipice with thames water and give the cunliffe review ’s clear call for improved financial responsibility will the government rethink their approach and adopt sensible measure to put water company on a more stable and secure financial footing to protect water the environment and the british taxpayer 
 the reason that thames be in the state that it be in be the weak so call light touch regulation that the conservatives impose on the water company when they should have be get a grip the point beyond that that the hon gentleman make be a sensible however and our reform to water regulation and indeed to the regulator be intend to ensure that such problem can not happen again in the case of thames we be of course keep a very close eye on what be   go on with that company at the moment it remain viable but we be ready for all eventuality should they occur 
 what step his department be take to help protect moorland 
 the department for environment food and rural affairs work with other to protect moorland by restore peatland manage graze and reduce practice that in some case can be harmful such as burn those step make peatland wetter to help reduce the impact of wildfire we be review the exist protection and will announce the next step shortly 
 a devastating wildfire have be rag on the north york moor between scarborough and whitby cover about square mile it be a huge fire i be sure that the minister will want to join i in commend the incredible bravery of our firefighter as well as the tireless service of farmer water tanker driver gamekeeper landowner and all the other volunteer will the minister provide reassurance that he will look carefully at proposal to limit control burning and to change the prohibition of burn on peat over cm deep to peat over cm deep in the light of this year ’s record number of uncontrolled fire include the on langdale moor 
 i thank my hon friend for her powerful contribution i join she in express sympathy for all those who have be affect and i thank all those involve in fight those fire this be a cross governmental issue wildfire and fire and rescue service be the responsibility of the ministry of housing communities and local government but my hon friend will be aware that we have be consult on end locational burn to improve moorland resilience to wildfire we know that restore peatland with diverse plant species prevent the over dominance of heather and molinia which dry out peat and increase the risk of fire frankly recent wildfire show just how degrade our peatland have become 
 i join   the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume   in pay tribute to the firefighter farmer gamekeeper and everybody who have take part in fight the moorland fire in north yorkshire just over the border from my constituency do the minister agree about the huge importance of manage moorland manage burning of moorland not only improve the ecological status of the moorland but reduce the threat of wildfire 
 i absolutely agree with the hon gentleman and that be why the consultation have be take place these be complicated issue and sometimes controversial but we all want to get those moorland into a state where we be not subject to these dreadful fire 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the thank of conservative members go out to all the emergency service our mighty farmer and gamekeeper who have be consistently fight the horrendous blaze on the north york moor the secretary of state be currently push a dangerous proposal to ban a vital conservation and land management measure through eliminate the use of control burning of heather on moorland which manage fuel load and help to prevent out of control fire do the minister now recognise that if the government ’s burn ban and deep peat change go ahead they will be responsible for more uncontrollable and far more damaging wildfire that negatively impact wildlife our precious peatland and rural business 
 no i do not agree with the shadow minister i have choose my word carefully this be a complicated set of issue we be consult and we will be come back with our proposal shortly 
 what step he be take to help tackle water pollution on the dorset coast 
 my hon friend show i the scale of pollution on the dorset coast and i share his determination to put a stop to it this government be fix the break sewage pipe that be responsible for this pollution fund by £ of private investment that we have help to secure over the next year that will fund wessex water in his area to cut storm overflow spill by 43%—a major milestone towards clean up for good beautiful place in his constituency which i have the pleasure of visit with he such as bournemouth beach and hengistbury 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer and for his visit to bournemouth people still talk happily about his visit to the hengistbury head outdoors centre i meet recently with constituent in bournemouth east who be call for nationalisation as a way to improve accountability and investment in the water industry how do the secretary of state see a path towards nationalisation sit within his wide effort to protect our water 
 nationalisation be not the answer because it would require handing over more than £ to water company owner that could only be raise through high taxation or cut to vital public service it would also take year of legal wrangling that would see the brake slam on investment cause pollution to get bad and ultimately lead to high bill for customer this government be take the fast possible route towards clean water and fairer bill 
 we in north dorset would love to be talk about ministerial visit from the defra team but despite an invitation to the farming minister none have cross the border to visit 
 north dorset farmer and landowner wish to play their active and full part to ensure that through nitrate neutrality and other farming mechanism they be improve water quality to help the river that flow   to the coast of bournemouth christchurch poole and so on will the secretary of state ensure that body such as the environment agency and other that advise our farmer provide consistent advice in a timely fashion in order to maximise their enthusiasm 
 adjournment debate require 
 i have enjoy visit milton abbas on many very happy occasion i agree with the point that the hon gentleman make we be work with farmer and landowner to ensure that they be get the support they need to take the kind of action that he talk about the new regional tier propose by sir jon cunliffe will give a place where farming and land manager can raise their voice and ensure that the outcome they can contribute to be deliver 
 what progress he have make on reduce pollution in bathing water 
 we have introduce a new era of accountability we be reset reform and revolutionise the water sector put public health and the environment and deliver the change rightly demand by the british people with the most ambitious target on sewage water pollution in history we will halve sewage water pollution by 
 over the summer we see the announcement of a £ investment into southport ’s waste water treatment work to reduce the number of sewage overflow to just per bathing season allow southport to once again become the jewel in the crown of the north west coast do the minister agree that that level of investment be very much need after more than a decade of tory neglect of our waterway and that it show the difference a town can see when it have a labour mp a labour council a labour metro mayor and a labour government here in westminster 
 minister that be a tough 
 unsurprisingly i could not agree more i thank my hon friend for his work to champion his community here in parliament the previous government oversaw record level of sewage pollution in our river lake and sea but this government have secure £ of private investment to upgrade crumble pipe and halve sewage pollution by so that community can once again take pride in their river lake and sea 
 as i have remind ministers on a number of occasion tackle pollution in our river and sea require we to address agricultural pollution as well as sewage pollution i be disappointed not to hear the minister mention that but i like to come with solution i recently visit the wyescapes landscape recovery project in my constituency which be an innovative farmer lead project of farmer protect soil reduce pollution restore nature and produce great quality food will the minister or perhaps   her colleague the farming minister come to visit this innovative project to see how we can tackle river pollution and protect nature and food production 
 another adjournment debate need 
 the hon lady raise a really important point agricultural pollution be incredibly serious and this government recognise that we have update the defra statutory guidance for the farming rule for water and i recently host a roundtable with farmer environmental organisation and the water industry to bring the voice of stakeholder to the fore we have commit to include a new regional element in the new regulator to ensure great involvement in water planning by move to a catchment base model for water system planning we can tackle all source of pollution enter the waterway include agricultural pollution 
 i have a very keen interest in the river wye i go to see it last year and it be absolutely beautiful the hon lady will be well aware of the research project with £ of funding that we announce to look into all source of pollution and what we can do to clean up this beautiful place in our country 
 i welcome the fact that the rolling reporting of dry day spill have become mandatory under our government but it have unfortunately lay bare the track record of south west water which be among the bad offender on dry day spill what step be the minister take to ensure that company such as south west water feel the full force of the law with regard to dry day spill 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to be angry about the state in which our river lake and sea have be leave and i recognise the trouble that a fail water company cause for his constituency that be why we have commit to resetting reform and revolutionise the water sector and why we be establish a new single and powerful regulator that can fully hold all company to account and ensure that they be deliver for the british people and clean up our waterway for good 
 run off from chicken manure be a particular problem in the bathing water and river in shropshire i have visit both harper adams university and lohas fertiliser in my constituency which have great new technology to deal with chicken manure stabilise it and move that great fertiliser to other part of the country where it cause few problem however they can not scale up so what step be the minister take to enable the new technology that could deal with some of these problem to be scale up and use across the country 
 the hon lady raise a really interesting point it be perhaps worry how interested i be get in what we can do with manure and human waste to provide organic fertiliser in our country she have give a brilliant example of what can be do and i will make sure that the minister who be responsible for the circular economy my hon friend   the member for coventry east mary creagh get to hear about it and learn more 
 what step he be take to increase access to the sustainable farming incentive for small and medium sized farm 
 funding for the environmental land management scheme pay to farmer will increase by from £ in to £ by sadly though we inherit a set of scheme that do not necessarily distribute fund fairly we be work with farmer to reshape the sfi and further information about our reform will be provide shortly 
 like the national farmers union i welcome the protection for the agriculture budget in the recent spending review include crucial funding for sustainable farming on visit to farmer in my constituency the difference this be make be clear it be invest in our countryside and support nature base farming however far too many farmer on small and medium sized farm tell i that the scheme be far too difficult for they to access at the moment those be exactly the farmer who be also likely to be lock out of private nature base financing option so how can we work with those farmer to reform the scheme and ensure that more of those small and medium sized farm can benefit from this crucial funding 
 my hon friend make an important point and i commend he on his interest and his insight he be absolutely right and we be learn from past sfi iteration and from what we be hear from farmer to improve the sfi for all farmer and to ensure we can give well guidance and that everyone can have a share of the pie we be also look into a new local advice and collaboration offer as well as consider how we can get the good environmental outcome from the money we be spend 
 after the elephant in the room that be the farm destroy family farm tax the no issue that be raise with i by mid buckinghamshire farmer not least at the bucks county show last week be the uncertainty over the future of the sfi i do not think it be go to cut it with farmer to say that further detail will be provide in due course they need certainty and they need it now so will the minister come to the dispatch box and put a firm date on when farm will have that certainty as well as assure they that the new sfi will have food production at its heart 
 the hon gentleman will be pleased to know that we will be make announcement on this very shortly interruption we be pick up a disastrous mess inherit from the previous government this be absolutely true who be quite cavalier about the way in which these scheme be run we be have to clear up that mess but i absolutely sympathise with farmer who should not have be put in that position in the place 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 give the secretary of state ’s love of dorset i would love to invite he to mid dorset where goodens farm   be do some really innovative thing on very small family farm especially with manure mr randall who run that farm join the sustainable farming incentive last year which enable he to start grow a new crop herbal ley because climate change be make farming so tough he be try everything he can to keep his business go the sfi allow he to take that risk but it be no long available to he as he put it we need farm security if we want food security so what step be the minister take to look after farmer on our very small farm who be critical to food production 
 there be a lot in that question the hon lady be absolutely right that herbal ley have be very effective and many people have see the impact they have have during the dry weather it be also interesting that these scheme be now available to much small enterprise than they ever be under the previous scheme there be much that can be do and we be redesign the scheme to make they work towards achieve exactly the outcome that the hon lady be seek 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 as we have hear this summer have see wildfire burn across our countryside i add my thank to the emergency service who be out in force to battle those fire but so too be farmer gamekeeper and local volunteer who give up their time and resource to control the fire and help put they out i pay tribute to all of they for their selfless bravery and community spirit 
 the fire come at the end of a long period of drought visit farm this week and early in the summer i see for myself how food production have be affect it be clear that further work be require to support farmer to build on farm reservoir and irrigation system that can sustain their business through dry period and i have invite the nfu to work with i on that i want to use this opportunity though to thank farmer for the outstanding work that they do to feed our country through thick and thin 
 as we move into autumn flooding be once again on the mind of resident in rossendale and darwen this government have already make vital commitment to our flood defence but recently some community have express concern that flood modelling be out of date and be either not fully identify risk area or identify risk area as high risk that no long be the environment agency be aware of that so will the secretary of state join i in urge it urgently to prioritise new modelling 
 my hon friend make an important and timely point through the flood resilience taskforce we be look at how we can update the modelling to make sure that all area that need protection will get the investment to do it because far too many community be expose to the danger of flooding that be why we be invest £ between and to protect our community and well maintain our flood defence in england 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i join the secretary of state and everyone across the chamber in thank the fire service farmer and rural community for their hard work and bravery in tackle the wildfire that we have see this summer 
 i be hearten to discover the secretary of state ’s new fondness for farmer we will all be listen carefully to his answer to the next question with of farmer say that they have pause or delay investment because of the budget and with food price rise record farm closure under his watch and labour ’s own think tank admit that the family farm tax need change will he finally do the right thing put rural community above his own ambition and axe the family farm tax 
 may i welcome the shadow secretary of state back to the chamber it be disappointing that she do not bother to turn up for the water statement i can only assume that she do not care much about the pollution that her party be responsible for across the country 
 when it come to farming we be work with the farming sector on a road map to bring it back to profitability that be the route to ensure that those business remain financially viable and successful into the future it be her government who leave so many farmer on the brink of bankruptcy so it take only small problem to push they over the edge some farm close under the previous government we be work with the sector to make it profitable for the future 
 i hate to break it to the secretary of state but i suspect i have speak to far more farmer than he have in the past month they do not believe a word he say because he betray what he say to they before the election about the family farm tax as for this road map if farm continue to close more than half of farmer be think of give up in the next year because of this government ’s plan it will be a road map to nowhere yesterday the governor of the bank of england tell the treasury committee that the rise in food price be due in part to measure in the last budget place high cost on food business in light of that and the terrible summer harvest will the secretary of state do farmer a favour for once and rule out a new wealth tax on farmland in the next budget yes or no 
 the cause of food price inflation include rise global energy price extreme weather event that have be affect harvest as we have already hear and global supply chain problem include the russian invasion of ukraine those thing be affect food price right across the country as part of the road map we be work with farmer to ensure more supply chain fairness so that the producer of origin get a fair share of the money that be make through the system for the food that they grow that be the good way in which we can support farm to get their fair share of the revenue that come in for the food they produce 
 in my constituency producer such as longley farm exemplify british quality its dairy product be globally renowned   what specific step be the department take to prioritise the purchase and promotion of british produce ensure support for domestic farmer reduce food mile and strengthen the uk ’s food security and rural economy 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and we should all be proud of high quality british producer like longley farm that be why back in july i announce our food strategy which will build pride in british food by ensure we have a food system that back british food grow the economy feed the nation nourish individual and protect the planet now and in the future 
 brit chew piece of plastic chewing gum each year a single piece release thousand of microplastic into the body that be link to cancer diabete and stroke will the government consider commission independent research into the environmental and health implication of plastic chew gum 
 i thank the hon lady for her important question and i share her concern about the risk that microplastic may pose to the environment and human health that be why we be look at all source of pollution that enter our river lake and sea but there be obviously more work to be do to improve our understanding the environment agency be collaborate with different sector include the water industry and national highways to increase our evidence base and knowledge of these material 
 may i also express my disappointment about the global plastic treaty we be unable to reach an international agreement but i reassure all member of the house that the government remain committed to seek a global solution to the problem of plastic pollution that we all face 
 erewash ’s industrial base be build on the erewash canal which be now a lovely leisure spot for my constituent but abandon boat like the near sandiacre lock that sit rot for over year pose serious risk to public safety and local wildlife i be very glad to work recently with the canal river trust to get those boat remove can the minister advise how we can support the canal river trust in the future with the tool that it need to get similar boat remove in a more timely manner 
 i commend my hon friend for his successful championing of this issue on behalf of his constituent i know how much it mean to his community to have such boat remove it be an important issue and i be more than happy to follow up with the canal river trust in order to understand if it need any additional tool to continue and complete this work around the country 
 i recently speak to david who farm near the village of berwick in my constituency he tell i that he have recently give up raise livestock altogether due to the lack of local abattoir his near option be well over an hour away what action be the government take to   support new and existing abattoir so that farmer across the country who be in a similar situation to david do not stop raise livestock too 
 the hon gentleman raise a very important point and i visit an abattoir last week because of the change to the system over a number of year we have see a concentration of these facility we all want to see more small abattoir the previous government introduce a fund but it prove difficult to get uptake there be a whole range of serious issue we be very aware of the problem and we want to work with he and other to solve it 
 in the last few day i have have a huge number of email from constituent about continued sewage discharge into our otherwise beautiful sea and the shocking record of southern water on this issue i note early that the secretary of state say he have be to bournemouth a couple of time but can he come a little far down the coast visit my constituency and set out what this government be do to clean up our water and hold southern water to account 
 well i be not far away a couple of week ago i be down in lewes i congratulate my hon friend on be such a powerful campaigner on issue relate to sewage in his constituency he tell i that he have bring together a group of campaigner i would be delighted to meet he and they to see some of the problem and talk about how we can start to fix the appalling problem with pollution that the conservative party have land we with 
 we be join in the gallery by farmer from my constituency of newbury it be the time they have come to the house with the intent of lobby individual labour mp to try to stop the family farm tax will the secretary of state agree to meet the farmer from my constituency or to attend the berkshire county show in just a couple of week time so that he can explain to they directly why the government believe that have an inheritance tax on farm be the right way forward rather than protect the rural economy 
 i be always happy to meet farmer that be why i have visit farm already this week and sit down with a group of farmer to talk about their concern i be more than happy to make sure that the people the hon gentleman have visit get an appropriate meeting to discuss their concern 
 the solicitor general be ask 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of people smuggler 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of people smuggler 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of people smuggler 
 anyone involve in the vile trade of people smuggling will be meet with the full force of the law this year more offence for facilitate illegal entry into the uk be prosecute i be pleased to tell my hon friend that the government ’s border security asylum and immigration bill will allow for more prosecution include by criminalise the creation of online material that facilitate a breach of uk immigration law 
 i welcome the government ’s step to deter people smuggling and end the exploitation of vulnerable people i also want to highlight the work that wolverhampton city of sanctuary do in my constituency to help refugee rebuild their life as the home secretary confirm only this week of the government ’s major reform be develop control and manage route for genuine refugee do the solicitor general agree that have safe and legal route for asylum seeker be a crucial step in undermine the business model of the people smuggle gang 
 develop control and manage route for genuine refugee be important this be of a host of robust concrete and practical measure that the government be take to crack down on the vile activity of people smuggling gang i contrast our approach with that of the conservative party which leave we with this border crisis and with that of reform which be happy to stoke anger but have absolutely no answer 
 to stop the small boat it be crucial that the labour government provide global leadership to smash the criminal gang can the solicitor general set out the work that we be do with other country to secure our border and end this appalling trade in human life 
 my hon friend rightly highlight this government ’s global leadership on these issue which be part of our plan to fix the border crisis leave to we by the last government we have agree a landmark deal with france and we have increase co operation with germany and other country we have remove people with no right to be here and increase the removal of fail asylum seeker by we be give border security command counter terrorist style power through our border bill which be a bill that both reform and the conservative party vote against 
 my constituent in halesowen continue to be concern about the number of people cross to the uk on small boat they be call for swift and tough action against the people smuggler responsible for these dangerous crossing which be put the life of woman and child at risk can the solicitor general outline how she be support this action 
 i have hear from crown prosecution service prosecutor about the deplorable action that the smuggler take in not only facilitate very young child be aboard the boat but even   sedate they to ensure they be compliant during the crossing my hon friend be right that the danger face by people particularly child when they cross the channel be extremely grave this government be absolutely determined to break the business model of the people smuggler so protect our border and stop life include young life be put in such danger 
 will the solicitor general commit to work across cabinet to publish the number of people smuggle case that have collapse before trial over the past year and the reason why they have collapse 
 i think this be important to look at and i want to highlight that the cps be take considerable action to prosecute these offence we have give the cps extra funding to increase its capacity to work on border security command case and the money will allow the cps to recruit additional staff in the area at the frontline of combat organise immigration crime 
 i thank the solicitor general for what she be personally try to do and indeed the rest of the government if we be to prosecute people smuggler effectively we need global action may i focus her attention on the republic of ireland we have a porous border between northern ireland and the republic and the people smuggle gang be use that without any inhibition whatsoever what have be do with the republic of ireland to ensure that that do not happen 
 i be more than happy to look at that but the point the hon member make about international co operation be extremely important that be why i highlight our groundbreaking deal with france it be a deal that the conservatives be unable to do which will be absolutely key to stop people cross the channel 
 i call the shadow solicitor general 
 i completely disagree with what the solicitor general have say about the previous government ’s record in this area and it be a bit rich in view of her government ’s record over the past month report reveal that ministers will soon replace immigration judge with professionally train adjudicator we be tell that be to tackle the case appeal backlog which will of course involve case of people smuggler can she please confirm how long it will take to put that in place and whether it will require primary legislation 
 the conservatives leave we with a border crisis and we be fix it the shadow solicitor general say that we be set up a new independent body to clear appeal more quickly and that be exactly what we be do we have double the number of asylum decision already we be sort out their mess 
 figure be go up and up and up and the solicitor general know that can she confirm who these adjudicator will be it would be lovely if she   would answer the question and will exist tier tribunal judge of the immigration and asylum chamber be eligible to apply 
 as i say we be set up a new independent body to clear appeal more quickly we be clear up the conservatives mess and the home secretary will bring forward plan in the area that the hon lady mention 
 what step the crown prosecution service be take to prosecute people for groom gang offence 
 what step the crown prosecution service be take to prosecute people for groom gang offence 
 the grooming and sexual exploitation of young girl in this country be nothing short of sicken and the government be do everything in our power to secure justice for the victim and protect child from further harm the crown prosecution service have significantly increase prosecution for child sex offence and recently secure conviction against offender for truly hideous crime go back to 
 from my time as lancashire ’s police commissioner i have see the fruit when the police the crown prosecution service and the court work together to prioritise the listing of case involve rape and serious sexual assault as we know that victim and witness be less likely to continue with a prosecution the long it continue can the solicitor general update we on the work be do to ensure that those agency work together to support the victim and prioritise those case listing 
 as the hon gentleman will know list be a matter for the independent judiciary however i can tell he that certain area have pilot scheme of weekly list meeting across criminal justice partner to ensure as he say that we lessen victim attrition which be unfortunately far too high as a result of the record court backlog 
 i welcome the fact that the backlog of those case will be examine again and that historical case will be look at but of the challenge be that whistleblower in local authority be sack under non disclosure agreement what advice be the crown prosecution service provide to ensure that those nda be remove so that we can get to the truth of what happen with those terrible crime against young girl 
 the hon gentleman refer to a very important issue which be why i be pleased to tell he that through our flagship crime and policing bill we be work to implement the key recommendation from the jay review of which be include long overdue mandatory reporting duty for those work with child it also include make groom an aggravate factor in sentencing and crucial change to address safeguard loophole 
 the conservatives fail to implement a single recommendation from the report of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse despite hold more than meeting event and roundtable on the issue alexis jay herself speak of the huge disappointment and anger at their response what work be the government do to implement these recommendation and those from the casey review 
 as we hear from the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips in the house this week the home office be make important progress in implement those recommendation thousand of case have be identify for formal review and priority case those involve an allegation of rape be be review urgently increase funding for the tackle exploitation programme will allow all police force to access cutting edge technology to combat these horrific crime 
 alongside the failure to go after some of the evil perpetrator of these crime without fear or favour another devastating failing of the grooming gang scandal be the criminalisation of some of the young people involve by a system that all too often fail to see they as child and victim how be the solicitor general work with colleague right across government to ensure that we can disregard those conviction as quickly as possible and so that such key failing can not happen again 
 i be pleased to tell my hon friend that the cps be work actively alongside the government to ensure that the criminal conviction for victim of child sexual exploitation with the offence in that case be prostitution be be disregard which be extremely important 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help improve efficiency in the criminal justice system through the use of technology 
 well use of technology be key to reform all our public service include the criminal justice system from the police and the cps to our court prison and probation service this government be absolutely determined to harness all the power and potential of new technology to the benefit of the public those who work in our public service and of course the public purse 
 i thank the solicitor general for that answer the court system and all the associate it have be leave in the most catastrophic state by the previous conservative government it be shock that £ be spend on a civil court it system that can not even handle litigation where there be more than claimant or defendant which be basic and normal the particular issue that worry i today though be the legal aid agency and the state of its it system as she will know it be the subject of a cyber attack in the spring could she update we on that situation and on any potential plan to build back well 
 unfortunately my hon friend accurately describe the year of neglect of the justice system under the previous government she ask specifically about the legal aid agency the government take immediate action to bolster the security of the agency ’s system and an injunction be put in place to prohibit the sharing of any breached datum we have put in place contingency plan to ensure that those most in need of legal support can continue to access the help that they need and we be work at pace to restore service quickly and safely 
 what step she have take with the crown prosecution service to support victim of crime 
 what step she have take with the crown prosecution service to support victim of crime 
 this government be commit to restore confidence in the criminal justice system which mean ensure that victim of crime be properly support through the justice process the cps be take a range of measure to well support victim include by offer pre trial meeting to adult victim of rape and serious sexual assault recruit victim liaison officer to act as a consistent point of contact for victim and deliver the groundbreake victim transformation programme 
 early this year i visit southend on sea rape crisis centre where we discuss how extended court delay put pressure on the sector organisation that provide this vital support under the previous government the total backlog of all court case soar with victim leave wait year for their day in court now we finally have a government who be put victim our labour government have allocate the high number of sit day on record how be the cps play its role in get quick justice for victim 
 my hon friend rightly highlight the necessary and important action that this government be take to address the crisis in our court alongside that the cps be use every tool at its disposal to reduce the backlog include by trialle new initiative to expedite domestic abuse trial and weekly list meeting with partner in the criminal justice system 
 i recently visit a colchester organisation the centre for action on rape and abuse or cara which offer vital support to victim of rape and sexual abuse will the solicitor general reaffirm the government ’s commitment to support such organisation which carry out so much of that vital frontline work and will she reiterate what she be do to enhance the number of rape trial that actually proceed 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise the important role that organisation such as cara play in support victim of rape and serious sexual violence support victim throughout the criminal justice process be a priority for this government   and we be take a range of measure to do just that include implement raneem ’s law to embed dedicated domestic abuse team within control room and introduce free independent legal adviser for victim of adult rape 
 as the solicitor general know i have be campaign to support victim of spike i thank she for meet i before the recess but unfortunately the correspondence from her office subsequent to that meeting seem to entirely miss the point and do not follow at all the conversation we have give that it quote heavily the cps will she agree to meet again with i and with representative from the cps to understand the loophole in the law that i have identify it would be a tragedy for the victim of spike if this be not deal with because of something as frustrating as a misunderstanding by people who be not in the room at the time 
 the hon member have do important work in this area we meet previously to discuss the potential for reckless spiking and i entirely understand why he be concerned about that the correspondence that we send reflect that we have have discussion with the cps who feel that the circumstance that he be concerned about be very unlikely to arise however i be more than happy to meet he again if he believe that there be issue that need to be far clarify 
 close follower of parliament will know that i have raise on more than occasion a case of stalk in my constituency despite be report arrest and charge continually by the police he keep get release on bail the police be frustrate and my resident be be let down what assurance can i provide she and other in the same position that the cps take seriously repeat offender and that their repeat offending be take into account when they finally come to court 
 the hon member raise a very important point and i acknowledge how damaging stalk can be to people ’s life particularly when it come to repeat offender we have set out new measure to tackle stalking include statutory guidance to empower the police to release the identity of online stalker and a review of the stalk legislation to ensure that it be fit for purpose 
 what step her department be take with the serious fraud office to tackle economic crime 
 fraud be the most common type of crime in the uk it hurt individual and business and undermine everyone who play by the rule and it undermine economic confidence too that be why the government have underline their commitment to tackle economic crime by provide the sfo with an £ boost as part of the spending review that will bolster the sfo ’s intelligence capability so that it can proactively identify and prosecute the big and most complex economic crime 
 a businessman in my constituency have be defraud of £ local police lack the skill and resource to investigate and the national fraud intelligence bureau say that it can not identify a line of inquiry even though my constituent have compile evidence himself to his great credit my constituent be more concerned about how many more victim there will be while such crime go uninvestigated and unpunished will the solicitor general meet i to discuss how we can ensure that this crime be properly investigate and these wretched fraudster be bring to justice 
 i be very sorry to hear about the position that my hon friend ’s constituent have be put in i be sorry to say that it encapsulate perfectly why fraud be so damaging the government be do everything in our power to crack down on fraud and corruption and support victim of these crime i be more than happy to meet my hon friend to see what more might be do in this case 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the newly build launceston primary school in my constituency be demolish and then rebuild cost million of pound because of serious defect in the building the contractor at fault go into administration unfortunately this be far from a stand alone case it be happen across the country individual developer be put their company into liquidation and then set up a new evade their obligation to finish vital infrastructure such as road and sewage work such case often leave government departments homeowner and the british taxpayer out of pocket what step be the serious fraud office take to tackle these all too common case and will the solicitor general please consider new legislation to prevent such developer from get away with such serious fraud 
 i be sorry to hear about the position that the hon member ’s constituent have be put in it be a terrible example which i be sure need to be look at much more closely as he know the serious fraud office be operationally independent as a highly specialist agency it take on a number of complex economic crime case each year the case he raise may be for it it may also be for action fraud i be more than happy to examine it far and to raise it with the appropriate agency 
 what step she be take with the crown prosecution service to help reduce the backlog of court case 
 the government inherit a record court backlog in the crown court on take office we take immediate action include by fund a record high number of sit day the cps be play its part to help tackle these issue that include set up a surge team which have complete more than pre charge decision contribute significantly to reduce the backlog 
 the solicitor general confirm the horrendous backlog in the crown court to we all in case in my constituency victim dani will have to   wait more than year to get justice dani be just and have be a victim of grooming and sexual abuse do the solicitor general agree that for dani and many other justice delay be justice deny what far urgent step will the government take to tackle the backlog 
 i be extremely sorry to hear about dani ’s case the previous government close over court building and the human cost of the delay as a result of the backlog be really considerable victim be wait year for justice and attrition in rape case in particular have more than double in the last year as i say on take office we take immediate action and not only in relation to sitting day we have also commit to invest up to £ more a year in criminal legal aid and we be take action to ensure that there be more specialist counsel available too 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 last year crown court trial be ineffective because the prosecutor fail to attend give that the government be get to grip with the backlog they inherit by increase sitting day and through brian leveson ’s proposal be the solicitor general concern that the cps also need to step up to the plate what be she do to ensure that that happen 
 the cps be indeed step up to the plate to play its role in reduce the backlog in line with the government ’s manifesto commitment the cps be explore option for expand the role of non legal resource to support the system it have also set up the surge team that i refer to i can also confirm that the cps be work with the judiciary his majesty ’s courts and tribunals service and other criminal justice system stakeholder on a range of local initiative include a trial blitz case resolution court and weekly listing meeting 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to introduce a duty of candour 
 i know how much work my hon friend have be do to support justice for hillsborough family and indeed to push for a hillsborough law as she know i be unable by convention to disclose whether the law officer be advise the government nor of course the content of any advice but i know that colleague be work to bring forward a hillsborough law as soon as possible 
 the family have be campaign for a hillsborough law for year and their demand have always be clear a law with a duty of candour at its heart there have be too many broken promise and miss deadline can the solicitor general tell i when the government will bring forward the hillsborough law will it honour the promise make to victim of state cover up and finally deliver justice for the 
 i thank my hon friend for her question she have be a resolute and steadfast champion for the hillsborough family and indeed for the justice she refer to as she know the government include the prime minister have be work closely with the family and i can confirm that the draft bill will include a statutory duty of candour for public servant with criminal sanction for those who do not comply and measure to decisively tackle the disparity between the state and bereaved family at inquest as to timing i know that everyone be work extremely hard to get the legislation right the government hope to be in a position to introduce a bill to parliament very soon 
 what step she be take to help ensure that the uk uphold international law 
 the hon member will appreciate that as a law officer i can not talk about the specific of legal advice to government however he will be aware of paragraph of the ministerial code that acknowledge    the overarching duty on all minister to comply with the law that obligation be inherent in all the advice that the law officer give to government 
 by the end of september more than gazans be project to face catastrophic food insecurity while the integrate food security phase classification predict that a further palestinian child will be at severe risk of death from malnutrition by next year the government will have receive legal advice regard the famine in gaza and israel ’s role in it will the solicitor general commit to publish any advice that the government have receive on whether breach of international law have occur in the conflict in gaza 
 the hon member will appreciate that i can not comment on any legal advice that may or may not have be give or indeed whether it have be seek what i can confirm to he be twofold the government take their legal obligation extremely seriously secondly the government be very clear in our position that the horror take place in gaza need to be bring to an end

 i call the shadow leader of the house 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i hope you and everyone in this chamber have a very good summer break with just the right proportion of sun sleep and family 
 if i may let i start with a double round of congratulation to the prime minister on his birthday this week put he squarely in the prime of life and secondly to my brilliant colleague my hon friend   the member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont who have just be appoint to the giddy height of shadow deputy leader of the house that be the reshuffle that really matter as befit a former lawyer at freshfields he will bring his forensic intellect to scrutinise the government 
 i have be plan to talk about the government ’s performance over the summer take into account the escalate union demand for pay the rise in inflation unemployment and gilt yield and the record number of small boat crossing in the half of the year i think it be fair to say that the past few week have be a total shamble for the government little wonder that the prime minister have undertake yet another of his performative government reset to distract the medium and the general public he insist that everything be   absolutely fine which be doubtless why it be all be change round yet again they can not blame these thing on the previous government though doubtless the leader of the house will try 
 there can however be only topic today and that be tax in the real world it seem that those of we poor soul who actually do pay tax be about to be confront with a massive tax raise budget perhaps with a particular focus it have be rumour in the medium or kite have be fly on property taxis last year the chancellor increase spending by £ fund half of that through taxis and half through increase borrowing 
 of course it seem that the only person who will not be pay more tax be the deputy prime minister i like and rather admire the deputy prime minister uniquely among the government she at least have a policy of try to reduce taxis we just hear the solicitor general talk about government take a strict line on fraud i do not hear so much about take a strict line on tax fraud—[interruption or potential tax fraud but we now have a situation in which the deputy prime have try to dodge pay £ in tax on her home after demand that previous ministers should resign over tax scandal it appear that she fail even to look at his majesty ’s revenue and customs guidance on the internet as to whether high rate stamp duty be payable that guidance be readily available and be straightforward it be hard to imagine that any qualified tax adviser let alone any individual seek to question their own tax arrangement would not have take a look or know about it 
 the deputy prime minister sign a deed for what appear to be an off the shelf trust scheme from shoosmiths the solicitor be that craft to avoid tax we need to know more about what disclosure she make to the civil service about her home what review be carry out and what advice she be offer i hope the prime minister ’s adviser will look at those issue in addition to all the other issue he be look at 
 do the leader of the house believe that cabinet ministers let alone the deputy prime minister of this country should be use scheme to dodge tax should the secretary of state responsible for housing be flip her own main residence to avoid pay tax due on it do she concede that there be the appearance of very serious impropriety about these proceeding do she see how difficult they have make the situation for her colleague the chancellor of the exchequer who be plan to put a budget in front of this house that will include tax raise measure many of which will likely be focus on property above all labour and every labour member stand by this make a solemn commitment to maintain the high standard in office in its own general election manifesto do the leader of the house accept that this conduct by the deputy prime minister massively fall short of that and that it discredit both the prime minister and the government as a whole 
 i call the leader of the house 
 welcome back to you madam deputy speaker and all the house staff i join the shadow leader of the house in wish the prime minister a happy birthday for early this week 
 this summer have be mark by some happy personal event here in the house no i be not talk about taylor swift ’s engagement to travis kelce although i be sure we will all want to wish they a happy engagement we have our very own power couple my hon friend the members for north east derbyshire louise sandher jones and for loughborough dr sandher who get married to each other over the summer recess there be also my hon friend   the member for leigh and atherton jo platt who marry her long term partner ian and my hon friend   the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty who marry kristiam this recess 
 the happy news do not stop there my hon friend   the member for southampton test satvir kaur   have her beautiful baby daughter i be thrill for she and also for my hon friend   the member for leicester east shivani raja   on the arrival of her new baby too there be new dad in the house as well my hon friend the members for wirral west matthew patrick and for york outer mr charters so that be dispatch for this week we be very much more a family friendly parliament these day and i be determined that modernisation will continue that trend 
 i join the shadow leader of the house in welcome the new shadow deputy leader of the house   the hon member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont to his place i hope that he will still on occasion ask i some question and invite i to his constituency from the back benches which i be always happy to accept as he know 
 i be also pleased to announce that this bumper session of parliament under the labour government will last until spring by any measure our legislative programme in this session be highly ambitious deliver on the promise that we make in our manifesto and shift power and opportunity to work people there be a few highlight which i know that shadow leader of the house be always happy to hear about we be give the big boost to worker right in a generation finally end no fault eviction stop water boss bonus set up great british energy to get bill down bring back rail into public ownership save british steel job seize and crush dangerous off road vehicle finally recriminalise shoplifting ensure that bus be affordable and serve their community and protect our much love football club we be take on the vested interest that hold this country back and we still have much more to do in the rest of this session 
 in contrast the conservative really have show on whose side they stand in this session on the side of landlord against the renters right bill on the side of criminal gang in vote against our border security asylum and immigration bill for the few not the many in education and as ever die in a ditch to save the hereditary peer in the other place we know whose side they be on 
 the shadow leader of the house choose to have another go on the issue of tax and property which be i notice the subject of of the conservatives opposition day debate yesterday they could not muster enough speaker for that debate to go the full hour so he be have another go today i repeat that the   deputy prime minister have give a full account of her family circumstance and live arrangement she make it clear that she be now rectify her mistake she have refer herself to the independent adviser on ministerial standard who be now look into it i will not say any more on that matter because he be look into it 
 suffice it to say that the deputy prime minister be a huge huge asset to this government she be an incredibly effective minister and she have be deliver whether on our record investment in social housing the flagship employment rights bill the big settlement for local government in many year major planning reform to get more home build or the delivery of devolution and community empowerment among much more the conservatives have a go at she because she be so bloody good at her job 
 yet again the shadow leader of the house come here and talk about the economy and the budget but another year have go by and we have still have no apology from he or his front bench colleague for the state they leave the country ’s finance in let we just remind ourselves about that they leave a huge black hole in public spending high level of debt and borrowing and living standard that have for the time in history fall during a parliament he be always very selective in his use of statistic he do not mention that the british economy have grow fast than all other g7 country in the half of this year or that mortgage be now at a year low after a decade and a half of poor productivity because of a lack of investment we be now power up this country and invest in the new job of the future around the country with job come every day the chancellor will set out the budget in the usual way but she have make clear that most of the speculation be quite honestly damaging rubbish 
 let we not forget that we be now come up to the year anniversary of the disastrous liz truss mini budget i think i remember that the shadow leader of the house be the financial secretary to the treasury at that budget when government lose confidence and take irresponsible decision the poor in society pay the heavy price when the economy crash we will take absolutely no lecture from the conservatives 
 the shadow leader of the house want to talk about the performance of the government over the summer but he do not let we be honest the leader of the opposition do not need a reset but a full blow resuscitation her party spend most of the summer check whether she have a pulse or not the truth be that her leadership like the future of the conservative party be quite frankly at death ’s door 
 the snp lead glasgow city council be propose to introduce a car tax on east renfrewshire motorist so that every time my constituent enter glasgow city they would have to pay a fee could she make time for a debate on the enormous level of waste by the snp government on thing like barlinnie prison which be time over budget or the ferry that go nowhere so that we can tell the snp to stop waste our money and get out of the pocket of east renfrewshire motorist 
 i know what an issue parking charge can be in city centre such as my own my hon friend be right that would make a really good topic for a   debate let we have a look at the performance of the snp government in scotland they have have the big settlement ever in scotland what be they do with that money and how be they serve the people of scotland 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 yesterday at prime minister ’s question the prime minister tell the leader of my party my right hon friend   the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey that the situation in gaza be horrify and a man make famine we agree more than palestinians be estimate to have be kill in the conflict just yesterday adult and a child be report to have die of malnutrition as a direct consequence of the israeli government ’s man make famine and illegal restriction on aid enter the strip it have be the deadly war ever for journalist with at least kill by israeli force accord to the committee to protect journalists and israeli hostage be still think to be alive and brutally hold by hamas terrorist 
 across the house we have beg the government to do more to help end the conflict to save the life of the hostage and gaza ’s civilian indeed it be something that constituent write to i and undoubtedly all member about on a daily basis yet action have be excruciatingly slow in july the prime minister set a deadline for further action he say that 
 the uk will recognise the state of palestine by the united nations general assembly in september unless the israeli government take substantive step to end the appalling situation in gaza agree to a ceasefire and commit to a long term sustainable peace 
 that deadline be fast approach the un general assembly convene in less than a week the house should surely have the right to debate and vote on this important step recognise that parliament will break for conference recess in less than week will the leader of the house grant a full debate in government time before then to show the strength of support for the recognition of the state of palestine in this house 
 i welcome the hon member back from summer recess and look forward to continue to work with she on the many committees on which we both sit i thank she for raise that very important issue let we be under no illusion the situation in gaza be unimaginably bleak it be truly horrific and the horrifying image and account we be see daily be sear on all our mind as we go about our business on top of everything else after so many civilian death and so much destruction we be now see a man make and wholly avoidable famine and widespread starvation 
 the government be lead international effort for a peace plan that involve the release of hostage a ceasefire and the huge humanitarian response need to prevent further death and destruction the recognition of palestine as a state be an important step towards that which be why the prime minister set out those plan as we approach the unga later this month 
 i have personally long support the recognition of palestine include last time parliament be ask to give a view on the matter on monday in a hour   statement to the house the foreign secretary update members on the step we be take to recognise the state of palestine and make clear that unless the israeli government take urgent step to end the appalling situation in gaza and commit to a long term peace we will make that assessment before the leader meet at the un in new york we will as ever ensure that the house have a full opportunity to continue to discuss and scrutinise these very important decision

 i thank the leader of the house for announce the backbench business for next week she will know that back benchers be frustrate on monday that they be not able to debate transport inequality obviously there be important statement we understand that but will she consider give that debate protect time next week so that all those who wish to contribute can do so rather than be confine to about second each if the debate be squeeze in next week 
 in addition to business in the chamber there will be a debate on the hydrogen supply chain next tuesday in westminster hall on   thursday september there will be debate on improve regulation for non surgical aesthetic and cosmetic treatment and on consumer affair on behalf of the backbench business committee i ask for early notice of the business we will be allocate in the week when we come back after the conference season so that we can allocate time for many of the debate that be wait 
 next week the london underground network be likely to grind to a halt as the trade union be call out individual section throughout that week the last time the union go on strike the labour mayor of london have to find £ to buy they off the transport secretary have long experience have be deputy mayor for transport in london but as far as i be aware she have not utter a single word about what will happen next week will the leader of the house encourage the transport secretary to come to the house and let we know what will happen in london next week if the strike go ahead i know we have transport question next thursday but frankly that be too late 
 i welcome the chair of the backbench business committee back after recess and thank he for announce the forthcoming backbench business i recognise the disruption to those who want to speak on monday in the debate on transport inequality which be sponsor by my hon friend   the member for derby north catherine atkinson and i be pleased that have be reschedule for thursday i be happy to look at protect time for that so that member can be confident about their contribution in what be obviously a well subscribe debate 
 on the tube strike nobody want to see strike action in london it be incredibly disruptive for commuter and business as ever the government and i be sure the mayor of london call on transport for london and the union to get back round the table so that those strike do not go ahead next week 
 i be become increasingly concerned about the level of fraud face individual and business in the uk fraud account for over of all crime from online and push payment fraud to phishe vishe and smishe to name just a few scheme i have even see example of business in my constituency be hit by various companies house scam will the leader of the house grant a debate in government time to discuss how we can tackle these challenge move forward 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise such issue fraud be increasingly prevalent across our country and economy it be become increasingly sophisticated especially give advance in technology such as ai that be why the government continue to focus on those issue i think it would make a very good topic for a debate 
 in a week when the liberal democrat run arun district council have be find to have the bad possible grading for its social housing provision include more than half of its home be without smoke alarm it be allege that senior director include responsible for housing have leave the council with redundancy payment total £ can the leader of the house advise i on how good to hold the council to account in this place for the benefit of taxpayer in my constituency

 i thank the hon lady for raise the issue around fair funding i know this be a really important matter for a number of colleague she will be aware that the deputy prime minister have ensure a record local government funding settlement but the hon lady be absolutely right the devil be in the detail and we need to ensure that funding follow need i will certainly arrange for she to have a meeting with the minister
