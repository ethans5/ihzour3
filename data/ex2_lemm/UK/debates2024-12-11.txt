 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of the autumn budget     on   wales 
 if i may i want to thank the worker and emergency responder across wales for all their work over the weekend to protect people and property during storm darragh i be sure the whole house will join i in send condolence to the family of the people who lose their life 
 the autumn budget deliver for wales for the time in a generation and the welsh government have receive the large settlement in real term since devolution at £ that include an additional £ through the barnett formula provide a spending boost to public service such as the nhs 
 i associate myself with the word of the secretary of state about all those impact by storm darragh and all those work hard to restore power 
 the welsh government ’s draft budget yesterday note that the uk government will be provide additional support to mitigate the cost to public organisation of the additional employer national insurance contribution however the detail remain to be publish give that many of these organisation will soon be set their own budget could the secretary of state urge the treasury to bring forward clarity urgently so that local authority and public organisation in wales can have the clarity they need to set their budget 
 the welsh government will receive additional fund to help with the cost of national insurance contribution on top of that record budget settlement of £ the big since the dawn of devolution however that critical funding and all the investment announce in the budget yesterday by the welsh government will only get to where it be need if the hon gentleman ’s party colleague in the senedd vote for the budget 
 the budget commitment of £ for the tata transition board be indeed welcome but thrive the domestic abuse organisation in neath and port talbot be concern   that since the tata announcement there have be a rise both in report incident of domestic violence and in demand for prevention service for perpetrator can the secretary of state provide assurance that the transition board will look at this as a priority fund project 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for all her work to tackle domestic abuse she be such an effective advocate for the people she campaign for i also want to thank thrive for all the work that it do in neath and port talbot i want to assure my hon friend that of the transition board ’s aim be to support the wellbeing of worker and their family in our steel community and we be study the datum closely to target future release of funding in the most effective way possible 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 my sympathy go out to all resident and business impact by the weekend ’s storm i also thank andrew r. t. davies for his leadership of our party in the senedd and i wish darren millar well 
 the uk labour chancellor have plummet business confidence through the floor with her budget action on the family farm tax and the new job tax and by whack the hospitality sector with an £ bill accord to uk hospitality will the secretary of state confirm that there be no benefit for wales despite her figure and that this be simply a money merry go round taking from welsh business destroy job in the meantime and squash growth mean poor public service as the frontline remain squeeze 
 i appreciate that the hon lady represent a constituency on the south coast of england may not be familiar with the landscape of business in wales in wales of small and medium sized enterprise be microbusinesse and be small business we protect the small business and more than double the employment allowance to £ in the budget mean that over half of small and microbusinesse will pay less or no national insurance contribution at all 
 i call the plaid cymru spokesperson 
 the secretary of state celebrate funding for wales yet fail to mention that outside of the nhs the welsh government budget be low in real term compare with wait for it—2010 this fall far short of fix the foundation of collapse public service do she believe that a budget that leave wales with less compare with year ago be really a budget worth celebrate 
 i think someone should get the right hon lady a calculator because the plaid cymru ask for the budget would create at least £ a year in unfunded bill for the taxpayer its plan for hs2 the winter fuel allowance and the child benefit cap would mean significant spending cut in wales we be not prepared to subject the people of wales to that if she want further investment in wales her party need to vote for the welsh government budget in the senedd 
 i be glad that the secretary of state have mention hs2 because her government ’s budget confirm that hs2 will run to euston and that stretch alone will cost £ hs2 construction work also mean that passenger from wales will face disruption as train will be divert away from paddington for year she previously say that hs2 be no long in existence do she stand by this statement give that welsh passenger will bear the huge cost of this project 
 the right hon lady know that i be refer to the phase of hs2 which the conservative government cancel and she know because i have say it before and will say it again that i remain very angry about the previous government ’s break promise on rail and on hs2 
 i be work in partnership with the welsh government to develop a long term sustainably fund package of much need rail infrastructure improvement i meet great western railway with the under secretary of state for wales my hon friend   the member for llanelli dame nia griffith just last week to discuss mitigation in relation to old oak common 
 i call the chair of the welsh affairs committee 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on support for clean energy project in wales 
 this government be support clean energy project in wales tidal solar and onshore wind project be successful in the recent contract for difference round and we have give the celtic and anglesey freeport the green light which will enable green industry to grow create new job i be also delighted that project have be successful in the round of the crown estate ’s £ supply chain accelerator fund which will support the delivery of float offshore wind in the celtic sea 
 the under secretary of state for wales my hon friend   the member for llanelli dame nia griffith be recently with i in llandudno at a roundtable with the main stakeholder in float offshore wind in the celtic sea this project be ready to go and it will bring massive benefit through cheap more secure energy for everybody across the uk what be the secretary of state and the wales office do to ensure that the contract be sign seal and deliver as quickly as possible we want these benefit to come via wales not via other region or country 
 i thank my hon friend for her question we know that float offshore wind will be critical to deliver our clean energy mission and wales have a huge part to play in that the uk government jointly with the welsh government recognise these opportunity and what they present for wales and we be determined to take full advantage of they my colleague in the department for energy security and net be work to move the process forward as quickly as possible note the need for certainty and a tight timetable so that we can get on with it 
 steel be a key component of develop clean energy project in response to my write question the government confirm that they have estimate the cost of nationalise british steel to safeguard the plant ’s future can the secretary of state explain why the government do that for british steel but dismiss nationalisation in the case of port talbot 
 the government have no plan to nationalise british steel 
 what discussion she have have with the welsh government on the potential impact of the propose tourism levy on job in wales 
 the welsh government have introduce a bill in the senedd that will give local authority in wales the choice to introduce a levy on overnight stay in visitor accommodation it will be for individual council to decide whether they will introduce a small charge pay by people stay overnight in commercially let accommodation in wales to help support a thriving tourism industry 
 i thank the secretary of state for her response but have she assess the regional impact of this levy although the impact can perhaps be level out and absorb across the whole of wales some community be clearly go to be hit hard than other how will they be compensate for the impact 
 more than country and holiday destination around the world have introduce a form of visitor levy include greece amsterdam barcelona and california and many of we have pay such levy abroad without notice the money will help to support a long term thrive tourism industry in wales i be confident that the welsh government will work with business and tourist alike to get this right 
 do the secretary of state agree that the successful introduction of similar scheme in place such as manchester and indeed in successful tourist destination around the world show that the conservatives should stop fear monger and support something that could really boost welsh tourism 
 my hon friend be absolutely right as i say such levy be already the norm in more than country and holiday destination around the world manchester show it can work so why can wales not show that 
 i call the shadow secretary of state for wales 
 tourism be vital to the welsh economy however labour ’s new tourism tax have merely create attraction closure and strike from the zoo in ynys môn to the cliff railway in aberystwyth the welsh government proposal will put more job in jeopardy leave hotel room empty   and simply send welsh family across the border on to flight for their trip treat and holiday do the secretary of state really agree with her colleague in cardiff bay that the potential price of tourism job and the loss of tourism to wales together with £ of revenue be worth pay 
 i be afraid i do not recognise any of those figure from the hon lady as i say in manchester a similar scheme have be introduce it have be highly successful and have raise £ in just year she should be more ambitious for wales 
 what step she be take with the welsh government to help reduce nhs waiting list in wales 
 what assessment she have make with the welsh government of trend in level of nhs waiting list in wales in the last month 
 both the uk and welsh governments be seize of the need to drive down waiting list the spending review provide the welsh government with an additional £ for next year to invest in public service such as the nhs the welsh government recently announce an additional £ in this year to reduce the long waiting time by increase capacity for more people to be see and treat 
 the disastrous record that the labour party have in healthcare in wales over the past year be cold comfort to resident in south west hertfordshire if that be the template the party intend to use across the whole of the united kingdom do the secretary of state agree that the key to reduce waiting list in wales and south west hertfordshire be invest in our healthcare infrastructure and particularly new hospital 
 if i be the hon gentleman i would be a bit embarrassed about raise the subject of new hospital give his government ’s record the welsh government have just have a £ record settlement £ of barnett consequential and with the welsh government ’s budget yesterday £ for the nhs and social care to bring down waiting list and increase capacity the welsh government be focus on the priority of the welsh public 
 the labour party have be in charge in wales for year the percentage of patient in wales wait more than a year for treatment be compare with in england why in year of be in charge have you not reform the nhs in wales and bring down waiting list 
 i be not sure mr speaker be in charge of reform the nhs in wales i say to the hon gentleman that under the previous conservative government waiting list increase by a large percentage in england than they do in wales 
 as the secretary of state have just say it be under the last prime minister that waiting list increase fast in england than in wales do the secretary of state agree that recent budget announcement by both the uk and welsh governments demonstrate that both government understand the importance of fix our nhs and deliver for the people of the whole united kingdom 
 i could not agree more with my hon friend as i say there be a record settlement from welsh government yesterday with £ announce to bring down waiting list and increase capacity in the nhs and social care if the party on the opposition benches want more money and more investment in the nhs they need to tell their colleague in the senedd to vote for the budget 
 the welsh budget yesterday announce significant extra funding for the nhs in wales i be surprised why be the party on the opposition benches vote against it 
 i think their stance on the welsh government budget say it all they be more bothered about score cheap political point than they be about deliver service and investment for wales 
 i call the shadow secretary of state for wales 
 the nhs in wales be break under labour wait continue and no family it seem be without somebody wait in an ever grow queue it be the high on record with in of the welsh population on a waiting list in september people be in need of treatment if someone have lose their winter fuel allowance along with any hope of see a gp or consultant and get social care what do the secretary of state really have to say and do to reassure old people that the labour government here and in the senedd have the ability to tackle that disgrace of a backlog 
 i say to the hon lady that both the welsh and the uk government be look after pensioner in wales we make the tough but right decision on winter fuel payment give our economic inheritance from the previous conservative government we be focus on deliver funding and support to the people who need it most there have already be a increase in pension credit claim since july ’s announcement and those people who receive the winter fuel payment will get on average an extra £ a year in pension credit 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 resident in rural powys be suffer as a consequence of delay to ambulance turn up or in some case of those ambulance not turn up at all in recent example the family of a stroke victim in my constituency have to drive their paralysed and vomit mother in a car to a hospital in hereford after be tell that there would be a to hour wait for an ambulance and that be after they have already be   wait hour for an ambulance to arrive shockingly that be not an isolated case it be an experience to which many people across rural wales can relate will the secretary of state tell i what action she be take to reassure my constituent that an ambulance will turn up in their hour of need 
 i be very sorry to hear about the experience of the hon gentleman ’s constituent yesterday the welsh government announce £ additional funding for the welsh nhs and for social care i hope that his colleague in the senedd will vote for the welsh government budget so that we can see that investment go into the nhs to deliver the improvement in wait time that we all want to see 
 what step she be take to strengthen the union 
 we be work in close partnership with the welsh government to grow our economy and unleash wales ’s potential this have already deliver tangible result include secure more than £ investment and hundred of job for north wales a well deal for steelworker at port talbot and a record budget settlement for the welsh government to spend on public service include provide funding to keep coal tip safe which the previous government do not do 
 i be pleased to hear the secretary of state announce the welsh economic growth advisory group will she explain how the resetting of relationship between the welsh and uk governments be strengthen wales ’s position in the uk industrial strategy and also improve access to vital service and relationship over the border in the forest of dean 
 the secretary of state be very pleased to chair the meeting of the advisory group last week the group will work with we to inform the uk government ’s industrial strategy to ensure that we build on wales ’s proud industrial heritage and develop the job and industry of the future this be the time that representative from both government from business education and industry group and from the union have come together to shape cross government uk policy prove the difference that government work together for wales can make 
 there be no well way of strengthen the union than improve the healthcare of people in wales somehow at the general election labour manage to mislead the public in england into think that it could bring the change to the health service in truth we need welsh people to have a much improve health service as the people of england have have under conservative control interruption only the labour government could suggest that long wait list in wales and bad outcome in wales be somehow something to crow about they be not what will be do about it 
 what do you make of that mr speaker with the additional funding that we have provide for the welsh government i can assure the   right hon member that there will be proper investment in the welsh health service which do not happen for year under the tories 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on increase economic growth in north wales 
 i have regular discussion with cabinet and welsh government colleague on economic growth i recently have the pleasure of visit airbus in broughton alongside the prime minister and i address cbi wales member alongside the minister since come into government we have work to drive over £ in private investment from eren holding and kellogg ’s into north wales create and sustain over job 
 cross border co operation and investment by north wales and the mersey dee region of north west england be essential to maximise growth on both side of the border key to achieve that will be improve railway connectivity will the secretary of state meet i and the cross party cross nation growth track group to explore how we can make that happen and help the economy on both side of the border prosper 
 i know the key role that good cross border transport play in strengthen economic and social tie across north wales and the north west of england i be pleased to join the welsh government cabinet secretary for transport at flint and chester station recently to announce a increase in rail capacity with more timetabled service on the north wales main line i would be delighted to meet my hon friend representative from the mersey dee region and growth track 
 today thousand of farmer have descend on this place in a further bid to get the government to listen and to realise the consequence of their action be it not time to do the right thing by those who feed our nation and stop the family farm tax grab which will see our farm decimate and our food security put in jeopardy that certainly will not help economic growth 
 the uk budget deliver £ for farming over the next year and i be pleased that this government be able to protect welsh farm budget for the next financial year yesterday ’s welsh budget allocation confirm protection of the basic payment scheme funding for the next year and provide additional revenue and capital funding to help the sector transition to the new sustainable farming scheme that have be welcome by farm union across wales 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help improve transport connectivity between wales and the rest of the uk 
 the government be absolutely committed to work collaboratively with the welsh government to improve transport connectivity within wales and with the rest of the uk we be already make progress network rail and transport for wales announce a joint programme which as the secretary of state say will see more timetabled service on the north wales main line i be delighted to see the tri mode train bring into service on the south wales metro last month 
 the low thames crossing be a vital link between our channel port and holyhead port i know labour be against new road building in wales but a north wales corridor connect our port would be a vital piece of transport infrastructure for our whole country will the minister lobby the welsh government on that for wales and for our entire united kingdom 
 i remind the right hon member that holyhead be recently give freeport tax status and i assure he that the welsh government have not rule out a northern ireland crossing 
 on our transport policy in wales casualty fall by a quarter on mph and mph road last year do the minister agree that that will be of great comfort to school like osbaston in my constituency and to parent like rhiannon in flintshire who praise the scheme for help to save her son ’s life after he be hit by a car 
 indeed the welsh government have be clear that the priority objective of the mph policy be to save life and reduce casualty recent collision datum provide an encouraging sign that the policy be move in the right direction 
 what recent discussion she have have with the welsh government on tackle violence against woman and girl 
 the government hold regular discussion with the welsh government on tackle violence against woman and girl to help drive forward the government ’s ambition to halve violence against woman and girl in a decade most recently on   november the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips who have responsibility for safeguarding meet the welsh minister for social care and the welsh cabinet secretary for social justice they discuss in detail measure to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 the safety of woman and girl be as important in newcastle under lyme as it be up and down our united kingdom the welsh government have have a violence against woman and girl strategy since sadly the previous uk government do not have for my constituent in england what lesson can the new government learn from the welsh labour government on keep our woman and girl safe 
 as my hon friend say the welsh government ’s violence against woman and girl strategy have be pioneer delivery on that important issue for year now the uk government ’s aim of halve violence against woman and girl in a decade be ambitious and learn lesson from the welsh government will help as part of their long stand commitment to tackle violence against woman and girl south wales police have introduce new measure include the cardiff safety bus which have receive national recognition for safeguard more than vulnerable people on the street of cardiff since september

 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark welcome the fall of assad and with his hope for the syrian people 
 since middlesbrough council have return to labour control under mayor chris cooke it be no long subject to government intervention in its child ’s service or to a good value notice and it be on track to become financially stable i know that the prime minister will want to join i in congratulate mayor cooke and the council on their recent success can he confirm that the spending review will not simply end year of   conservative austerity but will unwind it and provide the resource that council need to properly serve our community 
 i join my hon friend in pay tribute to that mayor and to all local representative across the country who do a fantastic job even when funding be cut to the bone during the past year of tory government we be boost local government funding by £ and invest £ to improve road i be proud to see the work on the carbon capture cluster in teesside which will create new job 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 last week the prime minister do not seem to want to talk about appoint fraudster to his cabinet in fact he seem to want to talk about immigration so let we talk about immigration he have relaunche yet again with many new target milestone and mission but why be cut immigration not a priority 
 i be glad that the leader of the opposition now want to talk about immigration last week she say that she do not want to and for good reason because the previous government preside over record high level of immigration the figure just a few week ago show net migration of nearly that be unprecedented a nation experiment in open border under the last government she be the champion she stand up and praise the then tory home secretary for listen to she on remove cap on migration visa she be applaud it now she be furious about what she be campaign for we will drive down lawful migration we will drive down illegal migration 
 the prime minister talk about open border but he be the campaigning for free movement i be in this house ask for a lift in skilled migration he be support all the people who should not have be in this country he want we to relax immigration but as he be so keen to talk about the past let we look at his record year ago the prime minister sign a letter demand that foreign criminal be allow to stay in britain dozen of labour and liberal democrat mps repeatedly sign these letter insist that rapist and murderer be allow to stay here of those criminal ernesto elliott have conviction include for knife crime after his deportation be block elliott go on to murder someone he be able to stay here and murder because people like this man campaign against deport criminal will he apologise for sign these letter 
 i remind the leader of the opposition that the number of migrant come to this country under her government ’s watch nearly be over time the number who do so when we be in the eu they lose control of the border and the particular example she put to i be an example of failure under her government to take the necessary measure to keep our country safe 
 that be a ludicrous assertion the prime minister be the who be repeatedly sign those letter he even ask we to pause all deportation   he do not want to talk about his past but that letter be just the tip of the iceberg there be more the prime minister actually complain that the immigration system be work to 
 deter migrant rather than provide support 
 he say that he be 
 proud to have serve as jeremy ’s shadow immigration minister 
 he boast that he 
 take the last labour government to court for cut benefit for asylum seeker 
 and say that he would never take 
 a target base approach to immigration 
 if he want to talk about immigration let we talk about his record we can talk about it all day the prime minister say that he want to talk about immigration i have commit to a cap on migration why will not he 
 the leader of the opposition talk about my record for year i be the chief prosecutor prosecute people who go to prison many of whom be then deport while she be talk i be actually do the hard yard convict those who should be in prison she preside over record number of asylum seeker in this country a record number of lawful and irregular migrant in year in which her government lose control of the border they set a cap for each of those year but it be not hard it do not stop people come and they get a record number they should apologise for what they have do with their open border policy 
 the prime minister do not answer a single—[interruption 
 order do the hon member interrupting want to leave if you have not get the gut to stand up to the comment you should not be in here 
 the prime minister do not answer a single question he never answer question he want to talk about the past the fact be that we have acknowledge where thing go wrong but he will never take responsibility he have scrap a deterrent that the national crime agency say we need since he come into government and scrap the rwanda deterrent small boat arrival have increase by nearly his own mp be complain about have to house asylum seeker so can the prime minister tell the house how much more his government will spend on hotel accommodation because he scrap the deterrent 
 i be invite to tell the house what go wrong under the last government that would take we all afternoon we be go to smash the gang that be run this vile trade we sign a landmark agreement with germany this week interruption 
 order mr philp you have be very loud i think now we be go to have a little bit of silence from you 
 this week we sign a landmark agreement with germany the leader of the opposition should welcome that because it will make sure that we   have the power to take enforcement action across the continent where it be need we have set up the border security command we have commit £ on top of the exist £ and we be extend the power so that they be like counter terrorism power we have return people who should not be here a record flight get off the opposition talk about get flight off and have do for year but they do not succeed we get the flight off 
 the prime minister say that he want to smash the gang the only thing he have smash be his own reputation what he have be agree be not go to do anything the cost of the iraq agreement be half a pound that would not even buy a house in his constituency many of the thing that he be take credit for be our agreement let we talk about what he put in his manifesto the prime minister promise to end asylum hotel he promise and he be prime minister now but in altrincham and peterborough his government be expand the use of asylum hotel because he unilaterally disarm the deterrent in fact a man who arrive by small boat tell sky news he be happy labour be in power that man say the conservatives 
 want to deport we 
 but labour be 
 make the procedure easy for we 
 he be right be n’t he 
 the leader of the opposition should welcome the iraq deal anybody who want to deal with this vile trade would have welcome it she should also welcome the german deal that we do this week many of the boat that be find their way to the channel be come through germany that be well document there have be a difficulty in take enforcement action which if she spend more time research that than her terrible joke she would know about we have sign an agreement to take enforcement action in germany to stop those boat get to the coast that be effective action she should welcome it it be really good news all law enforcement think that it be a good thing why do she think it be a bad thing 
 because the number be go up under his watch the prime minister have consistently back criminal over law abide british people he defend terrorist like hizb ut tahrir in the european court he argue that all immigration law have a racist undercurrent he vote against life sentence for people smuggler he vote against more than measure to control migration he even say it be wrong when the conservatives take away shamima begum ’s citizenship now he have appoint her defence lawyer as his attorney general event in syria mean that we may see more small boat arrival for once will he take the side of the british people and strip citizenship from jihadi terrorist and supporter of assad who want to come back and destroy this country 
 i be director of public prosecutions for year unlike anyone on the conservatives bench for year i be prosecute hundred of thousand of criminal that include huge terrorist gang and rapist for of those year i be work with the then home secretary theresa may who commend the work that i do at the end of those   year the leader of the opposition stand there and say that i have not do anything in law enforcement i dedicate year of my life to law enforcement and lock up criminal which be more than she can say 
 it would be easy to take the opposition seriously if they actually get serious not a sliver of remorse not a hint of contrition it be like the arsonist complain about the people who be try to put the fire out all they do be come every week with more and more complaint just wait till they get their hand on the people who create the mess that we be clear up we be fix the economy we be end their open border policy and we be take down the waiting list that be what people vote for we be deliver it 
 in the last couple of month since i speak to the prime minister here about the need for social and industrial investment in cornwall we have have a fresh tranche of share prosperity funding a huge boost to international interest in our clean energy industry and a road map to great political autonomy that reflect cornwall ’s unique national identity will the pm join his minister on that visit in the spring to meet representative of those industry at hand and spell out a road map for cornwall to help britain become a clean energy superpower 
 i thank my hon friend he be a champion of the extraordinary potential of cornwall particularly in our transition to clean power by next week we will publish our english devolution white paper set out our ambition to move power from westminster into every part of england include cornwall and i know that he and his colleague be meet the deputy prime minister to discuss this next week 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 while syrians be rejoice at the overthrow of the brutal assad regime many people there and around the world be worried about what come next as indeed the prime minister say with threat of extremism isis terrorism and unsecured chemical weapon only an open political process can bring peace and stability but that will require the full backing of the international community do the prime minister share my concern that president elect trump say about syria 
 the united states should have nothing to do with it 
 if america step away will the prime minister step up and work with other ally to provide british leadership over syria 
 the right hon gentleman be right that this be a very serious moment we all welcome the fall of assad and i hope that this can be a much need turning point for syria but that be by no mean guarantee that be why we have be speak intently and intensely with our ally in the region and across the globe about how we ensure that this be peaceful political and a rejection of terrorism and violence this could be a turning point but in the past we have think that what come next will necessarily be well and that have turn out not to be the case that be why we be work so hard on this and show the leadership that the right hon gentleman and the house would expect from this government 
 i thank the prime minister for that reply and hope that we can continue to work on a cross party basis regard britain ’s role in secure peace and stability in the middle east 
 move on to another subject british farmer be the good in the world and that be because of our tradition of family farm where from generation to generation a commitment to high quality food to our precious environment and to animal welfare be pass down but family farm be let down badly by the last conservative government with their botched transition to new payment scheme and their unfair trade deal with australia and new zealand which have undercut british farmer now many family farm feel that this government ’s budget will be the final blow will the prime minister change course and recognise the vital role that british family farm play 
 as the right hon gentleman know we put £ into farming over the next year which be a record number under the budget and last week alone there be £ to support farmer in the united kingdom that contrast with the last government under which there be an underspend of £ in relation to farmer on inheritance tax as he know in a typical family case the threshold be £ and therefore the vast majority of farmer will be unaffected despite the fearmongering of the conservative party 
 place of worship be vitally important not just for practise ’s faith but for local heritage the government ’s list place of worship grant scheme currently provide much need tax relief for religious building in need of renovation but it be schedule to end next year what assurance can the prime minister provide my constituent that the government will continue to support restore our much cherish place of worship such as holy trinity church in horwich 
 i thank my hon friend for that question and recognise the important role that these building play at the heart of community particularly at a time like christmas a wide range of fund be available for maintenance and restoration include the national lottery heritage fund ’s place of worship scheme detail will be confirm in the usual way by department at the spending review 
 last week my neighbours omar and delal al shaqaqi who serve south belfast as a doctor and a classroom assistant receive the news they have be dread delal ’s mother and brother be among gazans kill in their tent by an israeli airstrike in the so call humanitarian zone of al mawasi and other family member be fight for their life in a barely function health system the crisis in gaza be get bad not well none of we in this chamber can end their nightmare but we can do more the government have rightly use every tool at their disposal include sanction on arm trade and official against putin ’s russia when will israel be hold to the same standard for genocide when will this government confirm further sanction recognise the state of palestine and offer some hope to beleaguered gazans and the many million who be watch on in horror 
 may i start by say that i be sorry to hear of the dreadful loss of the family of the hon member ’s constituent there have be far too many example like that i be pleased to see that there be now a ceasefire in lebanon we desperately need that now in gaza which be something we have be press for for some time there be intense talk go on to that end at the moment as she know that ceasefire would provide the space for the hostage to be allow out they have be there for a very long time it would allow desperately need aid to go in at speed and at scale but it also open the potential for the pathway to the state solution which i believe be the only peaceful way to resolve this ongoing conflict

 with permission mr speaker i will make a statement on the new border security agreement we have reach with germany and with the calais group of interior ministers from the uk france germany belgium and the netherlands which meet in london yesterday with europol frontex and the european commission to discuss strengthen action against small boat crossing and organised immigration crime 
 in the light of fast move event in the middle east we also discuss the situation in syria at the calais group yesterday and i will briefly address that issue as the foreign secretary tell the house we welcome the fall of the assad regime but continue to closely monitor this fast move situation where there be significant risk of instability consider that i have take the decision to temporarily pause decision on syrian asylum claim all calais group country have take the same decision we will of course continue to keep all guidance relate to these asylum claim under constant review and we will keep the house update in the normal way 
 last week i update the house on the new agreement the government have reach with the iraqi government and the kurdistan regional authority to tackle organise immigration crime this week we have reach new strengthen agreement close to home smuggler and traffic gang have be allow to get away with their vile trade in people for far too long britain need strong border and a properly control and manage asylum and immigration system but for the past year we have have the opposite that be why we be prepared to do the hard graft to get the system back under control and tackle the gang long before they reach our shore 
 immediately after the election we begin to strengthen our international collaboration to go after those criminal gang include by increase the number of national crime agency officer in europol set up the new border security command and make the new agreement with the g7 already that strengthen collaboration be deliver result in the last few week alone we have see the arrest of a major suspect in the supply of boat and engine to the channel which involve co operation between belgium the netherlands and the uk a major operation last week against a syrian and iraqi kurdish gang operate through germany and france be lead by french police but be support by intelligence from the nca and involve german police officer it deliver not just a series of arrest of suspect gang member but the seizure of multiple boat and engine destine for the channel boat that could have lead to thousand of people make dangerous journey 
 criminal need to know that there will be no hiding place the gang who undermine our border security by facilitate small boat cross the channel be also facilitate dangerous and illegal journey into other european country and commit wide crime include serious violence exploitation money laundering and drug trafficking these gang operate across border therefore we need law enforcement co operation across border to bring they down and new system to work   across different prosecutorial and legal system we need to rebuild basic intelligence sharing and co operation that be damage under the last government ’s post brexit arrangement and new expertise be need to deal with evolving threat 
 this week i sign a landmark agreement with my german counterpart minister nancy faeser to tackle irregular migration the new joint action plan be the of its kind between the uk and germany it include much strong operational co operation such as information and intelligence sharing include very practical basic measure such as increase the use of the siena secure information exchange network application europol system by the nca to share information with german police to swiftly pursue investigation strong partnership to deliver prosecution new work to take down social medium content that be be use as advertising by organise smuggler gang joint working and co ordination with transit and source country support each other on return and establish the german international liaison officer in the border security command 
 importantly the joint action plan mean strengthen the law in germany to tackle people smuggler we know that gang be rout many supply chain through germany include use warehouse to store boat and engine that be destine for the channel clarification of the law in germany will mean that activity facilitate migrant smuggling to the uk in germany will be a criminal offence this be a major change which will make it easy for german prosecutor to dismantle supply chain and prosecute the smuggler involve it mean that in germany and across europe we be send a clear message to the smuggler activity to smuggle people into the uk be a criminal offence and you will be prosecute and bring to justice germany and the uk will also work together through europol to investigate the end to end criminal activity of kurdish gang network that be operate in both our country in co operation with the iraqi government and kurdish authority follow the agreement i reach in iraq 
 the joint action plan embody our share determination to pursue organise immigration crime but it also reflect the same determination and commitment share across other near neighbour embody in our meeting with the calais group in london yesterday i strongly welcome the new announcement from the french interior minister on increase the police presence and enforcement along the french coast through the winter alongside the appointment of a new coastal préfet the increase violence we have see on the beach towards french police be a total disgrace 
 the calais group also agree a new plan to strengthen action across our country include a range of action back by an end to end approach to tackle migrant smuggling network from the french coast through to source and transit country include vietnam and central africa this include strong enforcement capability through europol target the illicit finance model of migrant smuggling network take down social medium advertising and co ordinated preventive communication to deter people from pay gang to arrange dangerous irregular journey we also discuss at the calais group the major escalation of enforcement activity we be undertake here in the uk immigration and asylum rule need to be respect and enforce and for too long they have not be 
 over the summer we move more staff into return and enforcement activity which have already lead to nearly return since the election with enforce return up by and voluntary return by also during the summer enforcement officer complete more than visit to employer and more than arrest a substantial increase on the figure in the previous year we discuss the need to scale up all these operation drastically over the next month to ensure that word turn into decisive action against the gang yesterday as part of these effort we publish a mission statement for the border security command set out the approach that we be adopt to increase enforcement capacity in the uk and europe draw on the good intelligence and enforcement practice in the police the national crime agency border force and our intelligence agency 
 in the year before this government come to office criminal gang be allow to take hold all along our border establish a criminal industry profit from misery and exploitation and put life at risk the terrible consequence of this phenomenon have be clear for too many year fatality in the channel as people risk their life make dangerous journey border security undermine and public trust in the immigration system erode while criminal gang make million in profit they can not be allow to get away with it in place of the failure of the past this government have a serious and sensible plan to strengthen our border security and fix our broken asylum system a plan that be base on grip not gimmick and on serious international partnership i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 i thank the home secretary for the timely sight of her statement and i thank she for her comment on syria we certainly support the effort of this government and other around the world to secure a transition to a stable government in syria that can ensure the return of peace we also support the suspension of asylum processing i be glad that the government make that decision a few hour after i call for it yesterday 
 do the home secretary agree that give that most if not all the asylum claim be predicate on the threat pose to the individual by former president assad now that that threat have go and the basis for the asylum claim have therefore go it would be reasonable to ask syrians who be claim or have recently be grant asylum on that basis to return once they be safe early today the leader of the opposition ask the prime minister if he would ensure that no former uk resident who be in syria and who support the murderous daesh regime that kill and rap innocent woman and child persecute minority and severely persecute its opponent return to the uk in government the conservatives ensure that those people do not return the shamima begum case be an example so will the home secretary take similarly robust action to ensure that people who support daesh do not return to the united kingdom i think the house would appreciate such an assurance 
 let i now turn to the question of small boat and border security the home secretary assert i must say rather boldly that her approach be deliver   result but i be afraid the fact do not bear that out let we have a look at the result that be actually be deliver in the day since the election more than people dangerously and illegally cross the english channel more than do so in the same day in the previous year i do not call an year on year increase deliver result that be a failure why be these figure up year on year the national crime agency tell we that we need a deterrent but that law enforcement alone would not be enough yet the government cancel the rwanda deterrent before it have even start the flight be due to take off on   july and they cancel it before it even take off of course we welcome the law enforcement that continue the work do by the last government but accord to the nca that alone will not be enough so we need a deterrent when will the home secretary introduce 
 in the spirit of examine the right hon lady ’s claim that she be deliver result let we look at the government ’s record on asylum hotel in their manifesto they promise to close down and end the use of asylum hotel accord to figure that we obtain recently in the month follow the election far from reduce asylum hotel use they increase it by people in place such as peterborough and altrincham which be now represent by labour mps asylum hotel be open up in express contradiction of their own manifesto commitment 
 let i say a word about removal it be welcome that overall removal have go up continue the trend under the previous government although i observe that almost all those removal be to european and north american country the home secretary do not break out the number on small boat return and i wonder why that be i have look into the figure and it turn out that in the month after the election less than of people cross by small boat be return more than that the number of people return have cross by small boat in the month after the election be in fact low than the number return in the month prior to it so the number of people return after cross by small boat have go down under this government 
 the home secretary mention criminal gang and i be glad that the work start under the last government include by my right hon friend   the member for braintree mr cleverly be be continue that include the international co operation that he pursue both as foreign secretary and as home secretary but i ask the home secretary this why in opposition do she vote against life sentence for people smuggler 
 we hear a bit about the calais group ’s discussion yesterday of course co operation be important we too co operate when in government but i wonder whether the home secretary have the chance to ask she french opposite number or question will the french accept return of people cross the channel that would provide a very powerful deterrent as she will know the post eu exit documentation the political declaration expressly allow individual member state to engage in bilateral arrangement on border do she raise that with her french counterpart and what do they say 
 secondly be the home secretary able to ask her french counterpart whether france will intercept small boat close to the french shore as the belgians safely   do in belgium it have result in a reduction in crossing if the french would do the same and intercept near the shore it would have a dramatic effect 
 the home secretary say that she be deliver result but these be the result crossing be up by asylum hotel place be up by and small boat return be down under the new government she be deliver result i be afraid they be bad 
 i gently point out to the shadow home secretary that his party leave we with the high ever level of small boat crossing in the half of a year the high level on record if we have carry on with small boat crossing at the same level as in the half of the year when he be in the home office we would have have to deal with thousand more arrival over the last few month when he be the immigration minister small boat crossing increase about tenfold because he let criminal gang take hold along the channel they build an entire criminal industry on his watch that he do nothing to stop which be why we now have to deal with those criminal gang 
 on return i gently point out to the shadow home secretary that by the time the conservatives leave office return be down by more than a quarter compare with under the last labour government because of the conservatives continue failure to even get the system work that be why we have put substantial additional resource into return and into make sure that the rule be enforce which they simply have not be for far too long 
 on the asylum backlog perhaps the shadow home secretary will take responsibility for the total crashing of the asylum system in the last few month before the general election when the conservative party and the home office of which he be a part end up cut asylum decision by more than compare with the beginning of the year that shocking dereliction of duty mean that we have have to deal with the increase backlog that his party leave behind over the summer and we be get it back under control 
 there be some important issue on asylum decision involve syrians let we be clear many claim for asylum relate to the assad regime which be clearly not in place now it would therefore not be appropriate to grant asylum decision on those case in the current circumstance we need to monitor the evolve situation so that we can get new country guidance in place and take those decision but we will do that in a sensible and serious way which be about get the asylum and immigration system back under control by contrast the shadow home secretary and the conservative party seem simply to want to go back to the rwanda scheme once again i point out to they that it cost the taxpayer £ and send just volunteer to kigali the most shocking waste of public money over year on a fail scheme all they deliver be gimmick instead of ever get a grip and all the shadow home secretary want to do be turn the clock back to failure again 
 it be so refreshing to have a home secretary who be actually target those who exploit refugee i understand what she say about the evolve situation in syria and   i welcome what she have just say about new country guidance may i press she a little bit more though she will understand and recognise that the syrian community in this country which many of we have be proud to welcome and support be unsettled there be claim in process when do she expect to have a refresh assessment we know that the situation in syria be very uncertain at the moment can she please give our syrian community some comfort about the direction of travel 
 we be obviously review the situation as swiftly as possible we have withdraw the previous syria country guidance because it would not have be appropriate to take decision on that basis and we be monitor the situation closely to look at how and when new country guidance can be draw up my hon friend will understand that there be considerable uncertainty about what be happen in syria we have welcome the removal of the assad regime however much be still unknown about what will happen in syria next which be why we have to be serious about this matter and monitor the situation closely other country be do the same 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the home secretary for her statement and for advance sight of it on syria this be a fast move situation and it be absolutely right that the temporary pause on decision on syrian asylum claim be keep under constant review the uk should be do all it can to help secure an orderly transition of power in syria in accordance with international law and the government should move to offer asylum seeker and other certainty about their claim as soon as possible 
 we welcome the government ’s attempt to tackle people smuggling gang who send vulnerable people on perilous journey across the channel we also appreciate their work closely with our european neighbour on this issue instead of blame they as the previous conservative government do all too often do the home secretary agree that in addition to bilateral agreement with state and the calais group such as the she sign yesterday we need to work even more closely with inter state agency such as europol which she mention and eurojust to restore the uk police ’s real time access to the eu wide datum share system that lead to the identifying and arrest of criminal shamefully that co operation and access be lose under the conservatives 
 we should not forget how we end up in this mess the asylum backlog balloon thank to the last conservative government and thousand of people be currently wait for their claim to be process can the home secretary update the house on what progress she and colleague be make in tackle the backlog will she commit to establish a dedicated unit to improve the speed and quality of asylum decision making and introduce a service standard of month for all but the most complex asylum claim to be process many of the people we be talk about be incredibly vulnerable they be flee war persecution and famine do the home secretary agree that we have to tackle this problem at source and what conversation   have she have with the foreign commonwealth and development office about boost international development spending and co operation to tackle the root cause of the numerous refugee crisis 
 the hon member raise asylum claim from syria this be something we discuss in the calais group and all country be take the same approach of recognise that we can not currently take decision we clearly want to be able to do so as swiftly as possible but we need to monitor the situation in syria in the meantime 
 the hon member raise the importance of other partnership work include with europol and eurojust and i agree with she on the importance of that of the thing we agree with germany and then as part of the calais group discussion at which europol be also present be that we be keen either to establish a new europol taskforce or to expand of the exist taskforce to look at the end to end smuggler route and its supply chain and particularly to work with the kurdish authority and the iraqi government on the end to end route involve the iraqi kurdish criminal smuggler gang all those involve include the iraqi government be keen to work with we on that but we need that europol taskforce in place in order to be able to do that 
 on asylum decision making we be increase the caseworker in post and we have substantially increase the pace of decision decision making have plummet by about just before the election but we now have the extra caseworker in place and we have get decision back up to where they be that allow we to clear the backlog on initial decision finally i agree with the hon member that we need to continue to work on the source issue and we be work closely with the foreign office on that 
 i spend year work on migration before i come into this house include year as the home affair attaché in paris where i see at hand how the kind of instrument and datum share the home secretary be describe can make a concrete difference in the fight against immigration crime i also see that as the previous government pull the uk out of these instrument it make our job as official hard i could not welcome the home secretary ’s statement more immigration be an international phenomenon and by definition tackle immigration crime require international co operation can she tell we a bit more about the step she have take to build the relationship with these key european ally will she also commit to keep her foot to the floor on this issue in my experience these relationship can so easily be cut and but to bear fruit they take time and political will 
 my hon friend have considerable experience in these issue and i thank he for all his work on this he be right to say that with something as basic as the right kind of information and intelligence sharing if the system be remove and no new system be put in place basic operational action simply do not happen whether they involve go after the criminal gang or prevent dangerous boat crossing and criminal activity this be as basic as make sure that we now have much strong system include use the europol   secure information exchange network application siena system so that when the german police get information from the national crime agency it be in a form that they can swiftly use to pursue investigation and prosecution my hon friend be right we have to make sure that the detail work which have often not be take seriously for far too long 
 i welcome the home secretary ’s commitment to maintain the relationship with the calais group interior ministers that i be develop when i be in her role and to build on the uk frontex agreement that i sign with commissioner johansson in february of this year however i want she to explain this to the house if the role of the border security command be so clear if the division of labour between it and the small boat operational command be so clear and if this issue be so pressing why have it take month to give they a mission 
 i recognise the point that the former home secretary have make to be fair to he he have to do a lot of work to try to repair the relationship with the calais group and with some of the european partner after some of his predecessor have be rather more careless shall we say and rather more destructive in that relationship but we now have these further agreement in place and they be crucial practical arrangement about strengthen law enforcement co operation to go after the criminal gang 
 on the right hon gentleman ’s point about the border security command i know this have be a bugbear of his in that he want to see it as the same as the small boat operational command but they be very different the small boat operational command be rightly focus on the operation in the channel and it do some excellent work to ensure that we can have order around the system in the channel the border security command be a much broad programme of work for example martin hewitt travel with i to iraq and kurdistan in order to build those operational relationship so that we can work upstream he be also part of the calais group meeting yesterday in order to build those co operation arrangement as well we have provide continual update on the work of the border security command and we will continue to do so but we be already get on with work that i be afraid his party and he as home secretary never do 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s statement and the frankly grow up approach she be take to tackle this problem do she recognise the fury that be feel by constituent in hartlepool and elsewhere that as this system collapse over the past year with all the cost associate with that simultaneously our public service be eviscerate do she understand that that be why people in hartlepool want the system fix and fix quickly 
 my hon friend make a really important point what we see be the loss of control of our border security the loss of control along the channel where the criminal gang be allow to take hold and the chaos that be allow to develop in the asylum system at the same time we see the loss of control of legal migration where the new policy that be bring in mean that the figure quadruple in the space of just year most people across the country want we to   have strong border security and properly control and manage migration and asylum system so that the system be properly fair and work for this country we have not have that for too long and of course that have leave people deeply frustrated and want change 
 i welcome this joint action plan it be in our national security interest that it work and i hope it do so i be also grateful for the home secretary ’s point on syrian asylum seeker and we look forward to hear more detail as that story unfold she mention work upstream may i encourage she to meet the interior ministers of algeria libya morocco egypt and tunisia and also interior ministers in the sahel because she will know that a lot of the migration through the mediterranean be come out of north africa and particularly libya 
 the right hon gentleman make a really important point about the work upstream we do include interior ministers from north africa as part of the g7 discussion in italy in october that be important and it reflect a lot of the work with north african country which italy for example have be lead i also agree with he about the importance of the sahel some of the issue that we discuss in the calais group yesterday include look at area of instability and area from which people have be make dangerous journey we need to engage with those country we talk about the sahel and about central africa and we talk about iraq and some of the middle east area we also talk about vietnam from where we see a significant increase in the number of people arrive in small boat at the beginning of the year 
 i welcome the home secretary ’s statement today and congratulate her team on the work that they be undertake in this very difficult area back in the previous government commit to £ as part of an agreement with france that include strengthen law enforcement deployment more wide area surveillance technology and vehicle and enhance physical measure at transport interchange then in they commit to a furth £ and to continue these agreement my constituent see these agreement and the financial commitment be make with our neighbour and yet over the past few year they have just see increase problem with small boat crossing and backlog what reassurance can my right hon friend give my constituent that these agreement will make a difference and because this go to the heart of fairness that these funding agreement will bring about the change that people want to see 
 people clearly want to see practical change on the ground which be why the partnership work we have be take forward not just with france but with belgium the netherlands germany and other country be so important this have be about the prevention work along the french coast and the work with the french authority however the reality be that we have to be take action long before the boat the engine the people and the gang reach the french coast in the place that be the fundamental   difference between the approach we be now take and the previous government ’s work it be about how we work with other european country to tackle the gang before they reach the french coast that be where we need much strong partnership and that be where many of our effort have be focus 
 the application of the syrian asylum seeker have already be mention but when the department look at these claim will the home secretary keep in mind that syria ’s new leader be a committed jihadist who have voice support for the attack there be therefore very serious question particularly for woman and minority and all paused asylum claim should be process with that firmly in mind 
 in a similar vein although i fully support the increase effort to shut down illegal and dangerous trafficking route it be important that we have safe asylum route for those who be still at significant risk 
 the hon gentleman make an important point about the continue instability there be a lot that we simply do not know about how event will play out in syria those who have take over and who be involve in the initial overthrow of the assad regime initially say they would pursue an approach support minority within syria but the development we have see in recent day raise question about that we have also see huge instability with various organisation and group operate across the country that be why we need to monitor this closely i think everybody want to see great stability we have also see the initial sign of people want to return from turkey to syria for example in the few day but the situation be very unstable which be why we need to approach this with care and with detailed monitoring of what be happen 
 the conservatives should be absolutely ashamed of their asylum and immigration policy of their inactivity and of the complete mess in which they leave britain and our border interruption the anger and frustration they be show be share by my constituent in portsmouth north on the small boat arrival their frustration continue to fill my inboxe 
 when the home secretary come to power she promise a relentless focus on these boat we have already hear today about co operation with other country on raid arrest seizure and strong enforcement will she assure my constituent in portsmouth north that this be not a gimmick and that the focus will continue through the winter 
 my hon friend be right that the only way to deal with this issue be not through gimmick we have see those fail time and again or through the kind of posturing that the conservative party continue with it will be deal with only through partnership hard work and graft 
 we have set up the border security command put in place new agreement with country not only in europe but beyond such as iraq and strengthen our law enforcement capabilities—£150 be go into the border security command over the next year we be also get on with return and enforcement which   substantially increase this summer as a result of the action we have take to get they back on track after the system ’s previous failing 
 people be feed up with gimmick and we need to take a serious approach to get a grip on this issue 
 the home secretary have not answer very many question today so can she answer this very clear question which metric should we use and by which date to allow we to judge whether the government have succeed in smash the gang 
 i think everyone will be clear that no should be make these dangerous boat crossing that undermine our border security and put life at risk we need to pursue the criminal gang network that spread across europe and beyond which be why we welcome last week ’s arrest in germany as a result of the french lead operation support by the national crime agency we will continue to support and accelerate this work so that we can take strong action against the criminal gang 
 this week have see the result of the home secretary ’s work which have lead to the agreement with germany it be hard work and grip that get result it be incredible that under german law the stockpiling of the boat and engine use to cross the channel be not prohibit can the home secretary assure we now that this agreement will lead to a path to close this loophole and disrupt the work of the small boat gang 
 my hon friend be right that this be a practical issue to disrupt the criminal gang operate along the french coast we need to disrupt their supply chain and to be able to go after they wherever they operate of the most basic issue on which the previous government take no action at all be the fact these flimsy and incredibly dangerous boat be be ship across europe often be store in german warehouse however the legal framework in germany make it very hard for the german police and prosecutor to take action against those smuggling gang 
 the basic thing we have do be to reach agreement with germany that it will strengthen its law to make it clear that store these boat facilitate dangerous and illegal boat crossing out of the eu and into the uk which be a crime strengthen the law in that way help we to take action against the criminal gang but the previous government just never choose to do it it require diplomacy hard work and shared commitment and that be what we have show 
 we all welcome the fall of assad and look forward to he and his accomplice be drag before the criminal court to face justice for crime against humanity however the home secretary will know that the current situation in syria be very complex with a number of proscribe organisation involve we understand that the government be consider de list some of these organisation at the same time we be hear that money be send to syria to help and assist the syrians could fall into the hand of these proscribe organisation what action will the home secretary take to make sure that do not   happen as this be a move situation will she undertake to update the house on any move to de proscribe these organisation 
 the hon gentleman raise an important issue as he will know we do not routinely comment on either proscription or de proscription or on any of those process but i make it clear that proscription decision be take with care base on evidence over time they be not rush or base on inadequate evidence these be always important issue but the most important thing be the safety and national security of the uk and any decision we take will always be take in that light 
 i welcome the home secretary ’s statement and all the action her department be take to tackle migrant smuggling gang and to reduce the asylum backlog frankly i be quite surprised by the reaction i have hear from conservative member because either through inaction or through incompetence the last government leave we with an inheritance of asylum hotel at a cost to the taxpayer of £ a day they do not seem very bothered about target then 
 constituent in bournemouth west and across the country be rightly furious about this do my right hon friend agree that if conservative members be really serious about tackle illegal migration they would take responsibility for their legacy and welcome our measure rather than complain about they
