the right hon gentleman have some gall ask that question bear in mind that during parliamentary consideration of the trade act he promise to negotiate a well agreement with the eu now we find ourselves have bad term of trade with canada than we have when we be in the eu 
 it be strike too that issue that bedevil those discussion on the eu canada deal be now support by conservative members the secretary of state specifically seek to avoid investor state dispute settlement provision in the bilateral deal with canada that have now collapse we raise those concern at the time 
 this bill and our accession to cptpp will not make up for the ten of million of pound of extra cost that manufacturer and the car industry will face when export to canada due to the loss of eu cumulation right and the high tariff that will result from april this bill will also not be much help for dairy business that export to canada cheese exporter be now face tariff of because ministers be too late to try to stop the loss of a vital quota for tariff rate reduction minister have to be wake up to this issue by question from the opposition 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right this be a highly competitive training scheme between and the department fill all of its fund training place per year and since it have fill all of the funded place each year we have now commit to train a further educational psychologist 
 that be reason the high need budget be up by over in the past year and will reach £ in we be also support local authority with financial deficit through the safety valve and deliver better- value programme in most constituency include in the hon lady ’s area the funding have go up by to 
 we be implement a gold thread of high quality teacher training reform to ensure that teacher have the skill they need the department have be explore opportunity to build expertise through a review of the initial teacher train core content framework and the early career framework to identify   how we can equip new teacher to be more confident in meet the need of child and young people with send there will be more investment in educational psychologist of which there will be another and more investment in early year senco of which there will be another 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and also for all the work he have do in this area we work together when he be minister for child and family and i be work in the department of health and social care and it be something that we both care deeply about 
 as i say in answer to the early question there be a golden thread of high quality teacher training reform we will be look at a revise framework and work with provider so that they can ensure that the contract deliver the very good support for teacher what will be vital and something that member will feel be the additional senco that will be train in the come year 
 absolutely obviously reason for the reduction in some of the sme number be the fact that we make improvement to ensure that every single apprenticeship be of high quality i want to make sure that all young people who embark on an apprenticeship as i do put their trust in the system and get what they deserve we have remove the limit on cap on sme and we be work on reduce the number of step to make it easy for they to access the system we be also look at what more we can do we be focus on a number of way in which to ensure that apprenticeship work well for sme which account for of employment

 what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability

 what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 there be nothing more important than ensure that everyone in our country regardless of need get the very good education possible that be why our special educational need and alternative provision improvement plan will ensure that all child get the support they need to reach their potential we have open special free school include since september and launch a £ change programme to test and refine our systemic reform benefit every region in england early this month i announce an extension to our short break programme we have a plan and we be deliver on it 
 today many parent of child with special educational need include those in my constituency be at their wit end either they be fight to get an education health and care plan for their child or they be struggle to access the right support when they get that be a waste of public money a waste of parental energy and too often a waste of their child ’s precious potential do the secretary of state agree with my constituent who feel that the system be break 
 i would agree that there have be an absolute increase in special educational need in the past or year largely because we know more but also because covid have add some pressure on the system we have expand the system and want to ensure that all child with special educational need even more than before get the help they need we have an improvement plan in place which be publish in march and focus on early identification and improve support all the way through the journey we be train many more people and put more support in place for the hon lady ’s constituent 
 in small and rural community such as mine in west lancashire population and service be often very sparsely distribute and send student often have to either travel upwards of an hour to reach any provision or go without what be the government ’s plan to address that issue 
 we have be try to increase the number of place within both mainstream and special educational need and alternative provision setting as i say we have more special educational need school already build and more approve we have work with many local authority include in rural area to make sure they get the provision they need 
 every child with special educational need or disability should receive the high quality support they deserve but school and council do not have the necessary resource to meet increase demand and rise cost what discussion be the secretary of state have with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities on the funding and power available to council to improve send provision 
 that be reason the high need budget be up by over in the past year and will reach £ in we be also support local authority with financial deficit through the safety valve and deliver better- value programme in most constituency include in the hon lady ’s area the funding have go up by to 35%.[official report   february vol c. 1mc correction

 the hon gentleman make a vital point early identification be absolutely key in provide support and ensure that it impact the child as early as possible i be very happy to understand more about place local authority have make lot of bid and that be why many more special educational need school have be or be be build i announce recently although i do not know whether his local area bid into they we have many scheme to ensure that local authority have financing to improve the number of place in mainstream school and special educational need school

 worcestershire county council have some welcome plan to set up a new autism free school in malvern recently i visit our place an independent provider in west worcestershire which provide specialist education mainly for child with autism be it the secretary of state ’s understanding that such independent provision would be affect by taxation should the opposition bring in a tax on independent school across this country 
 my hon friend make a very good point there be independent school across our country many of which provide special educational need support and excellent education in particular specialty if those school be subject to increase taxation that would make provision more difficult we will have to assess what that would mean 
 a number of colleague have mention initial teacher training perhaps they and the secretary of state should look no far than tomorrow when my minute rule bill come before parliament a bill that aim to increase and ensure there be autism training for all teacher will the secretary of state back it

 what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of change to visa fee and condition on the number of application for postgraduate research 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of change to visa fee and condition on the number of application for postgraduate research 
 our visa change strike the right balance ensure we have a fair and robust migration policy but maintain the uk ’s place as a top destination for the good and bright from around the world the hon and learn lady will be pleased to know that we continue to attract the good scientist from across the world we have over postgraduate research student from overseas of the total produce groundbreaking and collaborative research 
 i thank the minister for his answer but i be afraid the evidence do not entirely bear out what he be say because ucas figure reveal a notable fall in accept application from international student both heriot watt and edinburgh napier university in my constituency of edinburgh south west be highly seek after destination for international phd student both carry out vital scientific research with strong link to commercial and industrial need not just in scotland but across the united kingdom and indeed across europe and the world but the government ’s visa rule be make those university far less attractive destination for international student be   the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman the former science minister not right when he say that the uk 
 will never be a science superpower behind a visa paywall 
 i know that the hon and learn lady be a stickler for datum our target be for over international student every year and we be well over that target as i say our visa change strike the right balance be fair to the taxpayer while ensure that we have good international student come to our country 
 the minimum salary requirement for a skilled worker visa be set to increase by from £ to £ jeopardise the prospect of early career researcher and academic come to the uk can the minister answer the question from my hon and learn friend   the member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry   that he do not answer how will the uk be a science superpower behind that visa paywall 
 i think i have set that out we have of university researcher come from outside the uk and over postgraduate student from overseas—41 of the total what i would say to the   hon gentleman be that the real cost of the snp ’s tuition fee policy be that scottish university be unable to provide place for local student who be less likely to take a place at a university in scotland than english student be to take a place in england 
 will the minister be investigate the discovery expose by the sunday times yesterday of russell group university take student with much low academic qualification for undergraduate degree and when he do so will he check that the same be not happen in the postgraduate field give the much high fee that can be charge for overseas student 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question he will know that while i be a strong supporter of international student i be absolutely clear that i want a level playing field for all domestic student as well i meet vice chancellor only yesterday afternoon as soon i have see the report in the sunday times and i have ask the department for education to carry out an urgent investigation into bad practice by agent where it occur as i be very disturb by what i see we want absolute fairness of entry for domestic student as much as for international student 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i listen to the minister ’s response to   the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry but in december i be also assure by the minister that he be commit to the target of international student however recent research from idp have find of its august and september applicant to study in the uk would consider change their study destination if post study work visa length be shorten what be his assessment of the impact that any change to the postgraduate work visa could have on the international education strategy and the sustainability of the sector 
 the hon gentleman the opposition spokesman know that visa matter be for the home office the migration advisory committee be look at the postgraduate international student visa route and will come to its conclusion however as i keep say to he our target be for over international student a year and we have well surpass that 
 what step she be take to tackle persistent pupil absence in school 
 what step she be take to tackle persistent pupil absence in school 
 tackle persistent absence be my top priority as indeed it be last year i pay tribute to our incredible teacher and head who have go above and beyond to get child back to school we be more than double the number of attendance hub to support school we be invest £ to expand to mentoring   to help child and we will be require all school to share datum to support early intervention our plan be start to work with few child persistently absent or not attend last year and number continue to fall 
 but by child in manchester in tameside and in stockport be set to miss half their time at school if current trend continue labour have a plan to fix this crisis back by sir kevan collins the government ’s own former education recovery commissioner if this be the secretary of state ’s top priority why be her plan not work 
 it be work it be not go to stick on the trajectory because we have already turn around the trajectory since the pandemic it be already fall in england there be no well example of the labour party have no plan and just snip from the sideline than on the question of attendance i suggest that labour members look at other country around the world because this be a global phenomenon we have daily datum that be almost unique which be why we be now reduce the figure if we look at wales labour run wales we see that attendance in school be much bad at nearly day low per pupil 
 the secretary of state say that keep child in school be her top priority but since persistent absence in newcastle have more than double and severe absence be up she say it be a global phenomenon but what matter be what happen in school in newcastle labour ’s plan for school be support by sir kevan collins why will she not support it what be she go to do about this because we need to see change now 
 the hon lady may have mix up a couple of thing there but the plan to get child back into school be to have daily attendance datum which we introduce and send out to every local authority some local authority do not perform as well perhaps the hon lady ’s be of those but we send out daily datum so that they can identify exactly where the school be we be work with attendance hub which we be introduce across the country for individual to attention we have attendance mentor we have a national campaign and a cross government action alliance all of which have mean that england have a absence rate compare with in wales and it be much high in most country around the world we have a plan and we be deliver on it 
 i work as a teacher and as head of year with overall responsibility for school attendance labour members seem to forget that there be also a role for parental responsibility in all of this in my time i encounter a large cohort of parent who find that it be still cheap to pay the fine they be give and save the money by go on holiday during term time be it not time to ramp up the cost of fine for parent who choose needlessly to withdraw their child from their education harm the child ’s outcome 
 every moment matter in school and we have improve and increase our school standard the most important thing be that child be now   there thank to our datum we can now see pattern and those who be take a week off outside term time or those who perhaps have a pattern of behaviour of take particular day off we can go into the datum we be about the only country in the world that can do that so we be uniquely position to tackle the problem we can go down into the datum and work at school level and local authority level to ensure that we put into action everything we can to improve attendance 
 attendance matter and we know that some school and local authority have high attendance rate than other that be why the education committee the children ’s commissioners and other all say that their top priority be to ensure that all school and local authority follow good practice guideline my private member ’s bill the school attendance duty of local authorities and proprietors of schools bill will make that mandatory i know that the government support it so will the secretary of state take the opportunity to ensure that all colleague across the house back the bill and no object to it on reading this friday so that we can make good practice mandatory and get our kid back to school 
 i thank my right hon friend for all her work in this area she be right the thing to do be ensure that we understand good practice and that it be roll out everywhere a lot of work be be do in that area i very much appreciate the initiative that she have introduce and i urge colleague across the house to support her endeavour 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the million of child persistently absent from school be a national scandal yet last week government mp join together to vote against labour ’s long term plan to deal with that issue put party above country and child so far the government have only announce stick plaster policy will the secretary of state come forward with a long term plan to address that properly or do school and family have to wait for a labour government to finally give all child the education they deserve 
 certainly not under a labour government school standard would plummet back to where they be the last time labour have education under their control—27th in the world for math and for english if i remember correctly standard fall under labour and it have absolutely no plan to get child back into school as i say this government have uniquely put in place daily datum to enable we to get down and implement lot of different plan we be also plan to legislate for child who be not in school which i think be about the only thing labour actually put in its plan we be committed to do that and we warmly welcome the private member ’s bill from my hon friend   the member for meon valley mrs drummond the child not in school registers support and orders bill and look forward to work with she when it progress to read on   march i urge all hon member to support the bill 
 what step she be take to support school with decrease pupil roll 
 i recognise the challenge from fall roll when there be demographic change that be why we be change how the growth and fall roll funding be allocate to local authority it be now base on decrease as well as increase in pupil number we be also give great flexibility to allocate funding to meet the revenue cost of reduce surplus place 
 i thank the minister for that reply decline school roll in london be a big issue that i have raise in the house on a number of occasion we be see family with young child be drive out of london because of the affordability of housing and the cost of living crisis and a new report out today by london councils show that the situation be get even bad in lambeth we be see a drop in demand for reception place over the next year archbishop tenison ’s school opposite the oval cricket ground in my constituency close last year we need urgent action from the government the fall roll funding be help but that be just for the short term will the minister look at how we can protect our vital education asset will the government finally address the cost of living crisis 
 it be true that a period of change be come as the bulge in primary school number start to move into secondary school and it be important to plan ahead for that we want to work with local authority and i know that the hon member ’s local authority lambeth be be proactive in look at amalgamation where necessary we also have pupil place planning adviser in each region work with local authority and academy trust and school resource management adviser work directly with school there will also be some repurposing of some space in school i be not speak specifically about her constituency with opportunity for more early year provision in some case and more special educational need provision we will have to be agile and ensure that there be still sufficient space for parental choice 
 as the secretary of state know we share a local authority when it come to calculate demand for secondary school place west sussex get a d minus of my district be oversubscribed and last year more than child almost all from school be take out of district to a school that none of they have apply for and some of they have not hear of next year it could be even bad despite help from my noble friend baroness barran and the regional school commissioner west sussex have still do absolutely nothing to address the shortage of secondary school place will the minister intervene 
 as i say to   the hon member for vauxhall florence eshalomi it be true that there be change as number move from primary into secondary   and it be important to try to plan ahead on the specific of west sussex i will be pleased to meet my hon friend to discuss it far 
 what step her department be take to increase school attendance 
 what step her department be take to increase school attendance 
 attendance do decline through covid it be now improve but there be a lot more to do we be expand attendance hub to support nearly school and we have launch the moment matter campaign to remind parent of the importance of every single day in school 
 in hartlepool we have see a rise number of parent and guardian opt for home school education as of november that number have increase to more than triple in year in addition we have a huge number of child who simply do not turn up at school will my right hon friend please share the step that he be take alongside hartlepool borough council to ensure that those child be receive a fair and decent education 
 i will local authority have duty towards those child to ensure that all be receive a suitable education and act if not the consultation we hold on revise guidance to help fulfil that responsibility recently close and we will publish the response in due course we remain committed to legislation as my right hon friend   the member for chelmsford vicky ford   say to create statutory register of child not in school in order to help local authority identify those eligible child 
 i know from speak to school in wimbledon that access to mental health support can get pupil back into school or keep they in school what plan do the department have to roll out more access to that mental health support so that we can see that trend increase 
 of course there be multiple layer to mental health support the mental health support team programme which we be roll out gradually across the country continue to expand at the end of march of pupil in school or further education be cover by that include at secondary when the figure for this year come out i expect they to be high unlike the opposition we be put mental health support not only into secondary school but into primary school where it can make a big difference 
 the reality for mental health support team in school be that funding be not guarantee beyond and the coverage be patchy early this month i hear about a teenager in a secondary school in my constituency who have not attend for month because of mental ill health the school be convince that if there be dedicate qualified mental   health practitioner in secondary and primary school attendance would improve will the minister back my minute rule bill to commit to exactly that duty to be pay for by treble the tax on social medium company which so often be at the root of those problem 
 the hon member identify important problem there be important link between mental ill health prevalence and non attendance we will see benefit from the offer to all state school and college of a grant to train a senior mental health lead as well as the wide mental health support team that i mention 
 early intervention be key we need to look at what more can be do at primary school level because although not entirely often the sign be already there by the time child get to secondary school could the minister say more on that the transition from primary to secondary be also key and we need to look at that 
 the hon gentleman be entirely correct it be important to consider the role of mental health in primary as well as secondary school we put mental health education on the curriculum through relationship sex and health education and we be invest in the mental health support team that i mention as well as the training grant of course some school do the transition from primary to secondary very well it can be an unsettling time for child but also an exciting and it be important that we maximise those benefit there be a lot of good practice out there 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 in england school attendance be impact by off rolling a practice that do not exist in scotland now we hear in a report that school be actively remove gcse student not for any behavioural issue but because they be struggle academically and the school want to protect its place in the league table what step be the minister take to address what the centre for social justice have call 
 a system which effectively reward school for exit academically underperform student 
 let i be abundantly clear off roll remove a pupil from a school without use a permanent exclusion be unacceptable and unlawful that be in the ofsted framework and it be strengthen in the revise framework that come out in to look at that that can be see in ofsted ’s report it be also look at by the teacher regulation agency we must be abundantly clear that be involve in off rolling be not consistent with the conduct we expect of a teacher in serious case it could result in action 
 what recent estimate she have make of the number of school place available for pupil with special educational need in gloucestershire 
 place for pupil with special educational need and disability have increase in gloucestershire since we estimate that there be place and the local authority open additional setting in 
 at the moment pupil have be assess as need special school place but those place be not available over the next couple of year it look like at least more special school place will be need in gloucestershire can the minister look at the situation urgently to see what he can do to help 
 we be work closely with local authority on this issue we have allocate more than £ of high need capital allocation in the last year for local authority to create additional place gloucestershire county council have announce a place moderate and additional learn difficulty school for to year old to be deliver through our free school presumption route in early 
 there be only specialist school provide by the state in shropshire of they be 
 order the supplementary question should relate to the question on the order paper 
 just as in gloucestershire we be short of specialist school of our be rat as inadequate and need improve the most vulnerable child be unable to go to school because need be not be meet will the minister look at what can be do in shropshire to provide place for the most seriously affect child 
 in addition to work with gloucestershire we work with shropshire on its capacity we have already announce new special free school with a further in the pipeline 
 whether she have have recent discussion with her counterpart in the devolved administration on the potential merit of provide additional financial support for school pupil in the context of increase in the cost of living 
 i agree that give all that the uk have in common it be vital that we talk about policy issue frequently include on devolved matter the uk education ministers council last meet in june last year when it be host by my right hon friend the secretary of state in liverpool i understand it be for the scottish government to issue the invitation for the next we await their missive with anticipation 
 expand free school meal have a direct impact on child ’s health promote cognitive development and improve test score and concentration the scottish government be roll out universal free school meal for primary school child what additional   financial effort will the minister make to address educational inequality such as support and follow the example of the scottish government to improve outcome for all pupil 
 we await the scottish government ’s full programme but i will say that in recognition of the benefit of free school meal and target they where they can have most effect in every pupil in england be now eligible for free school meal compare with in when labour be in government 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 to be clear the uk government will not even extend free school meal to child in household receive universal credit speak in parliament week ago the children ’s commissioner for england urge the uk government to expand free school meal say that child with an empty belly can not learn when will this government follow scotland ’s lead in address child poverty by roll out free school meal to all primary school child 
 we have extend eligibility for free school meal on occasion mainly with universal infant free school meal the extension of further education student and most recently by extend the protection for people in transition on universal credit i say gently to the hon lady that we think it be important to target free school meal but that it be just as important for child in secondary school as in primary 
 what step she be take to improve early year education 
 this government be roll out the large expansion of childcare in england ’s history double the amount we spend now this will enable more child to benefit from high quality early year education and childcare more of the time build strong foundation for every child and enable more parent to work 
 why have it take year for the government to get around to have a plan they get rid of child ’s centre and sure start centre and they have not replace they with anything until now now we see chaos people can not get the code they do not know what money they be get from local government the national day nurseries association say it be a mess what be the minister go to do to clear up this mess 
 there be a lot in that question on the sure start point we be roll out family hub which will be a lot broad than the sure start centre be and will cover child with special educational need up to the age of as for the code issue as the hon gentleman will already know we have work with his majesty ’s revenue and customs to provide a solution to that issue for all parent so that no parent will miss out as a result 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 i very much welcome the fact that this government be double investment in early year and childcare as the secretary of state say early with regard to special educational need early identification of need be absolutely key from that perspective will the minister meet i to discuss the urgent need for a specialist assessment centre in worcester after the loss of the in fort royal it have go out for commission but unfortunately we have not have any bid to host the new and we need to get on with deliver for next september 
 i do not know the detail of my hon friend ’s specific case but i would be delighted to meet he to discuss it far 
 i call the shadow minister 
 with just over month to go until the start of the expand offer for year old the government ’s plan for early year education and childcare be in complete chaos with nursery and childminder across the country still wait to have their funding rate for april confirm how can the minister expect provider to confirm place with parent when they do not even know what they will be pay do he agree with the chief executive of the early years alliance that this be yet another example from this government of announce and do the thinking afterwards 
 i think the hon lady know that the reason provider do not have their rate at the moment be that local authority have not inform they of their rate we publish the rate in november and it be up to local authority to tell their provider where they do not have those rate that be the reason it be yet another example of where the labour party hop that if it snip enough from the sideline no will notice that it have no plan whatever for childcare 
 what step her department be take to increase the availability of mental health support in secondary school 
 we be roll out mental health support team to school and college support young people to access early intervention for mental health as my right hon friend the minister for schools say as of march there be team cover of secondary school pupil that will increase to around team by spring 
 when i be a young person we have a counsellor in our school it help many people not for the long term but through short term intervention that put people on the right track and mean that they do not need more expensive intervention down the line unfortunately those counsellor have go in many school labour will reintroduce they will the minister commit to reintroduce a counsellor in every school to ensure that we spend now to save later 
 counsellor have a role but we believe that a combination of roll out mental health support team and give every state school and college in the country a grant to train a senior mental health lead be a well approach to take 
 what step her department be take to encourage the take up of degree level apprenticeship 
 the government have build of the most powerful apprenticeship system in the world reach nearly different occupation from level through to master ’s degree level it be great that there have be over start since there be now over employer design degree level apprenticeship available include for occupation such as medical doctor space engineer midwive social worker pretty much whatever we be provide an additional £ in the next financial year to support provider in expand their offer to make sure more people can access they 
 the conservatives have transform apprenticeship since with local education provider employer and bexley council all help to make bexley of the top borough in london for apprenticeship do the secretary of state agree with i that apprenticeship have a key role to play in our economy and in social mobility and that while labour want to focus on teach divisive idea such as white privilege in school the conservatives want to support people from all background to get on in life 
 i could not agree more with my hon friend bexley ’s apprenticeship event on   february   will be a fantastic opportunity for local people to learn about the apprenticeship on offer in his constituency we have transform our apprenticeship system people around the world look at we and say how on earth have you do that i be very happy to work with anybody but all that be at risk the labour party would halve the number of apprenticeship take we back to square 
 sadly the government do not intervene to save cumbria ’s agricultural college however will they decide to invest in agricultural degree apprenticeship work with the university of cumbria and cumbria ’s further education college to make sure we have a pipeline of new leader who can feed we and care for our environment through farming

 i call the shadow minister 
 next week be national apprenticeship week and i look forward to celebrate apprenticeship across the country as the secretary of state know small and medium sized enterprise be crucial to deliver high quality apprenticeship at every level throughout our economy but the number of sme apprenticeship have plummet by since and research show that the levy be fail to reverse the decline in employer train more widely the secretary of state pretend that everything be fine but be not the real answer to back our business give they great flexibility to enable they to deliver the training that we need to get our economy grow again 
 absolutely obviously reason for the reduction in some of the sme number be the fact that we make improvement to ensure that every single apprenticeship be of high quality i want to make sure that all young people who embark on an apprenticeship as i do put their trust in the system and get what they deserve we have remove the limit on cap on sme and we be work on reduce the number of step to make it easy for they to access the system we be also look at what more we can do we be focus on a number of way in which to ensure that apprenticeship work well for sme which account for of employment.[official report   february vol c. 4mc correction 
 what step she be take to increase the funding allocate to the f40 local education authority 
 we be commit to fund all school fairly and equitably wherever they be the national funding formula replace an unjust system whereby school receive different level of funding for no reason 
 it be welcome that funding for all school have rise but do the minister accept that there be deprivation in market town and village where transport cost be high and that the difference between the sum for the highest funded local authority and those for the low fund such as central bedfordshire be thousand of pound per child what can he do to close the gap more quickly 
 my hon friend be right about the importance of deprivation factor and indeed transport cost we be increase the amount under the formula that relate to deprivation and there be also the sparsity factor of course all school be benefit from increase in funding which will total £ in 
 when it come to the funding of school should not the government just follow the money amber infrastructure which own newman college in chadderton have pay out £ of shareholder dividend during the time for which it have own that pfi school the heating system do not work the roof be leak which be affect classroom and now temporary classroom must be build to accommodate the pupil will the government intervene and point out to the provider that if the money be there to be take in dividend it be there to fix a roof as well 
 i would be happy to follow up the matter of the private finance initiative contract at that college and perhaps have some discussion with my right hon friend the minister for skills apprenticeships and higher education 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 as be mention by   the hon member for feltham and heston seema malhotra next week be national apprenticeship week when i do my apprenticeship i benefit from brilliant training and opportunity thank to general motors which get i where i be today and i want to spread those opportunity to everyone everywhere

 i look forward to fact check ’s assessment of the secretary of state ’s comment give that child in hull be wait more than week for their mental health appointment be it pride or inattentiveness that prevent the secretary of state from adopt labour ’s plan for a mental health professional in every school 
 if i may fact check the hon lady i think that the plan be for a mental health professional in every secondary school the plan that we have be to introduce mental health support team in every primary and secondary school as usual our plan on which we be deliver be well think through cover more people and solve the problem that they be intend to solve

 as the hon lady know we have be work closely with st leonard ’s school and actually with all school that be impact by raac i would like to take this moment to thank the headteacher and all the teacher who have do an amazing job to keep of child in face to face education we have speak to the award body they have be work with school and have offer some support in term of assessment and make sure that they can look at what more need to be do but exam be there to assess

 it ’ not our fault always seem to be this government ’s catchphrase and now it apply to childcare too it be not the secretary of state ’s fault but that of local authority it be not her responsibility to deliver on her government ’s own pledge even her own civil servant be say that some parent just will not get their place do she agree with the children ’s minister that no parent will lose out will she give that guarantee to the house today yes or no 
 i be glad that the hon lady have ask about childcare because it be yet another illustration of how this conservative government be deliver for work parent while the labour party still do not have a plan i know what it take to deliver complex project i have deliver many over decade work in industry all around the world give the hon lady ’s limited experience outside politic she should focus on not play party politic and deliver for hard work parent

 we be invest very heavily in breakfast club this be another area in which we think that target support matter that include secondary school not just primary school as the labour party suggest 
 be it not a disgrace that young child be tell to cover up their badge so that people do not know which school they attend and be tell to remove outward sign that they be jewish security be provide once they get to school but what will my right hon friend do to make sure that child be educate on the evil of antisemitism so that we spread this message across all school rather than just jewish school

 each year student have to apply for the ture international mobility scheme before the easter deadline but those from widen participation background need to know that they have the money before they apply and university be get confirmation of funding some month later in june and july i be sure the secretary of state will agree that ture should be open to all so will she press treasury colleague for a multi year funding settlement 
 i have enormous respect for the hon gentleman and i listen carefully to what he say we be work to smooth out any issue with the ture scheme however it be worth note that we have increase the proportion of disadvantaged student take part in it from to i be proud that we be embed social justice in the scheme

 we want to see school not exclude child where that be at all possible there be no right number for exclusion they have to be determine in the light of the circumstance at the school but we expect people to look at the matter as a whole i will of course be happy to talk to the hon lady 
 i thank the secretary of state for her early answer about raac will she give priority for a complete rebuild to st edward ’s catholic academy in my constituency follow the adjudication that more than of it be affect by raac can the plan start very soon please 
 yes i can give an assurance that we be go through all the detail and assess each instance on a case by case basis i know that all hon member be keen to know what will happen and they will have the answer very shortly 
 the change in the visa rule for international student and their dependant be have a significant impact not only on the number of student come to university such as the university of york a russell group university but on these university finance university will have   to make significant cut if this visa programme reach fruition will the minister meet vice chancellor and the home office together to talk about the impact this be have 
 we have regular conversation with vice chancellor and the home office on this issue however as i say our target have be more than student and we have well surpass that and of university researcher come from outside the uk we have a proud record on international student and that will continue 
 st peter ’s church of england primary school in budleigh salterton be an excellent school but it be be let down by temporary classroom that be way past their good temporary classroom should be just that temporary not a permanent solution far to my letter which be wind its way through the department will my right hon friend meet i to discuss this matter far

 we have very regular conversation with the department for levelling up housing and communities on that issue as part of our stable home build on love reform to transform the child ’s social care system and we take strict action where local authority be not meet the requirement 
 bournemouth christchurch and poole council be bizarrely take parent to court to challenge their legal right to secure special educational support for their child with the council lose of those case and this cost £ every month will the secretary of state join i in ask the council to think again will she agree to meet i to discuss special educational need provision for bournemouth 
 my right hon friend make an important point we be concern by any local authority spend too much money take parent to court child need to get the right support in the right setting at the right time and i would be happy to have a discussion with he about that 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make a statement on the removal of henry staunton as post office ltd chair and wide governance issue within the organisation 
 follow a conversation with the secretary of state for business and trade over the weekend henry staunton agree to step down as chairman of the post office an interim chair will be appoint shortly and a recruitment process for a new chair will be launch in due course in accordance with the governance code for public appointment i will update the house when we have further detail 
 the current chairmanship be not prove effective and we have a difficult decision change course or wait and hope that it improve give the challenging context for the post office and the importance of the role of chair the business secretary take decisive action i understand that member would like more detail around the decision especially consider that the post office be rightly under heighten scrutiny at this time i can confirm that there be issue beyond the handling of the horizon scandal but as hon member would expect i be not able to comment on the specific of individual human resource case 
 as the business secretary have say post office governance be a priority for the government the post office be a public corporation as such the post office board have responsibility for the strategic direction of the company while there be a clear need for new leadership of the board we continue to have confidence in the other board member who be experience executive with a range of business expertise across the legal financial insurance asset management and pension sector there be elect postmaster non executive director too 
 the post office face unprecedented challenge it need to work at pace to deliver compensation to the thousand of postmaster who fall victim to a faulty it system as well as to continue the essential work to implement the necessary operational and cultural change need in the business as such strong and effective leadership of post office ltd be a necessity 
 i thank the minister for his response it be concern that the secretary of state ’s move towards clarity and well governance at post office ltd begin with the government be on a different page from post office ltd on whether staunton be fire or leave by mutual consent will the minister clarify that be it possible that mr staunton be be make a scapegoat to take the heat away from this government and those who come before the government be the sole shareholder in post office ltd 
 back in july the minister for enterprise markets and small business say in a debate on pol ’s management culture 
 through the shareholder ’s representative on the board the government oversee the post office ’s corporate governance strategy performance and stewardship of its financial and other resource ”—[official report   july vol c. 180wh 
 that be not the same as the chairperson be the government satisfied that the uk government investments board representative have adequately fulfil his oversight role indeed have tom cooper who stand down in may be replace that be not clear from post office ltd ’s website 
 it be clear that the governance model simply have not work the arm ’s length approach use by successive government have allow scandal after scandal to fester the post office network be in disarray financial redress to postmaster be far too slow and in some case wholly inadequate the remuneration package for sub postmaster mean that many be work for below the minimum wage and service be continuously be strip away do the minister have confidence that the removal of mr staunton will speed up financial redress for victim and bring about change in the management culture of post office ltd 
 back in july mr staunton appear in front of the business and trade committee over the bonusgate scandal in a debate at the same time i ask the minister if he have confidence in the current management of post office ltd. i receive no meaningful answer so have it take a tv drama for the government to take action how be that acceptable 
 i thank the hon lady for her work the all party parliamentary group on post office do a tremendous job the phrase use in the statement be mutual consent but it be fair to say that the government exercise their right to remove the chairman the hon lady can deduce from that what she will this be not a case of allocate responsibility for the past problem of the post office we be simply say that we need new leadership go forward there be specific circumstance around the chairman that mean that we feel that he be not the right person to lead the organisation of the board at this time 
 the shareholder representative on ukgi as the hon lady be right to say be not the chair it be tom cooper but be now lorna gratton do i have confidence in she yes i do i meet she regularly and have a high degree of confidence in she 
 compensation be too slow we accept that a number of measure be introduce prior to the tv drama as the hon lady put it include the fix sum award of £ for overturn conviction we have also introduce a fix sum award for the group litigation order to expedite compensation that be something on which i be absolutely focused on a daily basis 
 i accept what the hon lady say about the remuneration of sub postmaster around the country part of that of course be about consumer habit where we shop on the high street we be keen to identify new source of revenue include through the banking framework which be a potential lucrative opportunity and parcel hub 
 on the issue of confidence in the individual let i say that have be a board director myself for year you be only as good as your last game so it be fair to say that at this point in time we do not feel that henry staunton be the right person to lead the board 
 give the government ’s role as the sole shareholder in the post office and the associate liability and responsibility that go with   that when will the secretary of state for business and trade make public all the associate paper relate to horizon and this entire scandal so that the victim as well as the country can see where the responsibility for all this lie by do so the government will be able to take the right kind of action and support the victim as they seek compensation 
 i thank my right hon friend for her question and the work that she have do on this we set up the inquiry in to undertake that work those document be public and subject to public scrutiny she may have watch some of the inquiry session which be very revealing about some of the conduct that happen at the post office that inquiry be due to conclude by the end of this year and then report probably sometime next year we will have a much clear understanding then of who be responsible and as be often say at this dispatch box that be the time to hold those individual to account 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the post office horizon scandal be of the most insidious injustice in our country it have rob innocent people of their livelihood their liberty and all too sadly their life at least postmaster have die without see justice or receive compensation and at least have take their life year on sub postmaster and their family be still suffer from the consequence and the trauma of all that they have be put through 
 the scale of the scandal be so vast that get the right leadership in place at the post office be of paramount importance however to decide to eject the chair during the weekend with no real opportunity to get the detail of the decision on the public record be unusual to say the least people need to know that remove henry staunton be a substantive evidence base decision if we be to have confidence in that decision can the minister assure we that this decision be indeed substantive and not just the result of a personal fall out between mr staunton and the secretary of state 
 the minister have talk about set a timeline in due course for replace mr staunton in the context of what have happen in the horizon scandal and the big challenge face the post office strong leadership be vital at this point in the process i hope that he will be able to share as quickly as possible further information about the timeline and when the post will be fill 
 what confidence can the minister provide that this change will lead to the wholesale culture change that be desperately need to make sure that this never happen again mr staunton be not in the post office during the horizon scandal he have only serve in the position since and this scandal have never be about the action of single individual 
 finally the priority for we all in this house be the fast track exoneration of all remain conviction and the delivery of rightful redress or compensation to all the affected sub postmaster as quickly as possible will the minister provide an update on when we will see more progress on those matter to make sure that we take urgent step to fix the seismic damage of this scandal 
 it certainly be not something that we want to do on a weekend there be a chance that it would come into the public domain by other mean which be why a conversation have to take place over the weekend we do not think that it would be right for the individual to hear about the potential course of action by other mean than the secretary of state speak to he i think that be the right thing to do i do not know why the hon lady would feel or whether she any evidence that there be some kind of fall out as she put it this be about very serious governance issue relate to the person who head the board of the organisation which be obviously confidential human resource issue 
 on the timeline to replace mr staunton as i say we will do so as quickly as possible we be look at recommendation as we speak and we will report back to the house as soon as possible on an interim and a permanent replacement this be not about hold somebody responsible for past problem in the post office it be about the governance of the post office go forward that be why a mutual agreement take place for mr staunton to step down 
 we be work at pace to deliver the blanket overturning of conviction we be keen to update the house as quickly as possible and should do so in the come day 
 as a member of the business and trade committee i be deeply concerned by the inability of mr read the chief executive officer of post office ltd to answer an array of very simple question in fact he appear not even to have do his basic homework when it come to look back at the horizon scandal although he be not the ceo at the time of the scandal what confidence do the government have in mr read as chief executive officer to turn it around and have he yet make public the board minute that show when the matter be bring to the board ’s attention for the very time if any board member be complicit in hear that information and not act upon it what step will the government take with lawyer to ensure that they be hold accountable 
 i thank my hon friend for his work on the select committee i be present for his line of question during that session the chief executive commit to provide response to the committee i be not sure whether they have be provide thus far a number of question need to be address and it be right that those answer be provide as far as the government be concern our primary mean of achieve that be through the inquiry which be hear important evidence right now and will conclude its work by the end of the year and report shortly afterwards 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 surely if ever there be a time to consider remove mr staunton from his post it be after it emerge last year that bonus be be pay to post office executive simply for do what i think we would all expect they to co operate fully with the horizon inquiry i think that people will be forgive for have the suspicion that when it come to horizon ministers have be a bit like the japanese moon lander suddenly burst to life as soon as a bit of light be shine on they in this case by an itv programme 
 i have question fujitsu ’s representative tell the business and trade committee a fortnight ago that fujitsu have a moral obligation to contribute to the financial redress for the victim have the secretary of state have any discussion yet with fujitsu about how and when that might happen as well as about the size of the contribution that it might make secondly with regard to the continue unexplained shortfall in horizon will the government commit to reveal how much in excess the post office claim back from staff resort to forensic accountancy if require 
 the bonus be return voluntarily by anybody who receive they for that sub metric and the chief executive return his bonus from across the entire inquiry 
 on the point about the government pick up the pace because of the itv drama i would say a couple of thing we be put a number of measure in place already we have put in place the horizon compensation advisory board which have lord arbuthnot as of its key member a fix sum award be introduce last autumn we be look at advice on overturn conviction thing be happen at pace in this area prior to the dramatisation but of course we be public servant and member of the public of course we want to expedite thing and the impetus behind they be at a raise level because of the public outcry 
 conversation be ongoing with fujitsu in my view the good point to negotiate be when we have all the evidence at our disposal which will not be until the inquiry conclude we welcome the fact that the company have take and accept some moral responsibility to contribute towards the compensation and we will take it at its word but negotiate at the right point be the right way to deal with that 
 the question of any excess money that come back from postmaster effectively into post office account be an important which we be ask now and we hope to get answer in the near future 
 i speak recently to a couple of my constituent whose parent be wrong by the post office horizon scandal now they be be ask to provide invoice from more than year ago to prove that they buy the horizon system record the post office itself admit it do not keep do my hon friend agree that it be right that we focus on those who have be wrong and that the benefit of the doubt must be with those postmaster who be completely wrong 
 that be absolutely right it should not be the case that a postmaster have to evidence a document that do not exist the benefit of the doubt should be with the postmaster of course it be fair to ask do you have documentation to support any claim you be make but if the evidence be not there the benefit of the doubt should be with the postmaster 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 leave the post office rudderless now when people be literally die before they get redress be not a situation we can put up with the key question for the minister be this   where be the bill to expedite redress for those who be wrongfully convict will he commit this afternoon finally to make sure that we have pre legislative scrutiny of that bill so that it be as strong as it can be and will he commit to a hard deadline enshrine in law in the bill to make sure the payment be make as rapidly as possible frankly mr bates and the other sub postmaster who have be wrong for so long should not be make to wait a moment long 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question but i do not accept his premise that the post office be rudderless the chief executive be still there and i speak to he a few moment ago prior to the urgent question as i have say we be look to appoint an interim chair as soon as possible and a permanent replacement shortly after that and meanwhile the daily work of the board will continue 
 on our commitment to overturn conviction on a blanket basis i appreciate the right hon gentleman ’s previous constructive collaboration and engagement with our department and i hope that continue i be keen to engage with he on our approach these be legal matter that need to be consider carefully and we have a number of meeting last week on this very issue so i be keen to engage with he but in a way that do not slow down the process of bring the legislation forward he will find we contact he and knock at his door in the come day to talk about how we will go forward with that legislation 
 i should point out that mr bates ’s compensation be not relate to the overturning of conviction because he be never convict that be not what be get in the way of mr bates ’s compensation although it be get in the way for something like other people and we be keen to resolve that as quickly as possible 
 will my hon friend take this opportunity to look at the post office ’s report practice under the former chairman of make payment of just £ under the horizon shortfall scheme for distress and inconvenience to people it falsely accuse of theft when a similar claim make at an employment tribunal in the most exceptional case be time that amount 
 to be clear those scheme be run independently of the post office there be independent process all the way through and an independent panel assess the loss i think my hon friend be talk about the horizon shortfall scheme but it be clear that any tariff that might go with payment be not a ceiling they tend to be a floor people should of course be fully compensate for both their financial and their non pecuniary loss that be a principle we have adhere to all the way through the process we be look at the recommendation of the advisory board on how to make sure people who have be through those scheme have receive fair payment in the group litigation order scheme there will effectively be a minimum £ fix sum award we be keen to ensure not only that we get the money out of the door but that that compensation be fair and see to be fair 
 the post office bully threaten and lie to sub postmaster and as we have hear there be huge frustration that throughout the entire compensation process it have try to minimise   payment or use extra long and complex form to avoid make payment to they be the minister confident that the compensation programme be truly independent and that sub postmaster will get the full and fair payment they deserve 
 i do not accept that premise i do not see any evidence of the compensation scheme try to minimise payment the independent panel for the horizon shortfall scheme include lord garnier for example and or kc very reputable people seek to do the right thing so we must be careful in our rhetoric of course we want to ensure that people get their full and fair compensation that be why we implement the horizon compensation advisory board which include lord arbuthnot   the right hon member for north durham mr jones chris hodges and professor moorhead they be decent people who want to ensure that people get treat fairly and full and fair compensation be what people will get 
 clearly in the wake of the horizon scandal there be a need for massive change in the culture drive post office management particularly in its relationship with sub postmaster who be after all run private business under contract with not own by the post office will the minister ensure that whoever be appoint chairman commit themselves thoroughly to that culture change and if necessary will he change other board member to ensure that we get the change that we all want to see 
 that be a good point in the past the relationship between post office ltd and sub postmaster have not be where it should have be it be important that that change there have be much work on this area manager have be appoint to help build that relationship and some of the past conduct and culture of the post office have change however we know that it need to change far that be the job of the board we need the right leader of the board in order to do that hence the action that we take over the weekend 
 poor leadership and governance of the post office lead to the badly design horizon shortfall scheme which other member have refer to i have to say to the minister that there have be massive under compensation of sub postmaster include my constituent mr pennington for year he be force to find shortfall amount total a possible £ because of the horizon system he and his wife have to use their own saving sell share and even jewellery and remortgage their house twice 
 the stress and worry of find those shortfall over year be immense and mr pennington have a mini stroke shortly after sell the business in because he could not stand pay the shortfall any more yet the horizon shortfall scheme have pay out a paltry £ for those year of stress and worry and have compensate only half the shortfall even the tax top up promise in november have not yet materialise i have write to the minister about that case but what action can he promise now to ensure that my constituent be finally compensate for those year of distress to he and his wife 
 i be very happy to work with the hon lady on that particular case we be clear that people should get full and fair compensation for financial loss and other impact include reputational loss—[interruption i be set out the position as it be of course we be all concerned to hear about people who do not feel that they have be properly compensate that be why we have the horizon compensation advisory board on which lord arbuthnot sit and to which i have refer a number of time we be keen to ensure that all those people get and can see that they have get fair compensation we be look at the recommendation for an appeal mechanism for example i be very happy to look at this particular case in that context it be absolutely the case that people should be fully compensate for financial loss and other impact on their life 
 i welcome what my hon friend have say by take this action the government have accept by default that the arm ’s length body model for the post office do not work so will he look again at the structure of post office ltd and will he confirm on the record that the former chairman have leave by mutual consent do not receive or accept any severance payment 
 yes i can confirm that there be no severance payment i do not think it be fair to say that we do not think the arm ’s length model work clearly we have the right to terminate the chair ’s position which be what we have do that be part of the current governance process of course individual be important and have the right individual lead the board be very important we do not think that be the case prior to this weekend which be why we take the action that we do we be very keen to appoint the right person to help make the cultural change within the post office that we all want to see 
 diolch yn fawr llefarydd the effect of the horizon scandal and post office business practice be still hurt our community the post office in nefyn close partly because staff no long trust the computer system which i bet be happen in countless community i have ask the post office to provide an outreach van in nefyn if no business at all be willing to provide that service as appear very likely because i have ask business last week the post office say no will the minister guarantee the people of nefyn that this the old and large town in llyn will again have post service in the town 
 i be very happy to take that point up with the right hon lady and to meet she to discuss it it be very important that our citizen our consumer have confidence in the post office that have certainly be the experience in my patch people have be outrage when there be a closure so the general public definitely have some confidence in the service the horizon system be be replace as far as i know there have never be a case of a customer lose out because of the horizon system but i be very happy to meet the right hon lady to discuss her case in nefyn 
 shepherd ’s bush crown office close in and hammersmith crown office close in after year sub office   in my constituency have be temporarily close for up to year with queue at the remain office stretch around the block at time and a lack of competition thank to multiple bank closure will the minister investigate why post office ltd lack commercial sense as well as integrity 
 i be happy to look into any case that the hon gentleman refer to there be clear set criterion the post office have to maintain branch nationwide and of the population have to be within mile of a post office the post office be maintain its requirement under those criterion but i be very happy to talk to the hon gentleman about the issue of course we be look at how to ensure that the network of individual post office be sustain over the long term with new revenue stream include through the access to cash legislation that the government have put in place and thing like parcel hub we think there be a bright future for the post office but i be very keen to work with the hon gentleman to make sure of that in his particular case 
 i recently raise serious concern with the minister that the uk government be not put enough effort into make sure that post office have a sustainable future something that be of concern before the itv drama shine a light on this issue it be a challenge and i do not feel that i really get an answer so i be come back to the topic again we really need to know that we have a clear proper plan for ensure that there be no further deterioration of the network and to help build it back up people in place like neilston in my constituency whose post office close week ago or clarkston whose post office close on saturday need those service those closure be bill as temporary but they be only temporary if someone have the confidence to take up the opportunity to be a postmaster who would feel that way now what be the minister ’s plan to address the issue and make sure we have post office service for all our community 
 i agree with the hon lady we need sustainable post office and that be about revenue there have be change in consumer habit and business level which have cause difficulty for postmaster as i say the government have legislate for access for cash which be a new opportunity for post office the banking framework deliver more revenue into those post office branch we be keen to see that enhance and for the post office to be more ambitious about that relationship with that money flow straight into the profit and loss account of individual postmaster branch there be many other opportunity include parcel hub and foreign exchange i be happy to discuss the matter offline if that would be helpful 
 the reputational damage to the brand of the post office as a direct consequence of the horizon scandal have be massive as the minister know my constituent della robinson be of the litigant who have their conviction quash a couple of year ago look to the future what be the minister ’s vision for reinvigorate the post office as a great british brand 
 i thank the hon member and i thank della robinson for her work she be of the trailblazer who be so important in get to where we be today and to our get compensation to the people affect as i say in response to early question i believe the post office brand be not damage it be the centre of the post office those who run it from the centre that be damage i think we should all get behind our post office and of course support they wherever we can this be not about the brand itself as i say when i hear about any closure from colleague or in my constituency i know that the local population be oppose to they which identify the high esteem in which people regard their post office i be very happy to have a conversation with the hon member if necessary 
 it have be very concern over the last few day to read that a senior uk government civil servant collude with the post office to shut down the independent investigation by forensic accountant back in and that he do so with the full knowledge of the coalition government now that the metropolitan police be finally investigate possible criminality on the part of the post office and high up employee do the minister agree that they should also be look at the possibility of misfeasance in public office 
 that be certainly of concern to the government as well the inquiry be there to ascertain exactly who do what or who do not do anything when they could have do something the met police will conduct investigation and take forward prosecution wherever they choose that be not something we seek to influence although as i have say from this dispatch box before i would welcome somebody be charge or criminal charge be bring against somebody for what have happen in this horrendous scandal 
 the family member of a terminally ill constituent come to my surgery in corkerhill on friday that person be a shopkeeper in the highland who like so many be catch up with unexplained shortfall in horizon total and although that do not lead to criminal action they pay up to avoid trouble often borrow from other source to do so can the minister tell we whether work will be do to ensure that we know exactly how much in excess the post office claim through all horizon error can he also tell i in general term how he will ensure that those who be terminally ill get the justice and compensation they richly deserve
