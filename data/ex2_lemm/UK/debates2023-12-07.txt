i apologise for not be here early madam deputy speaker 
 fly tipping be the no issue in my constituency will my hon friend join i in praise conservative run harrow council for introduce free bottle waste collection and hour notice of fly tip clear up and indeed increase the number of fine for fly tipping from per year under labour to last year 
 the clerk at the table have inform the house of the unavoidable absence through illness of the speaker from the sitting of the house this week the chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step his department be take to help reduce food waste 
 the uk be an international leader in tackle food waste which have fall by since or the equivalent of kg per person this year over £ will go to our food waste prevention programme and we have a groundbreake industry initiative help to redistribute more food than ever before 
 as i understand it a of all food be waste which contribute around of greenhouse emission and cost our economy about £ a year will the secretary of state consider introduce policy that reduce food waste across the supply chain such as improve food waste report from industry so that we can target measure and act on food waste for the sake not only of our economy but our planet 
 my hon friend raise an extremely important point some of food waste be waste in the home but the courtauld commitment include a groundbreake voluntary agreement with industry that have double the amount of food redistribute in the last year 
 as the secretary of state rightly say if we be go to reduce food waste that start with everybody participate include people at home and retail business in strangford asda tesco and lidl all redistribute food waste to local community group before it go bad and become unpalatable do the secretary of state welcome that it underline the fact that everyone need to participate in the reduction of food waste start with the supermarket people in their house and the government 
 the hon gentleman be right that the issue apply to all party which be why we fund love food hate waste and the food waste action week campaign to raise awareness food waste be down since and we have double the amount of food redistribute since so significant progress have be make but there be more to do and those information campaign play a key role in get that message across 
 question be in the name of bob blackman but i see that he be not present will the minister answer question which be group with it 
 what step his department be take to tackle fly tipping 
 the government ’s fly tipping grant be help council across the country put a stop to fly tipping at hotspot by spend £ on the issue and a furth £ will be award in the spring in july we increase the maximum penalty council can issue from £ to £ from april all income from those penalty will be reinveste in enforcement and clean up fly tipping in local area 
 i welcome the minister to his place fly tipping be a huge problem across north warwickshire and bedworth with thousand of incident every year particularly in rural area where the farming community be leave to bear the brunt of many of the cost we be lucky to have a dedicated rural crime team who do amazing work help to tackle the issue but will the minister give an update on the progress of the national rural crime unit in tackle the scourge on our community 
 i be very happy to pay tribute to the dedicated warwickshire rural crime team which do fantastic work in that area and especially to carol cotterill who lead on it the government be fund a new fly tip post in the national rural crime unit to optimise the role that the police can take in tackle fly tipping in rural area we have also confirm reform to waste carrier registration the introduction of digital waste tracking and the abolition of diy local waste tip 
 do the minister agree that a real problem with fly tipping be skip unscrupulous and dodgy skip company allow their skip to be fill and then mysteriously those skip do not end up in a legitimate place for waste will he look at the new technology we could have i believe that every skip should have a gizmo that track where it come from and where it be go use technology in that way would solve problem and i know that he would get a lot of cross party support for it 
 i will of course always welcome innovation when it come to deal with waste crime the government be already take action on that by award £ to help more than council to purchase equipment specifically to tackle fly tipping   our digital waste tracking system will make it easy for authority to identify waste that do not reach the next stage i will absolutely be happy to meet the hon gentleman if he have any idea on this issue so that we can take they forward 
 angus be the garden of scotland the minister be familiar with angus as we all know but we also have a fly tip blight that be deeply concern for our community farmer do their good to clear up those mess but it be not just commercial fly tipper take an opportunity to make a fast buck other people be avoid proper refuse centre can the minister assure the house that £ be enough the barnettise share of that for scotland do not amount to very much will he redouble those effort let we get a grip on this blight 
 i do know angus very well like i the hon gentleman will be incredibly frustrated when he see fly tipping take place in our beautiful countryside when it come to rural crime we be work with like of the national farmers union our counterpart in scotland and other to share good practice as i have say we have already fund a post within the national crime unit to explore how the police ’s role in tackle fly tipping can be optimise that will specifically help rural area such as angus 
 what step his department be take to reduce level of pmair pollution 
 pm2.5 be the most harmful pollutant for human health our action to date on transport industrial and domestic source have see pm2.5 fall by since this year we go far by set new target to drive down pm2.5 concentrate and the government will deliver on our air quality and net goal by support business to innovate 
 manchester have some of the high air pollution level in the country with thousand of child be see in a&e this year alone because of asthma and the impact of air pollution i recently meet child from st margaret ’s cofe primary school to hear about how they be asthma friendly and do everything they can to reduce air pollution at their school so that all pupil be safe and healthy labour ’s proposal for a clean air act would establish a legal right for everyone to breathe clean air abide by world health organisation clean air guideline why will the government not commit to that 
 it seem to i that no action be be take at the moment by the labour mayor of manchester the government take air pollution incredibly seriously which be why we have award £ to english local authority since to support the delivery of more than local project specifically to tackle air pollution we have also put an additional £ grant to local authority in alone into tackle the negative implication of air quality specifically 
 research show that pm2.5 can be to high in electric version of heavy application such as bus and truck than in their internal combustion engine equivalent do my hon friend agree that in order to get clean air and cut down pm2.5 we need an eclectic future that embrace all technology and our great innovator not just battery electric 
 as i have say i will always welcome innovation when it come to improve air quality not only in transport but in the implication of industry and commercial operator it be clear that through the environment act the government introduce the legally bind target to reduce pm2.5 we have a set goal to reduce exposure to pm2.5 by by 
 i call the shadow minister 
 from bournemouth to bolton hull to newcastle under lyme people be cry out for action to clean our air but the air quality target the minister just mention which be eventually set under the much delay environment act be at twice the world health organisation limit and do not have to be meet until so do he accept the judgment of his government ’s own office for environmental protection that on clean air tory ministers be unambitious and lack the urgency we need 
 this government through our landmark environment act have set key target that we will be deliver on many opposition members do not support all of its measure as for support local authority as i have say we be invest £ to support they in deliver more than project to specifically tackle air pollution and air quality issue 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on help to ensure food security 
 strengthen food security by support world class farmer and food producer be a top priority for this government we produce of the food we consume and food be of the uk ’s critical national infrastructure sector which we regularly discuss with cabinet colleague 
 i recently visit tom a farmer from my constituency at the family farm in pepperstock where we speak about the importance of uk food sustainability grow harvesting and eat domestic produce that be at risk without a well function seasonal worker scheme the national farmers union recommend improve the current scheme by secure it for year with annual review and by increase the visa period to month to cover long harvest do the secretary of state agree that those potential reform could support great food security in the uk and mean less reliance on food import 
 i agree with the hon lady on the importance of food productivity and the sustainability of our farming sector which be why we hold the uk farm to fork summit in may chair by the prime minister where we discuss food security with representative it be also why just in this past week we announce £ to support our farming and rural sector in get innovation to farm and to help with cost such as for solar as part of that investment 
 i welcome my right hon friend to his new role and in particular the experience of negotiate with the european union that he bring to it which will become more and more important in the month ahead i welcome his remark about support the farming industry but i ask he not to forget the seafood industry and its importance in provide food security i be sure he will not as he also know he have an open invite as the new environment secretary to visit my constituency which be a major fishing constituency in the uk while he be there if not before through a virtual meeting will he meet i and member of the seafood industry to discuss the way forward because as much as we welcome the measure announce early this week to tackle abuse of legal migration there be concern as we transition away from freedom of movement 
 obviously i be happy to give a commitment to meet my hon friend to discuss those important issue he will be interested to know that just this week i have a series of meeting with fishing leader to discuss some of the issue include not only the negotiation but the interaction with other area of government not least in respect of the offshore wind sector and the pressure on space we also discuss the work go on in our marine protection zone and how that interact with the fishing industry which i be absolutely committed to support 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i too welcome the new minister the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs   the hon member for keighley robbie moore and the new secretary of state i believe he be the during my time in the shadow environment team the fish our fisher catch be vital to our food security but the recent antic of the maritime and coastguard agency which be in the name of safety implement new medical rule be leave many inshore fisher at their wit end can it really be right that a fisherman in the prime of his work life risk lose his livelihood because he be brave enough a few month ago to admit to a doctor that he feel anxious i do not think it be so will the secretary of state corner his colleague the transport secretary in order to get he to do well than a temporary pause on this and to look urgently at exemption for small boat as other country have sensibly do 
 it be great to have cambridgeshire so well represent on these important issue of fishing and farming the shadow minister raise an important point because there have be concern in the fishing sector the minister for food farming and fisheries and i have be in touch with department for transport   colleague on this issue there have be amendment to the regulation as a result of those discussion which be ongoing however we should not alarm people either and the way that the shadow minister characterise this suggest that someone go to their gp and raise an issue and that prevent they from follow their livelihood be not what the regulation do i recognise that there have be concern in the sector we be look at they closely and follow they up but the situation be not as he characterise it that would cause undue harm to those in the fishing sector 
 post brexit attempt to recruit domestic worker into agricultural job have not manage to fill exist vacancy leave firm unable to produce at pre brexit level new government rule on migration now put the minimum income requirement for immigrant worker far high than the level currently earn by an agricultural worker in the uk in that context what assessment be he and his department making of the impact that his government ’s draconian immigration policy will have on the security of domestic food production and on the cost and availability of food for consumer as they continue to battle the cost of live crisis to put food on their table 
 of course we will work with colleague in the fishing industry to discuss the impact of the home office announcement—[interruption perhaps the hon member would like to hear the answer have ask the question that be part of the discussion that we will have it be worth remind the house that for farming the seasonal agricultural worker scheme be separate and be not part of the announcement from home office colleague this week however there will be question from the fishing industry and we stand ready to work with it on those 
 whether he have have recent discussion with representative of supermarket on their propose change to the red tractor scheme 
 the red tractor assurance scheme be independent and its relationship with food retailer be a commercial matter for it separately the government will launch a review of the fresh produce sector to understand issue relate to fairness in the supply chain it be important that consumer know about the food they buy 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer as he will be aware although farmer in this country want to comply they be a bit concerned that they may be disadvantage compare with foreign producer who do not work to the same standard what assurance can he give to british farmer that he will do everything he can to make sure that supermarket do not disadvantage they 
 i can give my hon friend a very strong assurance on that front support british farmer be my no priority indeed with the minister for food   farming and fisheries in the department we have someone who have a lifetime ’s experience of work as a farmer we should be proud of the red tractor scheme which be know around the world for be a high quality mark of british produce i recognise however that concern have be raise and we will launch a review soon into fairness in the horticulture supply chain but if necessary i will not hesitate to use the power in the relevant act to introduce legislation to tackle contractual unfairness wherever that exist 
 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for energy security and net on the impact of climate change on food price 
 food price depend on a range of factor which have recently include russia ’s war in ukraine and the subsequent energy price rise support our world class farmer and food producer and drive down inflation be top priority for the government 
 i thank the secretary of state for his response the energy and climate intelligence unit report that energy cost and climate change have push up food bill by an average of £ over the past year with climate change drive of that increase we already import £ worth of food from country struggle with extreme weather obviously we want to support those country on an international level with climate adaptation in term of our food security here will the secretary of state review his predecessor ’s decision to secretly scrap the horticulture strategy which could have help domestic grower and make we more resilient to the impact of climate change on food security and food price 
 the hon lady raise an important point about the impact of climate change on food price in the future that be exactly why the government pass the genetic technology precision breeding act to help to unlock innovation and strengthen food security by enable our lead scientist to develop crop that will well resist climate change it be why the government publish the national adaptation programme as recently as july and it be why we have our farming innovation programme with £ of funding which be focus on drive productivity and ensure that there be sustainability in the environmental and farming sector 
 what recent assessment he have make of trend in the level of food price 
 october ’s consumer price index price inflation be down from in september and the low figure since june industry analyst expect food price inflation to continue to decrease and the government be provide an average of £ per household to help with the cost of live this year and next 
 the minister like the secretary of state before he forget to mention of the big driver of food inflation in this country i will give they a clue it start with br and end in exit the reality be that the uk be the only g7 country where food price inflation remain above and the average across oecd country be if this government be not go to follow the snp ’s proposal for price control on food what be they go to do to finally get a grip on increase food price 
 i think the hon gentleman be mistaken if we compare price in the european union with price here in the uk we see that the price of a basket of good here in the uk be substantially low than it be for our friend in the european union if brexit be the problem here surely those price would be high in the uk than they be in the european union i think he be bark up the wrong tree 
 what step he be take to support british food producer 
 the government be commit to support british food producer we be invest £ a year in england ’s farming sector and we will also look to support more grower through the replacement of the fruit and vegetable aid scheme for england in the department for environment food and rural affairs also sponsor small and medium sized enterprise masterclasse to signpost and support those business 
 i thank the minister for his answer have go through a difficult time during covid in which it have to reduce staffing number the oscar mayer factory in my constituency have now take on additional product line and be look to expand and create significant new employment opportunity it use traditional method and fresh ingredient to make healthy and affordable meal option i know it be watch these proceeding and would be delighted if the minister confirm that he will visit the factory in flint to see the huge improvement it have make in change the ready meal sector which have historically be poorly regard 
 the hon gentleman will be surprised to know that i would be delighted to visit a food factory i be also delighted to hear about the success of oscar mayer north wales have a strong food and drink footprint represent by many large and small business should my diary allow i would be delighted to visit i will make sure that my colleague in the wales office also know that they have an open invitation 
 rise 
 question be in the name of sir edward leigh who be not in his place i would be grateful if the secretary of state answer the question as the shadow minister have indicate that he would like to ask a supplementary question 
 what step his department be take to manage waterway to help reduce the risk of flooding 
 the government be invest £ in flood protection between and this build on the previous year investment of £ show the increase investment that the government be make in flood protection 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be grateful for your generosity madam deputy speaker we be just grateful that at least some conservative members have turn up 
 on   october   over home in chesterfield like hundred across the uk be flood lead to the tragic death of mrs gilbert on tapton terrace less than a month later with the impeccable timing that only this accident prone government be capable of the national audit office announce that the government have cut by the number of home that will be protect from flood by will the secretary of state at least promise the house that he will never again say to a flood victim that the government be do all they can 
 i be sure the whole house extend our condolence on the sad loss of mrs gilbert our investment in flood asset maintenance be up by £ as i say the previous year investment be £ between and we be now invest £ yes there have be pressure on the programme through inflation and covid as the national audit office report show but what be not in doubt be the increase funding that this government be put into flood protection the £ indicate that alongside the increase funding for flood maintenance 
 what step he be take to tackle raptor persecution 
 the government take raptor persecution very seriously it be a national wildlife crime and there be strong penalty in place for offence commit against bird of prey in defra more than double its funding for the national wildlife crime unit to £ over year in part to target crime of raptor persecution 
 i thank the minister for his response there be many long stand tradition that be worth preserve in our countryside but raptor persecution be definitely not of they it be a vile practice and we need to do much more to protect our majestic bird of prey have the minister and the department consider whether introduce vicarious liability would act as a deterrent to rogue landowner who direct their gamekeeper to commit wildlife crime 
 as i say the government take raptor persecution very seriously and those find guilty of wildlife crime should be subject to the full force of the law defra be work with the national bird of prey crime priority delivery group which bring together the police the government local authority and stakeholder to make sure we be do as much as we can to tackle this type of crime 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 may i begin by thank and pay tribute to my predecessor my right hon friend   the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey for her work as secretary of state have represent for over year a rural constituency that with the cambridgeshire fen be well know for its farming and water management i be delighted to be appoint as secretary of state at defra and to be work with a strong ministerial team include the new under secretary of state my hon friend   the member for keighley robbie moore 
 in the next few day i will be travel to cop28 to continue the work that be put centre stage at glasgow on ensure that nature be at the heart of our approach to tackle climate change my priority for the department be to back british farming and fishing champion rural community and protect our environment for generation to come 
 i welcome the secretary of state to his place my constituent be particularly keen that the uk have the good possible animal welfare standard internationally and they write to ask the secretary of state what progress be be make particularly on livestock and equine welfare 
 animal welfare be an extremely important issue that be why we introduce the animal welfare livestock exports bill in the king ’s speech we be only able to do that because of our exit from the european union it be right that we put in place a ban to stop the export of livestock and horse for slaughter my hon friend will also be aware of the private member bill that be be take forward to tackle the important issue of pet smuggling and pet theft which i know be concern to member on both side of the house 
 i welcome the secretary of state to his place he will have see the bbc panorama investigation that expose how this conservative government have turn a blind eye to corruption and cover up at the heart of the water industry consumer be leave face high water bill while water boss profit from pollution will the secretary of state now back labour ’s plan to let the regulator block any bonus for water boss who be responsible for the tidal wave of sewage pour into our river 
 we can go well than that in that we have already bring forward measure that allow the regulator ofwat to take action alongside tough   penalty now with unlimited fine in addition all storm overflow will be monitor by the end of this year and there will be a much tough approach on regulation as the house hear in the strong response to the debate early this week 
 the mayor of greater manchester ’s proposal for a square mile clean air charge zone would have be a disaster for business in my constituency can my right hon friend provide an update on the government ’s response to the current greater manchester clean air proposal 
 i can try but the task of find clarity in the position of the mayor of greater manchester in this regard be somewhat confusing he say he be in favour of tackle the issue of air quality and indeed we have hear from opposition members how important that be and then when he have power to take action he seem to look to westminster and expect we to act on his behalf of course i will follow up my hon friend ’s request and seek clarity from the mayor but the ability to do so have to date be rather limited 
 why have the secretary of state and this conservative government allow water company to increase my constituent bill substantially and pay out million in executive bonus while fail to regulate the industry ’s rampant pollution and the dumping of raw sewage in our waterway in stark contrast to labour ’s commitment to hold those company accountable 
 let we look behind the rhetoric give that the leader of the opposition keep tell we that he want the labour government in wales to be his blueprint it be probably worth our take a look at labour ’s record in this respect interruption the hon gentleman ask the question but he do not seem to want to hear about labour ’s record which be not surprising under labour in wales the average number of spill from storm overflow last year be high than the average in england we have introduce unlimited fine and tough regulation and we have set strong target in legislation we can see what labour in power would deliver we can see it in wales a increase in storm overflow 
 can the minister give i an update on the investigation by the department and the uk health security agency of the recently confirm human case of influenza a(h1n2)v which be similar to influenza virus currently circulate in pig in the uk do he agree that infectious disease such as this with a zoonotic potential underline the importance of the animal and plant health agency to our national biosecurity and public health and that we should definitely be invest in the long term redevelopment of its headquarters in weybridge 
 swine influenza be endemic in the uk pig population it generally cause only mild illness but the health security agency ’s investigation with support from defra be ongoing we be committed to uphold the uk ’s high level of biosecurity and work be under   way with £ in the current spending review to safeguard the long term future of weybridge as a centre for scientific excellence in tackle high risk disease such as this 
 rise 
 order we have not much time so could we go a bit fast with short question and short answer 
 what step have the department take to deliver the measure propose in the national food strategy to encourage the reformulation of food and drink product 
 that be of the issue that i look forward to deal with in the week ahead and i shall be happy to drop a note to the hon lady 
 i apologise for not be here early madam deputy speaker 
 fly tipping be the no issue in my constituency will my hon friend join i in praise conservative run harrow council for introduce free waste collection and hour notice of fly tip clear up and indeed increase the number of fine for fly tipping from per year under labour to last year 
 i commend the great work that conservative run harrow council be do and i pay tribute to my hon friend for bring those point to our attention the new fly tip league table allow central and local government and indeed member of the public to identify council that be take a proactive approach to enforcement instead of simply clean up after fly tipper at fly tipper expense 
 a successful healthy and sustainable food system require a number of factor include a consumer base that can afford it recent survey show that of people have remove healthy and organic food from their diet to save money how do the secretary of state plan to cultivate a consumer base that will enable people to buy good healthy food 
 my right hon friend the chancellor have set out a whole range of method to support consumer with the cost of living—[interruption just as the hon lady raise her hand on that it be also worth remember that under the barnett consequential scotland receive more per head than those consumer in england so those in scotland be well able to meet those cost of living pressures—[interruption snp member do not seem to like the fact but it be a fact that under barnett consequential the funding in scotland be high per head that the funding in england which allow consumer to meet those cost of living pressure and to make those choice should they so wish 
 over the past week the suffolk and norfolk coast have take a real battering home have tragically be lose to the sea   not least in pakefield in my constituency will my right hon friend review the support provide to such household and business to ensure that they receive parity of support with those impact by pluvial and fluvial flooding 
 as a fellow east of england mp i know what a fantastic champion my hon friend be for his constituent and how rigorously he will ensure that those point be make he as an experienced parliamentarian will also know that many of those fiscal issue be for colleague within the treasury but i be very happy to have discussion with he and to make representation where require 
 oxford be proud when port meadow be give bathing water status yet just last week the water quality be again rat poor with the secretary of state meet i to discuss how we can hold thames water to account for its continual failure over dump raw sewage in oxfordshire 
 i be happy as the minister responsible for water quality to meet with the hon lady but i will also say that from the bathing water classification we see this week of bathing water in england be rat good or excellent that be up from when just across england be rat good this government be take water quality seriously and i will endeavour to make sure that we go even far 
 that conclude question to defra ministers we all welcome the new defra team 
 the attorney general be ask 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of perpetrator of fraud and economic crime 
 what step she be take to help ensure effective prosecution of perpetrator of fraud and economic crime 
 the crown prosecution service and the serious fraud office play a critical role in bring economic criminal to justice just yesterday the sfo announce a new investigation into fraud at aog technics ltd an aircraft part supplier that be the new investigation launch since nick ephgrave become director of the sfo 
 member of the conservative party use the pandemic as an opportunity to make money for their friend and donor total £ when will they face justice 
 i completely refute what the hon lady have say i be look forward to her question but i be disappoint with the tone and   substance of it it be right to say that this government be take economic crime seriously and fraud as well i hope she have see the new fraud strategy and importantly the report commission from jonathan fisher kc and his review on disclosure which be due out next summer 
 the government ’s fraud strategy in may be bill as a comprehensive plan to tackle fraud against the public and business so can the attorney general explain why it contain no detail of the number of offence suffer by business no estimate of the loss that result no target in relation to business no measure specific to business and not a single mention of the big type of business fraud procurement and payroll 
 i be pleased that the hon gentleman have see the full strategy that be good news i repeat my point about jonathan fisher kc who have some important work to do the hon gentleman will understand the volume of crime and the volume of digital material in the serious fraud office jonathan fisher be look at that and at disclosure and that will help business help individual help the country and help the sfo to get on with its job 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 the solicitor general will recall that back in the justice committee produce a report on fraud in the justice system and the step need to improve the way we tackle it i welcome a number of the change that have be make include the appointment of mr fisher kc but will the solicitor general reflect that of the area of concern be the type of fraud that be significant cause real loss to business and individual but fall below the level deal with by the sfo there be real concern about the capacity and expertise within police force and the crown prosecution service to tackle that level of fraud which fall into the gap what be the fraud strategy and more broadly what be the government go to do to empower the police and prosecute authority to tackle that sort of fraud 
 i be grateful to the chair of the select committee for his question we take all his report seriously especially in this area the cps charge of all fraud matter place before it and have a conviction rate of more than i will commit to reflect far on this matter 
 the solicitor general will be aware that the home affairs committee have launch a review of fraud last week we hear fascinating testimony on romance fraud from the victim of the netflix series the tinder swindler remarkably in her case she be treat as a perpetrator investigate by the police and threaten with prosecution even though she have be defraud out of hundred of thousand of pound and be lead a merry dance by that chap who be still do what he do then be there not a case for bring together law officer ministers the police and the social medium company to ensure that we deal with the victim and the perpetrator accordingly 
 my hon friend always raise serious point and bring to bear his expertise from the home affairs committee there be a case for cross government work in my role as a law officer i work across all department include the home office and i look forward to continue to do so 
 greensill capital be subject to criminal investigation in the uk switzerland and germany in duncan mavin ’s book a pyramid of lies he subtitle the saga 
 the prime minister the banker and the pound scandal 
 amazingly the company be not regulate by the financial conduct authority will the attorney general please look into this massive loophole the scandal could have be stop if the fca have be able to step in early 
 the hon gentleman will understand that the attorney general and i superintend both the crown prosecution service and the serious fraud office but that do not mean that we direct how they conduct investigation and nor should we it be right and proper that both organisation conduct their matter independently of government and that will continue 
 far to the question by my hon friend   the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill what guideline be give not only to the police but to the crown prosecution service about the level at which fraud will be investigate as chair of the all party parliamentary group on personal banking and fair financial service i have refer a number of case that have come to i to the police and to the cps and they say that they do not have the resource to investigate they could my hon and learn friend update the house on the position 
 my hon friend be diligent in these matter and he raise an issue that affect we all as constituency mps as we have all have case bring to we that need to be investigate i work very closely with both the police and the home office and i will continue to do so 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in january the then chancellor say that clearly criminal have seek to exploit our covid support scheme and 
 we ’re go to do everything we can to get that money back and go after those who take advantage of the pandemic 
 what proportion of that money have be recover so far how many of those who take advantage have be send to jail 
 i warmly welcome the hon gentleman to his place or rather back to his place as i understand that this be his outing in the shadow ministerial team it be pleasing to see his predecessor   the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter whose name be on the order paper we look forward to his question 
 the shadow minister will be interested to know that i recently visit the insolvency service which be conduct investigation into the bounce back loan scheme and the like we must remember that the covid lending scheme deliver just under £ of finance in almost   record time it be call for from across the house and should be support but he be right that those who have commit fraud should be investigate 
 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the unduly lenient sentence scheme 
 in my office receive request to review unduly lenient sentence of those be refer to the court of appeal and the sentence be increase in of case 
 i welcome much of the work be do as the solicitor general will be aware a serve royal navy sailor be the subject of a violent attack in torquay when he attempt to stop a group of yobs stamp a bird to death but the unduly lenient community sentence and small fine hand down do not reflect the gravity of the offence or provide any deterrent what step will the government take to review the unduly lenient sentence scheme to cover case such as that 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for his question i know he have have a long stand interest in this subject since even before he be a member of the house and i be grateful to he for hold the government to account he know that the uls scheme the unduly lenient sentence scheme be reserve for the most serious matter it be right to say that we keep the scheme under review i can not promise or guarantee to my hon friend any imminent change to it but i be very grateful to he for raise that important case 
 could the solicitor general make it clear what the scheme be about and spread the message more broadly i regularly write to he to say that a sentence have be too lenient i recently write to he about bernie ecclestone who i think should have be severely punish for his behaviour i have also sometimes write to the solicitor general and his predecessor about too severe sentence often involve woman who have not conduct any violent crime but get long sentence can we have a balance please 
 well it be a thursday and i think we have hear a call for a backbench business debate or indeed for an adjournment debate and i would warmly welcome that there have be such debate on the unduly lenient sentence scheme it be not a mystery there be further detail online but i would seriously welcome a further debate to air these matter because they be important the hon gentleman be right to say that the balance between on the hand unduly lenient sentence and on the other hand manifestly excessive sentence be important and i look forward to his application for a debate 
 if she will hold discussion with cabinet colleague on consult the international criminal court on potential breach of international law in the conflict between hamas and israel 
 i know that the hon lady care deeply about the region she and i and indeed you madam deputy speaker visit the region together some year ago and i know that at the current time all of we will be think about the place we visit and the people we meet in answer to her question the icc start an investigation into the situation in palestine in march 
 i thank the attorney general for her response in the light of the brutality and sexual violence perpetrate against israeli civilian by the terrorist of hamas and the scale of the indiscriminate bombing of ten of thousand of palestinians include child in gaza how be she urge the uk government to advocate for the end of the killing to ensure that the international criminal court can gather the most detailed evidence to weigh the action of all party against international law at the early opportunity 
 the prime minister the foreign secretary and indeed the whole of the uk government have consistently urge that international humanitarian law must be follow in this case the icc prosecutor who be a british bear barrister karim khan with whom i have have a number of extremely helpful meeting over the course of my time as attorney general have say that the investigation be 
 ongoing and extend to the escalation of hostility and violence since the attack that take place on   october 
 i call the spokesman for the scottish national party 
 article of the rome statute say that in relation to the work of the international criminal court state party shall cooperate fully with the court in its investigation and prosecution of crime within the jurisdiction of the court 
 give that in the uk refer russia to the icc can we assume that the uk will comply with any request from the icc for footage from the reconnaissance flight operate over gaza if not what would be the legal basis for refuse an icc request 
 as i say the uk support the icc and its chief prosecutor karim khan we do have surveillance flight operate in the region the primary purpose of those be to help with the hostage situation we will say once again that we very much hope that the hostage will be release immediately it be absolutely the case that we will continue to urge all party to continue to abide by international humanitarian law 
 what recent step have she take with cabinet colleague to uphold the rule of law within government 
 what recent step have she take with cabinet colleague to uphold the rule of law within government 
 as i emphasise to the house of lords constitution committee in june the rule of law be fundamental to our constitution and it be the duty of the law officer to uphold it 
 i will not ask the attorney general to comment on specific legal advice that she have give to colleague i know she can not do that but as a general point of principle do she agree that the inclusion of a notwithstanding clause in legislation can not magic away the international law to which it refer especially if an individual claimant can still assert their right under those international law 
 as the hon gentleman know very well i be unable to do away with client confidentiality and give he the specific of any legal advice that i may or may not have give i take very seriously my obligation to encourage the government to act in a lawful manner and to ensure that the government be act in a lawful manner both on the domestic front and on the international front 
 while it be a pleasure to see my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull east karl turner   back in his rightful place on the front bench i wonder how long the attorney general will feel able to remain in her how comfortable be she with the draft safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill which seek to oust the jurisdiction of our high court deny our country ’s international treaty obligation and treat our constitution and the rule of law with contempt she have rightly say that her duty be 
 as an officer of the court 
 and she have call for a respectful relationship between the executive and the court be that why her name do not appear on the face of the bill 
 may i start by thank the former shadow solicitor general for his great work while in that post and in particular for his championing of the pro bono movement which i know he have always take extremely seriously it have be and remain a pleasure to do business with he he know perfectly well well than most that i can not give from the dispatch box the detail of legal advice that i have be give to the government or of whether or not i have be give such advice that remain the case i remain very comfortable in my role and i hope that i will remain in this role to give the government legal advice for a long time to come 
 i join colleague on both side of the house in welcome the new shadow solicitor general my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull east karl turner to his place i be delighted to see his predecessor my hon friend   the member for hammersmith andy slaughter still contribute to our debate it be a pleasure and a blessing to work with both of they 
 as the previous question illustrate there be an intense level of public interest both inside and outside the house about the legal implication of the new rwanda bill while i appreciate that there be a doctrine of client confidentiality it be nevertheless right to ask the attorney general formally if she will publish her full legal advice   on the bill as happen with the brexit withdrawal agreement or a summary of the legal position as happen with the northern ireland protocol bill in particular will she set out the advice give to her colleague across government on whether the introduction and implementation of the bill be compatible with their obligation under the ministerial code and the civil service code 
 the right hon lady understand as i hope all of we in the chamber do the complication of the law officers convention which mean that i simply can not go into the detail of my advice here on very rare occasion either legal advice have be leak or more recently i be glad to say a summary of the government ’s legal position which may or may not include the attorney general ’s advice have be provide the sort of circumstance in which we would envisage that to be appropriate would be if we be take military action overseas for example it be not something that be do on a regular basis 
 what i would say to colleague because there have be a great deal of interest in the legal position surround the bill be that the use of a section 19(1)(b statement be not unprecedented in fact i remember as a much young lawyer when tessa jowell use such a statement for the communications act that act go on to be test in the strasbourg court and the government be successful in that case so i would not read too much into the use of a section 19(1)(b statement it be unusual but not unprecedented 
 what recent discussion she have have with the serious fraud office on the prosecution of covid-19 relate fraud 
 the attorney general and i regularly meet with the sfo director however the vast majority of covid fraud case do not fall within the sfo ’s remit and investigation be handle by the most appropriate agency recently as the hon gentleman will have hear i visit the insolvency service and hear about its excellent work in relation to bounce bank loan 
 give the statement by the former director of the serious fraud office that red flag be ignore and that parliament ’s own spending watchdog estimate potential fraud of £ how much have be recover to date and what further lesson have    be learn and apply to ensure that identification and prevention of fraud be embed across all government departments and why be the uk government not recover that fraud with the same zeal and determination that they have for impoverish benefit claimant who have have overpayment through no fault of their own 
 i entirely refute and disagree with the hon gentleman ’s final comment but he will be pleased to know that the new director of the sfo have set off apace he have launch new investigation there be a new energy and a new rigour within the sfo but i repeat that it be not just the sfo that conduct such investigation the insolvency service be also involve and be also carry out some excellent work 
 what step she be take to increase prosecution rate for small boat gang and other people trafficker 
 early this year the attorney general and i visit western jet foil and the joint control room in dover to discuss the illegal migration act the number of small boat crossing be down by a this year and we be see an increase in the number of prosecution since the introduction of the nationality and borders act 
 yesterday the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill be lay before the house it would disapply the human rights act for those seek sanctuary that undermine the uk ’s international reputation and international law the home secretary say yesterday at the dispatch box that the attorney general make it clear that the bill be in conformity with international law so can he confirm that that advice be give and how be it mean to impact small boat crossing and prosecution 
 the hon gentleman have kindly be present throughout question time so he will know that i can not confirm or deny whether advice be even seek let alone give let alone its content his question be about small boat crossing which government members be determined to stop i be disappoint that he do not support our nationality and borders act which prosecute the people trafficker that be the substance of his question i look forward to his reading the bill in more detail and support it in due course 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for transport if he will make a statement on expedite the contract process for refurbish exist uk train 
 i thank the hon member for his question which i will answer on behalf of the secretary of state the department work closely with roll stock owner and train operator to understand when new and refurbish train be likely to be require and to ensure a regular flow of work for train manufacturing company train be major asset with a lifetime of to year so there will naturally be peak and trough in procurement cycle the average age of the current fleet be year 
 the department have oversee the procurement of more than new vehicle for the great british mainline railway since some of those be still be produce include alstom train for south western and west midlands train passenger travel habit have change over the past year and while number be show sign of improvement we be still see reduce passenger revenue on the railway we be aware that alstom be face difficult trading condition it be consult its union and employee on possible job loss while it must be a commercial decision for alstom the government have be work with the company to explore option to enable it to continue manufacture at its derby site official from my department and my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport have hold regular meeting with senior management at alstom we have also convene a cross whitehall group to advise on way to support continued production at derby and how good to support those worker who could lose their job 
 the fact remain that the market for passenger train be competitive the department can not guarantee order for individual manufacturer none the less we expect substantial continued demand for new train last month lner confirm an order of new tri mode train for the east coast main line and on monday a tender for new train for the transpennine express route be launch contract award be also expect between late and early for major order for southeastern northern and chiltern in the meantime the government will continue to work with alstom and other uk manufacturer to ensure a strong and sustainable future for the rail industry 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for grant this question on a matter of some urgency i thank the minister for his response and i must impress upon he and the house that the secretary of state must expedite the contract bidding process for update exist uk train to ensure the survival of the uk base train manufacturing industry without immediate plan to allow company to bid for new contract make no mistake thousand of skilled job in the uk will go the urgency stem from the crucial role of the alstom factory in derby it be the uk ’s only end to end design build and test train manufacturing facility make it integral to the uk ’s rail manufacturing industry 
 some people currently work directly at alstom and job in the supply chain rely on the factory ’s continued production nick crossfield alstom ’s managing director give evidence to the transport committee yesterday and he be absolutely clear that the government need to decide now on how and where they want train to be make in the future if this government do not expedite the bidding process train will not continue to be manufacture in the uk they will start to be manufacture in north america south america or south- east asia 
 alstom ’s current and final contract for roll stock be on the elizabeth line and be due to expire in week that could mean an end to the rail manufacturing industry in the uk as we know it yesterday i meet unite the union of which i be a proud member and rail worker from alstom site in derby and they ask for our help in retain their job also just yesterday of the supply chain company that supply alstom go into liquidation due to the uncertainty over future order from the alstom factory time on this issue have never be more crucial 
 may i again thank my friend the hon member for easington for raise this important issue this be a matter of grave concern the site have be operate in derby for many year indeed i think he and i both go to that site when it be formerly own by bombardier as part of a transport committee delegation that support be assure i also make the point that i be meet unite the union next week it have be in touch and i will be pleased to work with it and everyone to see what more can be do to keep that plant open 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i know that the minister be a great advocate of the work of the transport committee and i strongly urge he to look at the transcript of the evidence we receive yesterday from not just alstom but other in the rail industry the fact be that the medium and long term prospect for the sector be positive what we be face be a short term lull i impress on he the urgency of work with the roll stock company rosco and other to try to bring forward some refurbishment contract that alstom and other can bid for to help smooth out these peak and trough in the sector 
 i thank my hon friend the chair of the select committee for the work he do that evidence session be particularly pertinent for highlight the matter he allow that committee to raise i can assure he that the secretary of state write to roll stock owner in september to encourage they to discuss with train operator and manufacturer opportunity to ease short term challenge in the supply chain such as refurbishment or major overhaul we recognise the issue and have ask other to do their good to deliver on that 
 i declare that i be a member of unite the union and meet with trade union member yesterday the urgency of this matter can not be overstate the clock be tick and those job will be consult on in the very near future if   contract can not be find the minister write in september but what have he be do over the past month to bring forward contract that will enable the plant to remain open 
 as i have mention we have write to ask roll stock owner what more action they can take just on monday i be up in yorkshire for the announcement of an extra £ in funding for the transpennine route upgrade that also start the tendering process for new rolling stock—29 new train with an option for another and as i mention we be look for the tender process for southeastern chiltern and northern to go forward as well so order be be put into the pipeline for train manufacturer 
 from the generous time he have give i on this subject my hon friend will know that overcrowding on the chiltern line persist to a very serious degree because the age of the roll stock regularly lead to chiltern have to run very short train on the main line train that some people can not even get on in the place as he look at this important subject will my hon friend do all he can to ensure that chiltern can get train refurbish and get new train into the pipeline as soon as possible 
 my hon friend be a champion for the chiltern line and he do indeed bend my ear on that subject he be right to do so because that line be get busy now which be a positive that tendering process will be bring into be next year we want to see chiltern train and that process should allow they to be deliver 
 we be not ask the secretary of state to give company special treatment over another i should say that i be also a member of unite the union but i believe that the retention of british manufacturing capacity have to be regard as strategically important for the united kingdom will he allow we to go forward by grant all company the opportunity to bid on new rail upgrade plan such as crossrail southeastern and even the extensive network north plan time be of the essence and swift action from the government can make a significant difference in secure the future of the uk rail manufacturing industry 
 i can give the hon member that assurance we will be bring those contract tender forward we now have train manufacturer which be to be celebrate we have caf in south wales we have hitachi up in the north east we have alstom of course in derby and now we have siemens in goole all those manufacturer be bid and the hon   member be absolutely right that there must be a fair process for all which will take place 
 it be not that long ago that we have the hat pacer train on the furness line we be very glad to see the back of those but of course a new shiny train be no good if it be not run the minister mention that if we be not see customer demand that be go to hurt the industry so   could he speak to what the government be do to improve customer service and get the level of train service back up to where my constituent hope it will be 
 we be aware that performance need to be a lot well than it be currently not just from train manufacturer but from network rail indeed i be due to meet with the train operator this morning to discuss that issue obviously i have have to move that meeting but i be very happy to meet with my hon friend so that i can take his particular point into account we need to do more 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the alstom litchurch lane factory in derby have be build train for over a century since the dawn of train travel it have provide high skilled job for the local community for generation and help support other local company that form part of its supply chain and as britain ’s big train building plant it play a pivotal role in support the growth of the midland and our country ’s manufacturing sector 
 follow the government ’s chaos and indecision over hs2 and the lack of a long term strategy hundred of highly skilled job at the plant be at risk with no confirm workload beyond the quarter of and contract to build train for hs2 push back until create a gap in order this news will be deeply worry for those affect and their family in the run up to christmas it will also be extremely concern for local business that rely on the factory and the wide rail sector and for the people of derby 
 the worker at alstom have only day to get a decision out of the minister before their livelihood be put at risk time be up they deserve to hear from the minister how this have be allow to happen and what action the government be take to pursue a deal to secure the derby plant and ensure that as many job be protect as possible what urgent clarity can the government provide alstom on the short term roll stock pipeline include possible refurbishment 
 i be pleased that the minister confirm that he will be meet representative from unite the union and i hope that he will commit to work with they to safeguard job when can the factory finally get certainty on hs2 order so that it can plan for the future and secure job how many more rail manufacturing job across the country be at risk follow the government ’s recent decision on hs2 
 early this year derby be name the government ’s home of great british railways just month on the future of its landmark factory be in danger at the heart of this be the chaos and indecision of the conservative party the minister owe the people of derby and the country an explanation of what he plan to do to stop the prime minister ’s hs2 fiasco lead to more job loss 
 i will if i may deal with the matter of hs2 head on the shadow rail minister make that same point say that this be somehow link to hs2 and it have now be make from the dispatch box   today the secretary of state respond to the shadow rail minister so i shall put this on the record with regard to hs2 he say 
 i can assure you this be not the case alstom be part of a contract with hitachi to design build and maintain hs2 train for phase only phase of hs2 between birmingham and london will continue 
 that position have be reiterate by alstom ’s chief executive i gently point out to   the hon member for wakefield simon lightwood   that this have nothing to do with hs2 that have be establish and it be erroneous to claim otherwise 
 the hon member also have to bear in mind that we now have train manufacturer we can not just award a contract to manufacturer there have to be a fair tender process for all the job across all plant the department for transport have win a case bring by of the other train manufacturer demonstrate that our tendering process be fair 
 my hon friend refer in his opening statement to a new order from transpennine he will be aware that there be severe overcrowding on the cleethorpes manchester liverpool service because the train have be reduce from carriage to in recent month can he enlighten i as to when the new stock will be come forward as it will greatly please my constituent 
 i hope my hon friend ’s constituent will be comfort by the order because it be not just an order for new transpennine express train but a complete upgrade of the transpennine route the uk government be spend more money on the transpennine upgrade than be spend on the elizabeth line and that will mean deliver a well service i be with the manage director of transpennine train on monday up in yorkshire and we be discuss just that we need to improve the service and the rolling stock 
 upgrade to our train must include electrification but electrification be at a standstill with only mile of track be electrify this year east west rail will not be electrify as standard and dirty diesel train be still go through bath will the minister commit to a long term plan for electrification 
 the prime minister ’s network north plan do just that electrification for hull between sheffield and manchester and between sheffield and leeds they be vast project not small project with regard to east west rail that be the upgrade of an exist line which have its bridge size all the way through from winslow to bletchley so it be difficult to put electrification on to that part let i remind the hon lady that there have be more than mile of electrification in the past year compare with just over mile in the year before that i think that be a pretty good record 
 i too have meet worker from the alstom plant in derby and as a unite member myself representative of unite as well it be pleasing to hear that worker representative and management be unite in their desire to retain good high skilled manufacturing job and train production   there i want to press the minister again about recognise the importance of retain the only end to end train production facility in the uk during this short term blip in production so to speak do he agree that this investment in public transport be vital if we want to tackle the net challenge we face 
 the hon lady be correct that be vital the challenge and it be a good challenge be that we now have manufacturer and we need to help they with international order that be why i sometimes go abroad with trade envoy from those company to export around the globe the average age of our roll stock be down to just under year year ago it be year and as it get fresher there be a challenge with pipeline as well however we be bring contract forward so that we can fill the order book well 
 as a derbyshire member of parliament i can tell the minister that there be huge concern about the future of alstom i think it be perfectly reasonable to say that the government have lack strategic direction on rail they have go from project to another and in the last few year there have be no sense of an industrial strategy when we have have these debate in the past ministers be always blame the eu and say we could not support british manufacturing because of the eu we be now out of the eu and it seem to i that country such as germany be much well at support their manufacturing can we have a real sense of urgency from the minister and an indication that the government be go to make sure strategically that these job be save 
 i assure the hon member that the secretary of state in particular have be meet alstom and our official and our director general meet alstom include with representative i will be do so on tuesday week we will do everything we can to assist but this be a commercial matter for the operator as i have mention i have be to that plant with the transport committee and see what it do for the workforce and for the supply chain we will be do everything we can to assist alstom in keep that plant open 
 i thank the minister for his answer with many of my constituent dependent on government help and support for manufacturing industry i can well understand union fear at the dithering and the effect on the workforce it be necessary to refurbish a number of train so can the minister outline how the government will ensure that the much need refurbishment contract can be organise to keep people in work rather than pay out redundancy money to they only to rehire they month later when thing be arrange properly that be the desire of every member of this house 
 yes indeed as i have mention we be bring forward order and the secretary of state have write to the company that finance train manufacturing and refurbishment to ask what more they can do to bring forward that refurbishment at the risk of repeat myself the challenge we have and it be a good challenge be that we have fine train manufacturer and we have roll stock that be young than it previously be so the aim be to try to get order out which we be do but i reiterate that it be also   important that we help our train manufacturer export order across the globe so that they can manufacture not just for home but for abroad and keep those job go 
 with permission i will make a statement about attempt cyber interference in british democracy i know hon and right hon member across this house will recognise the seriousness of this issue 
 the government have long highlight the threat to the uk and our ally from malicious cyber activity conduct by the russian intelligence service i can confirm today that the russian federal security service the fsb be behind a sustained effort to interfere in our democratic process it have target member of this house and the other place it have be target civil servant journalist and non government organisation it have be target high profile individual and entity with a clear intent use information it obtain to meddle in british politic 
 madam deputy speaker you and parliamentary security have be brief on the detail of that activity we want to be as open as we can with the house and the british public our commitment to transparency stand in sharp contrast to the effort of the kgb ’s successor to exert influence from the shadow what can we confirm today i want to stress particular point of our assessment 
 centre a unit within russia ’s fsb have be involve in a range of cyber espionage operation target the uk 
 secondly star blizzard a cyber group that the national cyber security centre assess be almost certainly subordinate to centre be responsible for a range of malign activity target british parliamentarian from multiple party 
 thirdly use those mean the group have selectively leak and amplify the release of sensitive information in service of russia ’s goal of confrontation in when he be foreign secretary my right hon friend   the member for esher and walton dominic raab   confirm to the house that russia have do that before the election with document relate to uk us trade i can now confirm that we know star blizzard be involve in this operation 
 fourthly these cyber actor use a combination of target tailor their operation in a far more sophisticated way than be usually the case with for instance commonplace cyber criminal they typically engage in thorough research and preparation include via social medium and network platform have thus identify way to engage a target they create false account impersonate contact to appear legitimate and create a believable approach seek to build a rapport before deliver a malicious link to either a document or website of interest while they have target business and corporate email the group predominantly target personal email address 
 finally the targeting of this group be not limit to politician but include public face figure and institution of all type we have see impersonation and attempt to compromise email account across the public sector university medium non governmental organisation and wide civil society many of those individual and   organisation play a vital role in our democracy as an example the group be responsible for the hack of the institute for statecraft a uk think tank whose work include initiative to defend democracy against disinformation and the more recent hack of its founder whose account be compromise from in both case document be subsequently leak 
 the government ’s assessment be base on extensive analysis from the uk intelligence community and support by a range of close international partner today ally from the eyes and the euro atlantic region be join we in illuminate the pervasive nature of this threat to our share democratic value i pay tribute to the dedicated public servant in our own agency and those of our partner whose painstaking work have allow we to expose the reality of the threat we face 
 take together the uk government judge that these action demonstrate a clear and persistent pattern of behaviour russia ’s attempt interference in political and democratic process through cyber or any other mean be unacceptable i reassure the house that we have identify target of parliamentary colleague and engage with victim through both the national cyber security centre and the parliamentary authority 
 the government will continue to expose and respond to malign cyber activity hold russia accountable for its action to that end the uk have designate individual under the uk ’s cyber sanction regime follow a thorough investigation by the national crime agency into the hack of the institute for statecraft in do so we send a clear message that these action have consequence this morning the foreign commonwealth and development office have summon the russian ambassador to the foreign office to convey that message 
 we have robust system in place to protect against the threat from foreign malign influence the minister for security my right hon friend   the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat lead the defend democracy taskforce which drive work to improve our resilience against these threat our national cyber security centre alongside eyes partner today publish a technical advisory to provide guidance to organisation and individual at risk of be target to help defend against such attack we will continue to defend ourselves from adversary who seek to threaten the freedom that underpin our democracy it be and always will be an absolute priority to protect our democracy and election 
 a key component of increase our resilience be support the national cyber security centre and parliamentary authority to deliver an enhance cyber security offer to right hon and hon member and to member of the other place that aim to well protect they against this insidious threat and support the resilience of our lively democratic society we hope that this statement help to raise awareness of the threat and allow those in public life in this house and beyond to recognise how they may be target by such operation 
 russia have a long establish track record of reckless indiscriminate and destabilising malicious cyber activity with impact feel all over the world in recent year the government have alongside ally uncover numerous instance of russian intelligence target of critical national infrastructure for example we have work in close co ordination with our intelligence partner to expose sophisticated cyber espionage tool aim at   sensitive target the irony of russia ’s abuse the freedom that it deny its own people to interfere in our politic will not be lose on anyone 
 of course our political process and institution have endure in spite of those attack but the cyber threat pose by the russian intelligence service be real and serious all right hon and hon member should pay careful attention to it in the course of their work and their daily life many in this house may not consider themselves a potential victim i want to underline to the whole house that the targeting can be extremely convincing we must all play our part in exercise good cyber practice use appropriate caution and follow the good guidance of the national cyber security centre and other to mitigate the threat that be how we defend ourselves and our precious democracy i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 i be grateful to the minister for advance sight of his statement 
 the news that the russian intelligence service be behind an effort to target member of this house and the other place civil servant journalist and ngos be not just concern it be an attack not only on individual but on british democracy on both side of this house and on the public we represent labour along with the whole house condemn it in the strong term 
 the news come as we approach the year of election not only in britain but in the united states india and the eu with more than election schedule in country across the world democracy be build on trust and trust must be build on the confidence that politician on all side be able to conduct the business of democracy free from interference 
 let i ask the minister some specific question about these revelation be he confident that the government have uncover the full extent of the cyber attack and every person who be affect 
 secondly on the response i welcome the announcement of the designation of individual follow the hack of the institute for statecraft but have any specific action be take to respond to the cyber attack on parliamentarian that the minister have reveal today if not why not 
 thirdly as we approach the general election what additional step be the government take to ensure the integrity of the democratic process will they make their official available to ensure that member on both side of this house be free from interference to train equip and support member and all staff to well identify and respond to the challenge and to ensure not just that their digital communication be protect but that their office staff and family be too 
 this revelation be shocking but not unexpected it be the late episode in a long pattern of hostile activity by russia and other hostile state include iran and the democratic people ’s republic of korea against britain and our ally there be more that we can do labour have commit to the establishment of a democratic resilience centre in government to work with our ally to protect our democratic value political institution election and open society will the government commit   to create as the shadow home secretary my right hon friend   the member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper have outline we do not yet have a robust and long last equivalent of the cross government counter terrorism strategy contest for deal with hostile state will the government commit to create 
 labour have propose a joint cell between the home office and the foreign office to speed up decision making share intelligence and expertise and remove traditional barrier between department will the government commit to create they still have not amend terror legislation to allow the government to ban hostile state sponsor organisation that be undermine our national security will they commit to do so the russia report have still not be fully implement will the government urgently update the house on when that will be complete 
 this be not just about cyber attack and direct digital interference it be about wide malign activity include the use of artificial intelligence and deepfake to seed false narrative spread lie and foment division that include the widespread use of disinformation misinformation and malinformation to undermine our democracy through mainstream and social medium and other mean labour have commit to urgently introduce bind regulation of company develop the most powerful frontier ai which could be use to disrupt election will the government commit to do so too will they also commit to ensure adequate resourcing for the national cyber security centre the intelligence agency and the defend democracy taskforce 
 i give the minister every assurance that the labour party will work in partnership and full co operation with the government and all relevant authority to take every necessary step to address this threat and protect the integrity of our political process from hostile interference as politician from different party we have all stand unite across the house against putin ’s imperial aggression in ukraine that unity be a source of strength and pride in the face of these threat this house must remain united britain must remain united and democracy must remain united in defence of our institution and against those who seek to undermine the great value that our society be found upon 
 i be grateful for the tone and constructive content of the right hon gentleman ’s response he be right to say that be a bumper year of election involve some election and billion of people across country this be a matter of trust and confidence which be why we have make this statement now to ensure that its full deterrent effect be properly time 
 the right hon gentleman ask whether we be confident that we have uncover the full extent of the activity we have a high degree of confidence with regard to this specific incident but of course it be a question and our duty be to remain ever vigilant the lesson of this sort of activity be that a high degree of vigilance be necessary and that be the posture that we now maintain in term of any future activity 
 i be grateful that the right hon gentleman welcome the designation specific action have be take by the ncsc in accordance and together with house authority   to ensure that all of the individual affect have a high degree of preventive measure in place the posture of the house authority and the security offer available have be enhance however as i have say it be a matter of improve vigilance on all side as for additional step we might take there be the collective deterrent impact of our naming and sham these individual and designate they in our sanction as well as the diplomatic effort to call russia out combine with personal cyber security measure on behalf of individual those important step that all colleague need to take 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the whitehall structure in this area and point to his own policy of call for a joint cell we be confident that the defend democracy taskforce lead by the security minister represent a robust and cross departmental response on the wide picture of disinformation the right hon gentleman be right to say that we need to up our game to counter disinformation call russia out and well resource and energise our own security posture in the cyber domain that have be do there be an enhanced degree of resource organisation and political will this public statement today be part of the hugely important deterrent effect 
 the intelligence and security committee be of the to sound the alarm on this issue in its russia report more recently we have highlight the risk that china pose through interference in democratic discourse for example in think tank and university will the minister update the house on what action the government be take in response to the recommendation make in those substantial report 
 my right hon friend make a very good point clearly this statement be about russia but she draw a comparison with the activity of china that be an appropriate reference and i be pleased that in our domestic legislation we have the ability to ensure that country with malign intent do not use think tank or other front to influence domestic political discourse in a way that be contrary to the health of our democracy 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 i thank the minister for prior sight of his statement it make for disturb reading and i absolutely agree that russia ’s action be completely unacceptable that member of this house and other have have their email account hack be deeply concern but we know that this have happen before indeed it be probably happen right now and we must accept that it will almost certainly happen again 
 as the minister say russia ’s action demonstrate a clear and persistent pattern of behaviour give that have the government consider make cyber security training mandatory for all mp and their staff he will be aware of the belief that of our weak link in our cyber defence be our staff who be constantly target by unscrupulous external actor although they be not house employee it would be a reasonable precaution for mps staff to receive in house training   on exactly what to look out for how to avoid get suck into a trap and what they should do if they have even the slight suspicion that they be be target 
 democracy be under attack just last week the canadian government ’s communications security establishment release a new report on cyber threat to election say that at least a quarter of national election around the world be target by some manner of threat and that china and russia be the most active country and be launch increasingly sophisticated influence operation by spread disinformation and seek to push election in a specific direction perhaps most worryingly the canadian report state in relation to ai undermine election 
 we assess it very likely that the capacity to generate deepfake exceed our ability to detect they 
 with mp face have their email hack the democratic process be undermine and the uk general election just around the corner what be the government do to proactively defend the integrity of those election and when can the house expect to hear about it 
 i be grateful for the hon gentleman ’s comment and question he be absolutely right about the scale of the threat alongside our call russia out and describe the nature of the threat it be important that we point out that russia have fail in its intent to undermine our domestic politic it be a genuine attempt that fail and we be now more aware and resilient that be why we be call russia out but we should also be proud that the institution of our democracy remain resilient russia have fail in its effort and it will continue to fail because we will continue to call it out 
 the hon gentleman make a very good point about staff training i do not think we should mandate that but we have work on a much enhance offer to ensure that cyber security be root and branch part of the normal working practice of mps and staff that offer have radically improve the house authority will continue to keep colleague up to date a high degree of awareness in our working practice be very important and that be part of the rationale behind today ’s statement 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s update i be sure that i be not alone in have receive a large number of template email on particular subject when i have diligently write back to those individual they have say that they do not send the email it be quite clear that hostile actor be collect our constituent email address and use they to subvert the democratic process will my hon friend take the message not only back to the foreign office but across the house that this need to be investigate and stop 
 my hon friend make a very good point this practice use email to insert malware or to entice user to click on a malicious link be sometimes extremely convincing staff have to deal with a great volume of such email which be why we be pleased that the house authority have great awareness staff should seek guidance from the house authority on take a more secure approach 
 the minister contribute to a very good debate in the uk eu parliamentary partnership assembly which meet in westminster early this week and touch on some of these issue we be clearly deal with hybrid warfare there be no other phrase for it 
 although i commend the minister for come to the house to give we this information the response of sanction people seem rather mild will he say more about that will he also say something about the co ordination across western democracy and ally on next year ’s year of election we must all co ordinate so that we can spot pattern in order to deal with this threat 
 the hon lady should be reassure that although today ’s announcement pertain to individual it be indicative of a huge and sustained institutional effort to tackle this threat by way of a vastly improve defensive cyber capability right across our nation our global response be work hand in glove with eyes partner and there be a huge diplomatic and security effort to make sure this activity be call out and pursue that be not just deterrence it be also enhance resilience although the number of individual be small the hon lady should be reassure that the institutional work be tremendously well resource and entirely determine 
 i thank the minister for his statement i be incredibly grateful to the speaker ’s office the security minister and the house authority for their work to increase our awareness and to improve our protection within parliament but we be in a very privileged position frankly the fabric of our society that be most at risk be those part that do not have access to such information whether they be small and medium sized enterprise that supply critical national infrastructure whether they be the part of the economy that keep we go or indeed whether they be those who protect our election will the minister speak a little about what protection and information will be offer to they so that they can support we 
 my hon friend make a very good point this affect we all it not only affect parliamentarian or those in public life it affect those in commerce the national cyber security centre have publish guidance and be available to provide guidance to those business that need to ensure they have a high degree of cyber- security and resilience particularly those involve in for example critical national infrastructure 
 this be a refreshing statement but what action will be take this be a very serious challenge to our democracy indeed it be not only a serious challenge to member of parliament i know of a major takeover of a british company by a chinese entity the senior executive say that when they attend meeting the chinese know information about the company its secret and its background that they could have know only by illegal mean it be everywhere and it be particularly come from russia china and perhaps iran and north korea can we have action yes we need to train our staff and member of parliament but i be brainwash as a child by the james bond novel maybe you be too   madam deputy speaker we have a wonderful intelligence system but be our intelligence service up to the job do they need more resource
