the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the spring budget on scotland 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the spring budget on scotland 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the spring budget on scotland 
 we have again see calamitous event in scotland this week however i wish humza yousaf very well for the future i always find he to be a very decent man to work with and there be no doubt that he be deal a rotten hand 
 although i do not want to dwell unduly on the private grief of snp members i very much hope that whoever become minister will work with we on the issue that really matter to people in scotland such as public service and our economy and will not continue to obsess with independence 
 this government be take long term decision to cut taxis for work people and to grow the economy the spring budget represent a significant milestone in the uk government ’s levelling up mission with investment into scotland burst through the £ mark in addition the scottish government will benefit from a £ funding uplift through the barnett formula for 
 the reality be that the chancellor ’s regressive spring budget leave the people of scotland behind in contrast the snp scottish government take the bold step of implement a progressive tax scheme 
 the westminster establishment argue that scotland ’s income tax rate would somehow cause people to leave the country last week however it be reveal by his majesty ’s revenue and customs that the opposite be true with many more taxpayer move to scotland than leave will the secretary of state join i in welcome this brilliant news and congratulate the scottish government on stand up for the people of scotland 
 the hon lady ’s point would be relevant if that report be not from long before we enter into tax band in scotland versus in the rest of the uk i absolutely do not agree with she 
 the secretary of state mention levelling up which be curious we know that the budget cut public service across the board and cut scotland ’s capital funding yet level up seem to benefit place such as the financial district of canary wharf which have benefit by £ per head be he suggest that scotland but not other part of the uk should accept austerity from this government 
 that be a ridiculous remark the levelling up agenda in scotland have be fantastically successful and there have be absolutely no austerity the scottish government have receive a record block grant of £ the high since devolution begin i be surprised that the snp want to talk about the budget because the scottish government ’s budget put taxis up and cut vital public service so scot be actually pay more and get less 
 what utter nonsense the hypocrisy of this tory party which be busy gaslighte the scottish public by complain about cut to capital spending while the tory government be busy cut or £ from the scottish government ’s capital block grant allocation be quite astonishing with westminster hold scotland back yet again can the secretary of state tell we as scotland ’s man in the cabinet whether he argue against these cut will he argue for the scottish parliament to have the ability to raise more capital borrowing to mitigate these savage westminster cut and to help drive scotland forward 
 in the fiscal framework settlement we make it very clear and agree with the scottish government that resource funding could be reallocate if they so wish from the record block grant into capital funding that be what have happen additionally they have the ability to borrow £ if require 
 i also begin by pass on my good wish to humza yousaf and his family i always find he very personable in my dealing with he although i disagree with virtually everything he have say or do as minister of scotland particularly put up taxis and deliver poor public service 
 be my right hon friend aware that business in my constituency be struggle to recruit employee from other part of the united kingdom because of the high tax rate in scotland which be damage our local economy 
 my right hon friend make a good point i be well aware as be business in dumfries and galloway that have tax band in scotland but in the rest of the uk be not the way to incentivise people to go to work in scotland or even to relocate their business there 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 on this international workers day may day scottish television journalist be strike for fair pay i be sure the secretary of state will join i in insist that stv get back around the table with its journalist to thrash out an acceptable deal give all the news that be happen this week we need they back on the television 
 i too pay tribute to the outgoing minister humza yousaf we may not have agree on everything but his historic appointment mark a pivotal moment in our multicultural public life in scotland and i wish he and his family well for the future 
 the spring budget be just another moment that expose the damage do by the chaos of the former prime minister ’s kamikaze budget the secretary of state have be spin that it bring taxis down but be it not the case that the tax burden in scotland and across the rest of the uk continue to rise the prime minister now want to mirror his irresponsible predecessor with an unfunded £ policy to get rid of national insurance altogether the secretary of state sit around the cabinet table so which of these have they discuss to pay for this pensioner the nhs or income tax rise 
 i agree with the hon gentleman that the tax burden in scotland be too high and rise and people be pay more and get less fortunately the uk government have take the decision to partially offset that not through income tax cut but through national insurance cut with 4p come off ni to pick up on his last point he be refer to an aspiration that this government have we have already reduce ni by 4p a and we aspire to remove it altogether because it be a tax on job 
 this be a £ unfunded aspiration and the secretary of state and the government will not tell we where they will get the money from scotland be trap between chaotic and fail government we have have prime ministers and we will have have ministers in as many year all the while   the right hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn   think he be already the minister and call the shot although he have be shoot himself firmly in the foot what be abundantly clear to the people of scotland be that neither the scottish government nor the uk government be even interested in deliver the change that scotland need with neither government want to let the people decide will the secretary of state tell the house who he think be most scared of a general election the tories or the scottish national party 
 we absolutely do not fear an election whether for holyrood or a general election as i watch the nationalist implode again i say bring it on i hear they say the same from a sedentary position interruption bring it on chap and chapesse over there start polish up your cv 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i too on behalf of the snp group put on record our sincere thank to humza yousaf for his public service over the month and year i wish he nadia and the rest of his family all the good in their future 
 let i also observe that few people in scotland will see our proceeding today as scottish television be currently black out because of a strike by tv journalist i implore the management of stv to get back around the table with the national union of journalists improve its pay offer and try to settle this dispute 
 the budget that be approve a few month ago also contain forward planning assumption on income and expenditure over the next to year what assessment have the secretary of state make of those assumption on the scottish public finance 
 as i have say before we have a record block grant it be run over a year period and it average out at £ and then there be barnett consequential add to that this year that figure be £ base on the spring budget ’s figure 
 that sound like no assessment at all have be make the truth be that accord to the institute for fiscal studies these forward planning assumption involve public service cut of up to £ that can only imply savage cut to the scottish block grant in the next to year sadly these planning assumption and the framework be endorse by the labour party so if people vote either conservative or labour at the come election be they not consent to massive cut in public service in scotland 
 of course i do not agree with those figure public service in scotland be in a desperate state in their recent budget the scottish government freeze council tax thereby put more pressure on local authority to deliver those public service 
 what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for defence on the level of defence spending in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for defence on the level of defence spending in scotland 
 scotland office ministers have regular discussion with the ministry of defence on all matter relate to defence defence spending contribute significantly to deliver thousand of high skilled job and investment in scotland i welcome the announcement by the prime minister that we will increase our defence spending to of gdp in response to rise global threat 
 clearly it be good news for the united kingdom and scotland in particular that of gdp will be spend on defence will my right hon friend update the house on the number of job that will be protect and potentially be create in scotland as a result of this decision 
 the short answer be that the increase investment announce by the prime minister will be focus on fire up the uk industrial base the whole united kingdom will benefit from that and it will ensure that our armed benefit from the late technology   both of those thing will bring economic benefit and support job across the whole of the united kingdom include scotland at this time of heighten global tension and an illegal war in ukraine spark by the russians i be confident that scotland will play a grow role as the uk government ramp up their spending 
 thank to the armed force parliamentary scheme i have be lucky enough to meet some of the amazing military personnel and civilian work at his majesty ’s naval base clyde will my right hon friend confirm that the increase in defence spending announce last week by the prime minister will bring benefit across the whole country whether at raf basis in my own constituency or at the many military establishment in scotland and that it be another clear demonstration that it be the conservatives who can be trust to defend and protect our entire united kingdom 
 my hon friend be absolutely correct it be the conservatives who be trust to defend the whole of the united kingdom the snp have consistently propose abandon our nuclear deterrent include in its most recent independence paper the irony be that the snp want to be part of the nato alliance but not part of a nuclear nato alliance 
 a vital part of defence spending be ensure that military personnel live in safe and suitable accommodation at last week ’s debate on the renters reform bill my hon friend   the member for north shropshire helen morgan   ensure concession from the government on the standard of military accommodation what assessment have the secretary of state make of that in scotland 
 the hon lady be absolutely right as the father of a serve soldier i completely agree with she i hear from member of the military that they be disappoint with the standard of accommodation i have raise the issue on a uk wide basis and discuss it with the defence secretary he say the programme of improvement which start before last winter amount to £ of spending 
 far to the secretary of state ’s comment about nuclear basis i hope he be aware of the alarming rise in more serious nuclear safety incident at scotland ’s trident nuclear basis on the clyde my question have reveal incident be log in and include with a risk of radiation leakage to the environment the category a incident in year have he concern if there be a radioactive leak beyond safe level in many of these incident what report will his government produce to reassure crew and those live nearby that the nuclear infrastructure be not as former downing street adviser describe it dangerously rot 
 i have visit faslane our base on the clyde it be an absolutely fantastic facility we do not comment on matter relate to faslane if the hon lady have any more specific question she should ask they at defence question but regard our nuclear deterrent and our nuclear facility we do not comment on thing that happen there 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the european commission ’s proposal for a youth mobility scheme on young people in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the european commission ’s proposal for a youth mobility scheme on young people in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the european commission ’s proposal for a youth mobility scheme on young people in scotland 
 i be in touch with home office ministers regularly to discuss immigration matter that affect scotland this government have youth mobility scheme agree with country and we remain open to new arrangement with our international partner include individual eu member state 
 i have to say that i be bemuse by that answer i will never shake in my view that brexit be an act of gross harm against the next generation particularly in scotland where we reject it but we be where we be and the eu have offer the uk a comprehensive youth mobility scheme up to the age of for year that strike i as a fantastic deal scotland want to do it so why be the minister so keen to hold scotland back but my actual question be be he as delighted as i think he must be that the labour party completely agree with he 
 the hon member and the snp continue to obsess about brexit and the decision of the united kingdom to leave the european union this government be absolutely committed to offer young people opportunity to travel around the world during their education as demonstrate through our association with the horizon scheme and through the government ’s ture scheme 
 the youth mobility scheme would allow young people in my constituency of glasgow north east and across scotland to participate in youth exchange work study and travel across europe the minister get to do that be his message to my constituent that this freedom be for the like of he but not for the like of they 
 the uk government currently operate successful bilateral youth mobility scheme with international party the country with which we already have arrangement include andorra australia canada hong kong iceland india japan monaco new zealand san marino south korea taiwan and uruguay interruption snp members may scoff at these country but these country be offer unique opportunity for scot to travel internationally and to learn as many of we do as well 
 anyone in scotland watch this will be incredibly disappointed with the response that we have have from the minister to date in march   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   say on bbc scotland that young people be not reap the benefit of brexit i do not often agree with my constituency neighbour in the south but he be absolutely right then and he be still absolutely right now be he not 
 the big obstacle to opportunity for young people in scotland be the snp government by restrict the number of place for scottish student at scottish university so heavily the scottish government seem intent on drive young people out of our country 
 have be involve in run a number of our youth mobility scheme i be fairly familiar with the concept that they involve such as capped number reciprocity the idea that we do not have a large flow way without it happen the other way limited term no access to the welfare system and the fact that people can not take dependant with they give their temporary status will the minister assure i that we will maintain the position that we have under the former prime minister boris johnson that we will do this where it be in the uk ’s economic interest and where we know that the main driver of issue such as immigration abuse do not exist that be why we have the scheme that we do with australia canada and new zealand and why we should maintain that open approach 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for his work in this area and his continued interest in it the government have make it absolutely clear that we have no plan to agree an eu wide youth mobility scheme for the reason that he have highlight but we be open to negotiate with individual member state individual arrangement that suit the united kingdom and scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in scotland 
 this government have demonstrate their commitment to support household across the united kingdom and in scotland with the cost of living with a £ package of support of the large in europe inflation be now at which be less than half its recent peak and be expect to fall to its target year early than expect 
 accord to the scottish parliament ’s own research as well as the fraser of allander institute the scottish government ’s child poverty target for be not set to be meet give the dereliction of their net target and the widen attainment gap do the minister agree that the scottish government have give up on govern and give up on the future of scottish child 
 i agree with the hon member the snp give up govern in scotland a long time ago thank to its continue obsession with independence and referendum the uk government remain committed to support   household across scotland demonstrate through our increase in work age benefit our maintain the triple lock for pensioner and our cut to national insurance 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i wish humza yousaf well for the future but after his year in office nobody in scotland be well off and that be couple with our have a prime minister who be cling on to power child poverty be up life expectancy be fall nhs waiting list be up drug death be up homelessness be up economic growth have flatline be it not the inescapable truth that scot have be fail by government for far too long do the minister agree that what scotland need now be to be rid of both these distract incompetent and hopelessly out of touch government 
 i certainly agree that the snp government have not be focus on the day job they have be neglect scotland ’s school nhs and transport network they have not be get on with the day job but the harsh reality be that whoever be elect to replace humza yousaf as minister will still have the same obsession with independence and referendum 
 what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the uk internal market on the scottish economy 
 the government ’s assessment be that our internal market be the essential basis on which business be able to trade freely across the united kingdom minimise red tape and maximise opportunity in scotland of outgoing trade be with the rest of the united kingdom more than with the rest of the world combine 
 the internal market be beneficial for all part of the united kingdom it be however more important to those area where there be a border do the minister therefore agree that the internal market should be very helpful in maintain and develop economic activity in the borderland area and will he consider a borderland growth deal which would certainly help the area on both side of the border 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the uk ’s internal market be essential to promote economic activity ensure that business in the border in my constituency in carlisle and beyond benefit from frictionless trade with the rest of the united kingdom the borderland growth deal which include a £ investment from the uk government be sign in july and be develop a range of project to far boost economic growth 
 when the bbc have the headline on its webpage why have ireland get so much surplus cash be it not clear that the reality be that independent ireland be more successful in the european and world market than   scotland trap in the uk ireland have a surplus of £ to spend on its society the uk have a deficit and cut which be hurt people will the minister remind we of the size of the uk deficit 
 i be very clear that scotland be well serve by be at the heart of a strong united kingdom the spending figure of the scottish government be very clear in term of their dependency on scotland be part of the uk to support vital public service like the nhs school and the transport network 
 i call stewart malcolm mcdonald not here 
 what discussion he have have with the scottish government on the biodiversity of scotland ’s river and stream 
 water quality policy be devolve in scotland the scottish government be responsible for biodiversity in river and stream in scotland not the united kingdom government it be for the scottish government to take action in this vital area 
 be it not the truth that scottish water stream and river be pure and clean because the scottish people reject the privatisation of water and lead by scottish labour make sure that we have scottish water in the public realm and deliver clean water for everyone 
 the hon member be absolutely wrong accord to a recent report untreated sewage have be release into scottish water and sea more than time over the past year but only of sewage overflow in scotland be require to be monitor unlike in england and wales where nearly be monitor thank to the effort of this government unlike this government the scottish government and scottish water be fail to take tough action to monitor sewage overflow and protect our very important waterway 
 what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on the protection of free speech in scotland 
 this government be commit to protect free speech it be the responsibility of the scottish government and scottish parliament work with police scotland to ensure that the hate crime legislation be implement and enforce in a way that protect freedom of speech and have the confidence of people in scotland 
 the scottish government ’s hate crime and public order scotland act come into force this month and be already have a chilling impact on free speech what lesson can the uk government learn from the introduction of this poor legislation in scotland 
 yes and police scotland already have stretch resource not least because it have be check up on the snp finance for the last year my hon friend be absolutely right and we do have concern that the legislation could have a potential chilling effect on free speech but it be for the scottish government to speak to their own devolved law for my part i believe it be an awful piece of legislation it lack clarity on what constitute an offence and importantly my right hon friend the prime minister have make it very clear that the uk government will not enact similar legislation 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 never before have such rubbish be utter about a piece of legislation as have be utter about the hate crime act in week the tories have try to repeal it which give that it mainly consolidate exist legislation will leave we unprotected against islamophobia racism and homophobia will the secretary of state now issue of his famous colonial decree and tell the scottish tories to back off 
 of all those law already exist that be the important thing secondly i be right about police resource there be hate crime report in the week more than in any of the precede year it be a ridiculous unnecessary piece of legislation 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday may 
 i know the thought of the whole house be with the people of hainault in east london follow yesterday ’s appal attack such violence have no place on our street it be absolutely heartbreaking that a teenage boy have die and i can not imagine what his family be go through we send they our heartfelt condolence and offer our very good wish to all those injure i reiterate my thank to the police and other emergency responder for embody the high standard of public service under such awful circumstance i know our thought be also with those injure this morning in an attack at a school in sheffield 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 we know that more than in teenager be vape with some expert describe it as an epidemic yesterday new research suggest that teenager who vape could be at risk of exposure to toxic metal potentially harm brain or organ development i agree with the prime minister in his wish to reduce the harm cause by smoking and vape through the tobacco and vapes bill do he agree that permit football strip to be sponsor by vape company send entirely the wrong message to young people and that it be time to ban vape company from advertising on sport strip 
 i thank the hon lady for her question obviously decision about kit sponsorship will rest with individual team but i agree with she that it be important that we do everything we can to tackle the scourge of teenage vaping that be why i be glad that she support our bill which will not only clamp down on marketing and availability of flavour target point of sale purchase but improve fund for trading standard to clamp down on those selling vape illegally to child 
 my husband be a veteran and the defence of the country be the government ’s duty in order to protect people across the united kingdom can the prime minister reassure the house that he have a plan in place for back our world lead armed service and do he know why the opposition refuse to back his plan 
 i start by pay tribute to my hon friend ’s husband and all our veteran for their service to our country in the most uncertain time since the cold war it be right that we build our security protect our value our interest and indeed our nation that be why this government have take the step to increase defence spending to of gdp make we the big spender in europe under nato when the labour leader stand up i hope he stop dither do the right thing and confirm that he will back our plan to increase defence spending 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i join the prime minister in his word about yesterday ’s awful event in hainault i be sure that the whole house will want to commend the responder and send our deep condolence to the family of the year old boy who be murder i join the prime minister in his remark about the attack in the school in sheffield as well 
 i know that everyone in the house will be delighted to see his majesty the king return to his public duty and look so well we all wish he and the princess of wales the good in their continue recovery 
 i welcome my hon friend   the member for central suffolk and north ipswich dr poulter   to his place on the labour benches after nearly decade as a tory politician and an nhs doctor he have conclude that if you care about the future of our country and our nhs it be time for change it be time for this change labour party as of today he be our new labour mp but i be sure he will not mind my saying that i hope he lose that title on friday when a lifelong tory and doctor say that the only cure for the nhs be a labour government be it not time that the prime minister admit that he have utterly fail 
 i be glad to actually see   the hon member for central suffolk and north ipswich dr poulter   in the house because he recently point out that resident under his local labour council be 
 charge much more in council tax but in return receive low quality 
 service he have be wrong about some thing recently but on that point he be absolutely right and this week people everywhere should vote conservative 
 the prime minister come out with all that nonsense but he lock himself away in his downing street bunker moan that people be not grateful enough to he the reality be that tory mp be follow tory voter in conclude that only the labour party can deliver the change that the country need i say to those tory voter that if they believe in a well britain they be safe with this change labour party and it be for they in the week since we last meet at the dispatch box have the prime minister manage to find the money for his completely unfunded £ promise to scrap national insurance 
 we address that a few week ago and i be happy to address it again i know that economics be not the right hon and learn gentleman ’s strong point but he would do well to listen to his shadow education secretary   the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson who just this morning say no that ’s not how it work indeed the institute for fiscal studies have also say that the link between national insurance and public service funding be illusory”—just like labour ’s economic plan however it be crystal clear that there be party that will deliver tax cut for work britain and it be the conservative party interruption 
 order whoever be bang the furniture will have to pay for it if they damage it can we have less of that we be not in the form now 
 that be a long ramble non answer to the question which be have the prime minister find the money to fund his £ promise to abolish national insurance whenever he be ask about the date of the election or about people ’s pension he act as if answer straightforward question be somehow beneath he but pensioner and those who be plan their retirement deserve well than his contempt for their question if £ be cut from its funding the value of the state pension would almost halve so i do not apologise for ask he again—[interruption 
 order mr gullis you have the next question which you be not go to reach at this rate and you have the minute rule bill i would be quiet for a while if i be you 
 i do not apologise for ask on pensioner behalf again whether the prime minister will finally rule out cut their state pension to fulfil the enormous black hole in his spending plan 
 of course we can rule that out the right hon and learn gentleman should stop scaremongere because it be thank to the triple lock that we have increase pension by £ since and they will rise in each and every year of the next parliament it be labour who always hit pensioner hard it be his mentor blair and brown who break their promise raise pension taxis by £ and deliver an insulting 75p rise in the state pension as former labour adviser just say brown destroy our pension system they do it before they will do it again labour always betray our pensioner 
 it be clear that the prime minister can not answer the question of where he be go to find this £ interruption no he have say where it   be not come from he have not say where it be come from luckily for he of his peer lord frost yes he again do know he say that to solve the problem of the tories spending plan the state pension age should be raise to understandably that will cause some alarm so will the prime minister rule out force people to delay their retirement by year and year in order to fulfil his £ black hole 
 i have answer this multiple time for the right hon and learn gentleman but i be happy to say it again the conservative party be the party that have deliver and protect the triple lock ultimately he be not worried about any of this because as we all remember he have his very own personal pension plan indeed it come with its very own special law it be call the pensions increase pension scheme for keir starmer qc regulations it be literally law for he and another for everyone else 
 the prime minister want to abolish national insurance which will cost £ and he will not tell we where the money be come from we be no close to an answer i be go to persevere last year the prime minister be apparently draw up plan to remove the winter fuel allowance from pensioner his paymaster general go a step far say 
 these be the sort of thing i think we need to look at 
 will the prime minister now rule out taking pensioner winter fuel payment off they to help fund his £ black hole 
 it be this government who just this winter provide double the winter fuel payment to support pensioner what be crystal clear be that we believe that the double taxation on work be unfair we believe that hard work should be reward which be why this week we be cut taxis by £ for everyone in work in contrast it be labour ’s new tax adviser who think that pensioner should be tax more those be his word this adviser call they codger he think that support they be a disgrace and he believe that their free tv licence be ridiculous it be labour who hit pensioner with tax after tax and they would do it all over again 
 be it any wonder that the prime minister ’s mp be follow tory voter in queue up to dump his party even the mayors who he be apparently pin his political survival on do not want to be see anywhere near he because until he start set out how he be pay for his fantasy economic he have a completely unfunded £ promise that put people ’s retirement at risk how do it feel to be day out from election with the message vote tory risk your pension 
 tomorrow voter will have a choice it will be a choice between mayors like andy street and ben houchen who be deliver or mayors like sadiq khan who simply virtue signal it be high taxis more crime and the ultra low emission zone with labour or low taxis and well service with the conservatives that be the choice from the west midlands to teesside to london there be only choice vote conservative 
 we can see the rwanda deterrent be work and we have now deport our illegal migrant but unsurprisingly labour just do not care the shadow home secretary be busy pose for pic encourage more boat to come over the leader of the labour party have say he would cancel the rwanda flight he take the knee when sign letter stop we deport foreign national offender who have commit crime such as murder and rape and he would do a deal with the eu surrender our border to legal migrant be it not right that only the conservatives will stop the boat and cut legal migration 
 my hon friend be absolutely right our plan be work legal migration the late figure show be down by and student dependant down by we all know labour ’s big idea it be to scrap the rwanda plan even when it be operational however as senior labour adviser say to andrew marr just yesterday 
 we can not just come in tear it up and have nothing to put in its place 
 i be sorry to break it to labour members but that be exactly their policy while we be get on and stop the boat all labour would do be stop the plane 
 i call the snp leader 
 on monday the armed forces minister could neither confirm nor deny that uk troop may soon be deploy on the ground in the middle east the public watching will be hop that member of this house do not have a short memory when it come to the potential deployment and involvement of our military in the middle east can i ask the prime minister to provide some much need clarity be he give active consideration to the deployment of uk force in the middle east yes or no 
 mr speaker you would not expect i to get into any operational planning detail but what i will say be that we be absolutely committed to support international effort to get more humanitarian aid into gaza which i think the whole house would support by land sea and air we have triple our aid commitment and right now together with the us cyprus and other partner we be set up a new temporary pier off the coast of gaza to get aid in as securely and quickly as possible 
 let we all be in no doubt aid be require in gaza and it be require because when people be not be bomb they be starve to death the solution to that be a ceasefire and the opening of safe ground aid route not the involvement on the ground of uk military personnel these be dramatic and potentially dangerous development so will the prime minister confirm to the house today that before he make a decision all member will be afford a vote 
 i be not go to apologise for our armed force play a lead role in support international effort to get more aid in indeed we be send royal navy support ship rfa cardigan bay to the region to support that effort the right hon gentleman   talk about this conflict the fast way to end it be to ensure that we have a hostage deal that get hostage out and aid in and for there to be a sustainable pause in the fighting it seem clear that there now be a workable offer on the table so i hope he join i in encourage all party include hamas to accept that deal so we can move towards a sustainable solution 
 my right hon friend ’s decision to cancel hs2 lead to £ for herefordshire ’s pothole and transport infrastructure hereford hospital have a new ward more bed and a new diagnostic centre on the way £ have be allocate to the river wye recovery plan inflation be down the rwanda bill have be pass and defence spending be increase do my right hon friend agree with i that if he carry on like this he be go to win the next election 
 i be thankful for my hon friend highlight the work that the government be do whether that be increase our defence spending to keep we safe secure our border with our rwanda act cut taxis by £ or raise the state pension by £ i be also pleased that locally in herefordshire we be fill in pothole help to save the river wye and improve local health service it be crystal clear that it be the conservative government who have a plan and be deliver a bright future for our country 
 in february the foreign secretary say that it would be difficult for a ground offensive on rafah to avoid harm civilian and destroy home and just yesterday the deputy foreign secretary admit that he be struggle to see how such an attack could be compliant with international humanitarian law all the sign be that netanyahu be about to defy the international community and that an attack on the palestinians shelter in rafah be imminent if that attack begin will that be the moment when the prime minister finally find the moral backbone to ban arm export to israel and if not how much more suffering have to happen before he act to prevent further uk complicity in crime against humanity 
 what the hon lady do not acknowledge at all be that israel suffer an appalling terrorist attack that kill hundred of its citizen and it do have the right to defend itself of course as i have be crystal clear we want to see humanitarian law respect and adhere to by all party too many civilian have be kill and we want to see israel take great care to avoid harm civilian i have make these point repeatedly to prime minister netanyahu specifically about the impact of any military incursion into rafah and we continue to say to the israelis at all level that we want to see more aid go in and bring about a hostage deal so that we can move towards a sustainable ceasefire 
 the increase in funding for special educational need and disability be extremely welcome but challenge around the recruitment of community paediatrician mean that some child in leighton buzzard dunstable and houghton regis be wait too long for an assessment what can the nhs do to attract more of the   additional doctor recruit under this government into community paediatric as a specialty that be incredibly rewarding and important

 hypocrisy need to be call out everyone in this house will recall the former irish prime minister in brussels with a photograph of a bomb custom post lament that any border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland be unworkable in breach of the belfast agreement and could result in such trouble again the hypocrisy of the irish government position have not be not lose on we with the irish police now task to patrol the border to protect from the unsubstantiated unfounded of asylum seeker who supposedly actually the reverse be true make their way to the republic of ireland from the uk via northern ireland will the prime minister challenge and call out   those action and confirm what representation he have make to the irish prime minister and the irish justice minister about the integrity of our uk border 
 the house will be aware that we have make commitment to avoid a hard border on the island of ireland the hon lady make a very important point that the irish government must uphold their promise too we can not have cherry picking of important international agreement the secretary of state be seek urgent clarification that there will be no disruption or police checkpoint at or near the border i can confirm that the united kingdom have no legal obligation to accept return of illegal migrant from ireland it be no surprise that our robust approach to illegal migration be provide a deterrent but the answer be not to send police to village in donegal but to work with we in partnership to strengthen our external border all around the common travel area that we share 
 i be the lord commissioner who sign into law the special pension of the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer he owe i the prime minister be right labour ’s 75p be an insult to pensioner yet last year our triple lock afford pensioner the high increase in year the prime minister be go to continue to deliver dignity in retirement be he not

 in only of the local authority area in england be nhs ambulance meet the national response time target for potential heart attack and stroke victim do the prime minister know which it be 
 when it come to ambulance waiting time in a&e of course there be work to do but the place where they be the bad in the country be in labour run wales thank to our plan we have see an improvement in a&e and ambulance time this winter compare with last winter we have more ambulance on the road fast discharge out of our emergency care centre and virtual ward bed as i say there be more to do but the contrast with labour run wales be crystal clear it have the bad a&e performance anywhere in great britain 
 for month thousand of my constituent have live with foul polluted air from the withyhedge landfill site the company be own by someone with previous conviction for environmental crime who a few month ago give £ to help vaughan gething become minister   of wales after another of his company be loan £ from the development bank of wales oversee by the then economy minister vaughan gething do the prime minister agree that this serious matter demand an independent investigation it be not some internal labour party matter ultimately that company need to get out of my constituency and let people in pembrokeshire have their quality of life back 
 my right hon friend bring up an incredibly important issue i know that people in wales be concerned about the relationship he mention i also agree with he on the need for transparency and an investigation regard the welsh labour leader because it be very clear that the situation be not at all transparent and answer be need 
 it have be reveal by the observer newspaper that the conservative candidate for the mayor of london be a member of the facebook group mention by   the hon member for edinburgh north and leith deidre brock they be full of islamophobia antisemitism and the most disgraceful incitement to damage property the bad bit for those of we who be in the house when our member of parliament be take be the death threat to the current mayor of london mr khan will the prime minister close down those facebook page which be begin by conservative member of staff and will he investigate the role of the current candidate and her membership of those disgraceful racist facebook group 
 the election tomorrow will be fight on the substance of the issue that londoner face the labour record be crystal clear house building in london have collapse knife crime be rise mayoral taxis be up and driver have be hit with ulez charge the labour mayor simply pander to union and have decimate london ’s night time economy that be his record and that be how he will be judge people across london know that they will be safe with the conservatives with low taxis and well service 
 today be staffordshire day when we celebrate all the brilliant thing about the county of staffordshire will my right hon friend join i in pay tribute to our brilliant police fire and crime commissioner ben adams and encourage the people of staffordshire to vote for ben tomorrow to ensure that staffordshire remain of the safe place to live work and visit 
 i wish everyone a happy staffordshire day my right hon friend mention the police and crime commissioner election it be right that she do because under this conservative government and previous conservative governments we have cut crime by over and deliver more police officer people with a labour police and crime commissioner be more likely to be victim of burglary and be twice as likely to be victim of robbery as i say last year knife crime in london go up by the fact speak for themselves vote conservative for safe street 
 with permission i would like to make a statement on immigration 
 the government be commit to reduce immigration both legal and illegal into the united kingdom legal immigration have rise in recent year in part because we have extend the hand of friendship to people flee conflict and persecution in ukraine hong kong and afghanistan that be the right thing to do but another factor have be the number of overseas student and worker and their dependant rise to unsustainable level the step that the secretary of state for the home department my right hon friend   the member for braintree james cleverly   announce last year to cut net migration will mean that around people who would have be eligible to come to the uk will now not be 
 we have restrict most student from bring dependent family member increase the salary that most skilled worker migrant need to earn in order to obtain a visa by nearly to £ stop overseas care worker bring dependent family member with they raise the minimum income for family visa to ensure that people be support financially and scrap the go rate salary discount for shortage occupation and replace the shortage occupation list with a new immigration salary discount list the late estimate from the office for national statistics show that net migration in the year to june be low than it be month early the figure be provisional and we need to go far but these be encourage sign 
 the late statistic show that the number apply for skilled worker health and care and study visa in the month of be down by on the same period last year we remove from   january the right of student start course other than those on postgraduate research programme and government fund scholarship to bring dependant to the uk via the student visa route the number of application for student dependant visa have fall by since our change come into force from   march we have stop overseas care worker bring family dependant here and have require social care firm in england to be register with the care quality commission to sponsor visa in the year end september an estimate dependant come here via that route in the month of the number of application for health and care visa be down by 28%—and this be just the start most of our change have only just come into force 
 meanwhile we remain committed to stop the boat follow royal assent for the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act and the ratification of our treaty with rwanda we can operationalise our plan to relocate illegal migrant to rwanda rwanda be a safe country that have repeatedly show its ability to offer asylum seeker a chance to build new and prosperous life it have a strong and successful track record of resettle people host more than refugee and it stand ready to accept thousand more who want to rebuild their life and who can not stay in the uk   once flight begin we will have add another vital deterrent to crack down on the people smuggle gang who treat human being as cargo the illegal migrant set to be remove to rwanda have now be detain follow a series of nationwide operation this week operational team within the home office have be work apace to detain safely and swiftly individual who be in scope for relocation to rwanda with more activity due to be carry out in the come week this action be a key part of the plan to deliver flight to rwanda in the next few week 
 we have make solid progress in stop the boat although we need to finish the job the number of small boat arrival fall by more than a in and our work with international partner prevent more than crossing last year as well as help to dismantle organise crime group since july our new agreement with albania have cut albanian small boat arrival by more than and we recently sign a groundbreaking deal with frontex the european border and coast guard agency which mark another crucial step in the securing of our border an initial cohort in the thousand of suitable case for removal to rwanda have be identify and place on immigration bail with strict reporting condition we have a range of measure in place to ensure that we remain in contact with individual include both face to face and digital reporting and immigration enforcement have a range of power to trace and locate any individual who abscond as well as a dedicated team of trace officer who work with the police other government agency and commercial company to help trace individual and bring they back into contact it would of course be inappropriate for i to comment far on operational activity 
 immigration have enrich this country beyond measure but it need to be sustainable and it need to be fair legal immigration should be focus on help those in genuine need and on ensure that our economy have the skill that it need in order to flourish it be simply not right for those who can afford to pay gangster to jump ahead of those who would play by the rule and whose need be great no need to flee to the uk from a safe country such as france both illegal immigration and unsustainable legal migration place intolerable burden on community and over time they will undermine support for immigration in general which would be a tragedy that be why this government have a plan which we be put into action there be furth to go but we be see its positive impact already i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement but i have to say that this really be get quite difficult to watch not for the time the minister have come to the dispatch box desperately fish for compliment when it be his government his home secretary and his prime minister who be the cause of the catastrophic state of both the work base migration and asylum system this be their bin fire their chaos yet they expect praise each time they half heartedly attempt to throw a single teacup of water towards the flame 
 net migration have treble since to a barely comprehensible under this government the number of people cross in small boat have spiral   from a few in to ten of thousand every year it be toe curlingly embarrassing to watch the minister claim that he have make solid progress on stop the boat when this year the number of crosser be at the high level on record more than between january and april 
 it be excruciatingly painful to watch the home secretary boast on social medium about remove people with no right to be here when the removal of fail asylum seeker have collapse by under this government since when the removal of foreign criminal have plummet by and when he have completely lose track of the asylum seeker he claim have be identify for deportation to rwanda it be also painful to hear government figure brag in the medium that their rwanda policy be somehow a success because a single person who do not even cross the channel on a small boat have choose to fly to rwanda voluntarily with thousand of pound of government money stuff into his pocket by the home secretary this be not a policy it be a headline chasing gimmick a fiasco and a farce 
 labour have be absolutely clear that we reject the £ rwanda scheme base on its unaffordability and unworkability it will cover only of small boat asylum seeker and the government have no plan for the other we will repurpose that money to smash the criminal smuggler gang with our new cross border police unit and a security partnership with europol crucially our new return and enforcement unit will ensure that more flight take off to other country which will remove foreign criminal fail asylum seeker and visa overstayer so that we can restore some control and integrity to our asylum system in a way that be firm fair and well manage we will also end the use of asylum hotel and other inappropriate accommodation for asylum seeker which be cost the british taxpayer million of pound every single day 
 it be painful to hear the minister brag today about the reduction in the number of health and social care visa award as a way of bring down net migration because it be base on such a small data sample secondly because this be only sector of the economy and thirdly because the minister seem to care not iota what the reduction in worker will mean for our elderly parent where be the impact assessment and where be the plan to recruit local talent 
 can the minister explain why net migration have treble since his party pledge during the general election to lower it will he admit that the huge surge in work base migration over recent year be evidence of this government ’s total failure to deliver on domestic skill and training labour push the government into scrap the unfair wage discount for job on the shortage occupation list which allow company to undercut british worker by hire overseas can he explain why it take so long for his party to steal our policy 
 on asylum home office source have tell the times that only to detention space be reserve for migrant who be due for deportation to rwanda can the minister confirm that this equate to less than of the current asylum backlog in the uk the prime minister promise to detain everyone who have cross   the channel on a small boat over last year give that we have only detention space what will happen to the remain 
 the government ’s immigration and asylum policy have fail we need to put the grown up back in charge so that we can fix this break system and once again give our country an asylum and immigration system that it can be proud of 
 what a quite extraordinary response the fact be that this be a government who have a credible plan to bring net migration down by and all those measure be now in flight as i have be able to set out for the house it be begin to deliver the result we say it would deliver 
 i will take no lecture from the shadow front bench about the issue of domestic employment i be of the ministers in the department for work and pensions that be proud to bring forward the back to work plan and the comprehensive reform of the welfare system that we be take forward as a government we be also see enormous cross government join up to support more domestic worker into those role that be the right thing to do to support people in this country to take on those role and fill those vacancy and let we not forget the record of every single labour government without fail they leave unemployment higher at the time of leave office than it be at the start under this government we have see record low unemployment benefit community across the country 
 we have begin the process of deliver the measure in relation to legal migration and we be also deliver when it come to illegal migration we have a plan we be now get on and close hotels—150 asylum hotel have be close that be a positive thing it be the right thing to do to make sure that we accommodate people in appropriate accommodation but get away from the model of provide hotel accommodation for people what be labour ’s plan on that we have see massive gain when it come to asylum decision making and productivity around those process what be labour ’s policy on that we have see crossing down by over a last year compare with the year before we have see albanian arrival fall by again what be labour ’s offering to achieve likewise there be n’t 
 we will continue to sustain the progress that we have make and we know from everything that have be say in recent day that the rwanda policy be begin to have the desire effect the deterrent be clear when it come to the hon gentleman ’s meagre offering i would just say that we have already double funding for the national crime agency for organise immigration crime work and we already have approximately official work on these matter within migration and border that be all that labour members be offer it virtually resemble a blank sheet of paper the truth be that they offer no deterrent they have nowhere to send people they have no plan they have no solution they try to bluff that they do but they be kid nobody they be terrified that our plan be go to work they be terrified that they will have to scrap it and they be terrified that they have no alternative only we have a plan it be deliver result and we will see it through 
 again no hint of a plan for how we deal with fail asylum seeker from country to which they can not be   return without the rwanda scheme i be pleased with the progress that the minister have make on reduce net migration but i be worried about the figure that come out yesterday of the migrant who have be identify for removal only can be locate this reflect the evidence from the permanent secretary to the home affairs committee early in the year when some fail asylum seeker who should have be remove could not be locate where be these people and what be the department do about track they down and make sure that they can be remove as need to happen as swiftly as possible 
 my hon friend will appreciate that i can not go into the granularity of the operational work that be ongoing to ensure that we can deliver on this policy but i can say that an initial cohort of suitable case of around people have be identify for removal and they have be place on immigration bail with strict reporting condition 
 for those outside that group there be still a wide range of tool to maintain contact with they that include as i say early face to face and digital reporting and many individual also reside within home office accommodation the minister for counter illegal migration my right hon and learn friend   the member for mid dorset and north poole michael tomlinson   lead on this work and he be confident of the whereabouts once the decision to detain be make and this be just of the cohort of people who may be eligible for removal to rwanda the policy be clear and we be get on and operationalise it that include detain people for the purpose of relocation 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 it be hard to know where to start with this complete and utter drivel the minister come here today proud of this tawdry pathetic self defeat piece of fascist nonsense—[interruption the tories—[interruption they do not like it but it be true and i will explain to they why the home office have put out—[interruption mr speaker they do not like the truth the home office have issue a promo video this morning of people be detain and it absolutely turn my stomach this be a government who glorify their state sponsor people traffic plan as they cuff people and take they out of their bed to be send to another country against their will it be sicken 
 these plan be damaging to our society to our economy to the people who need care and to the people who want to love live and study here university be up in arm about the cut to student number it make absolutely no sense the draft rule that the government have issue on adult at risk in immigration detention be release this week but instead of take action on the serious recommendation of the brook house inquiry the home office be instead double down on its policy of indefinite detention and labour members be go along with all of this shame on they 
 far from what the minister say small boat arrival be up this year rwanda be no deterrent because none of their other policy have prove a deterrent the thousand of people they want to send there have disappear never to be see again and who can really   blame they if they be go to be pluck from their bed and take away by ministers and send to country against their will indeed who can blame they the risk be that these people will end up be exploit because they have go into hiding they will be exploit they will be traffic and they will be vulnerable why be the minister not acknowledge the impact that this policy will have on vulnerable people 
 finally if it be indeed the case that the person the government send to rwanda have not be grant refugee status in this country why be they not be return to their country of origin be it perhaps that that country be actually unsafe if that be true why be they not give refugee status here in the place 
 it be a perfectly respectable position to want to protect our border it be right and proper to want to ensure that we have a fair and balanced system of legal migration that be sustainable i make no apology whatsoever and nor will this government or any of the ministers in the home office for place front and centre the determination to protect people ’s life we have see too many life lose in the channel at the hand of evil criminal gang with no regard whatsoever for human life who take people ’s money exploit they and send they out to sea in unseaworthy vessel candidly beyond that i be not go to edify the hon lady ’s contribution with anything far 
 i very much welcome the fact that the minister be able to come to this house with the encouraging sign of low migration number which will be welcome widely outside this house include i suspect in scotland do he agree that the lesson we should draw from this be that take practical detailed measure to crack down on the exploitation of certain type of visa route be the way to make progress on bring immigration number down rather than the windy rhetoric we hear from the opposition spokesman 
 my right hon friend be a distinguished former home office minister who have responsibility in the immigration space and i would argue that a lot of the measure that we have announce and that be now all in flight build on the early effort of colleague such as he he be absolutely right that the policy be balance and measure and that they deliver on the legitimate aim of want to reduce inflow of legal migration into our country to ensure fairness to ensure that the model be sustainable and to ensure that people who come here be able to be properly support i think that that be something that the british people strongly support and i entirely share his sentiment 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 the national audit office estimate that it will cost £ per person to fly people to rwanda can the minister tell the house which airline he will use to transport people to rwanda what be his estimate of the number of people who will be send to rwanda in the month of operate the policy 
 the chairman of the select committee for whom i have enormous respect and admiration will understand why i be not go to get into operationally   or commercially sensitive matter on the floor of the house we have consistently see great effort to thwart this policy in a whole host of sens over the course of week month and year we will not be thwart we have make commitment and we will get on with deliver this policy there be a plan and as the prime minister have say we will send a flight within the next to week that be where our focus lie and it would be entirely inappropriate to share the logistic on the floor of the house 
 as mass migration have be show to depress gdp per capita and as it be clear that it be easy to control the much high number of legal migrant may i encourage the government to return to their promise of have migration in the ten of thousand 
 again i be not go to set out today what the government ’s future ambition may be what i be able to say be that we have a package of measure that be deliver a reduction of in net migration span various different route i think it be a very credible offer to meet the ambition of the british people to bring those number down not least for the reason that my right hon friend touch on legal migration to this country need to be sustainable when we consider for example that we see care worker come with dependant i do not think that any fair minded person would by any objective yardstick think that that be a reasonable position that be why we be bring it to an end and i be pleased that the measure we have introduce be deliver result 
 the times report this morning that the number of visa grant for care worker in march this year be down on the figure for march do the minister expect that reduction to continue if he do who will do the work that those carer would have do and what impact do he think it might have on the national health service 
 we have commit to monthly reporting on the net migration measure we have introduce to allow parliament and other to take a view on our progress there be extensive effort across government to employ more people from our domestic labour force i wish liberal democrat members be as enthusiastic as i be about the back to work plan and our work on recruitment and retention we be take forward those credible effort to try to support more people in this country into these role we be also work intensively to improve the process for rematche individual who be already here on health and social care visa these be the right step to take and i will not pre empt what the figure might look like in the coming month the right hon gentleman will be able to look at they in the same way as everybody else 
 it be interesting to hear the minister ’s comment and to see the impact of thing that i think it be safe to say he and i would have want to do slightly early such as abolish the discount on the sol do he agree that the core problem be that   all too often people see immigration as an alternative to policy that affect the domestic labour market rather than as something that support those policy sector and business that will be very keen to have a meeting with he in his new role be not quite so keen to meet he when he be try to promote the disability confident scheme as minister for disabled people what be the government ’s plan to make sure that future migration policy clearly link up with our wide policy for the uk labour market and to make sure that it be not open to lobby to try to avoid it 
 my hon friend speak with real authority and experience on this issue i recall our conversation in our previous ministerial role and he be absolutely right that immigration ought not to be the port of call in meet our skill need and fill vacancy that be why the government have a co ordinated plan with our immigration policy our back to work plan our health and disability benefit reform and our reform in a host of other area that should be our focus i would argue that there be a strong moral case that invest in our domestic labour force to get people into vacancy be the right thing to do where there need to be a practical approach to migration we should look at it but it most definitely should not be the port of call 
 i welcome the comment on legal migration which be very important to many sector in northern ireland 
 on the important and perplexing issue of illegal migration can the minister say something about what the irish republic ’s government say this week about push back returnee to northern ireland can he confirm that the irish justice minister make up the fact that of the problem stem from northern ireland will he say something about the republic of ireland ’s court claim that the united kingdom be an unsafe destination to return people to in the instance will he please assure i that northern ireland will not become a dumping ground for the right wing problem be face across the eu 
 as the prime minister have rightly say include at prime minister ’s question we be not go to accept return from the eu via ireland when the eu do not accept return to france from where illegal migrant be come to the united kingdom the uk government ’s position be clear we have regular and ongoing work on the abuse of the common travel area which be right and proper we also stand by our obligation under the good friday agreement i would argue that the prime minister have make our position very clear 
 chelmsford be a very welcoming community we have welcome ukrainian refugee the family of those brave afghans who stand beside our soldier and the hong kong chinese we have amazing domestic abuse service and we have welcome woman and their family from all over london and the south east who be flee violent man we have build thousand of new home and because the labour mayor of london have so spectacularly fail to build new home we have welcome social housing tenant from all across london but this can not go on we have   family who be unable to find a home in temporary accommodation we have to control migration i be delighted that the minister be close hotel will he please close the atlantic hotel and the legg street flat in chelmsford chelmsford have welcome so many and we can not home everyone 
 i be very mindful that my right hon friend ’s community in chelmsford have be incredibly generous the uk government have be deliver work in conjunction with community to provide sanctuary for those flee the most dreadful conflict around the world include in ukraine afghanistan and syria as well as those flee the situation in hong kong she be also right to touch on the abuse of route which be precisely why we be introduce great care quality commission oversight and accreditation of the health and social care visa system 
 i hear my right hon friend ’s representation on accommodation on which we have have conversation reduce inflow be critical to allow we to get on with closing hotel across the country and to get the accommodation picture into a more manageable state it be clear that only this government have a credible plan to reduce the inflow of people come here illegally via small boat across the channel we will see that through to make sure that we can get on with close more hotel 
 as the policy be roll out it be see to be the brutal and inhumane financial fiasco that it be asylum seeker be detain as they turn up for their normal monthly reporting yesterday cause immense distress a number of they will inevitably be send to the detention centre in my constituency we have experience of what happen when people be distressed in this way we have see suicide self harm and mental breakdown can i have an assurance from the minister that the charity that support asylum seeker in detention include care4calais will have direct access to these detain individual and that these individual will have access to legal advice 
 there be of course establish process whereby people can access the support that be appropriate in the circumstance i have a principled disagreement with the right hon gentleman on this point about detention and i recognise that those in the scottish national party do not support detention either for the purpose of removal however where people be here who have no right to be here i think it be appropriate that they be detain for the purpose of removal that be do entirely properly in accordance with the law with the proper safeguard around it as ever that will continue to be the case during the ongoing work as part of the rwanda relocation 
 i welcome the statement and in particular the news that in some category at least immigration be finally begin to fall on asylum specifically the irish foreign minister and former taoiseach micheál martin complain bitterly just a few day ago that large number of asylum seeker be move from northern ireland into the irish republic sky news report yesterday that the irish government be seriously contemplate move police officer to the border to interdict that   flow in effect that would create a hard border on the island of ireland some of we be lecture for year include by today ’s opposition spokesman that the irish government would never contemplate that in any circumstance so the stench of hypocrisy be strong will the minister assure i that we will never allow the republic to return those people to northern ireland unless and until we can remove illegal cross channel migrant to france as for the contemptible remark of the snp spokesman let i say that at least the uk have a government which be more than we can say for scotland this week 
 my right hon friend know that this government be resolutely oppose to a hard border on the island of ireland i understand that the secretary of state for northern ireland have request an urgent meeting with the irish government to seek assurance that there will be no adverse implication for the smooth operation of either the common travel area or the good friday agreement that be an important meeting and he be right to seek it i reiterate that we would welcome a return agreement with the eu we think it be right that we explore those opportunity and we will continue to pursue that 
 when i be elect to this house we often debate safe and legal route but we do not hear much about that any more many of my constituent be write to i because they want a family reunion scheme for their relative in gaza i recently co author a report with helena kennedy recommend that the uk government have a humanitarian visa for woman in afghanistan and iraq will the minister therefore tell i whether the government have any plan to announce any safe and legal route before the next general election 
 i be sure the hon and learn lady have follow the position closely through the illegal migration act we make a commitment which be reflect in the legislation to publish the cap and the statutory instrument that sit alongside it which will support our effort to provide resettlement opportunity in this country for people in the year ahead that work be on track and we will deliver on that commitment and i will be able to say more in due course 
 in december care england appear before my select committee and tell we that the care sector have be blindside by the change to ban overseas care worker from bring dependant to the uk the government ’s impact assessment say that the policy would not affect the number of those apply to come here and help look after our constituent yet today ’s figure show that care worker application have decrease by more than half we all want to see a care sector sustain by domestic labour why would not we however with vacancy to the end of march this year be that decrease the intention or the unintended consequence of these change 
 as i have consistently describe the situation on dependant have be unsustainable as i say in answer to an early question we see dependant come with care worker that position could not realistically continue to be sustain we be in the very early stage of the delivery   of these measure the health and social care change have only just come into force my hon friend will want to satisfy himself on this have look at the figure across a number of month but i reiterate that there be huge opportunity associate with domestic recruitment and enormous work be go on in government with a focus on retention that be the right way to deal with these challenge but a health and social care visa route be still available for people it be not unreasonable to think that in future individual without dependant will come they will still be able to come and that be entirely appropriate 
 when the minister give a statement to the house he say that the government have extend the hand of friendship to those flee persecution and oppression be he aware that a considerable number of people who be in calais or who have cross the channel and try to get to this country be victim of human right abuse environmental disaster and war some of which this country have be involve in such as in afghanistan his answer be to demonise they and to try to force they to go to rwanda should he not think for a moment of a sense of humanity about people in a desperate situation through no fault of their own look for a place of safety in a country that be involve in the war in afghanistan in the place 
 i be exceptionally proud of the work that this country support by the home office and its team have do as part of the enormous resettlement effort we have take forward in recent year only last week i have the real privilege to spend some time with a team who have be support new afghan arrival through the afghan citizen resettlement scheme i be incredibly move by that work those individual have come through a safe and legal route and we will continue to see those commitment through the uk have play its part and it will continue to do so but what be not right in any sense be to give the impression that anybody ought to be get in a small boat have pay an evil criminal gang to do so and come across the channel and risk their life we see a young girl lose her life only last week nobody need to leave those french shore in order to find safety we do have safe and legal route and it be right that people come through those 
 month after the government announce that they be take over the whole of raf scampton and put migrant there not a single have arrive we have fight the home office to a complete standstill and everything we have say have be prove correct the cost be rise exponentially from £ to £ and the building be decay as be the runway the labour party have now join i in my early day motion against this proposal we have involve the levelling up secretary who be now impose all sort of condition on the home office will the excellent class minister before we today now ensure that his attention be laser focused on work with we and do what we have argue for from the beginning release the entire site to scampton holdings so that we can get the big and good levelling up we have ever have on a former raf base 
 my right hon friend be a tireless campaigner for his constituent he know that i be exceptionally sympathetic to try to deliver this regeneration project for lincolnshire i appreciate entirely the enormous economic benefit and opportunity that it present for people in the scampton area from a perspective of not only amenity but job we be work intensively with he and with the local authority to move this forward we do of course need to realise our accommodation ambition for that site in the short term but i also want to find and agree a way forward that mean that those regeneration ambition can also be realise as quickly as possible 
 we now know that it be the government ’s intention to pay board and lodge for year for anyone voluntarily remove to rwanda that commitment will fall heavily on the next government if this be even successful in get anyone to rwanda so how much be this nonsense go to cost 
 it be fair to say that if we be to adopt the approach of the labour front benchers which the hon gentleman no doubt subscribe to we would continue to have uncontrolle immigration to our country via the channel he offer no alternative solution to the that the government be take forward that be an unsustainable position i be confident that the rwanda policy will help to bring to an end the channel crossing put the evil criminal gang out of business and get the issue under control that have to be right what be clearly unacceptable be to parade around with no credible policy alternative and just pretend that everything be go to be okay
