the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion he have have with party leader on the restoration of power sharing in northern ireland 
 what recent progress he have make on the restoration of political institution in northern ireland 
 what step his department plan to take to help restore power sharing in northern ireland 
 what recent discussion he have have with party leader on the restoration of power sharing in northern ireland 
 it will not have escape your notice mr speaker that year ago on   january the northern ireland assembly reform the minister effectively collapse the institution and power sharing by resign on   february 
 behind these question be a desire for the return of power sharing and the northern ireland executive a desire that i very much share hence my most recent discussion with the leader of most of the political party that take place in hillsborough on monday when we discuss the very many matter relate to this goal 
 negotiation with the democratic unionist party have be ongoing for quite some time and they have not yet result in the restoration of the executive what do the secretary of state think the dup be look for 
 i can not answer for the dup and would never seek to do so but behind all this be the concern that it have about the northern ireland protocol as we leave the european union and how as a consequence good be gradually be remove from northern ireland ’s supermarket shelf a visible sign that northern ireland be be pull away from the united kingdom ’s sphere of influence and into the european sphere i believe the windsor framework set that straight 
 i very much welcome the secretary of state ’s commitment to a £ financial package however we be seemingly at an impasse he will be aware that there be a groundswell of opinion that believe element of the package should be release to address the ongoing crisis in our public service and in particular public sector pay pressure will he consider release some of that money to address public sector pay 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and indeed for the way in which he and his party have conduct themselves in the talk to try to restore the executive the uk government put an extremely fair and generous package for a restore executive worth £ on the table before christmas the money that northern ireland civil servant and i have available be from the budget pass in this place in the last year 
 i be recently in county kildare with the minister of state and the british irish parliamentary assembly work to build understanding between the country we hear from irish ministers and the ambassador about the impact of the lack of a function northern ireland assembly bear that in mind and the struggle that we know people be have in northern ireland with their bill potential strike action and all kind of issue can the secretary of state say a bit more about what he be do and about the meeting and conversation he be have to work at pace to try to get a solution 
 i thank the hon lady both for her interest and for the sentiment behind her question a huge amount be happen include meeting galore with all the political party in northern ireland and especially the democratic unionist party because it be the dup that i need to get on board so that the executive can be restore the hon lady say at pace and we will happily work at whatever pace we can but it be slightly determine by our interlocutor 
 the current industrial action be due to hard press public servant feel that they be at the end of their tether would it not be well if the assembly be function normally so that this could be resolve as soon as possible 
 yes the hon lady be exactly right there be a fair and generous £ package on the table for a restore executive to use for this purpose and many other as everyone involve in northern ireland politic understand there be a need to transform public service in northern ireland and this package would help to do that too 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i commend my right hon friend for his effort to try to restore the assembly and the executive with a big offer be it not right that be direct rule to be contemplate we would now need primary legislation follow the st andrews agreement the political reality be that it would mean huge political pressure on all of we here not only from within our united kingdom but from outside do he agree that the good way to preserve our   great united kingdom be for everyone to get back around the table and to govern northern ireland from stormont 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for his question and welcome his election as chair of the northern ireland affairs committee probably more than some other member will i look to a certain member on the benches opposite he be absolutely right in what he say there be no way this government want to go down the route of direct rule which would need primary legislation we do not want to go down the route of joint authority either and we will not do so we need to find an appropriate form to allow the executive to reform which be what we be work unbelievably hard on with our colleague in northern ireland 
 do my right hon friend agree that it be deeply regrettable that the taoiseach leo varadkar be pander to his domestic audience rather than think of the great good of northern ireland and the victim of the trouble 
 my right hon friend make a very fair point because in the midst of everything we be try to do to get the executive back up and run the republic of ireland ’s decision to take an inter state case out against the uk government on our northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act which be design to bring justice and information recovery to victim of the trouble be unhelpful and unfortunate we have make our representation very plain on that matter 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 now that the talk have conclude with the house have vote overwhelmingly to support the windsor framework back in march labour members stand by our commitment to implement it if we be to be in government and we support the effort the government be make to restore the institution furthermore it be worth point out that there would be no prospect of negotiate with the european union further arrangement of benefit to northern ireland if the uk be to renege again on an international agreement it have sign will the secretary of state confirm that if the executive be not restore by tomorrow evening he will need to bring forward legislation to postpone the election 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question and for his affirmation of the work do on the windsor framework obviously i will be do everything i can to ensure that it be not a labour government who come in to do any of this in the future however he be right to say that as of midnight on thursday tomorrow night i will need to bring in primary legislation because a duty fall on i to call an election for the northern ireland assembly i have a number of week i believe it be in which to do that and i intend to bring in legislation on these matter next week 
 i be grateful for that clarification the absence of the executive and the failure to sort out the urgent question of public sector pay be go to result in the big strike in northern ireland for many year   tomorrow some worker have not have a pay rise for almost year that be not sustainable as we await the restoration of the institution the party leader and indeed the head of the civil service in northern ireland have all call on the secretary of state to release the money for pay which he have say be available will he now do so so that public sector worker in northern ireland can get the pay increase they deserve 
 i be acutely aware of the industrial action schedule for tomorrow and the detrimental impact it will have on public service i hear the call from the right hon gentleman and other to step in but let i put this into a slightly different context public sector pay be devolve to northern ireland and he will know that as i mention early this parliament set the budget for northern ireland this year with primary legislation he will also know that decision on matter such as this be obviously one that locally elect ministers should take as they involve big and fundamental choice every penny spend on pay be a penny not spend on service choice on this be therefore eminently political indeed they be as close as we would get to the choice make in the period of direct rule direct rule be absolutely not the way forward these decision be for the executive and a restore executive have a generous financial package available to they to do exactly as the right hon gentleman wish 
 the secretary of state will know that northern ireland can benefit from power sharing arrangement only when those institution enjoy the support and confidence of both the nationalist and unionist community i think i have previously hear he accept that the northern ireland protocol do not enjoy the support of any unionist in northern ireland despite reference to talk have conclude in december the secretary of state helpfully indicate on monday this week that further progress have be make do he accept that the restoration of institution will be secure only when that confidence within the unionist community be put where it need to be 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and for the many many hour of work that he personally have put into the talk we have be have they be detailed talk and it be a complex situation i have say before because it be absolutely obvious that the unionists in northern ireland be deeply unhappy with the exist northern ireland protocol i believe we have make excellent progress i hope that in the come day and week we can get to a point where his party can come to a conclusion on those talk that lead we to reform the executive because i know that he be a democrat and want it reform 
 i appreciate the secretary of state ’s remark he will have hear the concern around the general strike which will be call tomorrow he will know that his government dismiss our call when we say that there simply be not sufficient money he know we have to battle for sufficient money and that in the run up to christmas he personally secure the availability of that money the release of the fund be call for by the dup every political party in northern ireland the head of the northern ireland civil service and this morning chief executive of public sector   agency across northern ireland i do not believe there be a lack of will on the secretary of state ’s part but this be a choice a political choice that the government can make will the secretary of state use today to encourage his government colleague the treasury and anyone else who believe that use public sector worker as blackmail or political pawn be beneficial in any way 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and the way that he put it as i mention early public sector pay be devolve and be properly a matter for locally elect politician who be well place to take decision in that space 
 what progress he have make on allocate funding to help tackle the impact of flooding in northern ireland 
 in the absence of the executive this government have make up to £ of support available for business and non domestic property through the reallocation of exist funding it be for the northern ireland civil service and local council to consider how to utilise the remain fund to provide further support to business and non domestic property 
 building resilience for the future be vital if this government be to address the challenge around climate change york ’s resilience measure cost over £ to protect my city this winter but the estimate cost to business in newry alone be £ as a result of the winter weather when will the minister bring forward a proper amount of money not just £ which may be a deposit to ensure that northern ireland can build its resilience for the future 
 i will answer in a couple of way only just over £ of that £ have be draw down which be a sign that the amount be sufficient secondly the northern ireland civil service have recently announce that up to £ have be make available to assist small and medium sized business with up to £ available per business the experience of her constituent i have the figure in front of i show that this government be commit to our infrastructure be ready for the future that be partly why we be so keen to see the executive back with a large package to help support the stabilisation and transformation of public service so we can get the kind of investment she refer to 
 what recent discussion he have have with the administration in northern ireland on the effect of increase in the cost of live on people in northern ireland 
 what recent discussion he have have with the administration in northern ireland on the effect of increase in the cost of live on people in northern ireland 
 what recent discussion he have have with the administration in northern ireland on the effect of increase in the cost of live on people in northern ireland 
 the government have take decisive action to help tackle increase in the cost of living include support for the most vulnerable household in northern ireland we be target support this winter through a range of measure include cost of live payment of £ it remain vital that there be a function executive in place that can deliver for the people of northern ireland who deserve that stable government take the relevant decision 
 i want to return to the subject of public sector pay public sector worker in northern ireland have see their real pay fall by more than over the past year do that not demonstrate that the uk government ’s response to the cost of living crisis be leave northern ireland behind i encourage the minister to join the cross party call to ensure that public sector worker in northern ireland be fairly pay for their important work 
 i be grateful that the hon gentleman raise this matter again he will have hear what my right hon friend the secretary of state say i wish to emphasise that the money that have be make available in what be a large package for stabilisation and transformation in northern ireland include a sum of money to enable public sector pay to be settle but that be a matter to be decide in northern ireland that be why we continue to press the dup and other party with as much force as we can muster to restore the assembly and the executive to deal with that 
 give that the uk be experience the big drop in living standard on record with household bear the brunt of high energy cost and temperature drop dramatically this week across northern ireland and indeed scotland why have the uk government leave household out in the cold this winter 
 i do not accept that we have leave household in the cold further cost of live support through the winter period for northern ireland household be announce in the autumn statement in with additional payment to household across the uk those on mean test benefit be get £ those on disability benefit £ and pensioner household £ we be resolve to promote prosperity in northern ireland and we be seize of the reality that disposable income in northern ireland be particularly squeeze that be why we have put in a range of measure to promote prosperity which i hope to return to in later answer 
 we have just hear the minister say that income in northern ireland be particularly squeeze in november the typical monthly pay in northern ireland see a month on month fall of by contrast typical wage in the uk show a month on month increase that mean that earning in northern ireland sit below uk earning the big difference on record what step be be take now in the absence of a function stormont to offer some kind of sustainable pay deal in northern ireland for public sector worker 
 mr speaker i could give a lengthy answer to the hon lady ’s question which would try your patience so i will just return to her final question on what be be do for public sector worker we be absolutely seize as we have say previously of the need to ensure that public sector worker have a pay rise that be why a very substantial sum be in the package on the table for the party none the less we be absolutely clear that on this issue as across a wide field of other about which i be sure we will hear in the course of these question northern ireland need devolve government to take the relevant decision in northern ireland and on that there be consensus across the house 
 the government ’s package to support people with the cost of living amount to about £ over year it be of the most comprehensive in europe can my right hon friend assure the house that people in northern ireland as an integral part of our united kingdom have have full access to those cost of live support measure 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right the extent of government support for northern ireland household be unprecedented it include the energy price guarantee on electricity and gas bill £ in payment comprise £ for energy bill support scheme payment plus £ to recognise the widespread use of home heating oil and target support for the most vulnerable household some of which i have already touch on she be right that we be determined to ensure that northern ireland feel the benefit of be in the union of this united kingdom 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i recently meet the melted parents campaign group in belfast it speak for so many parent across northern ireland where the cost of living crisis be far hard for family because there be no funding for a free childcare scheme or the or hour of pre school just eye watering and unaffordable bill but there be a cross party childcare strategy proposal will the minister say for all the employer and parent watch if there be a new temporary budget for northern ireland whether it will include childcare funding provision 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for raise this issue it be of the high importance in northern ireland and it be impress upon i frequently the budget will be debate in this house of course and i be confident that we will return to it as we have say before this be of those issue that underscore the importance of the executive return and i be grateful that we agree on that point she be absolutely right to raise the issue 
 i call martin docherty hughes interruption 
 what recent discussion he have have with the administration in northern ireland on ensure timely payment from the trouble permanent disablement payment scheme to eligible individual 
 like the hon member i too be quite surprised that he be that popular interruption i be sorry i misread the room again 
 the trouble permanent disablement payment scheme be a devolved matter deliver by the victim payments board i meet judge mcalinden the president of the board last week to discuss those matter 
 accord to recent evidence present to the northern ireland affairs committee this be actually very serious it be not a joke so maybe member would like to listen it could take more than year to process the application for the trouble victim compensation scheme mean that victim in northern ireland who have wait decade for compensation to be deliver will need to wait even long can the secretary of state advise not only the house but those await payment what his government be do to deliver that compensation scheme 
 as i say have meet judge mcalinden i be conduct a review of the operation of the scheme which will report before august this year the review be under way and i very much hope that it will address all those matter so that those who qualify for the payment get they in a much more expedited way 
 i call snp spokesperson 
 give the length of time it take in many case to gather the support evidence to make a claim under the scheme the pressure on the payment board itself and the strong likelihood that many of those who be potentially eligible be yet to apply it be clear that there be a risk that many who could be eligible for a payment might miss out as thing stand way the secretary of state could mitigate that be by extend the period allow for claim to be make and process as part of the review will he consider extend that deadline 
 yes that be actually part of the review and of the question we be look at 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to strengthen northern ireland ’s place in the union 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i wish to reassure he that the uk government be fully commit to protect and uphold northern ireland ’s place in the union i regularly discuss matter of the union and the importance of northern ireland within it with cabinet colleague and frequently meet the secretaries of state for wales and for scotland 
 would my right hon friend agree that the union be now strong than ever particularly with the decline of the snp and that its vital importance can be see not only in northern ireland but in border constituency such as mine clwyd south particularly in share service across the border with neighbouring   north shropshire such as the gobowen to wrexham line the a5 a483 and the chirk st martin ’s gp partnership 
 as we can see all politic be local and i congratulate my hon friend on the success of shared cross border service in his constituency he be absolutely right i know he be a great champion of connectivity across the united kingdom and i be sure that his constituent appreciate his effort on those matter 
 every devious deceitful and dishonest tactic be be use to try to bribe bully and beat unionists into accept the windsor framework and the northern ireland protocol despite the impact it have on our citizenship and on the union it seem that the late recruit be the chairman of the northern ireland affairs committee   the right hon and learn member for south swindon sir robert buckland who only this week tell the bbc that unionist should get back to stormont because constitutional issue be the responsibility of the eu and the irish government in any settlement would have a say in the future of northern ireland can the secretary of state confirm that this conservative and unionist government have not hand constitutional control of northern ireland to the eu and that the chairman of the northern ireland affairs committee have either become an over zealous advocate of the scare tactic or be talk through his hat 
 i see you be as brief as ever 
 mr speaker—[interruption base on that cheer the select committee chair have a lot of work to do to increase his popularity in this house as ever the right hon gentleman ask a question in his characteristic shrink violet way i completely disagree with what he say about my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland we need to get a deal do now the people of northern ireland want to get a deal do it be time for a deal to be do let we get the executive back up and run 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question i be pleased to inform the house that since last week we have be provide british sign language coverage on all question and statement as a matter of course this be available directly on parliamentlive.tv and it be also available to broadcaster and medium outlet who may be interested in take up the live feed i be delighted that the house service have be able to deliver this significant improvement in the accessibility of our proceeding 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday january 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 accord to the alzheimer ’s society nearly people be currently live with dementia in my colne valley constituency of whom have have a formal diagnosis that figure go up by this week with my dad ’s diagnosis my dad be my constituent will my right hon friend pledge to make dementia a priority by drive up diagnosis rate bolster dementia research invest in social care and improve access to the most innovative diagnostic method and to new life change treatment 
 i send my warm wish to my hon friend and his father and family i recognise that a dementia diagnosis can bring worry both for the person who be diagnose and for their wide family he be absolutely right about the timely diagnosis of dementia it be vital to ensure that those affect can access the care and support they need nhs england be carry out a pilot to ensure that we can improve dementia diagnosis in care home and our major condition strategy include a focus on dementia crucially as he say we be now double the funding for dementia research so that we can help everyone include his father 
 we now come to the leader of the opposition 
 i send my good wish to   the hon member for colne valley jason mccartney   and his father and to all those suffering in that way 
 i can not let today pass without say how saddened i be by the tragic death of bronson battersby age just who die in heartbreaking circumstance in skegness i know that the house will join i in send our deep sympathy to his family 
 the government have be force to admit that they have lose contact with of the people earmark for removal to rwanda have the prime minister find they yet 
 what i can tell the right hon and learn gentleman be that in spite of he seek to block every single attempt that we have make we have now manage because of our action to reduce the number of people come here by over a last year to remove more than people from this country back to their home country to carry out more illegal immigration enforcement raid to arrest hundred of people to close down thousand of bank account and to process more than case the big number in more than year that be because on the conservative side of the house we want to stop the boat we have a plan and it be work with he we would just go back to square 
 my thought be how do you actually lose people then i remember that this be the government who scrap high speed but the cost be still rise by billion this be the government who spend £ of taxpayer money on a rwanda scheme yet can not deport a single person and this be the government who wag a week long war on the greek prime minister for reason know only to themselves and suddenly i remember that of course this farce of a government could lose the people they be plan to remove the prime minister do not   answer the question so i will ask he again where be the people the government have lose where be they 
 as i say we have actually identify and remove over people from this country back to where they belong the right hon and learn gentleman ask these question about the rwanda scheme but it be important that we get it up and run because it be important as the national crime agency say that we have a work deterrent in order to resolve this issue that be how australia solve the problem and that be how albania have work for we he ask these question about the detail of those thing but we all know that he do not actually care about solve the problem we know that because the bbc quiz he ask 
 if the number cross the channel on small boat decline i.e. so it ’ work would you still reverse it 
 the labour leader say yes it be crystal clear that he do not have a plan and it will be back to square 
 spend £ on not get anybody to rwanda while lose people be not a plan it be a farce only this government could waste hundred of million of pound on a removal policy that do not remove anyone only this government could claim that they will get flight off the ground only to discover that they can not find a plane only this government could sign a removal deal with rwanda only to end up take people from rwanda to here the prime minister still have not answer the question so i will try again what progress have he make in locate the people his government have apparently lose he have dodge it time where be they 
 it be the same thing again and again here we be talk about what we be do and i be happy to go over it what be we do we have increase the number of illegal immigration enforcement raid by lead to thousand of arrest use power that the right hon and learn gentleman seek to block in this house we have close down thousand of bank account of illegal worker again use power that he seek to block—[interruption 
 order mr ashworth do you want that early cup of tea or will you be silent 
 as i say we have work through a record number of case and return a record number of people back to where they come from all that be a plan that be work and we can see that it be work because the number of people come to this country be down by over a again it be a bit rich to hear the right hon and learn gentleman pretend here that he care about how we actually stop the boat when he have be crystal clear in say that even if the plan to reduce the number be work he would still scrap it that be because he have no value no conviction and no plan it be back to square 
 more 
 order no 
 the prime minister do not have a clue where they be have he i can tell you place they be not and that be rwanda the only people he have send to rwanda be cabinet ministers for all the word the ridiculous thing be that we know the prime minister himself do not even believe in this rwanda gimmick he have to be talk out of scrap the whole thing he do not want to fund it he do not think it would work when he see his party tear itself apart hundred of bald man scrap over a single broken comb do he not wish that he have have the courage to stick to his gun 
 i have absolute conviction that the plan we have put in place will work because i believe it be important that we grip this problem the right hon and learn gentleman spend a lot of his time in this house talk about his time as a lawyer and i would urge he to listen to lawyer because lord wolfson have say that our bill severely limit the ground for removal eminent king ’s counsel have say that it be undoubtedly the most robust piece of immigration legislation this parliament have see and—[interruption 
 order i want to hear what the prime minister have to say because it matter to my constituent those who feel that it do not matter to theirs should please leave 
 as i say mr speaker eminent kc have say that this be undoubtedly the most robust legislation this parliament have see and a former supreme court justice have be clear that the bill would work but i know that the right hon and learn gentleman have always be more interested in what leftie lawyer have to say i even have in my hand the textbook that he author for they it be call european human rights law by keir starmer so—[interruption 
 prime minister when i stand up please sit down can i just say that we do not use prop in this house if you need reminding i will certainly ensure that i do so 
 it be such utterly pathetic nonsense the prime minister have be brutally expose by his own mps yet again he have party chair who say that she hop the lords will rip his rwanda deal to piece and more who have to quit because they do not think it will work all of they appoint by he all now in open revolt against his policy each other and reality be it any wonder that they all think this gimmick be doom to failure when the prime minister himself do not believe in it 
 it be rich to hear from the right hon and learn gentleman about belief in something it will be news to he that it be actually the case that you can believe in something and stick to that position on this side of the house interruption 
 can i just say to member on the government side that this be very important it be an important day people want to know what be go on so i want my constituent just like your to hear what the prime minister have to say 
 just this week we have another example of the right hon and learn gentleman do thing and say another this week he back the home secretary in ban the terrorist group hizb ut tahrir despite he personally use the european court of human rights to try to stop they be ban you do not have to take my word for it the extremist own press release say and i quote the hizb ut tahrir legal team lead by keir starmer i know that he do not like talk about they because they have be a client but when i see a group chant jihad on our street i ban they he invoice they interruption 
 there be question that i think some member might want to hear answer i tell you what some who want question have already go off the list 
 if the prime minister stick to his position he would be vote with we his former home secretary say that the plan will not work his current home secretary call it batshit his former immigration minister do not back his plan and even the prime minister himself do not believe in it last week another of his mp say that the tories should admit that thing have get bad since they come to office that after year they have leave britain less united and that the country be a sad place if the prime minister can not even persuade his own mps that it be worth support he and if he himself do not even believe in his own policy why on earth should anyone else think differently 
 another week when it be crystal clear that the right hon and learn gentleman do not believe in anything and he do not have a plan while he talk the country down let i update he on what have actually be happen in the past week inflation more than halve from to and real wage rise for the month in a row last week rate start fall and million of people benefit from a tax cut worth £ so while he take we back to square with a £ tax grab let we stick with the plan that be deliver a bright future for britain 
 it be against the law to silence victim of crime but that be exactly what the post office do through the use of non disclosure agreement and this be just the most recent case of nda cover up mismanagement misconduct and even crime at work will my right hon friend the prime minister consider ban their use in all severance agreement once and for all 
 my right hon friend be right to raise an important point the ability to speak out about thing be key to unlock justice while nda can have a place and my right hon friend be right to say that they should not be use to stop victim of crime in particular get the justice they deserve i can tell she that the ministry of justice be carefully consider how good to address this issue include the use of legislation and i know that my right hon and learn friend the justice secretary will keep the house update on further progress 
 i call the snp leader 
 when people wake up today in home that they can not afford to heat with mortgage that they be struggle to pay to news that inflation be once again on the rise they will have look to westminster for answer and instead they find a uk government who be tear themselves apart over how quickly they can send vulnerable people on a plane to rwanda surely the prime minister must understand that the anger that some of his own back benchers have towards he be no comparison to the anger that the public have towards his party 
 if the hon gentleman do care about support work family to pay their bill and to pay their mortgage why on earth be the snp make scotland the highest tax part of the united kingdom where the average not the wealthy but the average worker in scotland be now pay more tax than they do in england 
 of course when it come to the rwanda bill the reality be that if you want to stop the smuggler gang you should introduce safe and legal route but instead the prime minister be seek to weaponise some of the most vulnerable people in society it be straight out of the cruel and callous right wing extremist playbook his time in office be fast approach its conclusion do he seriously want this to be his legacy 
 as i say it be important that we stop the boat because illegal migration be simply not fair it be not right that some people jump the queue and take away our resource from those who need our help most and by the way they be exploit by gang and many of they lose their life make these dangerous crossing so i completely disagree with the hon gentleman the fair and compassionate thing to do be to break these criminal gang and that be why we be go to stop the boat 
 unexpectedly month ago i have a heart attack thank to the swift action of the nhs emergency service it be catch early so stent operation later i be on a swift path to rehabilitation and recovery and i be sit here today fight fit and a bit light too so along with encourage everyone to visit the british heart foundation website to understand the early warning sign and get fantastic resource to help they would the prime minister also join i in personally thank everyone who help to save my life and help i recover include the east of england ambulance service the team at watford general hospital and harefield hospital the cardiac rehabilitation team and everyone who support i especially my family and my team some of whom be in the gallery today who help to ensure that i continue to deliver for the great people of watford 
 i thank my hon friend for share his story and i know the whole house will be delighted to hear that he have make a swift recovery we all wish he good health for the future as he resume his excellent campaigning on behalf of his constituent in watford i also join he in thank our fantastic   nhs staff for the life save work that they do up and down the country we be back they with record resource from our doctor to our ambulance service and we be all in this house truly grateful for what they do 
 mr speaker 
 until the uk government call for an immediate ceasefire it be complicit in the horror in gaza 
 those be not my word but those of the head of oxfam who like every single agency try to operate on the ground be clear that aid can not be effectively deliver while fighting continue more uk aid be of course welcome but even when it do get through it can result in what palestinian aid worker call 
 bomb we on full stomach 
 some people have already be kill so what will it take for the prime minister to back a permanent bilateral ceasefire 
 of course we want to see a peaceful resolution to this conflict as soon as possible a sustainable permanent ceasefire with an end to the destruction fighting and loss of life the release of hostage and no resumption of hostility would of course be the good way forward but in order to achieve that a number of thing need to happen hamas would have to agree to release all the hostage hamas would have to no long be in charge of gaza the threat of more rocket attack from hamas into israel would have to end and the palestinian authority boost with assistance would need to return to gaza in order to provide governance and aid that be a sustainable ceasefire that we will work very hard to bring about 
 today i be unsure whether to raise a national issue such as the desperate need for a minister for man or a local issue such as doncaster ’s need for a new hospital or edlington ’s for a new leisure centre but i think the good thing i could do be ask the prime minister to come and have a tour of doncaster and while i be show he around my home town i can press the need for a minister for man i can show he the site for a new hospital and i can introduce he to the people of edlington so that he can discuss their new leisure centre will the prime minister accept my invitation 
 thank to my hon friend ’s fantastic campaigning on behalf of his constituent city of doncaster council have receive more than £ in levelling up funding to support its regeneration project and most recently doncaster have be award £ in our long term plan for town over the next year which i know he be work very hard to make sure be prioritise for local people i will be delighted to discuss both project and his other idea when i come and visit he as soon as my diary allow

 presentation and reading standing order no 
 tim farron present a bill to require that every child be offer at least outdoor education experience during primary school year and at least such experience during secondary school year and for connected purpose 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday june and to be print bill 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to establish the right to breathe clean air to require the secretary of state to achieve and maintain clean air in england to involve the uk health security agency in set and review pollutant and their limit to enhance the power duty and function of various agency and authority in relation to air pollution to establish the citizens commission for clean air with power to institute or intervene in legal proceeding to require the secretary of state and the relevant national authority to apply environmental principle in carry out their duty under this act and the clean air enactment and for connected purpose 
 in the life of year old ella roberta adoo kissi debrah be tragically cut short when she suffer a fatal asthma attack ella live close to the heavily congested south circular in lewisham and follow an inquest in become the person to have air pollution list on her death certificate with the coroner philip barlow conclude that ella 
 die of asthma contribute to by exposure to excessive air pollution 
 next week would have be ella ’s birthday and i know that all our thought will be with her family at this time i want to pay tribute to ella ’s mum rosamund who be in the public gallery today for her incredible campaigning on air pollution and to express my personal thank to she for allow this bill to be call ella ’s law in memory of her daughter it be an honour to be able to present it to the house today 
 this bill be need because to put it simply the state of our filthy air be a public health emergency air pollution be associate with condition such as asthma heart disease and cancer and have be show to have an impact on our mental health too lead to an increase risk of schizophrenia depression and anxiety its impact be not equally feel however with those on low income and from black and ethnic minority background far more likely to live in polluted area it be child ’s health that be affect most of all a study publish just last week by the university of dundee reveal an increase in the number of under-16 admit to hospital for respiratory problem follow period of high air pollution while a study conduct by king ’s college london show that live within metre of a busy road could stunt child ’s lung growth by up to let i put that in context it be estimate that in london a of the population about people live near a busy road 
 it be therefore profoundly shocking but perhaps not entirely surprising that the uk have of the high rate of asthmatic child across europe with in young people live with asthma it have be calculate that clean air could prevent up to avoidable death in the uk each year and it could save the public purse billion as well estimate of the public cost of air pollution total as much as £ each year include the cost of the impact on social care and on our crumble nhs it could not be more urgent for the government to take action to clean up our air and protect life both now and in the future could not be   more urgent but although their current approach be vastly insufficient minister remain bullish in defend their effort indeed last year the prime minister himself tell i 
 we be confident that the measure we be put in place be not only legally binding but world lead in tackle air quality 
 he go on to say that the environment act provide 
 the capability accountability and ambition 
 need 
 to make all the effective intervention to drive down air pollution ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 the reality be however that the environment act do very little to help deliver clean air and it be certainly not world lead the environmental target that do get make under it to reduce level of pm2.5 to microgram per cubic metre fall short of the new world health organisation guideline of microgram per cubic metre and could certainly be achieve far early than the government ’s target date of indeed when professor frank kelly of imperial college london an adviser to the world health organisation on health and pollution recently give evidence to the environmental audit committee he state very clearly 
 our study show that of the uk could achieve a figure of microgram per metre cub by and the that could not be certain hotspot in london which again if you take extra measure on you could probably eliminate those as well 
 professor sir stephen holgate from the university of southampton a special adviser on air quality to the royal college of physicians subsequently write to the committee to confirm that such a change would result in about few infant death each year—20 few life lose and family save from unimaginable heartache 
 give that the mayor of london have already commit himself to deliver on this more ambitious target and give such significant benefit it be incumbent on ministers to explain why the current legal limit remain so unambitious they must also set out as a matter of urgency how they will meet the new who guideline which have halve the limit for pm2.5 to microgram per cubic metre in response to the marked increase in evidence show how air pollution affect different aspect of our health in the word of the chief medical officer professor chris whitty 
 we can and should go far and it be technically possible to do so 
 the clean air human rights bill or ella ’s law would set out an entirely new approach to deliver clean air in england it would enshrine the human right to clean air precisely and explicitly in english law thereby transform decision making by public authority by require they to consider clean air alongside other right under the human rights act it would be a step towards incorporate the resolution adopt by the un general assembly which recognise the human right to a clean healthy and sustainable environment it   follow a air approach that encompass the health and environmental impact of air pollution and greenhouse gas and it would set standard base on advice from the climate change committee and on the who ’ new air quality guideline and require the secretary of state to achieve clean air within year with the possibility of postponement for up to a further year per pollutant subject to strict condition the environment agency and the climate change committee would be require to review the pollutant and the limit annually and advise the secretary of state if they need tighten 
 the bill also cover air pollution both outdoors and indoor in public space and where health and safety standard apply the tragic death of year old awaab ishak bring on by extensive mould in his family ’s flat shine a spotlight on the significance of indoor air pollution while i welcome the prompt action take by the secretary of state for levelling up in bring forward awaab ’s law a law that should now frankly also be apply to the private rent sector through the renters reform bill it be clear that legislation to address indoor air pollution must extend beyond the home too especially since on average we spend around of our life indoor whether for work study or leisure finally in order to ensure independent scrutiny and continuous improvement the bill would establish a citizen commission for clean air which would review annually the secretary of state ’s compliance with the provision of the bill and advise the secretary of state where improvement be need 
 this bill have already undergo significant scrutiny in the other place after my noble friend and green party peer baroness jones of moulsecoomb top the private member ’s bill ballot in the previous parliamentary session it have already be extensively debate amend and improve and it receive cross party support include from lord randall of uxbridge a former environment adviser to   the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may   when she be prime minister he say 
 we have wait too long for proper clean air legislation i urge the minister to take this back and say that it be a golden opportunity to do something really wonderful the government could take pride in be part of a world beat bill”.—[official report house of lords   november vol c. 
 he be absolutely right by take up ella ’s law the government have a real opportunity to genuinely lead the world in tackle this press public health emergency and i urge they to take it 
 question put and agree to

 clause stand part 
 i know that the minister for counter illegal migration my hon and learn friend   the member for mid dorset and north poole michael tomlinson say that he do not watch box set but here we be once again for the next episode of this drama it be also the most important of all because this be likely to be the final opportunity for this house to consider the bill do it work will we be able to stop the boat can we secure our border as member in all part of the house know i feel passionately that illegal migration be do untold damage to our country and we have to make sure that the bill actually do the job 
 i want to speak to amendment but in particular and that be the with respect to rule let i say at the outset of this debate that i do not believe that our membership of the european convention on human right be sustainable i think that that will become clear and clear to the british public in the month and year ahead but that be not the purpose of my amendment today and it be not the subject of this debate that be a discussion for another day what we be discuss here be whether we believe it be appropriate for a foreign judge in an international court to impose a late night judgment often without the united kingdom be able to give its own argument or to hear the reason for that judgment whether we think that that really accord with the rule of law particularly in relation to this policy and whether we be willing to see the same thing happen again that happen in the summer of when a judge do just that ground the flight and prevent the policy lead to month indeed year of legal action and ten of thousand of illegal migrant break into our country cost our taxpayer billion of pound imperille life in the channel and perpetuate this challenge for year to come 
 i be happy to support my right hon friend tonight on this amendment as i do last night i be on the council of europe so i take quite a lot of interest in this there be an established legal principle that in fact the judge be act ultra vis in and that it be not in his power to do that there be also an established legal opinion that our government could actually have ignore it how do this relate to my right hon friend ’s amendment 
 i will come on to the exact point that my right hon friend be make they be fair and important one 
 as night follow day if we do not make change in this respect we will find ourselves in a few month time in exactly the same position that my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel   be in as home secretary in the summer of wherein the strasbourg court could issue or potentially many rule interim measure the decision about what to do will fall to a minister perhaps my hon and learn friend the minister for counter illegal migration and other colleague within government the court will be involve and we will find ourselves in a very difficult indeed intractable situation as i have say before set this scheme in train without know what we would do when that happen be a bit like pull the pin out of a grenade but not be prepared to throw it this be entirely foreseeable let we find a way through this challenge
