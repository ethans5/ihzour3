many seek asylum include from syria enter the uk by illegally cross the channel which be of course completely unnecessary as france be a safe country with a well function asylum system in relation to those channel crossing will the minister accept that the government ’s plan to smash the gang lie in tatter crossing be up by since the election they be about to break and the month of this year have be the bad on record do the minister accept it be a catastrophic mistake to cancel the rwanda deterrent before it even start i be in berlin last week and the new german government and other european government be look to implement removal deterrent very similar to the rwanda deterrent will she now do a u turn and implement a removal deterrent so that all illegal arrival be rapidly remove to a safe country 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the need to work with our partner my french counterpart minister haddad and i convene our quint partner and the eu institution on friday for a joint meeting minister haddad be visit london and we take the initiative to meet our partner because we be deeply concerned about the situation in bosnia we have also   be engage with those in the region include serbia and croatia i along with the special representative the foreign secretary and other will continue to do so 
 as the hon gentleman will realise this be an operational matter for the metropolitan police and i be sure that they will provide further commentary at some point

 the clerk at the table have inform the house of the unavoidable absence of the speaker the chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 i inform the house that mr speaker be in ukraine at the invitation of ruslan stefanchuk president of the ukrainian parliament alongside speaker from across europe he will provide an update to the house on wednesday 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 if she will review the pause in decision on syrian asylum claim 
 we wish mr speaker all the good on his extremely important visit to our parliamentary colleague in ukraine follow the fall of the assad regime the home office withdraw the country policy and information note and guidance on syria and temporarily pause interview and decision on syrian asylum claim this be and remain a necessary step that several other european country have also take the pause be under constant review and when there be a clear basis on which to make decision we will start process claim again 
 i be sure my hon friend will agree that the uk government together with the international community be look for a peaceful solution in syria that put the people of syria organisation work with the syrian community in scotland such as the scottish refugee council have report a sense of heighten anxiety among syrians currently in the asylum system and wonder whether people seek protection should be keep in limbo any long than be necessary there be also concern that the pause in decision making may increase the backlog of asylum case contribute to the legacy backlog leave by the conservative government 
 order ms ferguson be there an actual question 
 there certainly be be my hon friend able to give a timeline for her decision making 
 i understand the heighten anxiety among syrian asylum seeker but the home office rely on the country information in order to make decision on whether particular people need protection and that information be currently in the middle of quite profound change when we be in a position to make decision against new more up to date information we will certainly do so i hope the syrian community will be patient and not too anxious about the pause currently in place 
 how many hotel in scotland be use to house asylum seeker 
 we do not comment on where hotel be but i can tell the hon gentleman that there be hotel across the whole country we will be get those number down as quickly as we can 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 many seek asylum include from syria enter the uk by illegally cross the channel which be of course completely unnecessary as france be a safe country with a well function asylum system in relation to those channel crossing will the minister accept that the government ’s plan to smash the gang lie in tatter crossing be up by since the election they be about to break 300,000[official report   march vol c. correction)—and the month of this year have be the bad on record do the minister accept it be a catastrophic mistake to cancel the rwanda deterrent before it even start i be in berlin last week and the new german government and other european government be look to implement removal deterrent very similar to the rwanda deterrent will she now do a u turn and implement a removal deterrent so that all illegal arrival be rapidly remove to a safe country 
 some people cross the channel from the day the rwandan deal be sign to the day it be scrap the conservatives fail to deter a single boat or deport a single person instead they spend £ and send people fail asylum seeker to start a new life in kigali with free housing free private healthcare and free university education at a cost of £ each if the right hon gentleman really think that pay £ per remove asylum seeker be an adequate answer to the challenge of small boat crossing then i do not know what planet he be live on 
 what step her department be take with police force to tackle violence against woman and girl 
 i join the immigration minister in wish mr speaker well for his important trip to ukraine 
 the government have set an unprecedented mission to halve violence against woman and girl in a decade we have set out new measure include the domestic abuse specialist in control room start the roll out of domestic abuse protection order and a new national police centre for violence against woman and girl and public protection 
 the chichester base charity my sisters house give vital wraparound trauma inform support to woman in last year it support more than woman the charity have raise the ongoing issue of cross allegation whereby abuser be falsely accuse their victim as a means of keep the control and the emotional abuse go what step be the home secretary take with the justice secretary to ensure that the system properly recognise this form of continue abuse and protect victim from be retraumatise 
 the hon member raise an important issue about how coercive control can manifest and how abuser can continue their abuse in different way include use the civil court part of the reason for introduce   the national centre for public protection be to have the good possible national standard and training properly for the time across police and then work across the criminal justice system in order to keep victim safe 
 at last week ’s annual police award hold by the rochdale district of greater manchester police the unsung hero award go to jayne ward who be a sexual assault adviser for her role in support a rape victim throughout every single day in court that victim be reward with justice and the rapist be send down for year jayne currently support sexual assault victim do the home secretary agree that we owe a great debt of thank to jayne and to the police officer who help to secure such conviction 
 i pay tribute to jayne ward for the remarkable work that she be do to support victim of the most appalling and vile crime help they to get justice and help they as they go through the criminal justice system i also pay tribute to the police officer work night and day across the country to tackle sexual assault and abuse 
 the ambition to halve the prevalence of violence against woman and girl be a laudable but could the home secretary give the house some more information what number be she take as a starting point to be halve when will she be able to provide more information to the house and to my select committee 
 i thank the chair of the home affairs committee for her question we be currently draw up a strategy on violence against woman and girl which will be publish before the summer recess and will set out the approach that we need to take and the need to reduce domestic abuse sexual assault and stalking the crime that be most prevalent and of which woman be most likely to be the victim but which we also need to reduce more broadly we will set out detail on the measure that we will be look for as part of that strategy 
 the accurate collection of sex aggregate datum by police force be essential to address male violence against woman and girl what plan do my right hon friend have in place for her department to implement the recently publish sullivan review 
 i can tell my hon friend that we take the sullivan review extremely seriously it be important to recognise the difference between biological sex and gender and to make sure that police and the criminal justice system always have the accurate datum that they need 
 woman and girl will never truly be safe while terrify online influencer such as andrew tate be allow platform that radicalise man and boy into extreme misogyny what step be the secretary of state take with cabinet colleague to support police in tackle violence against woman and girl 
 measure in the online safety act be be implement over the course of this year that include the introduction this summer of measure expect to ensure that strong action be take to prevent young boy and child more widely from see inappropriate material which can be very damaging and very extreme we also need to work in school to prevent abuse in relationship 
 rape victim be fail under the previous government and too few actually get to see the inside of a courtroom among those victim be the victim of andrew tate here in the uk who suffer rape and other violence against they while i know that the home secretary can not comment on the current extradition notice with romania what message can she send to those victim whom i have meet and who will be meet a minister as well about their day in court and get justice 
 my hon friend will know that there be a court case under way in romania and that issue around prosecution and extradition decision be matter for the police and the crown prosecution service i know that she have work with victim include in her constituency and it be hugely important that victim of appalling crime have a route to justice wherever they be in the world 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in at least of our town gang of man have groom and then sexually torture little girl with astonishing depravity still not person have be convict for cover up these institutionalise rape local inquiry can not summon witness be be refuse by local authority and can not address national policy like deportation fundamentally the government ’s plan will not cover even in of these town will the home secretary explain how she will choose which town get a local inquiry and what she will say to the victim whose town will not be include 
 the shadow minister will know that we have ask the police to reopen case and historical investigation because it be crucial that where there be abuse include historical exploitation and grooming gang prosecution take place and perpetrator face justice for their vile crime we be support local inquiry and the review by louise casey into the scale and nature of exploitation across the country 
 the shadow minister refer to cover up we be introduce a mandatory duty to report child abuse and we be criminalise the covering up of abuse and exploitation that be something i call for more than year ago and i be really sorry that the previous government never introduce it 
 what recent progress the defend democracy taskforce have make 
 what recent progress the defend democracy taskforce have make 
 the taskforce be drive forward work to ensure that the uk ’s democracy be strengthen and protect this include work to tackle the unacceptable harassment and intimidation of elect representative i have recently provide detailed evidence on the taskforce ’s progress to the joint committee on the national security strategy and i will give evidence to mr speaker at a speaker ’s conference evidence session on wednesday 
 people in exeter want to be sure that the election and referenda we hold be safe and secure from outside state actor who want to manipulate our politic for their own end we already know that russian disinformation on social medium in many african nation be already have a huge impact on their domestic politic can the minister confirm that the taskforce will be take into account our own russia report and that this government will do everything they can to defend our politic from the malign activity of external state actor 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question it be and always will be a priority to protect the uk against foreign interference the government be absolutely committed to safeguard the uk ’s democratic process and have establish measure to protect it while there be no room for complacency kremlin disinformation operation largely fail here in the uk despite their good effort that be in part because of the discernment and judgment of the british public but also because of the action of our intelligence service 
 i declare an interest as a member of the speaker ’s conference do my hon friend the minister agree that aside from the security measure that be sadly increasingly necessary to protect candidate and elect representative it be vital that everyone who believe in the importance of defend our democracy play their part in do so and that this must include parliament social medium company the traditional medium the education system business charity and civil society organisation that way we can collectively create a healthy and safe environment within which our democracy can flourish 
 my hon friend be right to say that the defence of our democracy be something that every sector of our society business and the medium need to play their part in i assure he that defend our democratic process be an absolute priority for the government and that there be work across department to understand the nature and scale of harassment and intimidation of candidate and campaigner i assure hon member across the house that the joint election security and preparedness unit will continue to co ordinate cross government work on all threat include candidate security 
 the minister for local government and english devolution recently speak at an iftar host by the european islamic centre which be connect to jamaat e islami and abul a’la al maududi the minister for social security and disability attend the muslim council of britain ’s annual dinner and the prime minister host adam kelwick an imam who celebrate the   october   attack and tell follower to pray for victory for hamas why be the government   so keen to spend time with and lend legitimacy to organisation and people they say they oppose what will the minister say to the prime minister 
 we be not and i do not agree with the proposition that the hon member have make all ministers of course include the prime minister take these matter incredibly seriously and we always engage in the most responsible way 
 when the defend democracy taskforce be establish it be proclaim that its primary focus be to protect the democratic integrity of the united kingdom what work therefore have it do on the fact that there be a part of this united kingdom namely northern ireland where the democratic integrity of the united kingdom have be upend by the fact that in area of law our law be make not by this parliament and not by the stormont assembly but by a foreign parliament the european union what work have be do to restore democratic integrity to the united kingdom in respect of northern ireland 
 i give the hon and learn member an absolute assurance that we work closely with all the devolve government on this matter in fact i be in northern ireland just recently to discuss this with the justice minister the work that we be conduct as part of the taskforce be cross party and design to ensure that we do everything we possibly can to prevent interference in our democratic process we take the matter seriously and we will work with other on it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i realise that my hon friend   the member for west suffolk nick timothy   be unable to get a meaningful answer but with islamist extremism behind quarter of mi5 ’s caseload it be essential to shield our democracy from its pressure the minister have repeatedly reiterate the government ’s non engagement policy with the muslim council of britain despite a government minister attend its annual dinner more recently there have be concern about attendee at government event who have publicly express some frightening view will the minister assure the house that the government remain committed to a non engagement policy with those who seek to promote extreme view that undermine our democracy where government ministers go against that how do the defend democracy taskforce respond 
 i assure the shadow minister that our policy on engagement have not change i have respond on this matter on a number of occasion what i can say to he address the substance of the issue be that we will tackle extremism wherever we find it the government take these matter incredibly seriously we will never allow they to be use as a political football we will address these matter and tackle they head on 
 what step her department be take to tackle shoplifting 
 what step her department be take to tackle shoplifting 
 in the last year of the previous government shop theft reach a record high with devastating consequence for our high street and town centre the conservative party write that off as low level crime but the labour government be determined to take back our street from thug and thief that be why we be end the effective immunity for shop theft of good under £ introduce a new offence of assault a shop worker and deliver new neighbourhood police officer and police community support officer in community across the country 
 many retailer in bournemouth town centre and across my constituency have tell i that the same people over and over again be responsible for shoplift and put their staff ’s safety at risk good progress have be make locally with dorset police ’s operation shopkeeper and the town centre business improvement district ’s use of the uk partner against crime system but what more can be do to tackle repeat offender and to learn the lesson from successful initiative such as those in my constituency 
 i thank my hon friend for bring to the house ’s attention the excellent initiative take place in bournemouth it be a real example of the result that can be achieve when we get local authority business and law enforcement all come together i be keen to look carefully at example such as that of bournemouth and what be happen in the town centre to see how we can learn from such good practice and they can be disseminate 
 may i thank the minister for her early answer across my constituency from the co op in dartford to the subway on the high street and pet garden supplies on colney road i hear the same frustrating tale from business owner and shopworker about how powerless they feel to tackle shoplift the measure contain in the crime and policing bill to tackle that problem have just be set out and they can not come soon enough will the minister bring hope to people across the dartford constituency that we will turn the tide on shoplifting after it be clearly deprioritise by the conservative party 
 again my hon friend be absolutely right when the conservative party leave office shop theft be at a record level up in the space of year the shadow home secretary   the right hon member for croydon south chris philp now say tolerance on shop theft even in case where less than £ worth of good have be steal yet in the year that he be the police and crime minister he leave that £ limit in place allow thief to escape with impunity and in the absence of any police say that people should make their own citizen ’s arrest while shop theft soar all he have to say to the public be basically that they be on their own and should sort it out themselves 
 many of my constituent be exasperate by the fact that the police be unable to turn up when there be shoplift or a burglary yet they be able to send officer to get   themselves involve in a dispute with a local school and to warn off local elect representative from get involve sadly that misallocation of resource and unwarranted police overreach be not an isolated example may i urge the minister to avoid engage in political point scoring and instead join i in send a very clear message from both side of this house that our expectation be that the police should be focus on solve real crime and stay out of legitimate free expression and democratic debate 
 i think it be fair to say that the prime minister and the home secretary have be very clear about the priority of this government for tackle crime through our safe street mission we want to halve violence against woman and girl over the course of the next decade we want to halve knife crime over the course of the next decade we will deliver the neighbourhood police officer back into our community that be decimate under the previous government the priority of this government be very clear in tackle crime and policing 
 my constituent live just metre from the tesco express store in eastbourne where she work she do not feel safe leaving as a result of the retail crime there and so get a taxi back home in the evening will the minister explain not just what the government can do to help protect shop worker like my constituent but what can big business such as tesco do to well protect the employee who do such an important role for they and for their community 
 the hon gentleman make an important point clearly legislation have be bring forward to protect retail worker from assault however a good employer will want to ensure their staff be well look after if there be issue about leave work and need to take a taxi i be sure that good employer would want to address that and support those retail worker 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as my right hon friend   the member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden   have outline this weekend we hear the shocking report that the parent of a year old girl be arrest by hertfordshire police officer and place in a cell for hour because they complain about their daughter ’s primary school on whatsapp at the same time shoplifting case have be close without a suspect be identify do the minister agree that the police should be able to get on with the job of tackle crime on our street can she comment on whether they be get their priority right in that case 
 as the shadow minister will know this be an operational matter for policing and it be quite clear that the chief constable and the police and crime commissioner have set out that there will be a review of what happen in that particular case 
 what step her department be take to tackle violence against shop worker 
 to repeat what i be say under the previous government violence and abuse towards retail worker increase to unacceptable level everyone have a right to feel safe at their place of work alongside the union of shop distributive and allied workers and the co op who have long campaign for strong protection for retail worker we be bring in through the crime and policing bill a new offence of assault a retail worker to protect those hard work and dedicated staff who work in store and to send a really strong message that violence against retail worker will not be tolerate 
 on friday i visit the central co op in ashbourne which recently experience an armed robbery elizabeth and georgia be work there when the robbery take place and be still deeply affect several month later what action be the government take to stop violence against shop worker especially in rural area where the geographical distance involve often mean that the police take long to respond 
 i thank my hon friend for bring that shocking case to the attention of the house all our thought will be with elizabeth and georgia after what they have be through i also want to applaud the co op for the lead role that it have play in help we to develop this new offence of assault against shop worker to ensure that it be not just armed robbery against its staff that will be punish but the act of violence and intimidation that far too many shop worker find happen on a daily basis on the issue of serious crime in rural area our neighbourhood policing guarantee will deliver thousand of neighbourhood police community support officer across england and wales include in rural area to speed up response time build up public confidence and ensure that for those violent criminal who commit act such as armed robbery there will be no hiding place from the law 
 in ashford and staines in my constituency we have a real plague of shoplifting and antisocial behaviour inspector matthew walton of the north division be do a great job with his team to tackle it in combination with the community and the retailer but still the problem be get bad after the success of the facial recognition software roll out in croydon will minister please consider extend it to spelthorne because it would be a welcome addition to police in my area 
 as an operational matter live facial recognition be something for the police to use as they deem fit but from my experience of it be use in croydon i can see the benefit to police it seem to be a very effective tool that police force should have in their armoury 
 what step her department be take to tackle the antisocial use of off road bike 
 many of we will know from our constituency the havoc that can be cause in community by the dangerous and deafen antisocial use of off road bike that be why this government be give the police   strong power to swiftly seize those bike and other vehicle where they be be drive antisocially through local estate and town centre as part of our mission to crack down on antisocial behaviour and make our street safe 
 people across lichfield burntwood and the surround village in my constituency and i be sure across the country be sick and tired of off road bike be use inappropriately antisocially and dangerously on our street the bad example i have see be somebody do a wheelie on a quad bike at mph on eastern avenue in lichfield i report that to the police and they be follow it up as well they can but they tell i that they need the new power in the bill can the secretary of state reassure i my constituent and the rest of the country that this government will continue to crack down on this problem and will not rest until our street be safe for all road user 
 i agree with my hon friend and i be sorry to hear about the appalling incident he describe this be a challenge for we in many of our constituency my constituent in airedale and chequerfield see the total nightmare of off road bike be drive deliberately to harass people if we have to wait for the police to give multiple warning they can not take the swift action need which be why we need the change in the bill 
 my constituent peter from corfe mullen have have numerous run in with e scooter and off road bike what consideration be the home secretary give to the redefinition of electric bike so that it be genuinely an electric bike 
 the hon member be right that there be many different form and change to the kind of vehicle bike and scooter be use the legislation apply not just to off road bike but more widely to vehicle be use antisocially that be important because the police need to be able to act swiftly and not end up have to try to chase and catch the same people again and again to take action 
 antisocial behaviour be a significant concern to my constituent especially the nuisance cause by off road bike and e scooter last friday local officer specifically tell i that they do not feel they have the power to pursue the rider of these bike when they be in their patrol car with rider often taunt and even laugh at they because they know they can not easily be catch what step be the government take to ensure that my local officer in mansfield have the specific power they need to stop those bike and bring those terrorise our community to justice 
 my hon friend be right and people in mansfield should not be terrorise by deliberate harassment by people on off road bike that be why we be strengthen the law through the crime and policing bill but it be also why we support the work that some police force be do for example the work i have see in staffordshire where they be use drone to follow those on off road bike and make swift seizure or arrest 
 at the weekend i be speak to resident of braunstone town and many particularly the elderly be frighten by the use of off road bike and similar vehicle give the noise they make and the risk to pedestrian will the secretary of state assure i that the government be take the matter seriously and that they will empower local police force to bring those drive the bike to justice 
 the hon member make an important point often particularly for old people the way in which the bike be use be just dangerous the deliberate ramp up of the noise to intimidate and scare people be disgraceful antisocial behaviour that be why we be increase police power and why we want to work with police on thing like the drone use and other measure to tackle antisocial behaviour 
 what step her department be take to tackle mobile phone theft 
 street theft increase by more than in the last year of the previous government largely due to soar rate of snatch theft involve mobile phone there be clear evidence of organise criminality in those crime this be not just about petty criminal and opportunist that be why the home secretary recently convene a mobile phone theft summit with tech company police leader and the national crime agency and why our crime and policing bill include a new power enable police to enter premise identify by electronic mapping if steal item be believe to be there 
 mobile phone theft be a widespread concern in my constituency between and the spate of mobile phone theft have rise by can my hon friend reassure my constituent that this government will take all step to ensure their safety 
 i can give my hon friend that reassurance our recent mobile phone theft summit result in clear commitment from attendee to work in collaboration to tackle mobile phone theft and the organise criminality drive it that be also why our crime and policing bill will give police the power where it be not practical to wait for a warrant to enter and search premise where steal mobile phone be believe to be 
 the rise number of mobile phone theft have cause great concern among many of my constituent by the way i be not technically minded i know very little about how my mobile phone work but many people have everything on their phone their bank detail be on that phone their life be on that phone if their phone be steal they be in big trouble how will we restore confidence in the general public on mobile phone and have all our detail on they 
 i think it be worth reflect on the impressive result we have see in recent month from the metropolitan police in their work to intensify action on mobile phone theft the hon gentleman be right this be an important subject and we need to see that kind of activity around the country include in northern ireland 
 what step she be take to help tackle rural crime 
 the government be commit to tackle rural crime and safeguard rural area through tough measure to clamp down on antisocial behaviour fly tipping and the theft of agricultural equipment alongside our neighbourhood policing guarantee we be also provide funding to the national rural and wildlife crime unit to ensure their valuable work can continue 
 crime rate in rural area have surge by since compare with for urban area with a total rise of almost report offence rural crime in my constituency include theft of agricultural machinery livestock and fuel the area ’s remote location make it vulnerable to such crime which impact on local farmer and resident what be the government do to ensure that rural crime get the attention that it deserve 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that vital issue just last month i hold a rural crime roundtable in north yorkshire and meet local resident and farmer to discuss this important topic last week in recognition of the success of the national rural and wildlife crime unit i announce additional funding for both in the next financial year so that they can continue to support the police in rural area we be also work with the national police chiefs council on the next iteration of the rural and wildlife crime strategy later this year we will implement the equipment theft prevention act and put the necessary secondary legislation in place ahead of that we will publish the government ’s response to the call for evidence on the scope of that legislation 
 of the less widely recognise rural crime be the use of catapult to maim and kill wildlife those weapon be also use in urban setting i know that the home office take the view that the wildlife protection legislation and the police power ought to be adequate to deal with that but at the moment they patently be not will the minister consider review that and possibly amend the crime and policing bill to take account of it 
 i be always happy to review legislation and ensure that it be fit for purpose i would be very happy to discuss that far with the right hon gentleman 
 what her policy be on the use of live facial recognition technology by police force 
 i thank the right hon member for his interest in this subject and for the westminster hall debate that he secure last year i want to support the police to use live facial recognition safely while   balance public safety and safeguard individual right the home office invest over £ in to develop a small national live facial recognition capability by purchase and equip mobile lfr unit for deployment later this year i have be listen to stakeholder and will outline our plan in the come month 
 although i recognise that the use of facial recognition technology can lead to more offender be catch do the minister accept that deployment of a permanent network of fix camera across croydon represent a significant escalation in their use which make it all the more important that a clear legislative framework govern their use be debate and approve by parliament 
 i fully accept that there be a need to consider live facial recognition at the moment the law govern the use of that technology come from various different thing human right and equality legislation and other measure and we want to see whether that should be bring together that be why i have be have a series of meeting over the last few month as i say we will set out our plan for live facial recognition in the come month 
 harlow police department ’s recent successful trial of facial recognition have lead to some arrest do the minister agree that technology can play a vital part in tackle crime but can not be a substitute for neighbourhood policing 
 yes i agree with my hon friend that be why we have commit to neighbourhood policing and additional police officer and pcso on all our high street and in community up and down the land 
 whether she have receive legal advice on the compatibility of recent change to her department ’s guidance entitle good character caseworker guidance update on february with the refugee convention 
 the hon member will know that we take our international obligation very seriously we be satisfied that the good character policy be compliant with those obligation we have strengthen our policy to make it clear that anyone who enter the uk illegally include small boat arrival will normally be refuse british citizenship the good character assessment have be a feature of uk immigration law since and there have never be any suggestion either now or in the past that it be inconsistent with our obligation under the refugee convention or any other treaty 
 of the most shocking and egregious thing this government have do be impose a blanket ban on british citizenship for all individual who have enter the uk irregularly without any parliamentary scrutiny or public consultation effectively disenfranchise   all asylum seeker and refugee include those who have make this country their home for year the refugee council estimate that up to refugee who have already be grant asylum could now be block from secure naturalisation the minister know that there be no safe route to get to the uk so nearly all asylum seeker have to arrive irregularly surely the policy clearly breach article of the refugee convention which prohibit penalise those seek protection for their mode of entry interruption 
 order all member should be respectful and mindful of their language at all time now we need to hear the minister respond 
 i thank the hon member for his question he will know that we explain when make the change that each citizenship application will continue to be consider on a case by case basis and that the secretary of state may choose to apply discretion to grant citizenship on an exceptional basis where there have be particularly exceptional or mitigate circumstance such as modern slavery 
 what step she be take to help tackle people smuggle 
 the government be today play host to law enforcement counterpart from across the globe to discuss our joint response to organise immigration crime the uk be not only host that summit but lead the way in its response to this appalling evil trade include through new power introduce in the border security asylum and immigration bill which i note the conservative party vote against 
 i thank the minister for that response and welcome the increased co operation with ally on this vital issue it be critical that we stop the dangerous crossing but without tackle the problem at its source with aid to tackle famine and conflict and by provide safe legal route do we not risk the crisis continue how will the minister work with colleague across government to address those factor to ensure that we tackle the crisis fully 
 the summit be deal with source country we be look at how we can co operate with country all the way along the route use by smuggle gang to ensure that the right message rather than very slick organise immigration gang advertising be convey 
 people smuggler do not just put the immigration system in jeopardy they exploit the vulnerable and they put life in danger there be nothing progressive about allow the vulnerable to be exploit by these smuggler do the minister agree that we should be strain every sinew to crack down on these gang and can she update we on her meeting today on this topic 
 i agree strongly with my hon friend and that be why today ’s immigration summit where country will be co operate and attend be such an important event today we also announce that since we come into government we have return more than people who have no right to be here we have also tighten up the illegal working regulation to make certain that they apply across the board to the gig economy and to casual worker too 
 since the labour government come to power more than people have enter our country illegally the prime minister say he be very angry about that but he be not as angry as the british taxpayer who have to fork out £ a year to keep those illegal invader in our country do the minister agree that anybody arrive here illegally should be detain and deport 
 we have a duty to ensure that those arrive on our shore who claim asylum be properly process the conservatives prevent themselves from do that by become obsess with the rwanda scheme and they leave we with a huge backlog we will speed up immigration processing so that we can deal with those people protect those who have a right to be here and send back those who have fail i hope that the hon gentleman will welcome the steep increase in return and removal that i have just announce 
 do my hon friend agree that it be not gimmick such as rwanda but international co operation that will fundamentally deal with the illegal gang who be facilitate crossing be that not why we should welcome today ’s summit at which people be come together to co operate and to tackle those gang 
 my hon friend be exactly right these criminal be cross national very sophisticated and operate across border in order to respond properly we have to do the same and that be what today ’s summit be help we to co ordinate 
 what step her department be take to support police force in gloucestershire 
 total funding for gloucestershire police for will be up to £ which be an increase of up to £ on last year and include £ to kick start the recruitment of additional neighbourhood police officer and police community support officer in gloucestershire to get those bobby back on the beat in our local community 
 i thank the minister for her response in baroness may of maidenhead the then home secretary accuse police force of cry wolf over funding cut in the decade since police service across the country such as mine in gloucestershire have never truly recover from her scandalous cut to their number gloucestershire constabulary be of the worst fund in the country the victim of an   unfit for purpose funding formula last week the chief constable announce staff cut as she battle with a £ deficit will the minister meet i and my chief constable to discuss those challenge 
 yes of course i will

 have the home secretary see the police ’s anti racism commitment that be publish last week which say that the police do not have to treat everyone the same regardless of race and call for arrest rate to be artificially engineer to be the same across racial group do she agree that this tier approach to policing be totally unacceptable 
 the police operate without fear or favour and they respond to the crime they face across the country and to the perpetrator of those crime whosoever they should be and wheresoever they be that be the right approach for the police to take whether they be deal with the most serious violence which we have prioritise or with neighbourhood crime in community as the shadow home secretary will know from the approach we be take to the sentencing council and the importance of we bring forward rapid emergency legislation in that area we be very clear that there can be no preferential treatment for anyone in the criminal justice system it be really important that the principle of fair treatment for all be always maintain 
 i completely agree with the home secretary that people should stand equally before the law and be treat exactly the same regardless of their race or identity i agree with the home secretary about all of that but unfortunately the anti racism commitment publish last week do not say that in fact it say the opposite it expressly say that 
 it do not mean treat everyone the same or be colour blind 
 give that the home secretary and i agree that the law should be blind to race and that everyone should be treat the same will she join i in table an amendment to the crime and policing bill to override those provision in the anti racism commitment 
 the police already have to swear an oath on their impartiality and policing without fear or favour that be the responsibility of every single police officer right across the country the shadow home secretary will know that there be dedicated police officer who   do exactly that and will continue to do exactly that to ensure that they treat everyone appropriately and make sure that everyone face justice before the law

 the government have announce that we will provide £ over the next year to support the police in tackle retail crime include by continue to fund a specialist policing team there be £ available to the national police chiefs council to assist with measure that retailer can introduce to make their shop and retail outlet more secure that that may well be of use

 follow the grip storyline of adolescence and the rise of incel culture contribute to youth crime what specific measure be the home office implement to address the root cause and create a safe and more supportive environment for our young people 
 my hon friend be right to mention the television programme adolescence which many people will have see and the issue of rise violence among teenager we see this in a number of area the issue range from knife crime to extremism and violence fixation importantly we have the strong measure in the online safety act to protect young people from see extreme violence and inappropriate material online but it be also important for we to work with school to prevent violence among young people include violence in relationship 
 yesterday   report on the leaking of a report from the national police chiefs council on the leicester riot of the report blame hindu extremism however during the riot hindu home be attack but no muslim home and hindu temple be attack but no mosque will the minister ensure that the report be publish so that we can scrutinise it and ensure that the blame be put where it should be 
 we take these matter very seriously i will look carefully at the detail of the point that the hon gentleman have make and i be happy to discuss it with he far 
 there have be a recent slew of successful european sting operation that have result in the arrest of prominent individual involve in people smuggle gang do the minister agree that this highlight the crucial importance of international co operation and signal that labour ’s plan to smash the gang be work

 in the south west last year police community support officer be take off our street my local avon and somerset force account for of they it say that the change be a direct result of lack of funding will the home secretary agree to raise the matter with the chancellor as a matter of urgency so that we can put more money back into frontline policing 
 an extra £ be go into police for the financial year start tomorrow obviously past government must account for their failure to fund the police adequately 
 when the home secretary visit nuneaton to speak to local business owner she hear from they directly about the problem of retail crime there be a glimmer of hope because our town centre officer be have a big impact but that role be now vacant shop and other business say that retail crime be at an all time high with a increase since january now that labour be put more money into people ’s pocket what more can be do to ensure that it be safe for it to be spend in town centre 
 my hon friend be right to raise the issue of town centre crime we be invest additional fund of more than £ in police next year and be provide an additional £ for neighbourhood policing which be cut so heavily under the conservative government so that we can bring it back to our town centre we be strengthen the power of police officer and pcso to tackle street and shop theft crime that have soar in recent year because the conservative government turn their back on it 
 during the border security asylum and immigration bill committee we conservatives propose a new clause that would provide a mechanism for a bind annual cap on the number of non visitor visa issue by the uk that would have introduce accountability and transparency but it be vote down decisively by labour members the government talk tough but do the home secretary not believe that the british public deserve a transparent and honest answer to the question of what the level of migration will be under this government rather than the government ’s just blame we or say low number on every occasion 
 i be stagger by that question because net migration reach record high under the conservatives watch we be the one with a plan to bring it down quite frankly the hon lady should support that 
 mohamed wait nearly year for a decision on his asylum application a period that be extend by the pause in process syrian asylum case if the minister will not end the pause what interim step will she take to far support host community such as falkirk

 will my right hon friend join i in congratulate dawn thurkettle and the rugby street pastors and particularly the recently commission pastor on all the excellent work that they do to lower the temperature on night out in our town they show kindness and listen to people on our street and play an important role in our community 
 i would be delighted to pay tribute to dawn and the rugby street pastors for their excellent work many street pastor around the country do really important work in keep people safe and secure on night out 
 the final question go to the father of the house 
 will the home secretary consider raise an obvious lacuna in the law in the committee of ministers at the council of europe under the refugee convention we can automatically deport foreign criminal who enter this country illegally but under the convention on human right we can not surely we can address that in partnership with other member of the council of europe 
 the right hon member will know that we have increase the return and removal of foreign national offender significantly since the election deportation return and removal have plummet under the previous government we be increase they and i believe it be right to do so by work internationally we have secure a new agreement with germany which will now go after the trafficking and smuggler gang and the illegal warehouse in that country but we need to ensure that we take action against dangerous foreign criminal 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker i want to make it clear that in the question i ask the number i intend to ask about be the people who have illegally cross the channel since the last election which be   a increase on the previous period and for the   period since   january the number be the high in history to be clear the figure be since the election official report   march vol c. 
 the shadow minister have get his point on the record 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker i ask the security minister why the government be spend so much time with and lend legitimacy to organisation and people whom they say they oppose the security minister reply we be not i give example and for each of they there be photographic evidence in case a picture show the prime minister in no laugh with the man i mention i have much admiration for the security minister and i be sure that he do not say what he do deliberately but can you advise we on how he might correct the record 
 i be grateful to the hon member for give notice of his point of order as he know the chair be not responsible for the content of question and answer nevertheless member should strive to be accurate in the comment they make to the house if a mistake have be make there be a procedure for correct the record 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on hm government ’s response to the political situation in bosnia and herzegovina 
 i thank the right hon lady for her question about an issue that be very important to the government and to many member across the whole house 
 we strongly condemn the secessionist move by republika srpska president milorad dodik which seriously threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosnia and herzegovina such action be unconstitutional and dangerous include to those live in republika srpska whom he claim to protect the uk as of the signatory remain fully committed to the dayton peace agreement which protect the authority of both entity and support bosnia as a sovereign and politically independent state 
 on   wednesday february the court of bosnia and herzegovina find republika srpska president dodik guilty in a instance ruling of refuse to implement decision of the high representative the uk be clear that the high representative ’s jurisdiction be indisputable and that disregard the independent decision of the judiciary of bosnia and herzegovina undermine the rule of law 
 in response to the verdict the national assembly of republika srpska adopt a number of unconstitutional law and propose a new constitution in clear violation of the dayton peace agreement these move represent a significant escalation in dodik ’s secessionist path and threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of bosnia and herzegovina as a state as he accelerate those attack on the state he increase the threat to international peace and security 
 bosnia and herzegovina have the institution and mechanism to respond to this crisis and we support all effort by domestic actor to de escalate the situation and take appropriate action last week i convene a call with my french counterpart and the other quint partner the united states germany and italy plus european union institution in which we discuss our joint effort to bolster security and stability i also speak to the high representative last week 
 in the last few week i have speak to the bosnian foreign minister elmedin konaković reaffirm the uk government ’s full support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of bosnia and herzegovina the uk special envoy to the western balkans dame karen pierce reiterate that message during her visit to bosnia and herzegovina on and   march at our direction 
 we welcome the decision by operation althea under the eu peacekeeping mission eufor the european union force in bosnia and herzegovina to activate its reserve force to provide reassurance to the community most affect by the rise tension 
 in conclusion dodik ’s action do not serve the people of bosnia and herzegovina include those reside in republika srpska the people of bosnia and herzegovina need their political leader to focus on pass reform and build an inclusive future rather than exacerbate tension and amplifying secessionist rhetoric 
 i thank the minister for his remark attempt to undermine bosnia and herzegovina ’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and by extension the dayton peace agreement be deeply troubling over many year the uk have be a reliable supporter of bosnia and herzegovina ’s democratic and pluralistic journey and a trust promoter when it come to the security of the western balkans 
 we be proud when in government to have appoint lord peach as the special envoy to the western balkans his work be incredibly solid and robust and we welcome the fact that the government have maintain that position with the appointment of dame karen pierce we too look forward to engage with she 
 i know that the minister have speak with foreign minister konaković but what be the uk do in practical term both to support bosnia and herzegovina to stay the course and maintain stability and to defend and promote freedom and democracy in the region for the reason that the minister outline the issue be pivotable to the security and integrity of the region how do he envisage that the situation could be de escalate and can he update the house on the government ’s position on strengthen tie between nato and bosnia and herzegovina what be his position on eufor and its response in recent day 
 what direct discussion have the minister or the foreign secretary have with leader from across the western balkans include about the very concern action by the leadership of republika srpska specifically on the protest in serbia what assessment have the minister make of the impact on regional stability and security and what assessment have he make of any russian involvement in response to the protest there 
 finally can the minister share what plan he have to work with kosovo to shore up and build on its sovereignty and independence the western balkans matter to the united kingdom for so many reason and now more than ever give the war in ukraine so we must be an active player in promote and support stability in the region 
 i thank the shadow foreign secretary for her point i be glad she raise lord peach because that allow i to put on the record again my tribute to he for all his excellent work as the high representative it be a genuine pleasure to work alongside he i be also delighted that we now have dame karen pierce of our most experienced diplomat in the role she be already play a crucial role across the region as i say of her very visit be to bosnia because of the very issue that the shadow foreign secretary have outline 
 the right hon lady ask what we be do i have be very clear about the diplomatic effort that we be take across the region work with partner and ally include the united states the european union   and member of the quint we continue to work with partner and engage with regional partner who be absolutely crucial to that stability the foreign secretary meet croatian foreign minister radman on   march and i speak to serbian foreign minister marko djuric on   march as part of a regular series of engagement that we have be have include through the berlin process the right hon lady will be pleased to know that we will now be host the berlin process and that preparation for the summit be be lead by dame karen pierce i assure she that the foreign secretary and i have have extensive engagement with regional partner i be out in serbia and montenegro just a few week ago and i intend to visit the region again soon 
 the right hon lady ask about the important role of nato alongside eufor i have refer to eufor already we continue to support bosnia and herzegovina ’s aspiration for euro atlantic integration include nato membership through joint training of uk and bosnia and herzegovina armed force and our support for reform we be help it strengthen capability and enable alignment with nato standard we be work to invest in and strengthen the capability of the bosnia and herzegovinian armed force for peacekeeping operation country that export security be also more secure themselves we maintain office at the nato headquarters in sarajevo 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 what we have see from russia in georgia moldova romania the baltic state and now play out in the western balkans be nothing less than hybrid warfare democracy be work hard together to stand strong and support ukraine but do the minister agree that we need to put more effort into work with our ally in support of eastern europe and the western balkans which be very much on the frontline 
 my right hon friend the chair of the select committee rightly raise russia ’s malign action not only in relation to its illegal and barbarous war in ukraine but across the whole of europe and globally we continue to see a pattern of behaviour intend to hamper euro atlantic aspiration and exploit instability and division 
 recent attempt by russia to divide the international community at the united nations security council and in the osce have only far demonstrate the resoluteness of partner to work together to protect the territorial integrity of bosnia and herzegovina my right hon friend ’s work in the committee on these issue be crucial we be also work closely with our ally and the european union on these matter in relation to not just the balkans but location such as moldova 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 my former party leader the late lord ashdown regularly express his grave concern about the fragility of the situation in bosnia and herzegovina draw on his own experience as the country ’s former high representative despite repeat warning the uk ignore the threat pose to peace in bosnia by milorad dodik his entourage and   his supporter in the kremlin dodik ’s late defiance of international authority reject the legal order of the international peace envoy be only the late act in his concerted work to undermine the dayton agreement and regional stability in the balkans 
 it be clear that the uk have take its eye off the ball in bosnia the conservatives short sighted decision in to withdraw our troop from the eufor althea peacekeeping operation send entirely the wrong signal about our commitment to the region do the minister agree that the uk should recommit to the eufor mission so we can work in lockstep with our international partner to prevent a further deterioration of the situation in the balkans 
 madam deputy speaker you will understand that i can not comment on the previous government but i know there be strong support across the house for peace and stability across the balkans and that we be all engage in that effort 
 i assure the hon gentleman that we absolutely have not take our eye off the ball this region be of the most important to the foreign secretary and myself not least because of our long history of engagement in the region it be why we have now put in place of our most senior diplomat to act as special envoy and why we have be engage in the diplomatic conversation i mention 
 on the role of the high representative we be clear that the political crisis be cause by republika srpska president dodik and his supporter we support the high representative ’s role and we support the use of his power if necessary his role remain vital for bosnia and herzegovina ’s future prosperity and stability and we continue to work alongside eufor and indeed with the nato presence we have there too 
 we all know that dodik have continually deny that a genocide occur at srebrenica i be absolutely appalled to see that after his conviction he be invite by the israeli minister for antisemitism to go to jerusalem to address an antisemitism conference i hope that the minister can restate the uk ’s strong belief that a genocide occur at srebrenica and that other country should not be invite dodik to address conference particularly on the subject of genocide 
 i obviously can not comment on mr dodik ’s travel but i can say that we be absolutely clear on what happen at srebrenica my hon friend will know that i have visit srebrenica and that we have do important work with remembering srebrenica again there be a cross party attitude on this issue across the house we be in a year of very important and solemn anniversary and it be crucial that leader refrain from inflammatory rhetoric and action and instead focus on build trust between community across the western balkans and particularly in bosnia and herzegovina 
 president dodik ’s language and action be both reckless and dangerous give that the minister have just admit to there be russian meddling in the region as we know it have be go on for many year can i ask what conversation he have have with the americans to ensure that they continue to have command of the nato headquarters in sarajevo   to the point make by the liberal democrat spokesperson   the hon member for lewes james maccleary can the minister say whether the uk could play a bit more of a role in eufor and from his discussion with the french minister whether there be likely to be an extension of that mandate 
 as i say i meet of the american representative on friday with other quint member and there be unity across the quint on these issue we will continue to work closely with the united states and other partner on this matter eufor be vital for maintain peace and security in bosnia and herzegovina and for uphold the military aspect of the dayton peace agreement and we regularly engage with both eufor directly and the eu delegation 
 as the right hon gentleman know we do not currently participate in eu common security and defence policy mission of course we be open to future opportunity for co operation and we have identify the western balkans and indeed hybrid activity as of the area where we need to see close co operation the subject be discuss by the foreign secretary and the eu at the foreign affairs council in luxembourg a few month ago 
 do the minister agree that we need leader in the west balkans region who be focus on build a stable and inclusive future for all the people of the region instead of escalate tension with reckless rhetoric 
 i could not agree more i sincerely hope that all include leader in republika srpska will focus on deliver the reform and progress necessary for their citizen instead of use inflammatory rhetoric and divisive language which seek only to break down community and unity rather than build up the trust between community that be so need 
 in the 1960 germany take the very important step of show programme about what have happen in the world war with the holocaust the exact opposite have be happen in republika srpska and area of bosnia and herzegovina where textbook be be rewrite to actually increase that hatred will the minister say what plan the government have and what intervention they can make to try to get the truth of what happen during that war out to people so that those country do not just generate another generation of hatred 
 i completely agree with the broad thrust of the right hon gentleman ’s comment ensure that we understand what happen in the past and do not attempt to deny what happen be obviously crucial for all community build trust between community be also crucial he will understand that we have fund a number of programme as do the previous government include to support those who suffer sexual violence in the conflict in the 1990 as well as provide extensive support to the international commission on missing persons which have help to account for more than of the people miss from the conflict of the 1990s those sort of action be crucial to rebuild trust and deal with the legacy of the past 
 i volunteer with the osce to ensure free and fair election in bosnia   and herzegovina in follow the dayton peace agreement i therefore have huge concern about the escalate tension i welcome the diplomatic effort we be undertake to support stability on which the minister have update we but can he confirm that he be work closely with european civil society partner such as the osce to secure peace and stable democracy in the region 
 we continue to work with all organisation that seek to promote peace and stability in the region my hon friend rightly mention the osce which be crucial i know that the issue be of keen interest to member of the osce parliamentary assembly in this place we will continue to work with they with the council of europe and with other include our partner in the eu the us and beyond civil society organisation be crucial to that work many example of the work that we have do in the past to build trust between community and on peacebuilde have be achieve through civil society organisation 
 be the minister aware of report that russia today and sputnik be increase their dissemination of disinformation in bosnia and herzegovina at the same time as the widely respected bosnian service of voice of america face closure will he see what more we can do to counter russian disinformation in the region perhaps by increase broadcasting by the bbc world service 
 the right hon gentleman be right to highlight the destabilising hybrid activity of russia not just in bosnia but across the region he know the step that have be take in this country against rt and other russian outlet indeed we have call they out across europe and have work with partner on that he be absolutely right that free fair truthful and legitimate medium be need to ensure that citizen have the truth about what be happen not the kind of lie that be peddle from the kremlin i can not make specific promise but he know that we treat the bbc world service very seriously the under secretary of state my hon friend   the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west be here with i and will have hear his comment closely 
 as have be note the action of milorad dodik over the past few week and month have seriously undermine the stability of bosnia and herzegovina and have undermine the dayton peace agreement which end the country ’s to-1995 war in the aftermath of the horrific genocide that take place in srebrenica what step be the government take to work with partner such as the us the eu and other western balkan country to ensure that the territorial integrity of bosnia be uphold during this fragile period 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the need to work with our partner my french counterpart minister haddad and i convene our quint partner and the eu institution on friday for a joint meeting minister haddad be visit london and we take the initiative to meet our partner because we be deeply concerned about the situation in bosnia we have also   be engage with those in the region include serbia and croatia i along with the special envoy the foreign secretary and other will continue to do so 
 detect the hand of russia here much as do across the entire periphery of europe from the high north ukraine the balkans and the caucasus which the chair of the foreign affairs committee mention to the sahel the maghreb and libya right over to the greenland iceland uk gap will the minister describe the british strategy for roll back russian destabilisation across the entire periphery of europe 
 in second 
 to do so in a few second would be a challenge but i assure   the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin   that in all those region we be not only conscious of what russia be do but actively work with partner to push back that be why it have be identify as an area for close co operation with the eu it be why we work closely with the united states and other and it be why we work closely with individual partner in specific contexts include in moldova in response to russian attempt there the balkans moldova the caucasus and elsewhere be all area in which we see russia spread misinformation lie and bad 
 dodik ’s reckless rhetoric have be note many time in the house this afternoon can the minister assure i that work be be do with partner in the region to ensure that there be no contagion i be think in particular of kosovo 
 my hon friend rightly raise kosovo a country that i have visit on several occasion and which we continue to support we also continue to support the important dialogue between belgrade and pristina and to work with eu and other counterpart on this crucial issue we play a crucial role in kfor in kosovo in promote peace and stability it be important as my hon friend say to understand the wide regional implication and to continue to work with all partner to promote peace and stability whether that be in bosnia and herzegovina in kosovo or in respond to russian hybrid activity 
 give the recent love in between washington and moscow it be hardly surprising that the killer in the kremlin be encourage all his sidekick to stir up trouble in area such as bosnia and herzegovina be the government aware of and keep under very close scrutiny other potential area where ally of mr putin can be expect to start to stir up trouble and destabilise thing as part of his move now that he be on the front foot in ukraine 
 i would not agree entirely with the right hon member ’s characterisation only have to look at what president trump have say in the last hour on these matter to see that we be unite in try to not only find a sustainable peace in ukraine but call out russia on its action and take the necessary action when it come to russia ’s activity elsewhere as i say there be very strong quint unity on this issue and it be a real pleasure to be alongside american and european counterpart with a strong united approach   it be crucial that there be strong transatlantic unity on these issue and we will continue to work for that with european and american partner 
 the sarajevo security conference be in a couple of month and there will be a session on defence technology i have be ask along to speak about it nato country in europe be rearm and spend increase defence budget on invest in and develop defence technology what step be the minister take to ensure that our friend in bosnia and herzegovina be also update their capability what message can i take to that conference 
 i be glad to hear that my hon friend have be invite to that conference it be important that we have link at a parliamentary level with country in the western balkans particularly on these important matter i mention early that we be work include through our presence at the nato headquarters in sarajevo on invest in and strengthen the capability of bosnia and herzegovina ’s armed force and consider how they might be deploy internationally too that be very important we will continue to work with european partner both inside and outside nato to ensure that we can all collectively contribute to european defence particularly in response to the hybrid activity and new advance in warfare we see whether it be cyber or drone technology 
 i draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests last november i visit the srebrenica memorial centre and i be sure the minister will share my revulsion at the fact that it have to close its door for a short period just a few week ago due to the political situation there before he do so can he elaborate on the position that the united states of america have adopt in respect of bosnia and herzegovina and whether he view the us as a stable ally that recognise that the western balkans be crucial to the security of europe as a whole 
 we and the united states play a crucial role in the western balkans particularly in achieve the dayton peace agreement itself we continue to be commit to that as i say there have be strong unity among the quint and it be important that the united states and europe work together on these issue there have be a legacy of year of relative stability i say relative because there have be deep threat to it at different point and we need that to continue for the people of bosnia and herzegovina i be sure we be all committed to that 
 far to the question from my right hon friend   the member for maldon sir john whittingdale and know how much the minister value soft power can he reassure the house that there will be no further cut to the british council or the world service in the balkans on his watch 
 i will come back to the hon lady on her specific point about british council and the bbc world service funding but i have mention our wide development spending in the region while we be   have to make very difficult decision at the moment it be worth reflect on the fact that through around £ this year from the integrate security fund and foreign commonwealth and development office official development assistance we have continue to empower woman and girl strengthen democracy build resilience to domestic and state threat and promote peacebuilding and transitional justice we have be engage across a range of different area in the development and soft power space to contribute to peace and stability in the western balkans and in bosnia and herzegovina specifically 
 i associate myself with the comment make about the british council and the bbc world service a few week ago i have the privilege of visit brigade the anti russian disinformation brigade base at newbury have an assessment be make of the rise of russian misinformation and disinformation in the republika srpska theatre in recent month we hear during that meeting that russia be increasingly use misinformation and disinformation across ukraine eastern europe and indeed the balkans 
 we be clear that russia continue to spread lie and disinformation and misinformation not only in the western balkans but in many other location across europe we continue to work with ally and partner the eu and other to challenge that there be a particular challenge in the western balkans which be why we also support effort there to strengthen free medium journalism and civil society organisation 
 in my previous role as trade envoy to the western balkans i visit bosnia and herzegovina on a number of occasion and it be evident that though the entrepreneurial spirit be alive and well business leader be frustrate by the deadlocked structure that they must work in our embassy be do what it can but can the government take any further initiative that could increase economic activity and trade between our nation 
 the hon member raise an important point and i pay tribute to he for his work he and i travel together on a number of visit to the region include to bosnia and kosovo so i be well aware of his interest and engagement there there be many opportunity for increase economic linkage and trade with all the country in the region and we continue to promote those indeed i discuss they on my recent visit to serbia and montenegro 
 the hon member be absolutely right that this be fundamentally about leadership in the region as i say the people of bosnia and herzegovina need political leader to focus on pass reform and build inclusive future rather than exacerbate tension as we be see with president dodik in republika srpska because that do not serve the people of republika srpska 
 the minister have acknowledge that the secessionist move in republika srpska could have ramification for the western balkans more broadly part of that be the north of kosovo where there be a kosovo serb minority while the uk do not contribute to eufor and   operation althea we do contribute to kfor in kosovo what contingency plan exist for british troop to reinforce kfor through a strategic reserve as happen in 
 i be sure the hon member will understand that i be not go to get into operational detail but he can be sure that we prepare for all scenario across the region that be why we have welcome the step that eufor have take in relation to bosnia and herzegovina 
 the hon member be right to highlight the role that we play in kfor indeed i also visit kfor with   the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers   and see the important work that it do in line with its mandate it be important that everybody take step to de escalate tension and deal with issue that have not be deal with i have raise the banjska incident a number of time include with serbia and it be important that those responsible be hold accountable 
 i thank the minister very much for his answer he understand the issue incredibly well he will be aware of the recent judgment make in respect of human right in particular those involve discrimination against the jewish community will he outline whether the deputation include discussion of faith and freedom and people ’s ability to practise their faith and what the outcome be envisage to be to secure the right for people to hold and live their faith no matter what that faith be in bosnia and herzegovina 
 i thank the hon member for that important question he will be pleased to know that interfaith engagement be part of the special envoy ’s recent visit i can write to he with a little more detail about that 
 of course this be a country that have a strong tradition for a number of different faith at the moment we be celebrate eid and the end of the holy month of ramadan but alongside muslim community christian and jewish community have a long heritage in bosnia and herzegovina i have witness that with my own eye we remain a staunch defender of freedom of religion or belief and we will continue to work with organisation that promote an inclusive and diverse society where everybody be respect and not discriminate against on the basis of their religion or belief 
 the heartbreaking scene from myanmar and thailand over the weekend have shock the world i be sure i speak for those across the house in express our sincere condolence to all those affect by this terrible tragedy
