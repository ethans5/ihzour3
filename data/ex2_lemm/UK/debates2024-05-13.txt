i be obviously concerned to hear that case we have just have a consultation on the possibility of move from collect and pay to direct pay for all claimant which would certainly help to put a great focus on compliance although i be more than happy to arrange a meeting i be not sure that with i would be much help because i be not in charge of child maintenance i will ask the relevant minister in the lords to have a meeting with the hon member 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the average time take to decide the outcome of personal independence payment application 
 the time take to process a new pip claim fall from week in august to week at the end of january this year 
 i have recently help a constituent who wait month for an appeal against an initial pip decision the paperwork for that decision be incorrect it refer to another person we do not know who that person be and it take another month to correct that and another month to pay she the process could well be describe as a shamble another constituent have describe it as a highly stressful bureaucratic nightmare will the secretary of state give we some reassurance that his department be work to speed up the process and make it more dignified for those people apply for help 
 i set out the improvement in the processing time that people have be experience in fact we be now at week that be the figure at the end of january which be quick than be the case during the pandemic i can not comment on the individual circumstance that the hon lady have identify but i will of course be happy to look at the matter that she have raise 
 what step he be take to help fill job vacancy in st austell and newquay constituency 
 i know that my hon friend know what a fantastic job his jobcentre do this month st austell be run a sector base placement with crown rail offer guarantee interview to those who complete the training newquay jobcentre have work brilliantly to bring in new employer who be use the jobcentre regularly to help fill their vacancy 
 i thank the minister for that answer and join she in thank the excellent department for work and pensions staff at both newquay and st austell jobcentre through their hard work and under the leadership and policy of the government we have achieve an employment rate locally which be well above the national average we also have some great opportunity for the job of the future come through in renewable energy lithium extraction and the space sector what more be the government do to ensure that local people in cornwall can grasp those opportunity 
 my hon friend be a formidable champion for his area as we speak our partnership team be work with local employer such as naked solar to design sector base work programme and fill potential vacancy i be keen to work with he and his neighbour because the area that he name be all good for the high wage job that his constituent deserve 
 i call the chair of the work and pensions committee 
 helpful change would be to extend access to employment support to economically inactive people in st austell and newquay who be not claim benefit and do not have access to that support will the minister consider that as a step towards increase the prospect of fill the current job vacancy 
 we have extend the restart scheme for another couple of year make sure that everybody who walk through the door of our jobcentre be meet by a work coach what we need to do be ensure that they have the time to look at that bespoke support 
 what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the child maintenance service in secure fund from pay parent 
 the government be commit to ensure that separate parent support their child take robust enforcement action against those who do not do so since december there have be an increase from to in those pay something towards maintenance through collect and pay 
 last year i write to the department about a loophole that allow pay parent who earn non taxable income overseas to avoid make child maintenance payment for of my constituent that loophole have allow their ex partner not to pay any maintenance and effectively engage in financial abuse towards they will the minister meet i to discuss that loophole to ensure that pay parent be fulfil their financial obligation to their child 
 i be obviously concerned to hear that case we have just have a consultation on the possibility of move from collect and pay to direct pay for all claimant which would certainly help to put a great focus on compliance.[official report   may vol c. 12wc correction although i be more than happy to arrange a meeting i be not sure that with i would be much help because i be not in charge of child maintenance i will ask the relevant minister in the lords to have a meeting with the hon member 
 what step his department be take to increase the support available in jobcentre in south east cornwall constituency 
 my hon friend will know that her local jobcentre be do a good job of help people find and progress in work in her area drive the recruitment of seasonal worker and create exciting partnership with employer such as morrisons 
 with your permission mr speaker i would like to put on record my condolence to the family and many friend of my immediate predecessor colin breed who sadly pass away last thursday 
 under the conservatives we have near record level of payrolle employment and i regularly hear from employer that they can not get the staff need last month ’s house of commons library paper on people claim unemployment benefit state that people be do so in my constituency what more can the department do to make sure that the unemployed be ready to fit into vacancy as they arise by look at what local business need 
 i be sure i speak for the whole house when i join my hon friend in send our condolence to the family and friend of her predecessor 
 our employment relation team be work hard with local employer to match customer to the vacancy in my hon friend ’s business we be build skill work with sector base work academy programme and boot camp support people with a generous increase childcare offer of up to £ for child and £ for and help people with access to travel for those on the health journey later this year we will roll out our workwell programme across england include in area in the south west 
 on specific day jobcentre have be close due to ongoing industrial action can the minister assure i that anybody who miss an appointment due to that action will not be sanction 
 we will always take a reasonable view and make sure that unavoidable circumstance such as those the hon gentleman speak of will be take into account when talk to customer 
 what plan he have to increase level of employment 
 we have a near record level of employment and very low level of unemployment but we be not stop there the chancellor announce our back to work plan in the previous statement 
 the late office for national statistics figure show that the number of claimant in my constituency fall over the past year that be good news but more need to be do do the secretary of state agree that we always need to make work pay that we need to create incentive for people to get back into work and that local action such as my annual job fair which i hold recently in partnership with the dwp halesowen college and the halesowen business improvement district can make a practical difference on the ground by get opportunity to people 
 i congratulate my hon friend on the reduction in the number of claimant in his constituency which i know be at least in part due to the excellent job   fair he assist in organising he be right that work should pay that be why i be very proud that mine be the party that bring in universal credit make sure that that be exactly the case 
 may i add to the tribute pay by   the hon member for south east cornwall mrs murray   to my friend colin breed who serve south east cornwall with great dignity before she i thank she for pay tribute to colin and offer condolence to his friend and family 
 in our part of the world the issue be less unemployment and more the lack of a workforce the lake district have visitor every year and a relatively small working age population of whom be already employ in hospitality and tourism can the secretary of state help we out by say yes at least to discussion with the european commission which have offer a youth mobility visa programme between the uk and europe only youth mobility visa scheme exist with europe already and it be with andorra which be quite small 
 i think the government have already say they be not minded to pursue the scheme to which the hon gentleman refer but that be not the same thing as say that we do not take the issue extremely seriously that be why we have extensive training provision such as swap the sector base work academy programme and the workwell provision that we be roll out to which my hon friend the minister for employment have just refer 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of provide compensation to woman bear in the 1950 affect by change to the state pension age 
 the ombudsman ’s report have be lay before parliament and it be under active and considerable consideration at the present time 
 a report in today ’s scottish daily express note that in member of the public support financial compensation for woman bear in the 1950s if the government will not act on the final report of the parliamentary and health service ombudsman which recommend compensation will they now listen to the voice of the people and provide the proper financial redress that the woman against state pension inequality absolutely deserve and be entitle to 
 there be a variety of opinion as to what the outcome of the ombudsman ’s report should be there be the ombudsman ’s recommendation themselves to which some people take a counter view while other believe that there should be more by way of payment we be potentially look at very large sum indeed it be important therefore and only fair to those on all side of the argument that we take an appropriate amount of time to consider the report thoroughly which the ombudsman have also invite parliament to consider 
 i call the father of the house 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for remind himself and we that the ombudsman have unusually suggest that parliament should get involve some be ask for £ compensation per person the ombudsman have recommend between £ and just under £ could the secretary of state indicate whether he will make a decision and if so when and how much 
 i thank my hon friend the father of the house for his question i can not prejudge the outcome of the very detailed set of consideration he make reference to the amount involve which be considerable as i have say it be absolutely right that we look very carefully at the conclusion of that report and listen to what parliament have to say in that respect 
 roslyn gilmore be of several waspi woman in my constituency it have now be week since we have the statement to the house so i repeat the call again when can we expect the response to the ombudsman ’s report 
 i refer the hon gentleman to the answer that i have just give to the father of the house it have to be stress quite rightly that the report be year in the making and that be in part at least due to the complexity of the matter under consideration we be look at those matter extremely carefully 
 thing can not be dispute the be that some woman come to harm because of what happen the be that the report and the assessment that come to pass prior to it be a long time in the making i encourage the secretary of state to look into this matter not just carefully as he say and i know he will but at great pace 
 i have make it clear from the dispatch box that there will be no undue delay in come to conclusion on this matter 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 in evidence to the work and pensions committee on tuesday the ombudsman essentially say that the reason it decide to lay the report before parliament be that it could not trust the government to deal with it i ask the secretary of state a simple question do he have confidence in the ombudsman and do he accept its report 
 i have make our position extremely clear we be consider the report and it will come back to the house in due course and without undue delay the ombudsman have as the hon gentleman indicate invite the house to express its opinion as well that be something that we will consider alongside the matter raise in the report 
 the secretary of state be right to say that in due course be on people ’s lip because the reality be that waspi woman have now die as they do with every pass day indeed waspi   woman would have die in the time our select committee hearing take on tuesday be not the issue here that the government hope that this issue will be lose during the course of an election campaign and that the big party can concoct a situation in which we ignore the matter more woman will die and more 1950 woman will be deny the justice that they deserve 
 i simply do not accept that that be a fair assessment of the very considerable time and effort that we be put into take this matter extremely seriously 
 if he will make an estimate of the number of in work universal credit claimant that have have payment stop due to error make by his department in the last month 
 no estimate have be make but customer can request a mandatory reconsideration if they do not agree with a decision to stop their universal credit 
 my constituent georgina mitchell be a single mum to child of whom have additional need she work as a nurse and be in receipt of universal credit the minister say that work pay but since october georgina have have her benefit stop intermittently because the dwp have falsely record her earning as £ month £ the next and so on and so forth she can not pay her social landlord and her ability to pay for childcare be severely impact i have raise the matter with local official but despite assurance it keep happen she can not sort this and despite my intervention i can not seem to sort it will the secretary of state or the minister investigate the matter urgently and advise i on why these mistake keep happen and on what will be do to ensure that they do not happen again 
 i be very concerned to hear about the case that the hon lady have raise i be more than happy to look into it if she contact i far and i recognise the urgency with which we would need to do that 
 what recent estimate he have make of the number of pensioner in poverty 
 poverty among pensioner have remain stable with no statistically significant change since the number of pensioner with relative low income decrease by in to and since over pensioner have be lift out of poverty 
 my inbox be full of constituent who be sick of the economic chaos inflict by this government and by the former prime minister   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss can the minister explain why the number of elderly   individual resort to food bank have double in the past year to nearly be the people of bury south wrong and if they be what be the reason why so many elderly resident can not afford to eat in this country 
 in of low income pensioner live in a household that have access a food bank within month that percentage be unchanged from the previous year ’s figure i recognise the effort that people put into supply their front benchers and back benchers with zinger point to make but when i be in that role year ago i learn to make sure i have work out what the government ’s answer might actually be 
 we now come to the temporary shadow minister i wish the shadow secretary of state   the hon member for leicester west liz kendall a speedy recovery and look forward to see she in the house angela eagle welcome back 
 thank you very much mr speaker i be sure that the shadow secretary of state be make a good recovery she be probably watch we even now in between her physiotherapy 
 be it not the case that on this government ’s watch food bank usage have double for pensioner and over pensioner nearly in be now live in poverty that figure be not stable it be rise so what be the minister go to do about it 
 of course i also pass on my good wish to the shadow secretary of state who i hope be recover well 
 just as i give   the hon member for bury south christian wakeford   some advice i can now give some advice to labour front benchers always listen to the answer the minister have just give i will repeat it in of low income pensioner live in a household that have access a food bank within month that percentage be unchanged from last year ’s figure 
 but pensioner be in poverty labour get far more pensioner out of poverty than the minister ’s government have and the number of pensioner in poverty be now rise it be when the conservatives come into office and it be now so there be more pensioner in poverty despite the minister ’s bluster the government ’s own statistic show that well over a of pensioner entitle to pension credit be not receive it which save his department almost £ a year even when pensioner do apply the minister ’s department be miss its own week service standard for process new claim in nearly a quarter of all case why be his department so reluctant to ensure that pensioner be receive the benefit they be entitle to 
 the government be put an enormous amount of effort into improve the uptake of pension credit the number of claim receive in financial year be more than high than in the same period the year before and the recent case load be go up for the time in over a decade we have give cost of live payment to pensioner on pension credit we have give pensioner extra money   on top of their winter fuel allowance and cold weather payment the reality be that no government have support the pensioner population more than this government have as we all know labour be the party of 75p pension increase no pensioner will ever forget that 
 what step his department be take to reduce waiting time for access to work assessment 
 access to work remain in high demand we have increase the number of staff process access to work claim and be prioritise both renewal application and application from customer about to start a job we be also improve the service through increase digitalisation to reduce the time from application to decision 
 on this there be a litany of broken promise to disabled people minister have fail to tackle the backlog fail to open the scheme to more employer fail to extend the scheme to apprenticeship and fail to passport package of support so why have ministers now decide to hit disabled people with more brutal cut to pip when they have not support disabled people into work through access to work 
 the average timescale for an access to work application decision in april be day we have increase the staff on application redeploy staff from wide dwp work despite the hon gentleman ’s point claim for reimbursement be in a good position within a day ambition to pay it reflect the ambition that employer have and their mindset change to be more open minded with their recruitment and i be delighted about that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 let ’s get some fact on   january there be people await an access to work decision on   february on   march and on   april every month the figure keep increase so since the beginning of the access to work backlog have rise by more than do the minister really think this be support more disabled people back into work 
 i thank the hon lady for her point if we be trading figure at the close of business on   may there be application await decision i remind those people listen why this matter this be very significant support demand lead support for people who be get opportunity to work or take on new role this grant can provide up to £ worth of flexible personalise support per person per year it be absolutely right that we get the right information from the individual and take time to approve a significant application such as this 
 i be absolutely shocked that the minister brag about the access to work backlog increase to 
 last month the un publish its late review of how the uk have implement its convention on the right of disabled person the since the access to work backlog be just of the many reason cite as evidence that the government be still fail to take all appropriate measure to address grave and systemic violation of disabled people ’s right do the minister have any plan to put this right by finally implement the un ’s recommendation or be she go to ignore they as successive tory government have consistently ignore disabled people 
 i be disappointed not to be enough of a bragger in this house but i be very pleased that we be take time to make sure that the tailored support be correct we be work around fit note and occupational health we be also listen to those who be deaf and hard of hearing who make up of the total access to work expenditure and i will be bring more to the house on that matter we be absolutely focused on improve this with online application for access to work on the other point the hon lady make if she listen to the bbc access all podcast she will hear i say that we be very disappointed about that report we continue to work very hard for disabled people and we will be do all we can to make sure they be listen to unlike she not listen to a word i say just now 
 what step he be take to help fill job vacancy in sittingbourne and sheppey constituency 
 i thank my hon friend for his question fantastically as the timing would have it the team in his constituency be today hold a job fair at swale leisure centre with the support of local employer the local radio station be broadcast live from the event to promote opportunity and the dwp be work hard day in day out to get people into work 
 i thank my hon friend for that reply but do she agree that it be also important to ensure that people who be unemployed have the education and skill training need to take the job on offer much of the unemployment in my constituency be on the isle of sheppey with that in mind will she join i in welcome the radical shake up of secondary education now take place on the island and in addition the extension of sheppey college to provide additional post-16 skill training course which be be part fund by the government ’s levelling up fund 
 i join my hon friend in that because any way we can help lift skill across the piece such as through boot camp and workplace academy programme to help people into high skill well pay job particularly in area where perhaps that have not be the norm be to be welcome and congratulate 
 rise 
 be it really link i call jim shannon 
 may i thank the minister for what she be go to do for the sittingbourne and sheppey constituency as that be absolutely brilliant however i would love to see the same thing happen across all of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and in particular in strangford could the minister work with the local college which can provide opportunity and skill it be well 
 order i can save the minister replying the question be only about fill job vacancy in sittingbourne and sheppey not the rest of the world let we move on that be a good effort but out of i would give it 
 what step he be take to reform the welfare system 
 what step his department be take to reform the welfare system 
 on reform welfare we be increase the incentive to work and increase the disincentive not to work or to engage with the system and we be look to well target help for those who need it most 
 i be most grateful to my right hon friend for that answer i recently discuss the consultation on change to the personal independence payment with waveney shims suffolk help in multiple sclerosis our local ms support group it highlight the need for a more targeted and fair approach for those with fluctuating condition which should include the scrapping of the metre and the rule and the need for assessment to be carry out by those qualified and with a full understanding of neurological condition could he confirm that the review will take these matter into consideration 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and considerable interest and knowledge in this area and for the discussion he have hold with i on these matter as he will know we be currently go through a week consultation on how pip can be reform i certainly subscribe to the view that we want to examine the issue of size fit all and whether there be well way of look after people 
 i welcome the government ’s welfare reform and celebrate the million of additional people now in work thank to this conservative government i note that every labour government there have ever be have leave more people unemployed and on the dole queue at the end than at the beginning theirs be a truly disgraceful record however can my right hon friend assure my constituent who may be chronically ill or vulnerable that although there will be support in place they will not be force back into work if that be not appropriate 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right work be essential and be at the heart of the reform we be bring through indeed the office for budget   responsibility have assess the impact of our measure with the work capability assessment reform for example as lead to over few people on those benefit by the end of the forecast period i be very proud of that achievement because as he highlight that will mean more people have work and the benefit of it 
 the secretary of state claim that his work capability assessment reform be to encourage more people to get into work yet the independent office for budget responsibility forecast that just of the people who would be deny financial support would actually move into work in the next year so the evidence be clear that these reform be code for cut will the secretary of state finally come clean and admit that welfare reform be about deny vital protection and support for people with serious mental and physical health condition 
 the reform we be bring in be not a code for cut they be a clear well think through set of reform for put work right at the centre of people ’s existence the hon lady quote the office for budget responsibility she will be aware that it believe that the measure that the chancellor have bring in over the past fiscal event will overall mean more people in the labour market 
 when the secretary of state be consider welfare reform will he please look at the shamble in the child maintenance service over the past year the number of complaint to my constituency office have skyrocket chief among those be that constituent can not get response when they do those response differ between different member of staff and often be in conflict with each other what will he do to address the extraordinary waiting time and other communication issue within the child maintenance service 
 we be look at modernise how the child maintenance agency operate as the hon lady will know if she have specific example of constituent who have have undue waiting time i will be interested in put she in touch with the relevant minister he serve in the other place as the house will know for he to consider they 
 what step his department be take to support people with autism into employment 
 we be continue to run programme to support autistic people into employment include local support employment disability confident and access to work the department for work and pensions will also be work with stakeholder to support the independent task group carry forward the recommendation follow the buckland review of autism employment 
 may i draw my hon friend ’s attention to the effort by darlington building society along with other company in the region support the north   east autism society to help create job for people with autism can my hon friend highlight the work be do by the fantastic team at darlington jobcentre with their health and welfare roadshow this wednesday to help people get back into work 
 i thank my hon friend for bring to the attention of the house the important initiative go on in his patch in darlington such local programme have a huge impact in help autistic people into work and tackle stigma once establish i be sure that the buckland review task group will be interested to hear direct detail of the work be do in his area 
 the minister be right that the buckland inquiry and report be a breath of fresh air i contribute to that inquiry as chair of the westminster commission on autism however be it not a fact that too often people on the autism spectrum or any spectrum be undervalue in term of their huge potential to do great thing in our economy in many job will she look at early diagnosis which be so important 
 the hon gentleman and the minister for employment my hon friend   the member for bury st edmunds jo churchill be link together on this we have specialist swap for people on the autism spectrum so that we can see that talent and ability autistica estimate that in people be autistic that be around across the uk but sadly just in of working age autistic disabled people be in employment and the government be determined to tackle that with the review 
 what step his department be take to help reduce unemployment 
 what step his department be take to help reduce unemployment 
 we be bear down on unemployment not least through the sterling work of our jcp work coach as well as through the back to work plan that my right hon friend the chancellor recently announce 
 this friday i will be host my next job fair in atherstone along with the local dwp while these event have be successful with more than business typically on hand with live job on offer of the regular bit of feedback i get be that access to transport be often a barrier to people take up job particularly where those job might be out of the town centre or in industrial park and particularly before that pay packet come in will the secretary of state set out what if any support be available to help as many people get into some of the fantastic opportunity we have in north warwickshire and bedworth 
 i thank my hon friend for the extraordinary work that he do locally to support people into work he ask what support there be for those with travel challenge   the flexible support fund be there for a variety of different us but be to help with exactly the issue he raise for the month of employment 
 we have successfully halve inflation but we must get people back into work in bridgend we have lose the ford factory and biomet it be about local job i have always say that maintain close contact with local employer and work with business on the ground be the way to do it could the secretary of state tell the house what his department be do to work with employer to get people back to work 
 we do a huge amount with employer both at national level and at local jobcentre if my hon friend have not already engage with his local jobcentre staff i strongly recommend that he do so the result speak for themselves unemployment be around half the level in under the last labour government we have near record level of employment youth unemployment under this government have fall more than under labour it go up by almost 
 more than south west company be class as be in significant economic distress accord to begbies traynor ’s red flag alert report the loss of those business would deepen regional economic inequality and increase regional unemployment what step be the minister take with cabinet colleague to ensure that those business which provide vital job find a way out of significant economic distress 
 as we have set out there be a clear and detail back to work plan which be work for the reason that i have give if the hon lady have example of specific employer under the distress that she outline the minister for employment will be happy to look at what we may be able to do as a department in her constituency 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the prime minister say this morning and the secretary of state just repeat it that the government introduce universal credit to help people into work that be not a real account of the situation the truth be that not only do we have record sickness relate inactivity but young people be fare the bad i know what ministers will say the questionable allegation that labour government leave office with unemployment higher have already be trot out actually full fact find that that be particularly true of post war conservative government so will the minister acknowledge what be go on today for the time ever we have inactive to year old that ’ true be n’t it 
 i have already set out that we have universal credit as the hon lady identify as well as workwell and universal support to address exactly the individual to whom she refer on the general point it should be point out that economic inactivity be below the oecd g7 and european union average and low than in france italy and the united states and in every year under the last labour government 
 i say they would and i hear what the secretary of state say about scheme after scheme and initiative after initiative but what have the result be if the tory plan be work the obr would have forecast an increase employment rate would n’t it but what be the truth not only be employment forecast to go down but the forecast be downgrade in response to the government ’s policy that ’ the truth be n’t it 
 our record speak for itself more people in work since unemployment have halve since the last labour government on the hon lady ’s watch youth unemployment have fall by more than under her watch it rise by more than as i have state the last labour government ’s record on economic inactivity be that it be high than today every single year 
 what step his department be take to support pensioner 
 the state pension provide the foundation of support for old people in the next year we will fund more than £ of benefit for pensioner some of gdp 
 old people should be able to retire in comfort and dignity which be why this government create the triple lock and increase the state pension by this year and last year however many of my constituent be concerned about be tax on those pension as the personal allowance have in effect be freeze for nearly year will the minister encourage the chancellor to look again at the personal allowance and allow more pensioner to keep more of their well deserve money 
 as i be sure my hon friend be aware it be this government who have double the personal allowance since it be absolutely clear that those who rely solely on the state pension be not liable for income tax 
 we must all be aware of a grow number of pensioner who be struggle with rent council tax and other cost of living increase give that state of affair do the minister think there may be an argument that the threshold to access pension credit be too high and that if he be to lower it just a little he would help a great many more people who be obviously struggle 
 i draw the hon gentleman ’s attention to the fact that the state pension have go up by this year after an increase of last year on top of that for those in receipt of pension credit we have add £ in cost of living payment and have receive a £ top up to their winter fuel payment we have spend billion on support pensioner through the cost of living crisis as we establish in the exchange early pensioner poverty remain stable 
 what step his department be take to support pensioner with increase in the cost of living 
 what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of support for pensioner with increase in the cost of living 
 the government have provide total support of over £ to help household and individual with high bill as i just say in addition the basic state pension have go up by this year 
 but a new poll today show that third of people think the government should urgently pay fair compensation to all waspi woman include many in east leeds who be hit by the change to the state pension age it have be over week since the secretary of state get the parliamentary ombudsman ’s final report but nearly year since the ombudsman say that the department for work and pensions have commit maladministration through its failure to properly inform affected woman of the state pension age change with a waspi woman die every minute time be not on their side when will the government stop drag their foot to help ensure justice will the government allow mps to vote on a compensation package before the summer 
 the hon gentleman have hear the secretary of state reply at great length to a number of question on that subject today as he say we be look carefully at the report and consider what be a very complex set of recommendation and proposal to make sure that we do the right thing 
 minister certainly seem to prefer the comfort of their own massage figure to fact the trussell trust however say it have see a rise in pensioner turn to food bank in the past month and that be likely to increase the hard fact be that the uk devote a small percentage of gdp to state pension and pensioner benefit than most other advanced economy when will they take pensioner poverty seriously and fix this scandal 
 the household below average income statistic which be clear by the office for national statistics show that of low income pensioner live in a household that have access a food bank within month give all the effort we be put into the ongoing campaign to increase access to pension credit and the success that campaign be have i be very confident that we will make continue progress in reduce pensioner poverty 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 may i extend my good wish to my opposite number the shadow secretary of state   the hon member for leicester west liz kendall and wish she a speedy recovery since my last appearance at the dispatch box we have announce the area for the workwell pilot which will cover about a of england i be extremely pleased that we have also go out for consultation and a call for evidence on fit note reform that will feature within it the pilot i have just refer to on   may we announce that access to work have go digital finally i congratulate the minister for disabled people health and work my hon friend   the member for mid sussex mims davies   on her elevation to minister of state which reflect both the seriousness with which we take her portfolio and of course her undoubted ability and contribution to my department 
 i join the secretary of state in congratulate the minister on her elevation it be not before time 
 this conservative government have an enviable record when it come to employment with more people in work since i be pleased to hear that of the integrate care board involve in the workwell scheme which my right hon friend have just mention will be greater manchester icb which mean that my constituent will have access to integrated health and employment support from october interruption   the hon member for wirral south alison mcgovern   be heckle from a sedentary position the only job that she have create recently have be for a couple of clown interruption to be fair that be topical mr speaker 
 will my right hon friend explain how the workwell scheme will benefit people in my constituency and throughout greater manchester by ensure that they can access work 
 my hon friend be right the scheme be be roll out in greater manchester in part of london in cambridgeshire and all the way to the isles of scilly and part of cornwall it bring together healthcare support and work coach support to ensure that we do everything we can to help into work those who face barrier to work 
 it be an unavoidable fact that the united kingdom have of the low pension in the developed world and pensioner poverty be a very real issue i meet constituent who be pensioner reasonably frequently and all the increase that the government have provide for they have be lose through taxation for example peter ’s private pension will be cut by £ a year while mr and mrs clark ’s modest private pension have be slash by nearly they do the right thing and put away a little extra for their retirement will the government now do the right thing and correct the position so that they can enjoy it 
 order may i just say to everyone that i have a lot of member to get in on topical question and they be mean to be short and punchy i really do need to get other member in 
 let i simply point to what the resolution foundation have to say in its living standards outlook pensioner poverty be forecast to fall 
 give that it would not survive under labour just how vital be the work plan 
 my right hon friend be entirely right to raise that point in the absence of this government the work plan will be no more the problem be that we do not know exactly what will replace it because there be no plan from the party opposite no plan on work capability assessment no plan on personal independence payment no plan on fit note we do not know what labour stand for so let we stick with the plan and let we elect a conservative government at the next election 
 a recent report from the joseph rowntree foundation reveal shockingly that child experience destitution in the uk last year be it not the case that the government have completely fail the most vulnerable child in our society 
 no not at all we be provide significant support through the welfare system and expect to spend about £ in the current financial year include £ on child and those of work age we be focus on target cost of live support to the most vulnerable family the local housing allowance for instance help family in that bracket 
 let i begin by praise my local jobcentre in bexleyheath for the tremendous work it be do to get people into employment i visit it on friday and be very impressed our welfare system should always be there to protect the most vulnerable in our society but new challenge be threaten its sustainability and prevent it from work as intend i therefore welcome my right hon friend ’s plan to target the system well towards those who need it most by control spiral cost and ensure that it be fair to the taxpayer 
 my right hon friend be as always absolutely right we must have a system that target the most vulnerable in society and it must also be fair to the taxpayer because that be part of what underpin the confidence that the public have in our welfare state and that be worth preserve

 new statistic show that there be child live in relative poverty in the uk with as we have hear child experience destitution include in manchester which have the high level of destitution in the country what impact do the minister think the government crash the economy and unleash a cost of living crisis have have on those figure 
 i lay that out in reply to a previous question our economy be go gangbuster and inflation be down to i gently point the hon gentleman to the additional support deliver through the household support fund which we have extend for another month i might gently ask he to press the mayor of greater manchester on where the £ for his area have go

 i gently say to my right hon and learn friend that i be sure she would agree that any system have to be balance and fair for the taxpayer but also for those who need it most many work family do not see their income rise when they have to make choice and we have to make the system fair i would be more than happy to sit down with she and explain how we do that 
 maternity allowance contribution base jobseeker ’s allowance contribution base employment and support allowance bereavement benefit basic state pension and the new state pension these be all calculate use our contribution to national insurance give the chancellor ’s announcement of his desire to abolish national insurance cost £ what discussion have the secretary of state ’s department have with the treasury about how he be go to fund it 
 this scaremongere about the state pension and the £ on the back of what be an aspiration through time maybe more than parliament to abolish national insurance be frankly disgraceful particularly from a party that give we the 75p increase in and on its watch see we have the high rate of pensioner poverty in europe 
 thank to scientific research there be an emerge picture of the biological cause of common mental health condition give the secretary of state ’s extremely welcome workwell announcement question have be raise about how the individual implement it can not only understand the diagnostic pathway that they will need to go through but improve the evidence base for treatment specifically with solid science to support this government policy delivery will he work with his colleague in the department   of health and social care and the department for science innovation and technology to help academic research to provide the evidence that we need to deliver positive outcome for people with mental health condition 
 i thank my hon friend for her pertinent question that be exactly why we be pilot these measure and we want to make sure that we get it right i be interested in her suggestion and i would be happy to consider they in great detail 
 the government have be talk a lot about sick note culture as this be mental health awareness week do the minister agree the record long wait that many people face in get adequate mental healthcare be delay their return to work and keep they on benefit long 
 the approach we be take with our call for evidence be to try to find a system in which the fit note approach be improve and part of that must mean get treatment to people early rather than later that be exactly why my right hon friend the chancellor come forward with additional talk therapy within the nhs for exactly that purpose 
 may i put on record my thank to barrow jobcentre and to the central dwp team for the work they have be do to support the community through the team barrow project i be also delighted to find out that we be go to be a workwell pilot area in south cumbria could my right hon friend outline the difference that will make to local small and medium sized enterprise and to people look to get into the job market 
 it will intervene at a very early stage of the health journey for those fall out of work and go into long term sickness and disability benefit we want to stop that journey by help people and through workwell bring together healthcare assistant and work coach assistant to make sure that we retain people in work or if they be not far from the labour market bring they into employment 
 since we begin this question session a little over an hour ago waspi woman have die while we debate the challenge of    their pension the secretary of state talk about the great sum involve but can i remind he that those sum belong to the woman affect this government show no lack of haste in penalise those woman will they show the same eagerness to compensate they 
 it be important that all government policy be properly cost and that their cost to the taxpayer and the economy be take into account i have give the house an assurance that we be look in great detail at the report there will be no undue delay and we will come to our conclusion at the early possible moment 
 i have visit the old rehau building in amlwch which be be repurpose with business unit and a new jobcentre for the north of the island will the minister visit amlwch meet some of my constituent and personally thank the team who have work so hard to find a suitable building 
 diolch yn fawr to the team in ynys môn we have be search for a building for a number of year to go to the add youth offer and i would be delighted to join my hon friend in ynys môn and to thank the team 
 i call jim shannon 
 i will get it right this time mr speaker 
 what discussion have the minister have with the department for communities back home in the northern ireland executive in relation to the extreme poverty surge witness in the winter of and 
 as the hon gentleman will know the northern ireland executive be at liberty to make their own arrangement on most of the benefit for which the department for work and pensions be responsible however they generally choose to go with our decision i assure he that official work very closely with their counterpart in northern ireland to make sure that we take the need of the northern irish people into account when we take those decision 
 before we begin the urgent question i will make a short announcement about the house ’s sub judice resolution 
 a coroner ’s inquest have be open into some of the death of man at hmp parc and those proceeding be now sub judice however give the significant public interest in address this matter i have decide to grant a waiver in respect of the inquest under the house ’s resolution relate to the matter of sub judice while hon member may refer to those death i would urge the house to bear in mind the possibility that criminal or civil proceeding might be bring in future and hon member should exercise caution in their remark 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if he will provide an update on the situation in parc prison 
 ensure that our prison be safe and secure for both prisoner and staff remain our priority i extend my sincere condolence to the family and friend who have lose a love and my gratitude to the staff at hmp and yoi parc 
 there have be adult death at hmp parc since march it be important to note that these death be not all drug relate however have so far be link to substance misuse with another potentially so any death in prison be thoroughly investigate by the prison and probation ombudsman and be subject to a coroner ’s inquest until the result of these investigation be available i must be a little careful not to pre empt the detail of their finding or to comment on individual identifiable case so there be a limit to what i can say with certainty 
 i be able to say that we believe that the death this month have not currently be link to substance misuse the death at hmp and yoi parc should be consider in the wide context of the threat that synthetic opioid pose to his majesty ’s prison and probation service to those in our custody and indeed to the country more widely recognise the broad societal issue 
 our work at the prison can provide vital learning as we respond to this challenge both in custody and in the community where i understand this challenge have also occur hmpps and g4s the prison operator be work closely together use the late technology to gather intelligence on drug entry point and movement within the prison there have be extensive search of prisoner and staff and any suspicious substance be test on site with rapiscan drug amnesty have be run to improve safety and x ray scanner be be use on entry to prison 
 we have also expand the use of naloxone at the prison focus on duty manager and night staff in total around member of staff at hmp and yoi parc be now train to carry the drug during work hour we also have specialist team in hmpps include the substance misuse group and intelligence support staff in the prison 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question i be of the local members cover the prison site so i also thank the minister for the genuinely constructive and extremely open way in which he have engage with i 
 i also thank heather whitehead the governor of parc for engage with i over recent month as the death have sadly increase my thought be of course with the inmate who be no long with we and with their family obviously every death be a tragedy regardless of the circumstance 
 the minister make reference to issue around spice in the prison there be an assumption mainly base on social medium that it be like the wild west inside the prison he touch briefly on the concern of the bridgend community that the prison be a catalyst for spice because it be be transfer in and out of the prison will the minister expand on what work can be do with the moj public health wales official and bridgend county borough council intervention team to try to bring some sort of control to the drug abuse take place inside and outside the prison 
 i pay tribute to the prison staff they be work in what appear to be extremely difficult circumstance issue around staff to prisoner ratio have still not be deal with we must ensure the prison officer who have have to deal with the death over the past to week be receive the mental health support they need so they be able to continue to work in what be some of the most difficult circumstance in of the large prison in wales it be a category b prison and some of the inmate house there pose significant challenge 
 finally will the minister expand on the work with the health board i have have some constructive meeting with health provider over recent week but there appear to be a disconnect between the reality on the ground in the prison and what the ministry of justice seem to be say i would be grateful for any update he can provide to try to bring some calm not just to the prison estate but to the wide bridgend community 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for the typically measure tone he have adopt on what be a very sensitive subject which he and i have speak about previously i join he in thank staff i visit hmp parc last month and meet some of the staff for myself it be also right to thank the broad system if i can put it that way include the health board and south wales police i put on record my gratitude to lesley griffiths for her engagement on this issue in the welsh government we look to work with all those partner to tackle this problem because it be a share societal challenge not just in the prison but in the community 
 the prison have put in place a strategy to tackle drug by restrict supply promote recovery and seek to reduce demand and by ensure there be co ordination between g4s hmpps public health wales and the local health board we be seek to bring into that the local police and the local authority so there be share ownership of tackle the issue 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight mental health support for staff when a death occur in custody the impact on staff just as on other prisoner be significant when there be a number of death in custody that be amplify therefore we be put in place support to   ensure staff feel and be support the hon gentleman highlight staffing i believe there be currently around a dozen vacancy we have significantly increase the number of staff but i recognise a number of staff be new in post they need to be support by experienced officer to enable they to perform to the good of their ability 
 spice be a very strong drug i believe the hon member for ogmore have be brief that we be look carefully at nitazene which be a variation of spice i commit to continue to keep the hon gentleman engage and inform as a local member of parliament alongside my hon friend   the member for bridgend dr wallis   
 i call the chair of the welsh affairs committee 
 we should be clear that the number of fatality we have see at hmp parc this year be by no mean normal it be an extraordinary situation so i be grateful you grant an urgent question today mr speaker and i be grateful to   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore   for request it the minister know there have be multiple allegation of staff bring illegal substance into the prison a current prisoner at parc recently write to the welsh affairs committee 
 drug be everywhere in prison from cannabis to heroin and the so call spice dribs and drab may enter through visit and some by way of drone but let we not confuse the issue far more come in by people employ in prison 
 give the write answer that the minister give i last week in which he say that currently no prison staff be search use x ray body scanner can he say why not and in the absence of such measure what action he be take to ensure that all the staff who work in these difficult prison share in the safety culture and be not part of the problem 
 my right hon friend raise an extremely important matter the reality as he will know be that the overwhelming majority of staff who work in hmpps do so honestly and with good intent and it be right that we continue to root out those who do not in that context we continue to work with police force where prison be locate across the country and where there be evidence include in this case in order to take action against not just prison officer but any staff 
 more broadly we have body scanner in operation at this prison for visitor and other alongside the rapiscan system that can test substance we have also roll out handheld detector that can be use in cell to locate drug in a much more effective manner considerable progress have be make but we be clear that we need to continue make that progress not just in hmp and yoi parc but across the estate 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for ogmore chris elmore   for submit this urgent question and the minister for the constructive way in which he have reply this be the time in a week that minister have have to come to this chamber because of the crisis in or more of our prison 
 i wish to start by say that we be all think of those who have die at hmp parc their family and friend and the governor and her staff i appreciate that as this matter be currently under investigation we be limited in what we can say today but it be important none the less that we give voice to this crisis 
 it be shocking that the prison ombudsman have to warn prisoner at hmp parc to throw away drug immediately due to the severe risk that those particular one pose to public health i hope that the minister can outline what specific step be be take in fact he have already do so to remove drug and ensure that we do not have far unnecessary and tragic death he have promise action but we do not want this to be yet another bout of activity that happen after the fact and do not last 
 drug feature in the decision by the chief inspector of prison to issue an urgent notification concern wandsworth prison last week he go on to address the chronic lack of national leadership from the hmpps to the ministry of justice we be look at a national failure of leadership across our prison estate drug be fuel the violence that we see in our prison we be witness a crisis across the prison estate a crisis of year of conservative rule 
 in the spirit of today ’s question i thank the minister for his commitment but ask he whether the action plan that he have just outline will continue once hmp parc sink from the headline 
 i be grateful to the shadow minister for her question if it be helpful i will write to she in the same term that i have write to   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore to give some more information that i may not be able to say fully at the dispatch box as she kindly acknowledge i have set out the step that be currently be take to restrict supply and to tackle at source those scanner and measure at the gate as i understand it there be a bid for enhanced gate security which be currently be look at and take forward by hmpps at the appropriate time i be happy to update she in the usual way 
 on promote recovery training have be undertake by around staff in the use of naloxone which when administer can swiftly counteract the effect of for example nitazene that be an important step forward in term of reduce demand we be work at the prison with the alcohol and drug treatment centre dyfo this be where welsh colleague will correct my pronunciation 
 dyfodol 
 i be grateful to the shadow minister we be engage with dyfodol and indeed the health board we be also support the welsh emerge drug and identification of novel substance project through prison radio and literature to seek to be integrate and join up in tackle what be as i say a challenge for both the prison and the community 
 i reiterate the comment make by   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore   on the way the minister have engage in gwent this be more than just a few headline this be not the time that the area have have to endure a spate of death like this in a very different setting but still a   worry the hon member for ogmore touch on the social medium speculation it be not just a case of some irresponsible people there be genuine worry about what this mean for community and for the town where do the buck stop where do the accountability line take we be it to g4s or to the ministry of justice who do it reach at the top 
 i be grateful to my hon friend he allude to a point make by the shadow minister   the hon member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury that i fail to answer i reassure she and he that the focus on this matter will be sustain even when it be not necessarily on the front page of newspaper because we recognise that the necessary work can not be do overnight it will take sustained focus and sustain work from the team there 
 my hon friend rightly allude to the challenge that social medium can pose in an already sensitive situation by exacerbate community concern i hope that some of what i have say go as far as i could will help to reassure he on some of the issue on his final point as i say to   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore this be essentially a share responsibility between g4s hmpps the council the health board the police and other because this be a challenge for both the community and the prison and it will be well tackle and resolve by work together in that spirit of co operation 
 the death at hmp parc in less than month highlight how prisoner welfare in wales be fragment with responsibility split between the welsh government and the moj ultimately of course devolution of justice will streamline responsibility but give that health be devolve do the minister agree that death in prison in wales should be subject to scrutiny both here and at the senedd ’s legislation justice and constitution committee 
 with the caveat that we do not have the final report from the coroner or final finding from the ppo we have to remember that the death appear to have a range of cause so we need to be a little cautious in respect of the conclusion we draw at this point on the right hon lady ’s underlying point she be right about the devolution of health that be why work with the local health board be extremely important but i consider that the current arrangement on justice and on the scrutiny of matter relate to justice and prison be adequate 
 a constituent of mine who be detain in the prison say that he feel unsafe in parc he describe prisoner walk around with shank just to feel safe the prison have say that safety be a priority but my constituent ’s parent feel that their son be in danger staff will also be very concerned it can not be right that knife be easily carry how many knife have be take off prisoner in the last month in parc prison 
 i can not give the hon gentleman the exact answer he want now but i be very happy to write to he with that information on his broad point about safety and assault on staff or on prisoner   while assault on staff by prisoner remain too high they be significantly down from where they be in although as far as i be concern any assault on a member of staff be assault too many similarly the number of prisoner on prisoner assault in custody at parc have come down significantly from where it be in and but it still remain too high there be more to do but if i be able to extract the information he seek i will happily write to he 
 we know that roughly third of prisoner arrive on the secure estate have suffer a brain injury before they arrive in prison that can lead to poor executive functioning anxiety and depression all problem that can be massively exacerbate by be in prison i understand that the moj want all prisoner to be screen for brain injury when they arrive in prison be that happen at parc and be those people then get the support they need to be able to function as well as possible give those circumstance in prison 
 let i take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hon gentleman for his work campaign on this issue on which i have interact with he previously as a health minister on his specific question it be important to remember in the context of this very challenging issue that parc be generally a well run prison thing that stand out there which i see when i visit be the specialist neurodivergence wing and the work be do there with specialist train officer and staff to understand the specific need of those individual if he be ever at a loose end and able to visit with the permission of my hon friend   the member for bridgend dr wallis   and   the hon member for ogmore chris elmore i think that he would find the work be do there encourage and fascinating i encourage he to go 
 i agree with what my hon friend   the member for ogmore chris elmore   have say today many constituent have be in touch with our office in recent week and mother this morning say every day i expect a phone call fear the bad be my son go to be another statistic some parent include that constituent have raise concern over a long period about drug do the minister understand that action so far have do little to reassure those with love one in prison and that they need to know that the government be act urgently 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for articulate the understandable concern of parent family and other in a typically sensitive and measure way it be right that those voice be hear in this chamber i hope that some of what i have say today will provide a little more clarity and reassurance but the other reassurance i can offer be that i will continue to take a close direct and personal interest in the ongoing work to resolve issue that may remain in parc 
 we have all be sadden by event at parc what assessment have the minister make of the impact on the mental health of prisoner both in parc and elsewhere of staffing shortage that force prisoner to spend hour each day in their cell and leave they without access to appropriate rehabilitation course what step will he take to remedy the situation 
 i can offer the hon lady reassurance that the regime for time out of cell at parc be of the most effective in the prison system with extensive period out of cell be facilitate she quite rightly talk about mental health it be important in this context to remember as she do the mental health not only of those prisoner but of the prison staff and prison officer who be impact by a death in custody we be work closely with the prison and the prison be work closely with the health board to ensure that that among other thing be address 
 inmate at hmp parc be report to have be move there from hmp exeter devon live report on a dangerous inmate who be move to parc after he throw boiling water in the face of an officer and attack another prisoner with a tin opener without any warning or provocation do the minister feel satisfied that officer and inmate will be safe from prisoner at hmp parc 
 as i set out early although i consider assault rate still to be too high they be low than they be in and similar year it be clear that any assault on a member of staff be too many sadly assault occur across the estate and that be why we be back our staff with body wear camera and why they have pava for example which they can deploy when they be at imminent risk 
 i thank the minister for his answer and helpful suggestion to other member what step can be take to restore confidence in the safeguarding and access to appropriate medical care for those who be imprison in facility throughout this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland an investigation may well conclude that there be no fault but this matter have certainly raise question regard level of care and access to medical care and facility 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his important question i have set out the step that we be take in parc to train staff to use naloxone in order to buy precious time to enable professional medical service to arrive across england and wales prison come under my jurisdiction as prisons minister in wales healthcare be devolve in england healthcare in prison be the responsibility of and provide by the nhs we seek to ensure that prison have effective and close work relationship at a macro and operational level with their local health board or local nhs 
 i beg to move 
 that the draft procurement regulations which be lay before this house on   march be approve 
 this statutory instrument represent a significant legislative step in implement the procurement act which seize the opportunity follow brexit to develop and implement a new public procurement regime for over £ worth of public contract the new regime help to deliver the prime minister ’s promise to grow the economy by create a simple and more transparent system that will deliver well value for money reduce cost for business and the public sector 
 the regulation bring to life and set out the practical detail necessary for the functioning of many of the act ’s provision they address many of the point of practical detail that be more appropriately set out in regulation give their detailed nature and propensity to change and need update from time to time many of the measure set out the detail require to be provide in notice require by the act which allow contracting authority to conduct their public procurement in an open transparent and informative manner they include the particular content of various notice that will be use to communicate opportunity and detail about forthcoming in train and complete procurement 
 do the minister think the regulation be duly simplify so that it be feasible for the self employ and very small business to have access to contract be there any provision for break down contract size so that the self employ and small business have more opportunity 
 my right hon friend ask a pertinent question that be at the forefront of minister mind when the legislation be draft and as it make its way through both houses a number of provision in primary legislation be there specifically to increase the chance that small and medium sized enterprise which be more likely to be british get a big share of the £ worth of public procurement those provision include everything from the online procurement system that we be build which will increase transparency and allow great notification of pipeline help small and medium sized enterprise to prepare for those procurement to reduce red tape which will take the burden off those sme and reduce their barrier to entry we be hopeful that a lot of local business in his constituency and in mine will benefit from this landmark piece of post brexit legislation 
 the content i be describe would typically include the contact detail for the contracting authority the contract ’s subject matter key timing for the procurement process and various other basic information about a particular procurement that interested supplier would need to know the provision also cover the practical measure that authority must follow when publish those notice such as publish on a central digital platform and handle situation in the event that the platform be unavailable 
 beyond transparency the instrument include various other necessary provision to supplement the act that will be relevant in certain situation we provide various list in the schedule so that procurer be able to identify whether certain obligation apply in a particular case include a list of light touch service that qualify for simplified rule and a list of central government authority and work that be subject to different threshold the regulation disapply the procurement act in relation to healthcare service procurement within the scope of the nhs provider selection regime which have set out the regulatory framework for healthcare service procurement since its introduction in january this year 
 the regulation also set out how devolve scottish contracting authority be to be regulate by the act if they choose to use a commercial tool establish under the act or procure jointly with a buyer regulate by the act the provision of the regulation apply to reserved procurement in england wales northern ireland and scotland and to transfer procurement in northern ireland the welsh government have lay similar secondary legislation that will apply in respect of devolved procurement in wales and if the devolved body carry out that procurement mainly operate in wales elsewhere 
 the government have consult carefully with stakeholder throughout all stage of the reform process and we publish our response to the formal public consultation on these regulation on   march that consultation be a great success evoke a good response from the various representative sector and confirm that the propose regulation generally work as intend many stakeholder urge that certain matter be clarify and explain in guidance and training which be a key part of our implementation programme that be be roll out across the uk the government response demonstrate that we have listen to feedback and confirm a number of area in which the consultation lead to technical and draft improvement 
 once the instrument have be make contracting authority and supplier will need time in order to fully adapt their system and process before go live as such the government have provide month advance notice of go live of the new regime before these regulation come into force which will happen on   october   this year 
 will the minister give way 
 i would be delighted to give way to the right hon gentleman 
 i thank the minister for give way at least it will enable he to draw breath but could i ask a straightforward question to what extent be this instrument go to enable british industry and british service to compete on a level playing field in which we prioritise our domestic producer like every other country in the world do 
 the right hon gentleman know what be come because he ask i this question a number of time during the passage of the act we be do main thing the be that we be greatly simplify our procurement process which as he hear i say   a moment ago to my right hon friend   the member for wokingham sir john redwood will particularly work to the advantage of small and medium sized enterprise however the right hon gentleman must be cognisant of the fact that we have a number of international trade agreement with country all over the world in which we have agree to compete with they on a level playing field the only way in which we could deliberately give advantageous opportunity to british company vis à vis those arrangement would be to break those trade deal i be sure that be not what the right hon gentleman be propose 
 rise 
 i will give the right hon gentleman more go 
 we have a lot of time and a thin house i presume that the united states be also a signatory to the same trade treaty yet it have the buy american legislation which be very strong and very effectively enforce in the area of shipping for example it also have the jones act which say that anything be ship between port in the united states have to be carry by american vessel the united states be work under the same treaty so why be it able to do that while we for some reason perhaps deep treasury dogma or long stand civil service prejudice against industry cannot 
 if the right hon gentleman look at the detail of the trade deal that we have with other country he will see that by and large those trade deal have be create in order to further commerce and trade between country and agree that there will be area in which there will be a level playing field between our country and that other country that be often the basis of a trade deal the united states be the world ’s lead economy and have be for over a century and can sometimes strike deal or come to arrangement that other country that be not the world ’s large economy can not i be afraid he will have to go and do his own research on american trade deal but i can explain to he why we have the procurement system we do and why because of the step we have take in this legislation we will be create additional opportunity for small and medium sized enterprise in his constituency as well as in mine that be much for the well and it be a much well situation than we find ourselves in while we be still in the eu with a very cumbersome slow move and long unreformed system of procurement to which we have be shackle for about year 
 for the avoidance of doubt member will want to be aware that this statutory instrument have be correct to remove draft reference and a couple of typographical error that be mistakenly add during the publishing process i hope that colleague will join i in support these regulation and will approve this si today 
 i call the shadow minister 
 labour members will not be oppose the regulation which provide the detail need for the procurement act to come into effect later this year as member across the house will recall there be a need for a new procurement act to reform the eu law base procurement regime follow   the uk ’s exit from the eu and to consolidate various procurement regulation into place for those reason we do not oppose the procurement bill on or reading 
 the purpose of the procurement act be to create a simple more flexible commercial system that well meet our country ’s need after have leave the eu while remain compliant with our international obligation however as we have make clear in this house before we be concerned that the procurement act be a waste opportunity to reform procurement in spite of our attempt to strengthen and improve the bill with our amendment the procurement act when it come into force in october will unfortunately allow the same wasteful approach to emergency contracting rule that we see during the pandemic when friend of and donor to the conservative party be give the bite of the cherry while decent skilled local business be deny the same opportunity billion of pound of public money be waste while excellent small and medium sized business be overlook nothing in the draft regulation will address that concern 
 we also make it clear that we be very disappointed that the act fail to mandate social value to secure investment in good british business and i have to say that i be disappoint by the answer the minister just give to my right hon friend   the member for warley john spellar the procurement policy of a labour government would be root in get value for money for every pound spend our national procurement plan would reward business that create job and pay their taxis slash red tape for disadvantaged sme and claw back money from contractor that fail to deliver 
 the statutory instrument be require to implement the new public procurement regime establish by the procurement act it specify what information should be include in the notice that contracting authority must publish as per the requirement of the procurement act and where and how these should be publish other regulation in the statutory instrument impose requirement as to how contracting authority should obtain specify information from supplier and provide further detail about how certain organisation and contract be to be regulate it give detail about how the act cover welsh and scottish procurement in relation to reserved matter and clarify the disapplication of the act in relation to regulate healthcare procurement 
 turn to the specific measure in the regulation there be clarification about the various notice that will be publish on the central digital platform the platform be set up by the minister for the cabinet office and i hope it be progress well notice that must be publish there include plan procurement notice tender notice dynamic market notice and transparency notice there be further specification of the information that should be include in the notice with the purpose be to increase transparency and make the procurement regime more accessible to small business 
 measure that improve transparency and increase access to procurement opportunity particularly to small and medium sized business be very much to be welcome the challenge will be in how to make these notice and the digital platform as user friendly as possible with all the relevant information easily accessible and searchable as we move forward it would be helpful if the minister update the house on progress in meet the requirement   of the regulation and on what impact they have on the number of small and medium sized enterprise that bid for contract good purchase from small and medium sized enterprise often mean provide local job and local job mean that people can stay in their home town and not have to move away for work and importantly that they will spend their money in their local area thus boost the local economy 
 the regulation also set out the detail for supplier information requirement that will enable the creation of a supplier information system the purpose of which will be to hold commonly use supplier information and allow it to be share with contracting authority with the laudable aim of reduce the burden for supplier who have to provide the same information in relation to every procurement anyone who talk to business will say just how frustrating it be to have to supply the same information time and again that be a particular burden for small and medium sized business which simply do not have the capacity to deal with endless red tape measure that help to reduce that burden be very much to be welcome but again the challenge will be in the design and operation of the system it should become a useful tool that save repetition rather than become a burden in itself with business struggle to upload the necessary information 
 the regulation also specify a list of service that may form the subject matter of what be call light touch contract which would enjoy a less onerous regulatory regime with the aim of encourage organisation such as social enterprise and mutual to bid for contract for certain social health and other person orientate service the key issue will be to maximise transparency and to ensure sufficient regulation to protect and get value for money for the public purse while at the same time encourage a wide range of organisation to bid for contract the regulation specify that the act do not apply to what be term regulate health procurement which be govern by other legislation 
 the uk ’s commitment under the world trade organisation agreement on government procurement require we to have financial threshold that apply to central government authority and another for the procurement of good and service by local government and wide public sector body as well as a specific threshold that apply to procurement for what be term works”—construction procurement that reflect the typically high monetary value involve in procure construction the regulation therefore set out list of which body be define as central government authority and construction relate service that constitute work these regulation set out further requirement in respect of what happen at the awarding of contract and thereafter with regulation set out what the assessment summary should contain include an explanation as to why the particular score be give against each criterion 
 there be some innovative measure and we welcome those that help to make the whole process more transparent regulation set out the information require in a procurement termination notice that be publish when a contracting authority decide not to award a contract and regulation set out the detail to be include in a contract change notice include the ground on which modification will be make 
 the regulation also change the frequency of report on the prompt payment of invoice by government body from year to month and spell out requirement in respect of the contract performance notice include the detail require when use to report poor performance or a breach of contract the explanatory note clarify that these regulation do not include a statutory review clause as they do not regulate an activity carry out by a business for the purpose of the business but rather that they place obligation on the public sector however feedback and monitoring be crucial to ensure both that we be get value for the public purse and that the regulation be work effectively for business include reduce the burden on business and encourage a wide range of business particularly small and medium sized enterprise to bid for contract
