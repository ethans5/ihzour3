resolve 
 that an humble address be present to his majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there be lay before this house a return of the report entitle protect our democracy from coercion date   may .—(mark fletcher 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what recent discussion she have have with trade union on the future of grangemouth oil refinery beyond 
 my department attend the grangemouth industrial just transition leadership forum alongside scotland office ministers and representative of unite the union on   march we remain in close contact with the scottish government and the owner petroineos my hon friend the minister for energy security and net meet scottish government counterpart and petroineos management on   may   and raise the importance of work with the union 
 warm word be thing tangible support be quite another if grangemouth close scotland face the possibility indeed the probability of be the only major oil produce nation without refinery capacity yet € have be find by the uk government to support an ineos plant in antwerp while not a penny be available for grangemouth be it to be a brexit bonus for belgian worker and a p45 for those scot at the refinery 
 we be work with the scottish government and petroineos to understand all possible option for the future of the refinery i remind the hon gentleman that the conservatives be the only major party who be back the north sea the bidding it bring in each year and the hundred of thousand of job that it support while a new report last week show that labour ’s plan could lose as many as job in the next year 
 what progress she have make on reach the government ’s net target 
 we be on track to reach net by and we will do so in a way that bring the public with we we overachieve on our carbon budget by and we announce today that we will not be roll that over as we think that we will be able to overperform on carbon budget as well 
 i congratulate the government on we be of the major economy in the world to set out the ambition for net carbon emission by what discussion have the secretary of state have with the chancellor and the secretary of state for transport with regard to a revenue support mechanism for sustainable aviation as well as ensure that feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel take priority 
 i know from experience that my hon friend be a doughty champion for his local area and for the aviation sector my department be in regular contact with the department for transport and the treasury on aviation decarbonisation and the important role for sustainable aviation fuel in that transition on   april dft publish a consultation on option for a revenue certainty mechanism alongside detail of the saf mandate which together will support both decarbonation and the growth of the sector 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 tapadh mr speaker 
 there be many criticism of the government i be sure they be aware of they that they be too slow and indecisive about give signal to the market for particular technology which mean that when they need to commission new energy they be stick with only option gas which as we know be not exactly the way to net what will the secretary of state be do to move thing a bit quick and give the market signal as to which energy path the uk will be take 
 i remind the hon gentleman that we have of the most remarkable record when it come to renewable energy the only country that have build more offshore wind than we be china we have set out the large expansion for nuclear and we be at the forefront of cut edge technology such as fusion hydrogen and carbon capture 
 meet our net target which will be extremely difficult and eye wateringly expensive have be enforce on my constituent do the secretary of state agree that we must be more honest and open about the enormous cost of net on the british taxpayer will the government commit to publish a detailed analysis of those cost in advance of my westminster hall debate 
 there be a balance to be strike which i believe we be strike in ensure that we can make the most of the job and opportunity of the energy transition which will support up to green job in but yes when it come to additional cost we be take a measured approach because we want to protect household 
 in the climate change committee ’s late progress report it be make clear 
 there continue to be an overly narrow approach to solution which crucially do not embrace the need to reduce demand for high carbon activity 
 so when the secretary of state go back to the drawing board to revise the government ’s carbon budget delivery plan as she now must will she finally reduce the reliance on unproven technofixe and look instead at demand reduction measure or follow the recent embarrassing judgment from the high court be she aim for a hat trick with her department ’s climate plan declare unlawful for a time 
 i would find the hon lady ’s question more credible if she would at least once welcome the fact that we be the country in the g20 to have halve emission on our progress i be proud that of the reason that we have come so far be technological fix because of the remarkable progress that this country have make in renewable energy that be why we overshot on our and carbon budget and we be on track to overshoot on our 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 week ago the government be find for a time to be in breach of the law over their climate target that failure will mean that family across the country will pay high energy bill the court find 
 the secretary of state ’s conclusion that the proposal and policy will enable the carbon budget to be meet be irrational 
 last time the government claim that their breach of the law be just on a technicality what be the right hon lady ’s dog eat my homework excuse this time 
 let we be clear the court do not question the policy that we have set out which we have do in more detail than any of our peer it do not question the progress that we have already make as the g20 country in the world to halve emission and it do not question the ambition of our future target which be among the most ambitious of our peer if the right hon gentleman want to look at what would smother the transition and private investment in this country he need only look at his own mad unachievable target 
 with a defence like that i can see why the government lose in court not just once but twice bury in the court document be the confidential memo that reveal the real reason they lose the case official be tell ministers that they have low or very low confidence that half their carbon reduction would be achieve that be why they be find unlawful the right hon lady come to the house each month with   her complacent nonsense but the court judgment expose the truth the government be way off track abysmally fail to meet the climate emergency and push up bill for family as a result 
 i have learn in this role that the right hon gentleman like to call people who disagree with he name last week representative from the tony blair institute say that his plan would raise bill and harm our energy security be they flat earther an industry report say last week say that his plan would see up to people lose their job be those people who be worried climate denier when will the right hon gentleman admit that his plan be base on fantasy and ideology and be the last thing that this country need 
 whether she have make an assessment of the potential merit of public ownership of the   energy   system 
 no 
 every family in britain be pay the price for the government ’s failure on energy with bill through the roof while oil and gas profit have soar a publicly own clean energy company would allow we to take back control of our energy cut bill and create job across the uk why be the government let their ideological stubbornness get in the way of support family when they could follow other successful country and set up a publicly own clean energy company like great british energy 
 i thank the hon lady for her question but i do not think that consumer will the tuc itself have highlight the potential £ to £ cost that will be land either at the taxpayer ’s doorstep or directly on to consumer bill which be nothing to be thankful for 
 in just before privatisation of total consumer spending be on energy bill between and that drop to between and even last year during the war in ukraine it only hit do my hon friend agree that as he have already say the suggestion from   the hon member for blaydon liz twist   would wallop consumer 
 we have to work with business to secure investment we have secure £ for low carbon technology since as we boost uk energy production our energy security and ultimately deliver cheap bill for consumer 
 i call the shadow minister 
 when it come to who control and benefit from our energy system why do the government refuse to put the british people as we have hear foreign own firm whether france ’s edf or denmark ’s ørsted reap the reward of energy produce in britain as they benefit   british people pay the price expose to sky high energy bill and beholden to volatile international price why be the minister so opposed to put power back into the hand of the british people 
 there be not a single country around the world that think government alone can deliver increase energy security by work with business we can unlock the private investment to do it and talk about irrational imagine a career politician the shadow secretary of state run uk energy consumer bill would rocket 
 the minister be completely miss the point so i will use a real world example in bristol we have set up the year bristol city leap project with ameresco and vattenfall a partnership between the public and private sector that will help the city to cut carbon dioxide bring down bill and deliver green job actually the government be pilot a similar project in york because it have be such a success in bristol but why should it be vattenfall a swedish state own firm rather than a british equivalent such as labour ’s gb energy that benefit why can swedish taxpayer profit from invest in our future but british taxpayer can not 
 politician with business experience be high risk it be not so long ago that the shadow energy security minister highlight the success of robin hood energy back by nottingham city council which deliver a £ loss 
 whether she have make a cost benefit analysis of her net policy 
 our pragmatic proportionate and realistic approach to meet net will capitalise on the opportunity of the low carbon transition create job and investment across the uk 
 the cost of net be be bear by our hard press constituent at the same time as china increase its carbon dioxide emission by more than the uk ’s total emission every year wholesale electricity price be currently £ per megawatt but we be pay £ per megawatt for fixed offshore wind offer £ for float offshore wind £ for onshore wind and £ for solar can the minister explain whatever happen to plentiful cheap renewable energy 
 the hon member and i agree that we must champion the importance of deliver cheap bill for consumer this do not have to be a binary choice between tackle climate change and deliver cheap consumer bill by invest in a clean more efficient energy system we can do both 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 the benefit of renewable can not come at any cost in that spirit i welcome the commitment of the secretary of state and in particular the minister to protect food   security through the additional protection of versatile and productive agricultural land will the minister also affirm the government ’s determination to protect area that be particularly affect by energy infrastructure pylon wind and solar such as the lincolnshire fen the somerset level and romney marsh food security matter just as much as energy security in the national interest for the common good 
 we be proud to have take renewable from just under the last labour government to today but my right hon friend make a powerful point about the need to tackle cluster the secretary of state reiterate clear guideline and advice for local authority and plan committee up and down the country to make sure that we safeguard wherever possible our key agricultural land as part of our commitment on food security 
 community in westmorland can not afford for we not to be reduce carbon emission i think of community such as kirkby stephen appleby and kendal all of which be list as energy crisis hotspot that mean they have below average income but above average energy price there be over home in need of loft insulation and home in need of cavity wall insulation in my community will the minister give resource to the excellent cumbria action for sustainability to meet that need and decrease bill and also perhaps revise the rule for eco4 so the scheme well fit old home in rural area such as our 
 i thank the hon member as on football we agree on the principle the government be proud to have take energy efficient home from to local initiative can play a key part in that and i would be interested to learn more about the project he highlight 
 decarbonisation be welcome but it must be achieve in a way that balance the country ’s other priority such as food security i welcome last week ’s statement from the secretary of state about the importance of protect our good and most versatile farmland but can the minister tell i more about how he will ensure that we prioritise solar power on rooftop instead 
 the government be proud to have deliver an additional gw of renewable energy since alone we have also introduce planning change to make it easy to install solar panel on rooftop include those of industrial building and we can thank consumer for lead the way an average of household a month add solar panel to their roof last year 
 what step she be take to help reduce energy bill 
 what step her department be take to support people with the cost of energy bill 
 what step she be take to help reduce energy price for consumer 
 what step she be take to help reduce energy bill 
 the price cap have fall by since the start of last year and the government be take a comprehensive approach to bring down future energy bill for consumer that include reform electricity market to make they more effective invest across the energy system to make it smart and invest in energy efficiency to reduce cost for household 
 i thank the minister for her answer but i want she to understand that for constituent such as mine in romford energy price be become completely unaffordable and the government need to do more my constituent be also very concerned about the cost of net and we need to know what that will cost they in year to come surely the government need to take the british people with they on these policy but at present there be a great deal of scepticism 
 that be certainly of the department ’s aim we be very conscious that we must get that energy security while also help all the vulnerable household and non domestic business that need our support 
 a significant number of household in my constituency who be experience the continued impact of russia ’s illegal invasion of ukraine and unrest in the middle east have receive help in the form of the government ’s cost of live support payment those payment be welcome but do the minister agree that this important support should continue along with more information about the help that be available and how to gain access to it 
 my hon friend be a great champion for his constituent and of course i agree with he about the importance of ensure that householder know where to obtain information about what they may be able to receive especially as we be provide they with £ between and i recommend that they visit the help for households web page on gov.uk to find out what support they may be entitle to 
 many rural property on the welsh border include those in clwyd south and in neighbour north shropshire be not connect to main gas and therefore use oil or liquefied petroleum gas for heating and many of the resident be unaware of the support that be available to help with their energy bill can the minister tell the house what support the government be provide for those resident 
 my hon friend have raise an important issue we be of course help all those household the government support about household use alternative fuel with the £ alternative fuel payment in the winter of and although   energy price include alternative fuel cost have fall significantly since then we be nevertheless commit to support all household with that £ package between and 
 i have just have some solar panel fit to my roof and i be pleased to report that they be reduce my bill but what more be the government do to encourage people to produce their own electricity by mean of renewable in order to reduce the pull on the grid and also reduce bill 
 i be delighted to hear that my hon friend have have those solar panel fit she will be interested to hear that the government be consider option to facilitate low cost finance from retail lender to help household with the up front cost of installation and to drive rooftop deployment and energy efficiency measure 
 i know of too many case in which people whose property be connect to heat network be pay extremely high energy bill i welcome the department ’s response to the consultation on heat network but the energy act only allow for secretary of state to introduce a price cap at their discretion some of my constituent be pay bill that be time the level of the cap will the minister consider a mandatory cap to ensure fair price for heat network customer 
 the hon lady make an important point of course the price cap be an issue for ofgem however i would be interested to hear some of her suggestion and i be always happy to have a meeting on that particular subject 
 fuel and extreme fuel poverty across the highland and island be high than anywhere else in the uk yet family there be force to pay the high electricity standing charge in the uk—50 more than in london for example that be despite the region export in excess of time the amount of renewable electricity that it use when will the government introduce a highland energy rebate to ensure fairness for people across the highland and island 
 the hon gentleman will know that we have have many conversation about this subject of the thing that the secretary of state and i have be do be talk to ofgem to make sure that it be look at the standing charge that have lead to a call for input which have recently have over response 
 my constituent beverley scott who have cancer suffer from poor work carry out under the government ’s eco4 scheme this include leave she without heating and damage her internet she eventually have to go to the small claim court to get redress for shoddy work and i know of other people who have have to follow the same route give that provider company enable by government strategy leave vulnerable householder with no option but to go to court do the minister not agree that there should be well oversight and a simple remedy for people like beverley scott 
 the right hon lady make an incredibly important point of course of the thing that we be determined to do be make sure that those installation be carry out in the correct manner in fact we have new regulation in place to make sure that that happen go forward 
 the minister will know that i be concerned about the level of stand charge in my constituency as i have discuss this issue with she before of the problem be that people with pre payment meter often find that when they go to add the payment the standing charge wipe everything out can the government and ofgem find a way to provide more support for those on pre payment meter to avoid that problem 
 the hon lady and i have have many conversation about this issue of the thing that we have do be make sure that people who be on pre payment meter be not unfairly penalise 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister and her colleague have repeatedly say today that they care about cut bill for family but a recent report by the resolution foundation find that the onshore wind ban have hit the poor household income time hard than that of the rich such household have be force to pay additional electricity bill as a result of the total failure to build onshore wind in england how on earth can minister continue to sit there and claim that they stand up for working family when they continue to block the cheap form of clean energy there be which could cut bill for family who desperately need help before she leave office will the secretary of state pledge to put this right so that onshore wind can be build again and customer can save money on their future bill 
 that be absolutely not the case we stand here incredibly proudly as ministers in the department for energy security and net and we have make a commitment we be do more than have ever be do on renewable and offshore wind and we have do more to help people with the affordability of their bill 
 what step she be take to help improve energy efficiency in social housing 
 the social housing decarbonisation fund be upgrade to epc c a significant amount of the social housing stock that be currently below that standard we have already commit over £ of government funding with a furth £ already commit for to 
 by how much have the minister increase the level of insulation and what significance do she attach to it 
 i thank my right hon friend for his brevity as always the amount of social housing that be well insulated have go up from just in to today for housing overall we have go from just in to today 
 i welcome through the minister the admission by the secretary of state last week finally that this flagship scheme be fail although the word she use be that it have be 
 a bit slow on the uptake 
 they have have year to devise the most cost effective way of reduce carbon emission and people ’s bill make home warm and create good new skilled job when will we have a scheme that actually work 
 i respectfully say to the right hon gentleman that we do have scheme that be work i remind he that the department for energy security and net have launch a £ great british installation scheme which aim to upgrade around of the country ’s least energy efficient home 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the scottish government be work at pace to replace pollute heating system and improve energy efficiency in scotland ’s building stock with £ be invest in this parliamentary session towards heat and energy efficiency measure and £ towards new affordable housing with the climate change committee state that the scottish government ’s heat in building bill could become the template for the uk help scotland to decarbonise fast than anywhere else in the uk would the minister like to visit the scottish government in edinburgh i can arrange that for she so that she can see climate leadership in action 
 i reiterate that energy efficiency be incredibly important to we on the government benches and to the government i would be happy to come on a visit to edinburgh indeed i have already visit there 
 slightly more enthusiasm might have be welcome by people live in england in cold and draughty house nevertheless it be not simply our extensive ambition that leave the uk behind scotland but our delivery too since 2007—[interruption those on the government benches might want to listen to this since per person the snp have build more home than tory england and more home than labour wales and ensure of the scottish social rent sector have an energy performance certificate rating of c or above insulation level in scotland be way high than in england it be clear that the uk government have materially fail to abate the demand side of the energy system to any meaningful extent what will the minister do in the few week they have leave in office to atone for this glaring betrayal of bill payer 
 unlike the hon gentleman we have not abandon our target and there have be good progress and improved household energy efficiency around half of our homes—48 in england have now reach the government ’s target of achieve an epc rating of c up from in 
 what step her department be take to tackle climate change 
 britain be the major economy to halve emission while grow the economy by we have more ambitious target for than the eu with the uk aim for a reduction in emission compare with its we have over achieve on all carbon budget to date and remain on track for the next 
 at cop28 the uk alongside nearly country agree to the transition away from fossil fuel since then the government have recklessly grant new oil and gas licence and push legislation through this house to max out north sea fossil fuel will the minister meet the cross party parliamentarian who last week sign a letter urge the government to show climate leadership and join the beyond oil and gas allowance which aim to phase out oil and gas production ahead of cop29 
 i thank the hon member for raise that important issue that be why we be proud that we have already take out of the oil and gas sector 
 hydrotreate vegetable oil be a good alternative to rip out heating system that already exist in rural home we have hear today about the cost to rural home as we try to address the impact of use less fossil fuel will the government get behind the opportunity for hvo in rural community to give householder a chance to contribute to reduce harmful emission in their home 
 my hon friend have always champion his local constituent to ensure that they get value for money we must explore all potential option local or national to find the good way to deliver energy security and low bill in future 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of financial support for district heating network consumer 
 the evaluation of our energy support scheme will conclude in summer to ensure their bill be fair support heat network customer receive an average of £ via the energy discount scheme which close last month 
 that be rather disappointing i have more than constituent in the greendykes area of edinburgh who get their heating and hot water from a communal district heating scheme the government have refuse to offer they price protection say instead that this should be regulate by the business regulation scheme but that end on   march leave those people with no protection at all and face increase of up to in their energy bill my constituent want to know why do the government wait until the   business scheme finish before consider alternative protection for these domestic customer why take a year to get they protect and what compensation be the government go to offer in the meantime 
 i hear the passion with which the hon gentleman stand up for his constituent and rightly so give the circumstance that they find themselves in we be introduce regulation with ofgem power to investigate and intervene where price for consumer appear to be unfair and to ensure that all heat network consumer receive a high quality service from their provider i be happy to meet he to discuss this in great detail 
 district heating network be a good innovation and the government have a good record of stimulate these project around the country but   the hon member for edinburgh east tommy sheppard   be right to say that the regulation in this area need look at can i reassert what he have just say and ask the minister to carefully come forward with protection to ensure that consumer on shared heating network be not at a disadvantage compare with people who pay their bill directly 
 i be pleased to give that assurance to my hon friend as i have say we be talk to ofgem right now about introduce regulation to make this much fair and simple and to ensure that consumer on heat network get the service that they deserve 
 what discussion she have have with the scottish government on the berwick bank wind farm project 
 the planning decision be devolve to the scottish government official will work together to resolve cross border matter the uk government be commit to effective co operation with the scottish government on this and other issue support our share energy security and net objective 
 i thank the minister for his answer and for the promise that official will work together but he will be aware that this be a gw renewable project that could be the large offshore wind farm in the world deliver over £ to the uk economy the only reason that it be not eligible for this year ’s contract for difference auction be the scottish government ’s failure to make a decision on consent for the project have the minister or anyone in his department speak to scottish ministers about the impact of this decision on investment in our economy and to ensure that the consenting for offshore wind process be speed up so that we do not miss out on the ten of billion of investment and the thousand of job that a project such as this would deliver 
 the uk government work closely and collaboratively with the scottish government on a whole host of area especially energy security and net   however this be a live planning issue and whether it be in the jurisdiction of westminster or holyrood we do not comment on live planning case give their quasi judicial status 
 what step she be take to increase nuclear energy capacity 
 the civil nuclear road map reconfirm the government ’s ambition to deploy up to gw of nuclear power by the road map set out plan to make investment decision concern gw to gw every year between and 
 clearly it be important to have a mixed economy in term of energy production and nuclear have to play its part what action be my hon friend take to ensure that the development of small modular nuclear reactor be enhance and bring forward because that be the fast way to get nuclear energy into our network 
 i completely agree with my hon friend the small modular reactor technology selection process the fast of its kind in the world i might add continue to progress quickly and be currently in the tender phase allow vendor to bid for potentially multibillion pound technology development contract company will have until june to submit their tender response at which point great british energy will evaluate bid and negotiate final contract the aim be to announce successful bid later this year 
 the minister be always quick and keen to ensure that all part of this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland have advantage when it come to the technology to which the question refer when will northern ireland get the same advantage 
 as the hon gentleman know i be keen to ensure that every part of our great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland benefit from the expansion of nuclear power and the benefit that it can bring not only for meet our net objective but for the economy in which these small modular reactor will be build i would be happy to meet he at any time to explore what benefit can be accrue in northern ireland from the expansion of our nuclear capacity here in the uk 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of the high court judgment of may relate to the government ’s carbon budget delivery plan 
 the government be immensely proud of our record on climate change we have cut emission   fast than any other g20 country over the last decade the judgment contain no criticism of our detailed plan or the policy themselves which will keep the uk on track to meet net by 
 the government have a legal and moral duty to meet our carbon emission target failure to do so would consign my generation and generation after mine to a future of climate catastrophe so it be beyond a joke that the government ’s carbon budget delivery plan have now be rule unlawful not just once but twice when will the minister tell the flat earther sit behind he to stop try to make net a culture war issue and instead deliver a transition that both meet our climate obligation and improve people ’s living standard 
 our carbon budget delivery plan have over detailed policy we be recognise as a leader internationally have already cut emission by half the major economy to do so with a far ambitious target to get to by compare with just for the shadow secretary of state ’s beloved eu 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household receive compensation after be involuntarily fit with prepayment meter 
 the energy supplier be responsible for pay compensation they have carry out assessment so far   with customer due compensation a total of payment have be make with more planned 
 despite the energy ombudsman rule that of my constituent should not have be place on a prepayment meter due to her vulnerability she have not be award a penny of compensation under the scheme as the minister have just outline only people out of have have any compensation award at all that be so why be the number so small could it be that the energy supplier themselves oversee by ofgem be decide who be entitle to these payment both sit idly by as agent force their way into people ’s home to install the prepayment meter 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and for the opportunity to provide clarity the forced installation of prepayment meter be clearly unacceptable and the government have do everything we can to counteract it however i reiterate that investigation be carry out in of those case compensation be due and instead of the actual figure on compensation be 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household that be in fuel poverty in winter 
 the policy on fuel poverty be devolve statistic for england estimate that household be in fuel poverty in which be more than few than in 
 the good way to cut fuel poverty be through a nationwide home upgrade scheme but the secretary of state seem unaware of the reality when it come to home upgrade her official say in recent document give to the high court that progress to decarbonise the uk ’s building stock have be slow that policy gap remain and that the government be lag behind why will she not admit in public what her department tell she in private 
 this government be commit to make sure that we not only get energy efficiency but support people with their energy bill 
 thank to government grant a social housing provider in my chelmsford constituency chp have make some great investment in social housing to help energy efficiency reduce bill and low fuel poverty but it would like to go far will the minister discuss with i the way in which we can help to share the benefit of those saving so that some of they can be invest in improve energy efficiency and lower bill in even more home 
 my right hon friend make the important point that energy efficiency be crucial to lower bill that be why we have the social housing decarbonisation fund which support local authority and housing association in upgrade social housing stock below energy performance certificate level c. 
 what recent discussion she have have with business and investor on the government ’s net target 
 our department ’s ministerial team meet regularly with industry for example through the hydrogen investor forum the offshore wind industry council the solar taskforce the green job delivery group and the cross cutting net council 
 last week stellantis the owner of the vauxhall car plant in ellesmere port announce that it would import electric vehicle despite the fact that we produce some great electric van in ellesmere port and want to move on to produce car there as well do the minister think that over the long term reach our net target through the import of cheap chinese vehicle will be a good or bad thing for the uk car industry 
 the hon member raise a very important point of the opposition ’s main pledge which be to fully decarbonise the grid by could be meet only by open the floodgate to cheap chinese import the exact thing he be oppose to 
 many unwelcome application for large scale solar farm such as lime down in my constituency be fund by offshore company such as macquarie which be most famous for let thames water fall to piece what meeting have the minister have with these speculative investor to ensure that the people who build solar farm will be there in year to make sure that they be remove 
 my hon friend and constituency neighbour raise an important point about speculative development as part of speed up the grid queue in which we have somewhere in the region of gw of power capacity come forward we wish to prioritise shovel ready scheme not speculative scheme 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 since i be last at the dispatch box we have be build up britain ’s energy security we have take the next step in the big expansion of nuclear in year make britain a producer of advanced nuclear fuel and push putin out of the global energy market just today rolls royce announce that it will invest million of pound in bring new job to sheffield to manufacture small modular reactor we have overachieve in our carbon budget which be keep we on track to reach net and we be build on our proud record of be the major economy to halve emission we have invest over half a pound to help cut energy cost and bill for school and hospital and we be take our next step on pumpwatch to protect motorist from unfair price 
 late figure by national energy action show that there be still home in my constituency with legacy prepayment meter what action be the government take to remove this costly burden on family 
 i thank the hon lady for her question during my career i have look at the issue of prepayment meter for a long time and of the thing that i be proud of be our take out the premium that people on prepayment meter be pay 
 i welcome ofgem ’s ongoing review of stand charge in electricity bill in the north wales and merseyside region the standing charge be 67.04p per day compare to an average of 60.10p across the uk will the minister commit to come back to the house to provide further comment on this geographical variation once ofgem have publish the finding of its review 
 my hon friend make an important point and be right to pick up on this matter i reassure he that i have encourage and push ofgem to do more on this issue electricity standing charge include network cost which reflect the cost of maintain and upgrade the transmission and distribution network across the country i be of course happy to meet he to discuss this subject far 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the national infrastructure commission say that the government have reverse some progress on net   the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may   say that the government ’s roll back on net have put off investor a member of the climate change committee have say that we be not ready at all for the impact of extreme weather on our national security mad bad and dangerous will the secretary of state finally back great british energy and the national wealth fund instead of lurch from crisis to crisis not have a plan and sell out britain 
 we absolutely will not be back put the shadow secretary of state in charge of uk and british energy company pile misery on to consumer bill we have unlock £ of public and private investment in low carbon technology since with plan for £ more by last year alone we see an investment of £ that be up a staggering on the previous year 
 i know the secretary of state understand the importance of safeguard good agricultural land for food production will she update my constituent in inkberrow and stock green on what more she be do to ensure that solar panel be place on car park and warehouse rooftop which we have an ample number of in my constituency 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we need to protect the good and most versatile agricultural land in this country unlike the opposition we respect the view of community up and down this country and we will not countenance the industrialisation of our countryside however solar power remain very important we be committed to our gw target in our forthcoming solar road map we will set out exactly how we will incentivise the development of rooftop solar and development on brownfield and other site 
 private investor be queue up to make billion of pound of investment in the green industry of the future but under this government that money have flow abroad under energy uk ’s projection the uk be now out of major country for renewable investment up to how have the government allow that to happen 
 that be simply not the case we be lead internationally last year alone there be £ of funding for low carbon technology that be up on the previous year that be why other country turn to our business and supply chain for their expertise and to we as we be lead with our policy framework 
 the switch to electric car and van be crucial for improve air quality and reach net will the government   update we on action be take to deliver charge point in the right place in consultation with   resident r 
 the government have invest in the faraday battery challenge a £ programme to support the research development and scale up of world lead battery technology in the uk since all new home and home undergo major renovation in england have be require to have a charge point instal that be why we welcome the year on year increase in charge point 
 will the minister confirm whether the government have drop their commitment to consult on a social energy tariff if they have not can we have an update on progress give that a social energy tariff would lift household out of poverty 
 a social tariff mean lot of different thing to different people but what it ultimately mean be ensure that we support all vulnerable people the hon member will be aware that the government be do many thing to support people there be the warm home discount the cost of live payment which be £ and a variety of other measure 
 while it be important that we support renewable energy source do the minister agree with i that solar panel should go on rooftop not on farmland 
 as my hon friend have hear i say already today solar power be important and we remain committed to our gw target however food security be as important as energy security when it come to national security that be why we be protect the good and most versatile farmland in the united kingdom unlike the opposition we respect the view of community up and down the country we will ensure that our countryside be not industrialised and incentivise company individual and organisation to invest in rooftop solar and solar on brownfield not greenfield site 
 do the minister think that a regulator that allow the poor to pay the high bill and that have oversee the doubling of energy bill since and the collapse of energy company in the same period be fit for purpose 
 we be ensure that energy business be able to survive and not just through the price cap this be also a matter for ofgem 
 my constituency be home to scout moor of the large onshore wind farm in europe but the north west also have amazing potential for offshore wind an example be the morgan and morecambe development off the coast of lancashire such project require huge amount of infrastructure to be realise notwithstanding the reassurance that my right hon friend have already give will she ensure that community consent be part of any infrastructure project of this kind 
 my hon friend raise an important matter absolutely that be part of our forward planning in make sure that we can unlock the huge potential in every region of our united kingdom 
 under ofgem ’s price cap which have just come into effect people with the most poorly insulate rural home can expect to pay an additional £ on their annual energy bill will the minister expand insulation scheme particularly for people live in rural area 
 the hon gentleman ’s question cover a few issue of the most important thing be to look at how the standing charge be make up that be why we have encourage ofgem to answer our call for input insulation scheme be incredibly important as well which be why the government be commit to support so many of they 
 hydrogen be the only viable alternative to natural gas for a balanced reactive and carbon electricity grid the uk have gas power plant all of which could be cheaply and easily retrofit to burn hydrogen as a natural gas what be the department do to encourage this sort of retrofitting so that we can allow technology to decarbonise electricity generation and take advantage of the many benefit of hydrogen 
 i thank my hon friend for that rather surprising question on hydrogen the government recognise the value of hydrogen in support a decarbonised and secure power system we intend to publish soon our response to the december hydrogen to power market intervention consultation and we will soon legislate for decarbonisation readiness requirement so that new build or substantially refurbish combustion power plant be build net ready 
 in the last month in household or in young household in energy debt have turn to illegal money lender to help pay for bill and everyday essential the end fuel poverty coalition have state that the crisis could mean that young household spend year at the mercy of these loan shark what assessment have the minister make of the merit of work with ofgem and energy supplier in order to introduce support to alleviate this record high energy debt 
 the hon member make an incredibly important point and i have have many conversation with she on this matter i can reassure she that i meet ofgem regularly to discuss this as the issue be very close to my heart hence the call for input to give her further reassurance i can tell she that early this week i meet energy supplier and i also have ongoing meeting with citizens advice and other stakeholder 
 like other i welcome what the government have already do to extend the permit development right for rooftop solar and car park canopy but may i encourage my hon friend to tell other in government who have   responsibility for plan that there be considerable benefit to car park canopy particularly in hotter summer 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for his question i urge he to bide his time and have patience because in the next few week we will publish our solar road map which will expand on exactly how we will work with other government departments and indeed industry to ensure that we benefit from the huge advantage that we have in the number of rooftop available for the deployment of solar capacity across the uk 
 there have indeed be a significant increase in domestic insulation scheme in recent year however will the minister agree to increase the number of conversation with devolved institution so that we can see a genuinely nationwide revival of insulation scheme that individually can do more to reduce the dependency on high energy cost for those at maximum risk in social housing and elsewhere 
 clearly energy efficiency be incredibly important which mean that make sure that we get the correct insulation scheme be also incredibly important i give the hon gentleman my assurance that we be do everything we can to ensure that that insulation take place 
 give the float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme funding recently award to wales can the minister please advise i on when a&p falmouth which be to be a vital part of the supply chain for the only successful project in allocation round will be put on the reserve list the minister have promise to meet i on several occasion can i ask that we expedite that much as possible 
 i would be delighted to meet my hon friend to discuss this matter indeed i be determined to ensure that port that be not successful in the flowmis process can take advantage of the huge increase that we expect in the deployment of float offshore wind capacity off the coast of the united kingdom i be happy to meet my hon friend and indeed any other member of parliament who represent a port that be not successful through the flowmis procedure to discuss how we can move this forward 
 community energy can deliver so many renewable energy product and save on energy bill last year in bath a community energy project put rooftop solar on school save school £ when will the government remove the barrier to community energy 
 as a result of the energy act we launch a consultation and a multimillion pound fund to help to support the expansion of community energy across the united kingdom it would be great to have the liberal democrats support in the effort that this party and this government be make to ensure that the benefit of community energy be feel up and down the length and breadth of the country 
 as we go to net surely we also need to retain our sense of human right polysilicon mostly come from xinjiang where it be mine use slave labour to what extend be we prepared to say that net trump slave labour and be we check on slave labour product in the array 
 i can assure my right hon friend that we be indeed ensure that the extent to which slave labour be use be keep very much at a minimum if at all in the supply chain of any of the component come to advance we towards net the solar road map as refer to early will set out in great detail how the government will work with industry to ensure that there be no slave labour component to any of the part we be import to develop our renewable technology 
 my constituent from govanhill be be pass backwards and forwards between utilita energy and the department for work and pensions he receive income relate employment and support allowance and should be entitle to the warm home discount but neither utilita nor the dwp be able to give he the money he be entitle to he apply in september last year will the minister intervene and make sure he get the money he be due 
 i encourage the hon lady to write to i on this particular issue and i will look into it 
 i put on record my heartfelt thank to the secretary of state and the minister for nuclear and renewables for the action they take last week to put food security alongside renewable energy at the heart of local planning decision what be the government do to ensure that all council immediately enact that policy because it be both for local council and for government will exist soil assessment stand for nationally significant infrastructure project or will they be redo 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and her kind word i be pleased to confirm to the house that my hon friend the minister for housing planning and building safety have write to all local authority to draw their attention to the statement last week which underline our robust policy on solar farm on our good and most versatile agricultural land local planner should know this government be serious about solar be put in the right place and not on the good and most versatile agricultural land 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 tapadh leat mr speaker zonal pricing have the potential to low bill for household from sussex to shetland from stonehaven to the great town of stornoway of course some vested interest will be concern such as energy generating company that be benefit from the constraint payment raise from customer bill what be the government do to stimulate debate and knowledge about zonal pricing 
 it be a pleasure on my return as a minister to attend the hon gentleman ’s select committee which he chair so well this be part of stage of our wide consultation under our review of electricity market arrangement and we take on board his and his committee ’s constructive suggestion in that meeting 
 a key tool in our arsenal against climate change must be sequester carbon it be a pleasure last week to see the morecambe bay net peak cluster vision launch which could decarbonise of our cement and lime industry secure a gigatonne of carbon under morecambe bay can i encourage my hon friend the minister to meet i to discuss the project far 
 i would be delighted to meet my hon friend at any time and i be happy to discuss this and any other matter relate to the subject 
 with the final question i call sir john hayes 
 thank you mr speaker now that the government have recognise the importance of versatile and productive agricultural land in respect of solar will they recognise too the threat of a monstrous string of pylon stretch right down the east coast of england we either care about our green and pleasant land or we do not for as keats understand truth be beauty and beauty truth 
 my right hon friend will know that we value take community with we and work with they i be have a number of meeting on this very subject to look at new technology to see what additional option there could be to support local community as we rapidly upgrade our national grid network 
 before i call the minister i should say that he will take long than be usual for a statement and i totally agree with the extra time i be just let the other front benchers know that there will be some extra time 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement follow the final report of the infected blood inquiry 
 yesterday the prime minister speak about the anguish that the infected blood scandal bring to those impact by it i want to reiterate his word and apologise again today i be sorry the prime minister also speak on behalf of the whole house of our gratitude to sir brian langstaff and his team for complete his comprehensive report volume and page and of our appreciation of all those who come forward as part of the inquiry 
 it be the great privilege of my ministerial career to meet over representative of the infected blood community in cardiff edinburgh belfast birmingham and leeds as we finalise our response to compensation for this appalling tragedy the whole community ’s bravery through immense suffering be what have enable justice today i know that many of they will be watch from the public gallery i want to honour their fortitude through their unimaginable pain as i lie out a more detailed response to sir brian ’s interim report on compensation we will provide the house with a further opportunity to debate the inquiry ’s full report after the whitsun recess the government will also respond to each recommendation in full as quickly as possible within our comprehensive response to the report 
 the prime minister confirm yesterday that the government will pay comprehensive compensation to those who have be infect and affect as a result of this scandal i will now set out to the house the scheme that the government be propose and of course more detail of the scheme will be publish online today we be establish the infected blood compensation authority an arm ’s length body to administer the scheme a shadow body have already be set up and an interim chief executive officer have be appoint today i be delighted to announce the appointment of sir robert francis at the interim chair of the organisation the experience and care that sir robert will bring to the role will ensure that the scheme be credible and trust by the community his support in deliver the scheme will be invaluable 
 those who have be infect or affect as a result of this scandal will receive compensation to be crystal clear if you have be directly or indirectly infect by nhs blood blood product or tissue contaminate with hiv or hepatitis c or have develop a chronic infection from blood contaminate with hepatitis b you will be eligible to claim compensation under the scheme and where an infected person have die but would have be eligible under those criterion compensation will be pay to their estate this will include where a person be infect with hepatitis b and die during the acute period of infection 
 but mr speaker sir brian could not have be clear it be not just the harm cause by the infection that require compensation the wrong suffer by those affect must also be compensate for so when a person with an eligible infection have be accept on to the scheme their affected love one will be able to apply for compensation in their own right that mean that partner parent sibling child friend and family who have act as carer for those who be infect be all eligible to claim i be aware that be ask to provide evidence of eligibility will likely be distress so i be determined to minimise that distress as much as possible 
 i be pleased to confirm today that anyone already register with of the exist infected blood support scheme will automatically be consider eligible for compensation i also give thank for the dedication and hard work of professor sir jonathan montgomery and the other member of the expert group who be critical in advise on how the government could faithfully translate sir brian ’s recommendation for the purpose of the scheme in line with our previous commitment we will publish the name of those expert today 
 in his report sir brian recommend that compensation be award with respect to the follow category an injury impact award acknowledge the physical and mental injury cause by the infection a social impact award to address the stigma or social isolation result from the infection an autonomy award acknowledge how family and private life be disrupt during this time a care award to compensate for the past and future care need of anyone infect and finally a financial loss award for past and future financial loss suffer as a result of the infection the government accept this recommendation with small refinement inform by the work of the expert group and design for simplicity and speed other principle that sir brian assert 
 the care award will be directly award to the person with the infection or to their estate secondly the financial loss award will be pay either directly to the person with the infection or where an infected person have tragically die before the establishment of the scheme to their estate and to affected person who be dependent on they sadly many people have link to multiple individual who be infect or be both infect themselves and affect by another ’s infection as such multiple injury award will be offer to reflect the scale of the loss and suffering the scheme will be tariff base and we will be publish an explanatory document on gov.uk include example of propose tariff 
 however this be not the end over the next few week sir robert francis will seek view from the infected blood community on the propose scheme before its term be set in regulation to make sure the scheme will well serve those who it be intend for sir robert have welcome the government ’s proposal as positive and meaningful and he will set out more detail on engagement with the community shortly 
 the inquiry recommend that the scheme should be flexible in its award of compensation provide for either a lump sum or regular payment we agree which be why the award to live infected or affected person will be offer as either a lump sum or as periodical payment where the infected person have die estate   representative will receive compensation as a single lump sum to distribute to beneficiary of the estate as be appropriate we will also guarantee that any payment make to those eligible will be exempt from income capital gain and inheritance tax as well as disregard they from mean test benefit assessment we will also ensure that all claimant be able to appeal against their award both through an internal review process in the infected blood compensation authority and where need with a right to appeal to a tier tribunal our expectation be that final payment will start before the end of the year and if you permit mr speaker i would like to return to the house when the regulation be lay later this year to make a further statement with an update on the delivery of the compensation scheme 
 i know from my discussion with the community just how important the exist infected blood support scheme payment be to they i recognise that many people sadly rely on these payment and they be rightly keen to understand what the government ’s intention be i want to provide reassurance to all those out there today that no immediate change will be make to the support scheme payment will continue to be make at the same level until   march and they will not be deduct from any of these compensation award from   april any support scheme payment receive will be count towards a beneficiary ’s final compensation award this will ensure parity between support scheme beneficiary regardless of whether they be the or the last to have their compensation assess by the infected blood compensation authority we will ensure that no no receive less in compensation than they would have receive in support payment 
 i recognise that each week member of the infected blood community be die from their infection there may be people indeed there will be people listen today who be think to themselves that they may not live to receive compensation so i want to address those concern too today i be announce that the government will be make further interim payment ahead of the establishment of the full scheme payment of £ will be make to live infect beneficiary those register with exist infected blood support scheme as well as those who register with a support scheme before the final scheme become operational and to the estate of those who pass away between now and payment be make i know that time be of the essence which be why i be also pleased to say that they will be deliver within day start in the summer so that they can reach those who most need it so urgently 
 before i conclude i would like to turn to the matter of memorialisation many of those who be infect by contaminate blood or blood product have since die die without know that their suffering and loss would be fully recognise either in their lifetime or at all the life of most of those who have die remain unrecognised i note sir brian ’s recommendation on memorialisation across the uk and the government will address those recommendation in detail as part of our wide response to this report 
 in conclusion i know that the whole house will want to join i in thank sir brian and the inquiry for the work that they have do and pay tribute to all those who have be catch up in this terrible tragedy and who have battle for justice for so long yesterday be   a day of great humility for everyone implicate in this    inquiry and today i can only hope that with the publication of the inquiry report and with our firm commitment to compensate those touch by this scandal the infected blood community know that their cry for justice have be hear i commend this statement to the house 
 rise 
 order lot of members want to get in and all member will get in i now come to the shadow minister 
 the infected blood scandal be the grave injustice in our history and a profound moment of shame for the british state yesterday the leader of the opposition apologise on behalf of labour government of the past and the prime minister do the same on behalf of all government and the country i join they today in say a deep and heartfelt sorry 
 the scale of the horror that be uncover by sir brian langstaff ’s report almost defy belief that be why i pay tribute to the victim of this scandal who fight so hard for justice we thank the charity and the remarkable campaigning work of my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson as well as the father of the house and the journalist caroline wheeler whose work and book death in the blood do so much to drive this issue forward i also recognise the significance of the decision make by the former prime minister   the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may in establish the public inquiry i thank sir brian langstaff and all his staff for their forensic work i also thank the minister for regularly brief i and for his work in government ahead of today 
 of the most powerful conclusion in this report be that an apology be meaningful only if it be accompany by action and it be that i turn to now i welcome the further interim payment that the minister have announce and i repeat our commitment to work on a cross party basis and help to deliver the compensation scheme and get the final money to victim as soon as possible 
 i welcome the further detail that the minister have give include the appointment of the interim chair sir robert francis be say already that he be seek the view of the infected blood community and that be welcome but do the minister agree that continue to hear that voice of victim be crucial 
 i also welcome payment be make under the head of loss to the infected and the affected will the minister confirm that estimate of the total cost have now be make and that there will be no undue delay in those final payment reach victim time be of the essence victim die every day will the minister set out more detail about how the personal representative of estate will be handle as part of the scheme will he also confirm that plan be in place to trace additional people who might be eligible for compensation will he say a little more about when we can expect a progress report on sir brian langstaff ’s other recommendation beyond the establishment of the compensation body i add my support and that of all labour members to the consideration of appropriate and fitting memorial   across the different part of the uk and as sir brian langstaff recommend for victim who be treat at treloar ’s 
 on potential criminal charge will the minister ensure that all relevant evidence be make available for consideration by the prosecute authority and any other necessary support provide sir brian langstaff ’s finding on institutional defensiveness and on put the reputation of people and protect institution above public service follow on from other scandal such as hillsborough and horizon that be why we must deliver a duty of candour and the political leadership that we need to replace that culture of defensiveness with openness and transparency sir brian langstaff ’s report challenge we all to make progress on his recommendation that be what we must now come together to do the victim deserve nothing less 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his collegiate tone and for the constructive approach he have take throughout our conversation and in his response this afternoon i totally embrace the need to continue the dialogue with victim that be why i be pleased that sir robert francis agree to take on that role have do the study into compensation we have obviously meet a number of time and i have explain to he what jonathan montgomery and the expert panel do i be pleased that he have get to a point where he be sufficiently satisfied to move forward in this way 
 as the prime minister make clear yesterday there be no restriction on the budget and where we need to pay we will pay we will minimise delay and address the recommendation of sir brian langstaff with respect to speed and efficiency remove as much complexity as possible the right hon gentleman ask about the representative of different estate and trace additional claimant those will be matter that the interim chief executive and interim chair will look at carefully i envisage through the month of june an exercise to engage meaningfully with representative of the community to look at some of the assumption in the work of that expert panel which will inform the regulation that we be duty bind to bring to the house within month of the victims and prisoners bill receive royal assent 
 some of the other matter about appropriate memorialisation criminal charge and duty of candour on some of which progress be be make in different way be probably well leave to some of my colleague at a subsequent point as i say i anticipate that we will have an early opportunity to discuss those matter in full in a debate soon after the whitsun recess 
 i call the father of the house 
 the house will understand that my remark will be subsidiary to those of   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson 
 it be year since i be with the of my friend who i know have be infect and year since that person die friendship get fracture and family be change forever 
 point that i hope my right hon friend the minister will put to his fellow ministers in the department of health and social care regard whether those who be still infect in some way can have a kind of national health service passport so that when they go to get medical attention they be not ask the same question that my constituent be ask every time how much have you be drink why be your liver the way it be and all the rest it be important that young clinician understand that when they see haemophilia or a whole blood infection they can take for grant a lot of thing that do not need to be ask that humanity need to be spread 
 i recognise that my right hon friend have build on the work of our right hon friend   the member for horsham sir jeremy quin and perhaps i may say in a cross party way that sue gray deserve respect for when she lead civil servant in that as do her successor in the civil service who be put thing right 
 my final point be this people be not be award lottery sum although in some way they make up for some of the loss and recognise some of the hurt for some family who may not have be use to have much money around indeed most of they be use to have very little money because of the consequence of infection there may need to be mediation service in case they do not agree it would be a good idea if sir robert or other could consider whether such service could be make available in the same way that other people who have suddenly come into some degree of money can get some kind of help family sometimes do not find it easy to decide how money should be share 
 i thank my hon friend for his comment and i pay tribute to he for the work that he have do and for his constructive engagement with i over the past month and over many previous year he make the point about his friend and the stigma that some of the victim have have to endure which be why injury and social impact be reflect in the head of loss under the scheme he also make some observation about how well awareness of some condition can be take forward i will discuss that with ministerial colleague several from the department of health and social care be in their place today 
 my hon friend mention my immediate predecessor my right hon friend   the member for horsham sir jeremy quin but i be aware that a large number of paymasters general include my right hon friend the leader of the house who be sit alongside i today have do an enormous amount of work to get we to this point along with many official include james quinault who have lead the work latterly i want to acknowledge their contribution this be not about i 
 more broadly my hon friend make some wise observation about the need to ensure that for the community who will be give significant sum of money rightly so and in line with what they would be entitle to if they go through a legal process the appropriate framework of support be in place to assist they to receive that money in a way that be not destructive to their life 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 yesterday be an emotional day for many of we i be privileged to be at central hall with my constituent cathy young and her fantastic daughter lisa and nicola i join the minister in pay great tribute to the infected blood community that community give sir brian langstaff a stand ovation yesterday a sight that will never leave i may i echo the public gallery ’s reaction to the appointment of sir robert francis it be an excellent appointment will the minister confirm that sir robert francis will be able to meet the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood as well as other in the house 
 with regard to the composition of the board of the compensation authority will the minister guarantee i have already raise this with he that it will include representative of the infected and affect and that they will have what we believe be their rightful representation on the board i welcome his comment in relation to hepatitis b. that have always be of the issue of contention and some people with hepatitis b have be miss out on the exist scheme will he look to find a way so that those with hepatitis b can access the exist scheme i know that the scottish infected blood forum have ask he that question 
 on interim payment the minister mention the living will he clarify whether interim payment will be make to the estate of those who have sadly pass away some people will raise eyebrow about the fact that the interim compensation be less than that for those in the post office scheme will he give some explanation as to how the £ figure come about 
 i echo the comment of the shadow minister on look at criminal charge and a hillsborough law and i very much welcome his comment on memorial do the minister agree that there be other lesson member of this house regardless of political persuasion can get together to deliver justice and secondly for the general public the key lesson as show by those in the infected blood community be never ever to give up fight injustice 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his engagement and for the point he have make today i be there yesterday for the hour of sir brian langstaff ’s presentation of his report which be a moving moment for all of those who have suffer and wait for so long 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his endorsement of the appointment of sir robert francis which seem to be welcome in the gallery i recognise that what be absolutely critical for the scheme to be successful be full engagement with the community and that the explanation of how the scheme have be construct and any concern about the wide support that be need be interrogate fully before the regulation come back to the house throughout the scheme have be about reconcile speed and efficiency with consultation which be why it have be do in such a way over the past few month 
 the hon gentleman make a point about hepatitis b and access to scheme i will be happy to correspond with he separately on that obviously there be lot of technical issue he ask about the £ which he can see be an irregular amount that be because i be try to get the maximum amount that could be universally pay as quickly as i could to those who be infect   and alive without any risk of pay the wrong amount and that be the amount that i be advise what be really important be that we get to the examination of entitlement and what that balance payment be and get that payment out as quickly as possible this be not a stall tactic it be about try to reconcile the compete priority of responsible stewardship of taxpayer money and get payment make as quickly as possible for the most vulnerable in our community 
 with regard to memorialisation on these matter there will need to be wide engagement and i do not want to make binding commitment today i have say what i have say and i or another minister will return to that in due course 
 i call the chair of the health and social care committee 
 i thank the minister for what he say and how he say it i know that he the prime minister and in particular the chancellor who be sit next to he will make this right clearly the majority of sir brian ’s recommendation be for the health and social care sector and the health and social care committee which i chair will play its part work with the health secretary i see she in her place and nhs england to ensure that all the recommendation be implement unlike with some previous accept patient safety recommendation may i ask the minister about the loss category they make every sense and i note his small refinement but will the financial loss award reflect the reality that many infected blood victim to give just example can not access life insurance 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for his comment i also thank the chancellor for his unwavering commitment to resolve this in a timely way both when i be chief secretary and now in this role 
 with respect to the loss category my hon friend make a legitimate point about a specific additional burden that be a consequence of these condition that matter will no doubt be raise by some in the community the structure of the scheme be base around injury social impact autonomy care and financial loss clearly social impact and autonomy capture a range of unspecific thing a basket of good if you like that people will not have be able to procure at the same cost i can not give he a specific answer on that but jonathan montgomery and his team of expert have do everything they can to look at the law consider what the entitlement would be in different circumstance and give their good assessment and those sort of conversation will happen with the community in the come week 
 i welcome the minister ’s statement today reflect on the fact that he have talk about those infected and affected be fully engage i gently remind he of the maxim no decision about we without we and of the lack of transparency so far in the expert panel it be only today that we will learn the name of the people who have be advise the government 
 may i also welcome the appointment of sir robert francis as interim chair of the infected blood body it be worth reflect on what sir brian put in his report   yesterday about the government ’s failure to respond to sir robert francis ’s compensation framework document which the leader of the house commission when she be paymaster general and which the government promise several time to respond to that be never publish 
 because we have also not have a proper write response to the interim report from sir brian last april will the minister set out whether all recommendation be be accept by the government if not why not will he confirm how the government will ensure that the compensation authority be accountable directly to parliament as recommend by the infected blood inquiry 
 i thank the right hon lady for her observation and for her ongoing engagement since my appointment i take seriously her point about have no decision without full engagement i make a decision in order to get to this point where we would in principle accept the recommendation of sir brian langstaff and move forward with the independent expert panel as i have say to she previously i be always prepared to reveal the name of those individual but i do not want they to be distract while they do urgent work to make progress quickly their name will be available shortly today 
 sir robert francis and i have a number of conversation about the interaction between government and the expert group and the logic that i use to get to the head of loss and the scheme today i be delighted that he be prepared to facilitate engagement with the community 
 i have also be mindful of the principle of the government manage public money while also recognise sir brian ’s imperative to set up a body that be at arm ’s length from government in order to generate some trust with a very vulnerable community reconcile those have not be straightforward the right hon lady ask about the accountability of the arm ’s length body these matter will need to be discuss far with respect to the regulation that we must lay before the house 
 a number of my predecessor have do a lot of work on this issue i be pleased that we have make significant progress but there be an intense amount of work to be do to deliver this over the next month i look forward to work constructively with she as sir robert francis do to ensure that we get this to the right place as quickly as possible 
 i call the chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee 
 we have hear description of institutional defensiveness today but we should be clear about what we be talk about this be a grubby secret keep by the department of health the people who suffer as a consequence be treat as an inconvenience to be manage it fly in the face of what we be require to do in this house hold ministers accountable for what happen in their department we need to learn from this to improve how we behave and to hold the executive to account in future if we do not this incident will shame we all not   just those directly responsible we need to properly establish a duty of candour for civil servant in the advice they give to ministers and a requirement that ministers must satisfy themselves that they be give appropriate challenge and consideration to the advice they receive so that everyone involve in deliver service in future can be hold directly responsible and this place do not continue to be a charade 
 i thank the hon lady for her comment and i agree with her instinctive reaction to what sir brian say about the duty of candour it will be for the government more widely to determine how we respond to that in a formal and coherent way when my right hon friend the chancellor be in a previous role he move quite a lot of thing forward in the department of health as the hon lady know when someone spend that amount of time with that depth of evaluation and give a number of insight and recommendation it be important that the government look at they very carefully sir brian make wise observation about how we do government in this country which we must listen to heed and apply 
 i too welcome today ’s statement which have be a long time come this be a poignant day for many of my constituent their family and friend reassurance have be call for by organisation such as haemophilia scotland that the recommendation will be adhere to as perhaps they have not be in the past do the minister agree that have the involvement of various group of infected and affected people will help ensure that happen 
 i agree when i go to edinburgh i be keen to meet a representative group of scottish infect blood campaign organisation i have a very candid conversation with they in which i set out where we be as a government and what we be plan to do on this day at a high level those conversation need to continue as i say the immediate priority be under sir robert francis ’s guidance that engagement will continue throughout june so that the regulation be inform by the wisdom experience and view of those we be seek to support 
 let i start by commend my constituency neighbour   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson for her courage determination and persistence in relentlessly pursue this matter over the year i wholeheartedly support her call for the rapid payment of compensation before any more sufferer die and i know the minister have that in mind 
 the prime minister say that a travesty like this should never be allow to happen again like the pacac chair i think that rest on the duty of candour that sir brain langstaff recommend that mean a legally enforceable duty of candour for the entire public service not just some promise as it turn out the minister have in front of he the opportunity to do that on report today in the lords be the victims and prisoners bill which include a clause that impose a duty of candour in a very limited way can my right hon friend look at that clause and expand it to cover the whole public sector under all circumstance 
 i defer to my right hon friend ’s considerable experience and wisdom on many matter i recognise his point but to move on this matter in that way in this short timeframe would not be the right step however it would be right for we to urgently engage with he the public administration and constitutional affairs committee and other to ensure that the government come up with the right complete response to deal with a sensible point that sir brian make 
 i pay tribute to my constituent whose life be change for ever and the many campaigner affect by this scandal who have fight for so many year for truth and justice from hillsborough to the post office the infected blood scandal and many more we have watch the state and institution cover up wrongdoing and blame the innocent with no accountability how long do we have to wait for those in this place to finally act and rebalance the scale of justice and to deliver a full hillsborough law yesterday ’s event show how necessary that law be to begin to end the culture of cover up that be shamefully hardwired into our institution 
 i very much respect the hon gentleman ’s point about hillsborough i be not able to answer his question on that as my remark be about the compensation scheme but a number of point have be make about the incidence of public inquiry on a range of issue and what that say about our state and its failure in different way as he say considerable effort be require of individual which it should never have be to apprehend the state for what have happen these be wide matter that we will need to come to term with but i do not think i can do justice to his remark today 
 i appreciate that today ’s statement be about compensation but there be no opportunity yesterday nor much today to ask specifically about lord mayor treloar college in hampshire my constituent mike webster send his son gary a constituent of my hon friend   the member for eastleigh paul holmes to treloar back in the late 70 and early 80 he write to i last month to tell i how distraught he be that the school be now try to paint itself as a victim when we know that it be in receipt of fund to conduct experiment on child will my right hon friend give i some assurance from the dispatch box that the government be consider very carefully how the helsinki declaration may have be breach and some guidance about what future step may be take 
 my right hon friend very eloquently make a very important point in the course of my engagement i meet a number of former pupil from treloar i believe that in sir robert ’s report full volume pertain to what happen there so many individual undergo medical treatment that be not envisage by their parent and where consent appear not to have be secure this be a massive aspect of the work of sir brian langstaff the government will need to examine it very carefully include the implication for who be culpable and how we should most appropriately respond to avoid anything like that happen again i hope that what i have say today with respect to   compensation will give some modest measure of comfort to those i meet and those like they who be not here today 
 there be not word enough to pay tribute to all the campaigner infect and affect include my constituent lin who lose bill and the smiths i also pay tribute to my right hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   and journalist such as caroline wheeler the smiths lose colin age just year old to aids have be give infected blood from an arkansas prison at month old we now know from the inquiry that the risk of give that blood be know lin and the smiths want sorry to turn into something today for those who die every week on their behalf i say to the minister make sure we have a proper timeline and that we stick to it implement the recommendation as fast as possible put the victim at the heart of decision making and no more delay this group of people have wait far too long and have be through far too much already finally the smiths want their son to have his name back although they have always make sure that we   have never forget it so can i say it today colin   john smith 
 the hon lady make a move tribute to her constituent i can assure she that the government have hear the plea that have be make we have set out today a clear timetable on the journey to the regulation i will with mr speaker ’s permission update the house in early autumn on where we have get to and the timeline for further detail subject to the advice of the interim ceo and the interim chair she make a point about stigma which be a massive part of this for so many people i meet and for her constituent include the smith family we recognise that as part of the scheme but the memorialisation process must also recognise in particular those who be so badly stigmatise in the 80 and 90 
 the minister talk about stigma when i meet some of the affected community in peterborough i hear about the discrimination they face and about their lack of trust in public institution this all leave a very long legacy with that in mind how confident be he that despite that long legacy the scheme will capture and benefit everyone affect or infect how confident be he that everyone who should be compensate will come forward 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i be confident that the scheme will work and that it will work as quickly as it possibly can i mention today the interim payment of £ to the infect who be alive the speed with which we process the application of those affect and infected be very much on my mind as we set up the shadow arm ’s length body i will continue to work with my official to do everything we can to move the timeline from the right to the left conscious of how long people have wait
