the hon gentleman might be interested in this we have set target to reduce phosphorus load from wastewater treatment work by by relative to a baseline in area where protect habitat site be particularly impact by nutrient pollution which i be sure interest the hon gentleman we be go even far in the levelling up and regeneration act we place a new requirement on water company to upgrade wastewater treatment work in designate area to the high technically achievable standard by april 
 the clerk at the table have inform the house of the unavoidable absence through illness of the speaker from the sitting of the house this week the chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to improve the commissioning of primary care dental service for vulnerable people 
 what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of level of availability of dentistry appointment on other nhs service 
 may i through you madam deputy speaker wish mr speaker a very speedy recovery 
 as secretary of state for health and social care i want to reform our nhs and social care system to make it fast simple and fairer dentistry be a critical part of that integrated care board be responsible for identify area of local need and determine the priority for investment nhs england publish guidance in october this year to help icb use their commission flexibility within the national dental contractual framework and i will be look carefully at how the board be identify need and investment across england include for vulnerable people 
 i be glad that the minister mention icb liverpool have a very high percentage of child with dental decay and tooth extraction be the most common hospital procedure for to year old at alder hey children ’s hospital yet there be a £ underspend for primary care dentistry and instead of invest it in preventive care nhs england give permission to all icb include nhs cheshire and merseyside to use the balance to balance their budget will the minister agree here and now to reinstate the ringfenced funding to commission extra capacity for the most vulnerable patient 
 i be delighted to be able to inform the hon member that nhs england have provide guidance for icb that require dental funding to be ringfence with any unused resource redirect to improve nhs dental access in the instance interestingly icb will report their expenditure against the dental ringfence to nhs england as part of their in year financial planning which will happen at the end of this financial year 
 but the underspend be not be use on dentistry 
 no no you do not get another supplementary question i be about to call layla moran for question which be group with this but unfortunately she be not present so i shall go straight to the chairman of the health and social care committee 
 the government previously commit to publish a dental recovery plan which the former dental minister my hon friend   the member for harborough neil o’brien say that the government would publish shortly he also tell my committee 
 we do want everyone who need to be able to access an nhs dentist 
 we be surprised but he say it we be tell that the plan would be publish during the summer or before the summer recess when will the plan be publish if that be still the intention presumably it will come alongside the response to our dental services report which be due on   september 
 i thank my hon friend and i look forward to be grill by he and his committee in due course at least i think i do perhaps i can assist he on the very important dental report that his committee publish i be look through it myself this afternoon and i will be publish the response and send it to the committee imminently in relation to the dental plan both the under secretary of state for health and social care my right hon friend   the member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom and i be look carefully into the need of community in rural and coastal area as well as in more urban area to understand not just the need but the answer that we can provide to help with urgent care and importantly preventive care particularly for our child and vulnerable people in our society 
 last week another dentist in my constituency tell my constituent that they be no long able to provide nhs service these people have literally nowhere else to go nearby i want to come back to what my hon friend   the member for liverpool riverside kim johnson   ask about the underspend because we have a meeting with the icb and it be specifically tell that the ringfence be be disapplie do the secretary of state agree that that money should be spend on dental service and that that instruction should be give by she today 
 i agree and that be why nhs england have provide guidance as i set out early 
 i welcome the guidance that icb have receive cornwall icb have commit to ringfence money for dentistry next year but the truth be that before it take on that commitment £ for unmet unit of dental activity be return to nhs england what can the secretary of state do to ensure that cornwall get the money that be intend for cornwall to deliver nhs dentistry 
 a theme be emerge of underspend in dental work which be of the thing that the ministerial team and i be look at nhs england emphasise in its guidance to icb that the funding should be ringfence i very much understand the pressure that my hon friend and other south west members have be raise over many month on the care that their constituent be get to ease pressure in the south west nhs england have commission additional urgent dental care appointment that people can access through nhs 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i begin by welcome the secretary of state and her ministers to their post 
 last year the prime minister pledge to restore nhs dentistry include a specific promise to protect its budget yet last month we learn that he will break that promise and allow icb to raid dentistry budget to fill the gap labour have a plan for extra appointment supervise toothbrushing in school and a targeted dentistry recruitment scheme in leave behind area it be all fully fund by abolish non dom tax status we have a plan but the government ’s plan be month overdue where be it 
 i thank the hon lady for her warm welcome i look forward to discuss these matter with she over the dispatch box 
 over the weekend i be rather pleased to see the leader of the opposition ’s damascene conversion to the conservative cause as the shadow secretary of state be on his world tour investigate what other health system be do the labour party may wish to bear in mind the word of wisdom from the great lady herself the problem with socialism be that at some point you run out of other people ’s money 
 what recent step she have take to help prepare for a future pandemic 
 lesson from covid-19 have be incorporate into our planning for any future pandemic across a range of area that include the need to prepare for infection through all route of transmission and for the health and social care sector to have flexible capability that can adapt to a range of health threat 
 my hon friend may have hear that news be emerge from china of yet another respiratory disease spread through that country what mechanism be in place to learn from the covid inquiry when it   finish its work so that if mistake be make we do not make they again in the event that god forbid we have another pandemic 
 early indication show that the respiratory illness in china be likely to be due to increase level of endemic infection these be normal infection but at a high level 
 secondly we be not wait for the covid inquiry before we implement lesson learn of the key change we have already make be the introduction of the uk health security agency which carry out surveillance on both national and international threat a good example of its work be last year ’s strep a outbreak which it manage and contain very well this year the identification of a new covid variant not a variant of concern mean we bring forward our autumn vaccination roll out 
 for all of we who lose love one covid-19 be still very raw i have be follow the covid inquiry and recommendation have so far come forward the be that the lockdown should have be early and the be that those with covid should not have be send to care home covid go through care home and cast death everywhere have the minister take those lesson on board 
 i know the hon gentleman have a personal loss to covid and he be absolutely right to highlight those lesson learn we be learn lesson but each pandemic or increase in infection be different it may have be appropriate to have lockdown for covid-19 but lockdown may not be appropriate for other infection such as strep a or other respiratory illness we set up the ukhsa to provide expert advice we be learn lesson from the covid inquiry and we be already take action 
 what progress her department have make on discharge patient from hospital and move they into social care 
 when someone no long need to be in hospital it be well for they and well for the nhs for they to go home that be why we have be work hard to reduce delayed discharge and we have be make good progress in england delay discharge be down since january mean thousand few people wait in hospital and free up nearly hospital bed every day 
 in my constituency of north east fife an average of of social care and social work role be fill when advertise but yesterday the home secretary announce plan to make it hard to recruit care worker from overseas what assessment have the minister make of the effect of that announcement on hospital ability to discharge patient and free up hospital bed for those who need they 
 the hon member refer to yesterday ’s announcement on migration i be very grateful to all the international worker who come here to help in our health and social care system and to care for our   love one clearly we must get the balance right between migration and make sure that our health and care system have the workforce that it need that be what we be do both with the migration change announce yesterday and with our reform to the social care workforce to ensure that work in social care be appeal to home grow talent 
 i call the shadow minister 
 thank to their own internal chaos the conservatives have utterly fail in their promise at the last general election to fix the crisis in social care once and for all we now have over care vacancy and care staff leave their job each year mean that of patient in england who be fit for discharge be be keep in hospital each day will the minister therefore back labour ’s plan to deliver a fair pay agreement with well term condition training and pay to ensure that we have the staff require to care for all those who need it 
 labour really have not get a leg to stand on when it come to social care reform they do not do anything the last time they be in government and they still do not have a plan for social care in government we be reform social care careers—[interruption if the hon lady will take a look at what we be do we be introduce a new career structure for people work in social care introduce new qualification and invest in training for social care we be do what need to be do to ensure that social care as a career work for uk worker interruption 
 order you will not get your turn if you shout from there 
 what step her department be take to reduce pressure on nhs service in winter 
 we know that winter be hard for the nhs as it be for other health system that be why we start plan for this winter early than ever before back in january when we publish our urgent and emergency care recovery plan which fund more bed and new ambulance for our nhs fund more social care in our community join up care and make the most of technology so that more people can get the care they need when and where they most need it 
 accident and emergency department serve patient in hornsey and wood green be now serve double the number of visit by patient and be buckling under the pressure and the other have see extra patient this year compare with last what be the government go to do about overcrowding in accident and emergency 
 the hon member be right that our hospital be busy we be see more patient in a&es that be why we be do thing with our work on urgent and emergency care be provide   more capacity more hospital bed more hour of ambulance on the road and more capacity in social care to help with discharge we be also do thing differently by see more people out of hospital avoid people come to hospital unnecessarily and provide more care at home for instance our hospital at home bed be help people recover at home which be well for they and well for the system 
 i know the considerable work the department and nhs england have do prepare for winter give the importance of the nhs workforce who do such an incredible job and note that there be still a few month to go will the minister update the house on the delivery of our manifesto commitment for an additional nurse 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for the excellent work he do as a health minister it be a real pleasure to work alongside he and see what a difference he make for our constituent across the country he ask a very good question about the work we be do to increase the capacity of the nhs and ensure that it have the workforce it need include by deliver on our manifesto commitment to more nurse for the nhs which we have achieve 
 way the minister could help harrow ’s health service be well prepare for this winter and future winter would be to invest in new intensive care bed at northwick park hospital which serve my constituent give that the government have be tell repeatedly that their promise new hospital be about as real as the prime minister ’s meat tax why do ministers not invest in a hospital that actually exist and provide a new purpose build intensive care facility at northwick park hospital 
 i assure the hon member that we be invest in the national health service and in particular support it to prepare for this winter ensure there be more capacity in the system there will be more bed in hospital around the country this winter as well as new ambulance on the road but we be also do thing differently the future of healthcare be not just about hospital but about care for more people out of hospital for instance we be invest in proactive care so that in every neighbourhood the people who be more likely to go into hospital be know and reach out to and the care be available for they that be of the thing we be do to ensure that people receive care when and where they need it 
 sleaford and north hykeham be a beautiful rural constituency but live in a rural area mean people be far from specialist medical service which be a particular challenge in the winter month when the road can be difficult to travel on as the winter approach what be the minister do to ensure that constituent in rural area be well look after 
 my hon friend make a very important point about the additional challenge in rural area i want to ensure that this winter people get care when they need it and get it fast we be already see   progress on that for instance we be invest in make sure there be more ambulance hour on the road and we be see ambulance get to people quick in fact this october they get to people minute fast than last october ambulance handover delay be reduce and we be already see progress in a&e where people be be see fast too 
 i call the shadow minister 
 under the last labour government there be no winter crisis under the tories we have go from no winter crisis to an annual crisis to a crisis all year around rather than tackle the crisis at source this government have only stick plaster solution for a few month at a time how will patient know that a winter crisis have be avoid if problem persist into the spring 
 i be really sorry but the hon member ’s memory appear to be very short i be work in healthcare when there be a labour government and i remember very well problem for the nhs during winter she do not even need to look back into the past she can look at the labour run nhs in wales where they be have so much difficulty with a&e performance that they even fudge the figure and hide a whole load of patient so people would not notice what be go on 
 what step she be take to help reduce vaping by young people 
 the hon lady raise such an important question on a subject that be dear to both our heart we all know it be an offence to sell vape to child under yet in child try a vape in alone and the number try vape have triple in the last year we know the industry be target child quite cynically that be unacceptable our tobacco and vape bill will restrict the appeal and availability of vape to child and we be consult on that right now 
 as the minister rightly say under age vaping have increase by in just the past year minister have the chance to stop this trend year ago during the passage of the health and care act when labour table an amendment to prohibit brand that appeal to child but ministers would not support it and conservative members vote it down do the minister regret the fact that the government do not act soon when will the plan new legislation be bring to the house the consultation be welcome but there be consensus on the issue and action be urgently need 
 the hon lady know full well that make decision that change legislation require consultation that be both the convention and the requirement the government have bring forward the consultation as soon as possible it will close tomorrow and we will introduce legislation as soon as possible in   the new year i think the hon lady will find that that legislation really will tackle the problem of the cynical targeting of child 
 what step she be take to improve patient access to primary care 
 the hon gentleman will be pleased to know that with huge thank to all the superb gps and health team our manifesto commitment for more general practice appointment a year compare with have now be deliver our primary care recovery plan be address access challenge by tackle the am rush for appointment cut bureaucracy for gps and of course expand community pharmacy service 
 i thank the minister for her answer but let i correct she since the number of gp practice in bedford and kempston have decrease from to there be few doctor while the patient list have increase and the number of patient per qualified gp now stand at which be a rise of will the minister apologise to gps and to my constituent who face a daily struggle to access a gp because her government have decimate nhs primary care service 
 the hon gentleman will appreciate that more appointment between and now be a fantastic increase there be just under new gps since and the hon gentleman will appreciate that through the post covid recovery plan to improve access we have say to gp practice that they should provide urgent appointment on the same day and for every patient within week that have significantly improve access for patient and gp appointment be now be hugely support by access to community our flagship programme to improve healthcare throughout the country 
 i be incredibly grateful for the significant increase in the number of gp appointment offer to resident in my constituency however last week aspire announce that it wish to close the lower stoke surgery on the hoo peninsula where the council propose to build thousand of home will my right hon friend meet i to discuss how i can work far with the integrate care board i have be try over a number of year now to work with the icb so that it can come up with a plan for how it will deliver much need service so i would be very grateful for the minister ’s help 
 i be of course always delight to meet my hon friend to talk about issue in her constituency i reiterate that more gp appointment be brilliant news our flagship pharmacy programme will mean that more low level infection and problem such as sinusitis oral contraception impetigo and various other condition can be treat by community pharmacist at great convenience to patient and it will expand gps ability to deal with more complex problem all these thing be alleviate the pressure on primary care and be very good news right across the country 
 a primary care walk in facility at warren farm in my constituency face closure due to the presence of reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete the proposal to close the service will mean that service be relocate away from resident who need they what be the minister do to fund the investigation and removal of raac in health facility while make sure that community can still access the healthcare that they so desperately need 
 i be incredibly sympathetic to the hon lady ’s constituent the issue of raac be that the government be determined to resolve there have be a £ programme of new funding to eradicate raac from the healthcare system and that work be under way she will appreciate that it be for integrated care board to ensure that the provision be there for all patient but if she should need help with contact or negotiate with her icb i will be delighted to help she 
 a recent report highlight the fact that in september there be miss gp appointment in cornwall that be appointment that could have go to people desperately wait to see their gp it be happen month after month do the minister agree that that be completely unacceptable and can she highlight what step the government will take to address the issue 
 my hon friend be right it be appal that people book an appointment and then do not show up in many gp surgery now they post the number of patient who do not turn up for their appointment and urge people to make the effort to cancel as part of our access to primary care we be create digital tool so that gp surgery can notify patient that they have an upcoming appointment and say if you do n’t need it press here and it will cancel the appointment measure such as that make it easy for people to cancel but he be quite right that it be incumbent on we all if we book that appointment to turn up for it 
 what fund her department be provide to help tackle health inequality in essex 
 what step she be take to help reduce health inequality 
 i be pleased to reiterate to my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel   that essex be receive funding from the national institute for health and care research which be fund by the department of health and social care to promote research into health inequality and support well health outcome for her constituent and all resident in essex 
 i thank the secretary of state for her response and welcome she to her new role it be a real pleasure to see she in her position today my witham constituent have of the high patient gp ratio in the country that bring many challenge in access   the nhs from primary care to dentistry social care and hospital appointment some of which have be exacerbate by industrial action will she give an update on the work she be lead to address some of those issue and will she support my work and campaign locally to get a new primary health centre in witham town 
 i thank my right hon friend very much for her kind word she will remember how much i enjoy sit on the front bench alongside she when we be in the home office in term of her work in essex she be a formidable campaigner and she will know that the decision on such a healthcare centre lie with her integrate care board to which the government have give some £ of capital funding between and i be sure she will make a compelling case to the icb for such a centre in her constituency interestingly the mid and south essex integrate care board be of site receive additional support and funding from nhs england to address health inequality and i know she will pay close attention to how that be spend 
 there be multiple warning from expert such as professor sir michael marmot of the widen health inequality that start in covid just expose and amplify those inequality so that in the north there be more death or more than avoidable death while i welcome the new health secretary to her post and i welcome her announcement this morning what else be she go to do to address in particular the socioeconomic inequality that drive those health inequality 
 i thank the hon lady for her welcome have grow up in lancashire myself i very much understand why she be speak up on behalf of her constituent there be many different way that we deal with this but let i use a couple of headline point we be increase the public health grant to local authority provide more than £ this year so per capita public health grant allocation for the most deprived local authority be nearly and a half time great than for the least deprive 
 there be also interesting work go on with family hub indeed the under secretary of state for health and social care my right hon friend for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom who have responsibility for start for life be lead on that the family hub and start for life programme will deliver a step change in outcome for baby child and parent in local authority in england with high deprivation we believe strongly that if we can give the good start in life to our baby and child it will bode extremely well for their future year 
 a report that be to be publish shortly by the all party parliamentary group for diagnostic which i chair have highlight that community diagnostic centre be essential for tackle health inequality i welcome my right hon friend to her new role will she honour her predecessor ’s commitment to meet the all party group to discuss the benefit of diagnostic in general and the preventive role that they can play in reduce health inequality across the country 
 not only be i delight to accept my hon friend ’s kind invitation but i be also extremely grateful for her work in that area of course we think that community diagnostic centre be an important and exciting part of healthcare in this country we have centre operational at the moment and we know that they have provide additional test since july that be the future and we very much support it 
 we know that socioeconomic inequality drive health inequality and that poverty increase adverse health effect research by the trussell trust show that in people face hunger across the uk because they simply do not have enough money will the secretary of state raise with her cabinet colleague the trussell trust joint campaign with the joseph rowntree foundation call for an essential guarantee in universal credit to ensure that the basic rate at least cover life ’s essential so as to ensure that people can afford essential such as food and heating and to mitigate against health inequality 
 of course conversation continue between ministers across government in term of help not just with health inequality but with inequality of opportunity that be why i very much hope that the hon lady and her colleague will welcome the thoughtful focus that both the chancellor and the secretary of state for work and pensions have put into the back to work plan we know that get people into work can have enormous benefit not just financially but importantly for their wellbeing the idea behind the back to work plan be that we do it by work with people to draw out their full potential and help they to lead healthy life 
 if she will review the provision of health service for people live with a ehlers danlos syndrome and b hypermobility spectrum disorder 
 we recognise that body wide symptom associate with ehlers danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorder can be disable and can affect all aspect of life general rheumatology service which support people with ehlers danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorder be locally commission by integrate care board which be well place to make decision accord to local need the major condition strategy will focus on group of condition include musculoskeletal disorder such as these syndrome and disorder 
 that be all very well but i do not think that will convince my constituent or the in people who suffer from that awful disease this wonderful talented group of people on the treasury bench obviously inhabit an alternate universe my gp say that these day there be no training or research and that we do not have the capacity to look into these thing people with eds have to be assess by uptrained gps but they be not there our gp and medical service be on their knee when will the minister wake up to that fact 
 with respect the hon gentleman be as wrong as usual nhs england be take forward work to improve the way in which service for rare disease be commission put patient voice at the centre of service delivery and ensure co ordinated access to specialist care treatment drug social care mental health and special educational support we will continue to work to improve service in this area 
 what step she be take to improve maternity service 
 since we have invest an additional £ a year to improve maternity neonatal care next year that figure will rise to £ that investment be lead to progress on outcome stillbirth have reduce by and neonatal mortality rate be down by 
 woman continue to be fail by maternity service across england as have be highlight by a string of scandal include east kent nottingham and morecambe bay the care quality commission ’s maternity inspection over the past year downgrade many maternity unit brand third of they as dangerously substandard and highlight shortage of staff among other problem what additional step be the minister take to ensure that a woman can go into maternity service know that she and her baby will come out alive and can she tell we whether the recommendation of the kirkup and ockenden review have be fully implement 
 the hon lady have touch on inquiry the ockenden inquiry cover the period from to the kirkup review cover the period from to and the morecambe bay inquiry cover the period from to so the labour government be also responsible for part of all those period 
 we be introduce radical change we be increase the number of midwife which be up since and the number of midwifery training place have increase by we have introduce the maternity disparity taskforce to improve outcome for those woman who face the poor outcome and have also introduce a maternity support programme for those trust that do badly in cqc inspections—32 trust be go through that improvement programme right now those be some of the thing we be do to improve maternity service 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group for birth trauma i recently commission a survey of mum across the uk via mumsnet on this issue i be shock to discover that in mother be not be offer a week gp check post birth that mean that many woman with physical injury or mental health problem be unfortunately not be diagnose or offer support which be very troubling will my hon friend include birth trauma in the future update to the woman ’s health strategy and ensure that all mum receive a post birth week check up   with their gp that check up must include both the physical and mental health of the mum not just focus on the baby 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend ’s work in this place she will be pleased to know that we be roll out perinatal pelvic health service in every part of england which should be in place by the end of march next year in addition we be roll out obstetric anal sphinct injury bundle which my hon friend raise in her debate on birth trauma those have the potential to reduce the number of tear by she be absolutely right to be drive this issue forward it will be cover in the woman ’s health strategy but we be not wait for the year we be already make progress in this place 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the care quality commission now say that almost third of england ’s maternity service be rat inadequate or require improvement in safety up from last year the government have be tell time and time again to recruit more midwife and to value midwife so that they do not want to leave the profession in the place as a result of ministerial failure mother especially those from black and ethnic minority group do not get the safe good quality maternity care that they deserve what be the minister ’s plan to properly improve maternity care 
 the hon lady may not have listen to my answer we have increase the number of midwife it be up since and increase the number of midwifery training place by we have also introduce a maternity support programme that be provide intensive support for the trust that be go through it the hon lady may want to speak to her ministerial colleague in wales where labour run the health service because healthcare inspectorate wales recently issue an immediate improvement notice to cardiff and vale university health board for its maternity service 
 we will have to go a bit fast 
 what step she be take to improve access to mental health service 
 we be improve mental health service transform they with an extra £ a year we have already see some improvement in the delivery of those change from give mental health service parity of esteem with physical service 
 the minister will know because it cover her constituency as well that the sussex partnership nhs foundation trust do vital work in mental health but there simply be not the resource and i be afraid that parrot about parity of esteem do not tackle the issue wait time be day for child and young people in her constituency and mine i recently speak to a mother in peacehaven whose son be wait for an   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis his performance at school be in rapid decline but because of the wait time he be not eligible for support in school via any education health and care plan to start to turn thing around what assurance can the minister give my constituent and indeed her constituent that the wait time for mental health will come down and that resource will be give to these partnership rather than just empty word 
 the hon member be absolutely right we know that in sussex we have high rate of mental health illness than in many other part of the country with a increase in sussex a&e attendance he might not be aware of they but multiple scheme be available in sussex health in mind be offer psychological support to those suffer stress and anxiety which can be self refer we have the sussex mental health crisis line now open which be access via the service we have mental health professional roll out the blue light triage service in sussex and we have the brighton and hove mental health rapid response service open to which anyone can refer themselves urgently perhaps if he look at some of the service provide locally he will be able to reassure his constituent 
 the minister mention the importance of parity of esteem and she be quite right but it be disappointing that the government have a manifesto commitment in and to reform the mental health act which they have not fulfil with no such bill in the king ’s speech would the minister agree with i that the issue that exist prior to in relation to the mental health act still exist today with the disproportionate number of black and minority ethnic people be section under that act and people with learn disability and autism keep in inappropriate setting can she give any encouragement to those of we who want to see that reform particularly in relation to the appointment of a mental health commissioner to oversee change to the act and to advocate for the parity of esteem that she be look for 
 it remain our intention to bring forward a mental health bill when parliamentary time allow we have the draft mental health bill which we have put through pre legislative scrutiny we be look at the report from the joint committee and will be respond to that shortly 
 what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of increase in the cost of live on mental health 
 we be acutely aware of the impact that the cost of living have on mental health which be why this conservative government spend over £ during the pandemic on protect people ’s job and over £ during the recent cost of living pressure to pay for their energy bill 
 the centre for mental health the british psychological society and other have raise serious concern about the uk government ’s new back to work plan warn that the increase threat of apply benefit sanction or coerce people into jobseeke will be detrimental to claimant struggle with their mental health do the minister share my concern about this and have she make any representation to her cabinet colleague about the mental health impact of these measure 
 that be the difference between the snp and the conservatives we have aspiration for people and we absolutely want to support people with mental health problem and illness to get into work they should have the same opportunity to get into work and not just to get a job but to get a good job and get a career if we look at its website mind support people get into work say that it be not just a source of income but provide a sense of identity and structure as well as support confidence and ambition 
 a recent study by magic breakfast and the british nutrition foundation find that eat a healthy breakfast can improve the nutritional intake of the most vulnerable child improve their physical and cognitive development and their mental health will my hon friend work with colleague in the department for education to consider expand school breakfast provision in order to reduce the health impact of child food insecurity 
 we want a more cross government approach to mental health provision and that be why in our suicide prevention strategy we be work with multiple department my hon friend ask about support for nutrition in school and i will certainly raise that with colleague in the department for education to see what more can be do 
 i welcome the secretary of state to her new role research by the mental health foundation find that the cost of living crisis have leave a of uk adult feel anxious more than a quarter feeling stress and almost in feeling hopeless what representation have the minister make to cabinet colleague regard the impact of the cost of live crisis on health outcome since she take up her post 
 i have outline some of the financial support that the government have give during covid and the cost of living pressure i also point to scheme that the treasury have roll out such as the breathing space programme which see enforcement action from creditor halt and interest freeze for people with problem debt who be experience mental health issue and cover a day period that be the sort of practical help that this government be give to people 
 we now move to topical question we be run late because question have be too long as have answer i often make this plea in any case member should not be read their question question be not mean to be read they be mean to be question can everybody please cut out those bit that say their constituency be   beautiful for example and just ask a question we all believe that our constituency be beautiful and none more so than mine 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 my priority as secretary of state be to reform our nhs and social care system to make it fast simple and fairer since my appointment we be make progress to make our system fast we have hit our manifesto target to recruit and retain more nurse for our nhs and to deliver more gp appointment achieve both commitment month ahead of time we have make an offer to health union that i hope will end the consultant strike which have disrupt care for the public and put a strain on staff to make our system simple we have announce pharmacy which will make it quick and easy for million of people to access healthcare on the high street to make our system fair we have agree a deal with pharmaceutical company that will save the nhs £ in medicine cost and give patient access to more life save treatment the nhs be of the reason i come into politics—[interruption i know labour members do not like to hear that but i look forward to work with patient and staff across the country—[interruption 
 order i do not need any help thank you the secretary of state have answer the question at length i be sure that mean she will answer the other question much more briefly 
 people with disability and serious health condition already have high living cost and the proposal in the work capability assessment activity and descriptor consultation will mean that if they be reassess they will lose £ a month i appreciate that the secretary of state be new to her role but will she commit as a priority to take this up and consult cabinet colleague to ensure that people who be disabled and have serious health condition be not push even far into dire poverty 
 as i say early careful thought have go into the announcement that be make in the autumn statement and of course i will work with the secretary of state and the chancellor to ensure that the commitment we already have to people live with disability be maintain and that we have their wellbeing at the heart of all our policy making 
 the secretary of state ’s predecessor take a strong interest in the death that take place in the essex mental health trust and a statutory inquiry be now take place will she meet i and our essex colleague and the family to discuss that important inquiry so that they can have justice for the love one they have lose

 last month the national institute for health and care excellence say that kaftrio orkambi and symkevi be effective treatment against cystic fibrosis but be too expensive to put on the nhs ’s list cf be a death sentence so what can the secretary of state do to make sure that this medication be put on the shelf to save thousand of life in the future

 i assume from the hon gentleman ’s question that he fully support our effort to get consultant back into hospital as well as junior doctor and doctor in training it be all very well to sit there comment but we on the government side of the house be work with doctor to try to help they look after the nhs for we all

 be the secretary of state consult about yesterday ’s announcement by the home secretary if she be do she agree with he that it will have no impact on overseas recruitment or do she hear the fear of care provider about its consequence 
 yes i be what be more we look carefully at the figure in relation to overseas care worker we be grateful to all international people who work in our nhs and our care system but we need to   tackle the migration rate which be too high the package present yesterday by the government be a thoughtful and careful to tackle legal migration

 in response to a write question that i submit i be tell that the department of health and social care hold no central datum for diagnosis and treatment of those with eat disorder and have no idea how many mental health nurse appointment be available in gp surgery despite all the funding do ministers agree that that be a disgrace 
 nhs england hold some of that datum central datum be of the thing that we be introduce right now to improve our access to datum it   make it difficult to plan service when we do not have that dataset but we be work to resolve that as quickly as we can

 give that obesity now cost the nhs and our economy much more than smoking why do the secretary of state support a total ban on smoking but think that measure to tackle obesity be nannyish 
 the right hon gentleman raise a completely artificial barrier smoking be totally preventable it be the cause of in cancer and death it be unbelievably appalling obesity be a complex area and that the government be focus on we need to tackle it but it be entirely different 
 would the health secretary please agree to meet i to discuss improve access to gps and dentist in bracknell forest and wokingham borough

 i apologise to   the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey   for keep he wait to ask his urgent question 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence to make a statement on uk military deployment to the middle east 
 since hamas ’s horrendous attack on israel on   october we have increase our military presence in the region this be to support contingency planning monitor the evolve situation and be ready to react and respond as the right hon gentleman will know i deploy a royal navy task group to the eastern mediterranean include rfa lyme bay and rfa argus merlin helicopter and a company of royal marines as a contingency measure hms diamond be sail through the red sea to provide maritime security hms lancaster be already in the middle east 
 this morning i provide a write ministerial statement notify the house that unarmed military surveillance flight will begin in support of hostage rescue the uk government have be work with partner across the region to secure the release of hostage include british national who have be kidnap i will move heaven and earth to bring our hostage home the uk ministry of defence will conduct surveillance flight over the eastern mediterranean include operate in airspace over israel and gaza the surveillance aircraft will be unmanned they do not have a combat role and will be task solely to locate hostage only information relate to hostage rescue will be pass to the relevant authority responsible for those rescue 
 the mod be work on land air and maritime route to deliver urgently need humanitarian aid raf flight carry over tonne of aid have land in egypt i be consider whether rfa argus and rfa lyme bay can support medical and humanitarian aid provision give that their original purpose be potentially to take non combatant out of the area the mod routinely deploy significant number of military personnel in the wide middle east for operation such as counter daesh training maritime security and other reason there be currently a force lay down across the region of nearly military personnel 
 later this week the chief of the defence staff and i be visit sovereign base area the republic of cyprus the occupied palestinian territories and israel i will of course report back to the house after that visit our objective include to demonstrate and reaffirm the uk ’s continue support for israel while continue to press for adherence to international humanitarian law to emphasise the importance the uk place on humanitarian aid reach gaza to facilitate a deep understanding of israel ’s plan next step in gaza now that the current pause have end and activity along the northern border and to reaffirm the united kingdom ’s continue belief in a state solution and support for a viable and sovereign palestinian state alongside a safe and secure israel 
 across the house we welcome last week ’s pause in fighting and we be all deeply concerned about its restarting it be a glimmer of light in the recent dark day to see hostage reunite with family   aid reach desperate palestinians and diplomacy extend the initial pause there can only be the long term settlement the secretary of state talk about if hamas can not carry out a terror attack again like that on   october but the military operation in north gaza can not be repeat in the same way in the south far too many innocent civilian have be kill as the us defence secretary say 
 you can only win in urban warfare by protect civilian 
 israel must take all step to protect civilian meet the duty of international law and secure flow of aid into gaza 
 i welcome the secretary of state to the dispatch box for his statement particularly as this week mark day in the job the uk have an important role to play to strengthen regional stability in the middle east that be why the leader of the opposition have meet and speak with leader in the region include from jordan palestine israel and qatar that be why the shadow foreign secretary my right hon friend   the member for tottenham mr lammy have visit the region twice in recent week and that be why we welcome the initial deployment of uk force on   october they will do the job with total professionalism and we thank they for that 
 since then however accord to an answer give to i by the secretary of state the total number of uk personnel have rise to at least and the escalation risk have rise as well how will the secretary of state ensure that uk surveillance flight support hostage rescue and not israeli operation how many british hostage remain in gaza how will the uk navy ship that the secretary of state have deploy protect commercial shipping route what action be the secretary of state take to boost protection for uk personnel especially those at joint ally basis what be he do to open up the maritime route for humanitarian aid that he have tell we about today finally how many more raf aid flight will take off this month to get much need aid into gaza as the winter cold set in 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question i should just say that unarmed but not necessarily unmanned aircraft initially the shadow r1 be take on the task of look for the hostage 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the information flow i can reassure the house that only the united kingdom will have the ability to provide that information and that be how we will ensure that it be use for the appropriate purpose he ask about the number of hostage the united kingdom have not confirm exact number partly because it be still unclear whether some may have die in the original   october   event or in subsequent event and whether some may be be hold we do not want to cause additional stress but we know that there be still british hostage be hold 
 the right hon gentleman ask about protect the ship they be of course extremely capable ship the last ship to be deploy hms diamond be capable of look after herself might say and we be benefit from a great deal of co operation with ally in the region to assist with that force protection the right hon gentleman also ask about british force in the wide region who may be in for example syria or iraq again we take their force protection very seriously as   the right hon gentleman will understand i can not go into operational specific but we keep it under constant review 
 lastly the right hon gentleman ask about humanitarian aid this country have provide £ worth of additional aid make available for palestinians and flight have take off so far member on both side of the house will realise that the problem be not just provide the aid but get it into gaza the rafah crossing present a considerable barrier to that for all sort of security reason i be actively look at different route and the right hon gentleman will understand that that be of the reason i be go to the region this week 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s answer include his confirmation that as have be report the shadow r1 be be deploy i note that the intention be to use a range of surveillance aircraft will the secretary of state tell we what other asset he be intend to use give the significant tasking the threat to shipping and the ongoing commitment to for example operation shader will he comment on what be be deprioritise to allow this mission to take place finally in view of the recent threat to the rivet joint aircraft i know that there be defensive aid suite on board will he confirm that due consideration be be give to the protection of crew give all the likely threat in the area and the presence of iran 
 my hon friend will know that we have a number of capability for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance the rivet joint which he mention have be involve in carry out mission elsewhere and as i think he hint have attract unprofessional behaviour from other air force we have the p-8 available as well along with the shadow r1 and other exactly which aircraft and machinery perform these role will depend on operational circumstance but i can confirm that we have not have to pull resource away from other urgent work to provide this cover 
 it be important to repeat the denunciation of the death cult know as hamas give the war of attrition that be now take place in south gaza let i reiterate from the snp bench the call for an immediate ceasefire because i be afraid that a pause will not suffice the view from here at least be that without a ceasefire we will see yet another graveyard from which fundamentalism will rise 
 let i ask a specific question the secretary of state mention reconnaissance mission look rightfully for uk citizen be hold by hamas do he agree that any information come out of those reconnaissance mission that see illegal activity under international law should be hand over to the international criminal court for its ongoing investigation into the operation in gaza 
 the hon gentleman be right to stress the abominable disgraceful disgusting behaviour of hamas he call for a permanent ceasefire i suggest that that would be a heck of a lot easy if hamas release the hostage they be hold right now 
 as i stress early we will be in charge of the reconnaissance information which will focus exclusively on hostage recovery and will be pass only to the appropriate authority 
 those on both front benches seem to agree that hamas must not remain in control in gaza be any thought be give to how once they have be remove they can be prevent from come back there will need to be police and a moderate major arab neighbour of israel have say that a state solution can happen only if it be enforce will we have a hand in that enforcement if not how can it possibly happen 
 my right hon friend be an expert on these matter and he be right there have to be an international outcome to this and a solution i be afraid that in recent decade there have not be sufficient global focus on a state solution because it seem to be an unsolvable problem and it have slip into the background my right hon friend be also right to say that there must be a global coalition which will need to include arab state a huge amount of work be be undertake for what some people call the day after 
 may i ask a slightly wide question what be the government do specifically to prevent escalation and promote regional stability 
 i think that if on   october   we have project forward week and know what we know now we would have be very concerned about this lead to a widescale regional escalation it be a credit to the united kingdom and the professionalism of our service that after the united states we have deploy the most military assistance to the area i have be tell by a fair number of the arab state that they appreciate the deterrent that that have place on iran and its many proxy in the area certainly the fact that week later we have not see that expand be a credit to the british laydown 
 in recent week we have see houthi rebel attack on shipping in the red sea and back in june there be report of harassment of shipping in the strait of hormuz by the islamic revolutionary guard corps and iranian attempt to consolidate control of contested island what action be the uk take with our ally to protect freedom of navigation 
 my right hon friend be right we have see the houthi out of yemen try to take advantage of the situation and for the time in a very long period we have see somali pirate become involve that be why i have send hms diamond to the gulf and it be why hms lancaster be there as well let i reassure my right hon friend i be work very closely with our international partner on how we can dissuade people from engage in activity of this kind in what be international shipping water that include the   conversation that i have in the united states last week with my opposite number the american defence secretary lloyd austin 
 how can the secretary of state reassure i that the defence resource and attention now be focus on the middle east will not in any way reduce what we be able to commit to in support of our friend in ukraine 
 i hope the right hon gentleman will know of my personal interest in and dedication to ukraine i can absolutely reassure he that this be not defocuse that work in any way shape or form we be ensure that we continue to provide daily support to our ukrainian friend and i have a very close relationship with the ukrainian defence secretary umerov deputy prime minister kubrakov president zelensky and many other within their system 
 it be important that israel abide by the law of armed conflict but in that context i welcome the deployment of these asset not least to try to locate the british hostage the secretary of state will know that ultimately hamas and hezbollah be fund and train by iran so what discussion have he have with our new foreign secretary about when oh when we will finally declare that the islamic revolutionary guard corps should be ban 
 the irgc and its position be keep under constant review i know that my right hon friend the foreign secretary be constantly look at the region he have be out there already and will be weigh up the advantage of thing such as be able to have a post in country against what it would mean to carry out such a ban i also know that my right hon friend   the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois   will know how to take that up with the foreign secretary 
 far to the question from my hon friend   the member for west dunbartonshire martin docherty hughes with the international criminal court step up its work in gaza and the government again confirm their surveillance flight over gaza will the government hand over any and all evidence of war crime to the icc whether they be commit by hamas follow the   october   atrocity or in the ongoing massacre of gazan civilian particularly child by the israel defence forces 
 the easy way to bring this to an end as i hint early would be for hamas a terrorist organisation to release the hostage that they have to stop fire rocket into israel in a completely indiscriminate way which i think the whole house should condemn and to allow this thing to be bring to a close as i have say repeatedly it be important that israel should adhere to international humanitarian law i will be make that point publicly and have make that point all along to my israeli counterpart minister gallant i wonder why however the concern be not about the hostage who be be hold and how this situation could be bring to a conclusion much fast if they be release 
 i be pleased to hear that contingency planning be take place would the secretary of state consider task the aircraft carrier to the region as well behind hamas sit iran behind iran sit russia and behind russia sit china we be see new alliance form and the world ’s ability to deal with these challenge be be severely test as be our own armed force who be now increasingly overstretched what conversation be he have now with the chancellor about increase the defence spend in the budget in the spring 
 i will go for the last of my right hon friend ’s many good question this government be commit to as condition allow i know that he will be make his own representation to the chancellor i have previously talk about my own belief that we need to reach not just that but and high 
 it be reassure last week in answer to my question to hear the minister for armed forces   the right hon member for wells james heappey   tell we that uk surveillance flight would not involve the use of intelligence for target acquisition i also welcome the secretary of state talk today about how information that would be helpful to hostage recovery will be pass to the so call appropriate authority we have now hear question about the international criminal court will the uk pass any evidence that it gather of any breach of international humanitarian law by combatant in gaza to the icc 
 as the hon gentleman say that question have be ask and i have answer it a couple of time the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr flight be to look for british hostage and indeed other hostage that be the information that will be gather from those flight of course if we see anything else we would most certainly alert our partner but the purpose be to find our hostage and bring they home 
 we all ultimately want peace in the region and we all want to see humanitarian aid get through i welcome what my right hon friend have say about hms diamond join hms lancaster because do that not send a signal to iran that its support for terror group be not acceptable and must not continue and that through this action we will prevent further bloodshed in the region 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right it be important that we send that deterrent message and it be work i have call on all party not to think that this be an opportunity to get involve and cause further regional escalation and so far i be pleased to say that our deterrent have help to keep a lid on that 
 this conflict have already cost over palestinian civilian life and over israeli life the us defence secretary have say 
 you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat i have repeatedly make clear to israel ’s leader that protect civilian in gaza be both a moral responsibility and a strategic imperative 
 we know that regional escalation be a real threat what will the secretary of state be do to work with arab state and the us to apply pressure on the war party to bring an end to this war so that we do not see other country include our own and the us become engulf in a wide regional conflict 
 i be actually with lloyd austin the us defence secretary when he speak those word i believe and we agree entirely to make it absolutely clear israel need to comply with international humanitarian law it need to go out of its way to warn people when it go after the terrorist who use those people as human shield as a matter of routine the hon lady rightly ask what we be do with our arab partner in the region this will be my visit to the region and i speak to my arab counterpart all the time they have welcome our deterrent but they also want we to work with the international community on make sure that on the follow day when this be complete the solution be not leave to chance as it be before and that we be all work together to bring about a safe more peaceful middle east for israel and for gaza 
 i welcome the deployment of hms diamond and hms lancaster and the potential deployment of further ship but what discussion have my right hon friend have with our nato and eu partner about perhaps share the burden what progress have he make on that shadow r1 be a slow move specialist manned aircraft but it be unarmed in a region that have iranian proxy with quite good capability as well as syria and russian activity how confident be he that the advice he have receive have not put those servicemen in extreme harm ’s way 
 to clarify the record on the ship that my right hon friend mention hms lancaster be already there and hms diamond be there now and there be royal fleet auxiliary ship which i send right at the beginning of this conflict in answer to his broad question for security make sure that our personnel be keep safe be always at the heart of what we do i appreciate his concern and i know that he will understand that i can not go into the detail of how we ensure that protection but it be very much upmost in our mind wherever and whenever we deploy 
 yesterday i ask the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs   the hon member for aldershot leo docherty whether the uk government be in a position to contribute to the international criminal court ’s call for evidence in its investigation of potential breach of international humanitarian law he say 
 not at this stage but we will continue to take note ”—[official report   december vol c. 
 surely if the uk government be actively collect drone and surveillance image of the war zone the answer to that question should have be yes 
 i would have think that the no concern would be to locate the british hostage and   that be where the surveillance work will focus the fcdo will be well place to answer the hon gentleman ’s specific question 
 i be grateful to the defence secretary for confirm that the mod be currently rightly focus on regional security and containment but inasmuch as the uk have a responsibility to israel we also have a responsibility to the people of gaza can he therefore reassure i that his majesty ’s force will not become involved in any military action unless it be in direct support of british interest or british national 
 yes 
 the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis   mention future arrangement can the secretary of state give the house an assurance that there will be no deployment of british troop on the ground in gaza israel or the west bank without the approval of this house 
 there simply be not go to be a deployment so that will not be require 
 the houthis who be attack british and american cargo ship and hamas be basically side of the same coin they be iranian fund iranian train and of course iranian guide terrorist group that be publicly commit to the destruction of israel do the defence secretary agree that use uk military asset in support of our ally be crucial to deter further escalation none of we want further escalation 
 i particularly welcome the uk ’s deployment of drone to help locate hostage include british hostage in the day after   october the defence secretary say 
 no nation should stand alone in the face of such evil 
 will he repeat that crucial support today and in the difficult day ahead i thank he for his support 
 i clarify again that these be not necessarily only drone some will be pilot or will be unarmed my right hon and learn friend be absolutely right that no nation should stand alone it be easy to forget how this all begin when the hamas terrorist group think it be a plan to go into israel to butcher man woman and child cut off head and rape people 
 of the key to secure and sustain any ceasefire pende a wide political solution may be a un or un authorise peacekeeping or monitor presence on the ground for various reason historical and otherwise such a presence may have to be lead by the arab state do the secretary of state foresee any situation in which the mod could provide back up support to such a presence be any planning be do for such a scenario 
 as the hon gentleman can imagine and this be include in my conversation in the states last week there be a huge amount of international work about what happen afterwards and how it will be structure it be rather too soon i be afraid to predict   exactly how it will look but i do not think he be too far off the mark to think that this need to be a truly global response it will need to involve arab partner we will do whatever we can to support that but i see no circumstance in which british troop would be on the ground 
 can my right hon friend elaborate on the effort the government be make to de escalate the conflict in the hope that this would reduce civilian casualty 
 of course the single big thing that could happen to escalate this conflict would be for it to turn into a regional conflict i be think in particular of hezbollah on the northern border with lebanon as well as what could happen from syria from iranian back terrorist in iraq and of course from the houthis this could get bad in a variety of place which be why send ship and military for deterrent purpose have be so vital and have be our primary approach to prevent this conflict from turn into a big regional conflict 
 can the secretary of state tell we what role the raf base in cyprus be currently play in this situation be any military matériel be move through that base 
 the hon lady will know that the raf basis in cyprus be a very useful asset they be be use for example to provide support to our military in the area to answer her specific question i can assure she that we have provide no offensive military weapon to israel during this conflict in fact our military export to israel be quite low last year ’s figure be something like £ which be not a very significant amount of money during the conflict we would provide only defensive matériel or matériel that might help with the recovery of hostage 
 i applaud the decisive action of my right hon friend and the government to defend our strategic ally israel against hamas but the grim reality on the ground right now be that hamas continue to fire dozen of rocket at israeli town and city the iran back terror group have fire more than rocket since   october   and show no sign of stop their violent attack against israel will my right hon friend not only commit to continue his support for israel in defend itself against hamas but reassure the house that every possible step be be take to counter iran ’s link across the region which be cause instability 
 my hon friend make an excellent point that the conflict would be over immediately if hostage be release and hamas stop fire rocket into israel there would not be a cause for conflict indeed that be the policy israel follow for many year hop that even though rocket attack continue hamas would not take advantage of their own population by use they as human shield and building infrastructure under hospital school and home unfortunately that be not the hamas way that be what they have do and my hon friend be absolutely right to identify iran as be behind this whole evil business 
 the secretary of state need to be very clear with the house people have already die in gaza and have die in israel israel be clearly push the entire population southward if not out of the gaza strip altogether be britain involve in the military action that israel have take either physically or by provide information in support of those military activity i think the house need to be tell what be the long term aim of british military involvement in gaza 
 the simple answer be no and i hope that clear it up i be surprised to hear the right hon gentleman talk just about people be kill they be murder they be slaughter it be not just some coincidental thing i understand and share the concern about the requirement on israel on we and on everyone else to follow international humanitarian law when israel drop leaflet when it drop what it call a knock or a tap and do not bomb until afterwards when it call people to ask they to move when it issue map show where hamas have their tunnel and ask people to move away from they that be a far cry from what hamas do on   october when they go after man woman and child 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s statement on increase uk military deployment in the middle east thank to the armed force parliamentary scheme i have be privileged to meet some of the highly skilled raf and royal navy personnel who serve our country will my right hon friend join i in pay tribute to their exemplary professionalism and sense of duty as they undertake this extremely important work in the middle east not just on behalf of our country and people in the middle east but on behalf of every civilised democracy in the world 
 i absolutely join my hon friend they be the most remarkable people often operate in very difficult circumstance i be very much look forward to meet some of they in the region this week 
 we have see increase bombardment in southern gaza after the pause we be also see increase violence in the west bank support by extremist settler ministers what talk be the secretary of state have with israel to stop the increase in settler violence in the west bank 
 i certainly will not be pull my punch when i speak to my israeli counterpart the violence in the west bank be unacceptable and it must be control stop in fact none of that in any way shape or form separate we from our utter condemnation of how this whole thing be start in the place with hamas but the hon lady be right about that settler violence 
 medical aid for palestinians have warn that israel ’s indiscriminate bombing and siege be make it impossible to sustain human life in gaza with civilian displace and a lack of clean water and sanitation it be just a matter of time before a cholera outbreak kill many thousand more the secretary of state have be   unequivocal that the main purpose of surveillance be to help find hostage which be fine but for the time of ask if clear evidence be find of breach of humanitarian law will the uk government share that evidence with the international criminal court 
 the simple answer be that we will always follow international humanitarian law and its requirement i want to say with reference to the aid picture on the ground that of the primary reason for my visit this coming week be to work on ensure that the international community can get more aid into gaza and the united kingdom will be lead on that point 
 i very much thank the secretary of state and the government for the stance they have take it be that i and my constituent very much support as we do find a solution may i also thank the government for work tirelessly with partner abroad to bring home british national trap in gaza will the secretary of state perhaps provide assurance that surveillance flight will continue to fly over the eastern mediterranean as long as there be still risk to british national remain in gaza 
 i can certainly provide an assurance that we will always do whatever we be able to do in the circumstance during the recent pause for example part of the deal be that surveillance flight be not fly but we would always ensure that we be try to assist in particular give that this entire episode begin with something of a surveillance failure the uk have always be keen to help from the very early day of this conflict we have provide additional intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance over the eastern mediterranean what be new now be for that to be over gaza relate to the hostage specifically 
 it be absolutely right that innocent hostage should be release and that step should be take to release they it be absolutely right that those responsible for the crime of hamas be hold to account in international law but why be the secretary of state so reluctant to give a clear simple yes to the question whether the government will provide any evidence of war crime to the international criminal court be it because he have already see such evidence be it because israel have ask he to promise not to share such evidence what be the reason 
 i have already say that the united kingdom be bind by and would always observe international humanitarian law 
 i beg to move
