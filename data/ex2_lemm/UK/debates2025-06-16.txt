we have the most robust export licensing regime in the world and i be proud of that that be a matter that this house vote on just a few year ago under the last government and the right hon gentleman will know that we make a decision to restrict arm sale to israel that could be use in gaza i also refer he to the statement that i have make about iran ’s nuclear intent the work of the iaea the huge global concern and the un resolution that the uk do so much to secure last thursday 
 i call to mind the work of the iaea and refer my hon friend to the resolution of the un security council just last week all of which confirm iran ’s intent and its deception 
 order 
 that there be lay before this house an account of the contingencies fund show 
 a statement of financial position 
 a statement of cash flow and 
 note to the account together with the report of the comptroller and auditor general thereon.—(vicky foxcroft 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of standwithus uk ’s voice of students report on antisemitism on university campus 
 i thank the hon gentleman for highlight the report by standwithus uk antisemitism have no place in our lecture hall campus and university and no place in our society university must be place where all student feel safe and respected and be able to thrive a week ago today i bring together university vice chancellor and community leader to hear testimonial from jewish student and to discuss next step to ensure safe and more inclusive campus for all our student 
 what standwithus uk set out in its report into antisemitism and support for terrorism at british university be a source of national shame it be high time that we heed the stipulation in the international holocaust remembrance alliance ’s definition that so call anti zionism be nothing less that anti jewish racism i urge the secretary of state to reiterate that crucial point and ask whether she will commit to enact the report ’s important recommendation include introduce a framework of escalate financial penalty for university that fail to safeguard their jewish student from such hateful intolerance and extremism 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise that incredibly important issue that we as a government take extremely seriously because no student should be subject to antisemitism on university campus or in any place in our education system that be why we have commit £ of funding to address antisemitism in education half a pound of that have already be award to university jewish chaplaincy to support student welfare on university campus that run alongside the new condition of registration from the office for students that will ensure we protect student from harassment and discrimination 
 give my experience of work with the holocaust educational trust in school in mansfield i ask the secretary of state to confirm that the history of the holocaust will be teach in school follow the passage of the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill which the conservatives oppose 
 i can give that confirmation to my hon friend i join he in pay tribute to the holocaust educational trust for its work to shine a light on antisemitism at the moment in our country but also to ensure that we learn the lesson of history i say to my hon friend that yes we have give that undertaking ahead of the conclusion of the curriculum and assessment review to ensure that all our young people learn and understand the lesson of the holocaust which be more important now than be ever the case 
 what estimate she have make of the potential impact of increase in employer national insurance contribution on the number of redundancy in school 
 i be pleased to inform the house that the government be over a of the way to meet our plan for change milestone compare to last year we have over more teacher in school and over more in training whether on private school tax break or on teacher recruitment and retention the conservatives scaremongering be not come to fruition but they continue to talk down our education system to be disconnect from reality and to be wrong 
 may i update the minister who seem to be very complacent on this issue in harrow where i have be out to see many of our school since we pass the resignation date vacancy be not be fill and many staff feel threatened with be make redundant from our school that be not good for our child or for the education system all the school say that these issue be because of the national insurance hike that have take place which be penalise school budget will the minister take action to ensure that money be provide to enable school to recruit the staff that we need 
 there be absolutely no complacency on the government benches we see complacency over the past year and we be pick up the piece and fix the system we have commit significant funding to school we be provide mainstream school and high need setting with over £ to support they with increase in national insurance contribution at the spring budget we announce additional funding to the tune of £ per year by compare with we be support school to get on and improve education create excellent outcome for every child and we will continue to do so 
 i very much welcome the extra teacher that labour ’s plan for change have see in our school but school support staff be just as important as teacher in ensure the delivery of the well run school we have in ealing southall will the minister update the house on progress in reinstate the school support staff negotiating body which be abolish by the conservative party in 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to the fantastic work do in our school not only by teacher but by all school staff of the thing we do in government be to introduce   legislation to bring back the school support staff negotiating body to ensure that those staff be recognise for their vital work and that they be part of the conservation about term condition and pay that process be under way in parliament and we be in strong negotiation on a continuous basis through our improve education together plan which allow stakeholder to get around the table 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the last conservative government add extra teacher although we would never know it from the minister ’s answer there be few teacher in our school than last year labour promise more teacher but it be ignore the loss of primary school teacher because apparently they do not count the loss of teacher be not a coincidence the confederation of school trusts and the association of school and college leaders have show that school have be leave up to short in compensation for the national insurance rise will ministers finally admit that they break their promise to fully compensate school for that tax rise 
 i think the hon gentleman ’s math need a bit of work he will know as well as anybody that pupil number in primary be down and keep on fall yet recruit and retain expert teacher be crucial to this government ’s mission to break down the barrier to opportunity that be why we have commit to recruit additional expert teacher and we be target they at the sector in which they be most need it be not the government ’s fault that those on the opposition front bench do not seem to be able to add up or pay proper attention 
 if she will take step to stop the use of smartphone in school 
 if she will take step to stop the use of smartphone in school 
 mobile phone have no place in our school government guidance be clear that school should prohibit the use of device with smart technology throughout the school day if pupil fail to follow those rule school have the power to confiscate device to ensure that classroom be free from disruption 
 school with a smartphone ban be rat higher by ofsted and their student achieve well gcse result all the evidence show the benefit of ban smartphone in school but the government be simply issue non statutory guidance and pass the buck do the minister not understand the evidence do he need more evidence or do he not trust the government to be able to implement a ban on smartphone in school 
 i will take no lecture from the conservatives on this issue when they be in government they exclaim that the same guidance mean a consistent approach across school i have to ask if they be wrong then be they wrong now 
 mobile phone in classroom be link to disruptive and violent behaviour do the minister agree that mobile phone should be ban in all school so that child be focus on their education not glue to instagram and tiktok 
 i repeat my early answer legislation be not necessary because school already have the power to ban phone in school and the majority have choose to do so 
 from speak with former teaching colleague and local school leader i know that the impact that powerful school policy to restrict the use of smartphone and keep they out of school can have be really clear fantastic work have be do on that include by hitchin boy school in my constituency but sadly not all school be meet this high standard in ensure that they have robust and well enforce policy how can we ensure that we be spread this good practice to every school across the country would the minister love to visit hitchin boy school in my seat so that he can see at hand the fantastic work it be do 
 i think that show that school actually have the power to do this it be worth say that everyone include parent school and provider be responsible for ensure that child be aware of the importance of internet safety we encourage school to consult and to build on that support with parent to develop a policy that work in the context and that keep child and young people safe 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the secretary of state may dismiss ban smartphone in school as a gimmick but teacher health professional and parent be all call for action to reduce child ’s screen time every day we have new evidence of the harm that screen be do so why be the education secretary ignore that and press ahead with screen base assessment for child as young as from september do she accept that that be normalise screen time for young people which be the opposite of what we should be do 
 be that all that the right hon lady can go on after year the conservatives break the education system as i say guidance be already in place for school and the majority of school already have a ban on mobile phone use 
 what step she be take to help improve the school estate 
 what step her department be take to improve the quality of school building 
 this government be commit to sustained investment to improve the school estate in order to give child the good start in life we will increase annual capital investment for maintenance in real term rise from £ this financial year to around £ in over £ more than in that be on top of around £ per year over the next year to to continue the school rebuilding programme in over school we will go far by expand the programme provide long term certainty through to and we will set out detail in the forthcoming year infrastructure strategy 
 i be grateful to the minister for his answer i draw his attention to the process for get some of that funding battling brook be a small primary school in the heart of hinckley it be well love but it have have problem with of its classroom have damp and fall into disrepair so the school can not use they it apply to the condition improvement fund but be decline the school feel that the goalpost have be shift there be a month delay in the condition datum collection report so it be mark down and this all culminate in battling brook not get the funding it need will the minister look at this case and have a meeting with i so that i can go back to battling brook and make sure it get the funding it need to reopen its classroom in september for the primary school pupil of hinckley 
 the hon member have not be shy in lobby i on these issue but i would be very happy to meet he again he will know that the department provide advice and support on a case by case basis and i be happy to discuss these issue with he far 
 child at wreningham and brooke primary school be receive a class education from excellent teacher despite still be teach from portacabin due to a lack of investment by the previous government i thank the minister for already agree to meet i it would be rude if i do not extend the same invite to he so would he like to come and visit those amazing school 
 the government do not want any school to be leave behind include those serve rural community that be why we have invest significantly in capital funding this year with almost £ for norfolk county council to invest in improve its estate include wreningham and brooke primary school i look forward to meet my hon friend 
 small rural school in cumbria have some of the old building that be most in need of repair but also some of the most pressured budget will the minister consider set out a special budget aim at make sure we tackle repair backlog in small rural school such as those in my constituency 
 the hon member will know that ensure school and college get the resource and building they need be a key part of our mission to break down barrier to opportunity and ensure every young person can succeed and thrive i would be very happy to meet he to discuss these issue far 
 i thank the minister for have take the time to meet i and hear the case for saint benedict school to be rebuild to be more sustainable safe and secure the neighbour primary school st mary ’s be the green in the uk and an incredible example of what a rebuild can do to inspire young mind will the minister visit both school to see on the hand what have already be achieve in derby and on the other the amazing opportunity we have to achieve so much more 
 i be very pleased to meet my hon friend to discuss saint benedict which will benefit from transform building through the school rebuilding programme this government have commit to continue and expand that programme to improve the school estate and give child the good start in life i know that my hon friend be a real champion on these issue and i would be very happy to discuss they far 
 what step she be take to expand school base nursery 
 what step she be take to expand school base nursery 
 what step she be take to expand school base nursery 
 what step she be take to increase the number of school base nursery place 
 school base nursery be a key part of deliver on our plan for change by make high quality early year education more accessible and affordable so that every child get the good start in life at the spending review we announce almost £ for school base nursery on top of the £ already award to school the tories leave a childcare pledge without a plan but this labour government be deliver on promise make to family save work parent up to £ a year 
 the government have announce £ for the round of school to expand nursery provision support the roll out of the extended hour childcare offer in england but the public childcare now campaign point out that nearly third of the fund school be part of multi academy trust while we be fortunate not to have academy in wales concern remain that this model encourage privatisation reduce accessibility and undermine staff pay and condition contribute to great educational fragmentation what assurance can the minister offer that expand entitlement without invest in public infrastructure will not exacerbate these issue 
 i be delighted that so many academy be take part in our school nursery programme academy drive innovation across our system and be an important part of the system we have of course it be the last labour government who bring about the academy programme to drive up performance in our school and to make sure that all our child get a brilliant education sadly we know that after year of the tories far too many child include in our most disadvantaged community do not get the education they deserve that be why our school white paper later this year will make it a reality once and for all that they do 
 swallow dell primary in welwyn garden city be a fantastic school i have have the privilege of meet the leadership team who be ambitious for every single child they have a state nursery as part of the school but they be seek to expand and unfortunately their bid be reject in the last round i be passionate and hopeful that this school might be able to benefit from the £ of additional funding not least because in child attend swallow dell be eligible for free school meal my right hon friend know my constituency well and she be welcome to visit i hope that she will agree to a meeting to talk about swallow dell ’s bid for future funding 
 i join my hon friend in pay tribute to the workforce at swallow dell for everything they be do to make sure our child get a brilliant start in life i be sorry that they be not successful in the phase there be lot of demand and that be why i be delighted that the spending review give £ to ensure that we can make further progress towards our manifesto commitment i would be delighted to discuss it far with he 
 the conservatives let down work parent by not have a plan for their pledge i be proud of how this labour government have deliver to provide work family with hour of government fund childcare and funding for new school base nursery include at keresley newland primary academy in bedworth which i look forward to visit in the autumn i hope that the secretary of state will be able to join i can she outline the role that school base nursery will play in ramp up to the hour of government fund childcare this september put £ back in the pocket of hard work family across my constituency of north warwickshire and bedworth 
 i will certainly do my good to visit keresley newland and i be delighted that it be take part in our school base nursery programme we be determined to make sure that every child get the good start in life we know that the early year be crucial and that be why we have set an ambitious target of make sure that a record number of child at the end of the early year foundation stage be ready for the next step on their journey through the school system the last government make all kind of promise to parent but they do not fund they in fact they leave behind a huge black hole in the public finance interruption   the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott   should know that well than most because she be in the treasury 
 i recently visit the excellent matchborough school in my redditch constituency to meet headteacher lynn briers it be select as of the school in the country to receive substantial funding to transform unused classroom into much need nursery space i see at hand the difference that that funding will make can i therefore cheekily ask the secretary of state to confirm when the next round of funding will be available so that we can deliver even more of these excellent project to support school and family in redditch 
 it be because we know the benefit that primary base nursery can bring often work with the private voluntary and independent sector that we be determined to move as fast as we can to deliver the next phase i look forward to discuss that far with my hon friend i be delighted that family in redditch and right across the country will benefit from the expansion of free school meal eligibility to all family in receipt of universal credit lift child out of poverty and put money back in the pocket of parent 
 do the secretary of state monitor the number of private nursery closure if so can she tell we how many have close since the budget 
 yes we continue to keep that under review especially ahead of the further expansion of childcare in september the figure will be publish in the usual way and we will make sure that we have the workforce there to deliver on the commitment that have be make i say to the hon lady that in addition to almost double the early year pupil premium we put in place a £ expansion grant to make sure that ahead of the further roll out in september all our early year setting can deliver the place that be need 
 in my constituency there be more than active case involve child with special educational need many of which involve education health and care plan that be either deny or issue in such a poor state that they contain the wrong name and describe the wrong condition and therefore offer completely inappropriate package of support give that surrey county council have the high number of tribunal case against it every year most of which be lose may i ask whether the secretary of state intend to reduce the right associate with ehcp and whether she will do what so many parent ask i about and launch an immediate investigation into the council and its compliance with its legal obligation 
 the hon gentleman have raise a number of important question i will certainly look into the issue relate to surrey that we have discuss previously and will then come back to he as for support for child with special educational need and disability he have make the case for reform very precisely the current system be simply not work and the government be determined to ensure that child get more timely early support and that we have a system that be base much more on need as part of the process lead to the school white paper that will come later in the year i be engage with parent campaigner and other and i would be more than happy to discuss the matter far with liberal democrat colleague in order to understand their concern 
 this morning in my constituency i meet the chief executive of the early years alliance its laindon nursery be face closure not because of fall demand but because it be be hammer by the national insurance tax rise how can the secretary of state talk about expand provision when nursery after nursery in my constituency and across the country be be push over a cliff edge by this labour government 
 i too recently meet the chief executive of the early years alliance and i will always be open to discuss the challenge face by the sector but let i convey to the right hon gentleman the point that i make to the chief executive we be invest £ in early year education as well as almost double the early year pupil premium and provide a £ expansion grant to support setting ahead of a further roll out in september the right hon gentleman and the conservative party make a load of promise to parent at the time of the last general election but they do not fund they they do not ensure that the workforce would be there and they leave we with the black hole in the public finance that this government be turn around 
 in the last couple of month i have be speak to lot of nursery provider across my constituency about these issue and the thing that come up again and again be small business rate relief the secretary of state ’s department have already reply say that nursery can claim the relief but a nursery have to have few than child to qualify and the average number in my constituency be those nursery be not eligible and the national insurance and consumable change be cripple they so they be now consider not take on government fund child what should they do 
 i know that the under secretary of state for education my hon friend   the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan have be in touch with the hon lady recently to discuss this matter far and i personally will happily look far into the case that she have raise we be invest record sum in early year education and work with the sector to deliver the place that be need that be a big challenge because the last tory government do not leave behind a plan to deliver those place 
 what step she be take to support child with special educational need and disability who do not have an education health and care plan 
 parent right across the country know that the tories leave behind a send system that be in the word of the last tory education secretary lose lose lose labour will restore parent confidence with a support approach prioritise early intervention and inclusive support in mainstream school to address need before they escalate we will not be remove effective support but we will also expand school capacity to deliver consistent high quality provision to help child thrive with timely and effective support 
 in the last month i have visit nearly all the school in my constituency and wherever i have go i have ask whether people understand why the number of child with special educational need have be go through the roof i have receive various explanation such as lockdown diet social medium drug in pregnancy parenting increase awareness and over medicalisation be the department do any research on what be cause this phenomenon so that we can treat the cause and not just the symptom 
 my department and the department of health and social care be keen to understand some of the driver identify by the hon gentleman i know that he come to this discussion in good faith but some people include reform members of parliament sometimes do not approach it in a responsible way i think we need to tread with a great deal of care when we approach and discuss this subject not least because it be a welcome change in our society that we now well understand where child have additional need the challenge of course be that the hon gentleman ’s party do not put in place the support that be require both to identify and to support child with special educational need and disability 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 of the big challenge affect the delivery of support for child with special educational need and disability be the extent of local authority funding deficit they be currently deal with through the statutory override which allow local authority to set a balanced budget without account for their send deficit give that the statutory override expire in march do the secretary of state agree that a white paper in autumn provide far too little time for the government to implement meaningful change without extend the override far and when do she expect local authority to be able to have the certainty that they need to plan for the come financial year 
 i agree that in addition to long term reform which the white paper will deliver it be imperative that we take action now in order to make sure that the school system well cater for child with a wide range of need that be why we have invest £ to support council to create more specialist provision in mainstream school i have see some fantastic example right across the country and we need to see more on the precise question about the statutory override we want to make sure that council be well support through the process and we will set out our position very soon 
 of the good way to support autistic child in school be for teacher to go through mandatory training and to understand well the challenge that face by neurodiverse people how be the neurodivergent taskforce progressing and will the government bring in mandatory training for new teacher 
 we be introduce more training on send for new entrant to the profession that will take effect from september but there be more that we need to do include support teacher and staff   already work in our school that be part of the work that the group have under way and we will set out more through the white paper i welcome the right hon gentleman ’s interest in the issue i know he care very much about make sure that all child include those who be neurodivergent have the support that they need to thrive which be what this government be determined to deliver 
 i thank the secretary of state for her comment about the need to address the topic of send with great sensitivity as we risk stigmatise entire family and generation who be affect so adversely by this issue 
 in rural constituency like suffolk coastal the send crisis be incredibly severe and acute for many reason be the secretary of state look at the decline in population that we face in many of our rural primary school and at how that extra capacity could be a huge resource and opportunity in tackle the send crisis 
 i agree that in area where we be see space opening up in the school estate it be allow we to do thing like open more school base nursery it also provide we with the opportunity to deliver more specialist provision in mainstream school i have see some brilliant example right across the country of where that can be deliver i have also see brilliant example that involve the mainstream sector work together with the specialist sector to improve training for staff in order to improve provision overall this be a big challenge that many member from across the house want to see put in a much well place we will all have hear anguished tale from parent who have have to fight incredibly hard for the support that their child need alongside that we will all have hear that many staff in our school feel that they currently lack the training and support they need to ensure that all child be able to thrive and this government be determined to change that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 ask whether the government be plan to restrict ehcp so that they apply only to child in special school the government ’s strategic adviser on send christine lenehan recently say 
 i think to be honest that ’s the conversation we ’re in the middle of 
 be she correct to say that ministers be consider that or not 
 we do need to think differently about the system that we have inherit from the conservative party that member from across the house recognise just be not work this be not about take away support for family or child it be about make sure that there be much early identification of need and that support be put in place much more rapidly include ahead of any formal diagnosis i urge the shadow minister to reflect and to show a bit more humility about the terrible state of what he and his party have leave behind a system that be adversarial and fail child and in which child with special educational need and disability do not get the excellent educational outcome that should be the right of every child in this country he should reflect on his total failure 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of change to funding for level apprenticeship on people age and over 
 apprenticeship start by young people collapse under the conservatives labour be rebalance the system towards young people to help they get on in life by back they and give they the skill they need to get job and grow our economy 
 over apprenticeship be be undertake in the health public service and care sector and nhs employers and many other have raise concern about the impact of the government policy to cease funding for level apprenticeship for those over the age of can the minister tell we what plan be in place to ensure that the people support all of we and all our constituent be give essential training and support more particularly what discussion have she have with the secretary of state for health and social care about the impact of this decision on our nhs 
 we be encourage more employer include the nhs to invest in upskille their staff who be over year old and to deliver level apprenticeship where they benefit those business and individual it will be for employer to determine the most appropriate training and there be other training opportunity available at level include non apprenticeship route our reform will support new training opportunity and up to foundation apprenticeship start apprenticeship start participation and achievement be all up under labour and we be continue to go much far 
 i welcome the government ’s plan to create those training opportunity for young people include these high level apprenticeship however we know that there be significant shortage of those able to provide training and mentorship with only of to year old employ do the minister agree that there be an opportunity to retrain old worker so they can pass on their experience to the next generation 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we continue to support and train adult and many adult with seniority in their profession will continue to offer excellent support mentoring internship and guidance to young apprentice the change we have put in place will enable apprenticeship opportunity to be rebalance towards young people and will create more opportunity for those enter the labour market 
 i call the shadow minister 
 minister recently announce that they be ax level apprenticeship strangely they make the announcement during recess and also strangely it be only the day after the announcement that they finally answer my parliamentary question from april reveal that they be make a cut in those apprenticeship this be   blow a huge hole in the nhs workforce plan lead to a shortfall of nurse if ministers will not listen to the many employer say that this will make it much more difficult for people who be not so well off to get into the profession will they at least rule out cut level apprenticeship next 
 i can reassure the shadow minister that level apprenticeship be a core part of our offer and we will continue to fund they i also say politely to he that we will take no lesson from liz truss ’s previous health minister that government leave our nhs on its knee and we be have to rebuild it from its foundation again 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the number of health visitor in england have reach an all time low with just remain and there be a forecast shortfall of community nurse by the department ’s own skills england sectoral report show that the health and social care sector face the high vacancy rate at have there be any specific assessment of how remove level apprenticeship funding for those over will impact the pipeline of specialist community public health nurse into critical shortage role and be skills england work with the department of health on nhs workforce planning 
 skills england be take a pivotal and active role also of the worker in critical demand occupation which include the nhs the majority require a qualification low than degree level we be rebalancing opportunity towards young people whose rate of apprenticeship start have fall more dramatically than the overall decline over the last decade to create more opportunity for young people we will need to prioritise public funding towards those at the start of their work career and at the low apprenticeship level rather than those who be already in work with high level of prior learning or qualification 
 what recent assessment her department have make of the adequacy of outdoor education provision in the national curriculum 
 it be important for young people to enjoy the benefit of spend time in nature as part of a balanced curriculum beyond the curriculum the department be also work on an enrichment framework to support school in develop their offer which include a variety of outdoor education opportunity our national education nature park initiative also aim to support young people ’s wellbee and develop skill for the future 
 learn in the outdoors allow child and young people to build their confidence and push their boundary in a safe but challenging environment yet all too often young people from more deprived community include in my constituency do not have access to opportunity such as the duke of edinburgh ’s award will the minister meet i to discuss what more   can be do to support school in roll out the duke of edinburgh ’s award across bolton blackrod horwich and westhoughton 
 i join my hon friend in recognise the value of outdoor pursuit and the value of the duke of edinburgh ’s award which i benefit from take part in myself when i be at school the department have fund school in area of high deprivation to start offer the award and the department for culture media and sport be provide funding of a furth £ this financial year to extend the scheme my hon friend be of course keen to ensure that his constituent benefit and i would be delighted to meet he to discuss that far 
 i thank the minister very much for her answer worryingly obesity level be predict to rise between and in the next to year to combat that physical education be important as be the government look at child ’s diet at school those thing can address obesity so i be keen to hear the minister ’s thought on they 
 i agree with the hon gentleman we want all school to offer a broad and balanced curriculum include outdoor activity sport pe and physical activity and to ensure that every child can benefit that be why we be legislate to ensure that the national curriculum apply to all school through the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill 
 what step she be take to develop a send strategy 
 colleague across the house have already hear today about the lose lose lose system that we inherit from the conservatives improve the special educational need and disability system be a priority we be work to improve outcome for all child parent should not have to fight for support for their child we will be set out further detail in our school white paper in the autumn 
 give the sharp rise in diagnosis in york of child with send we have establish a send focus family hub we be also review other service i be particularly concerned about the culture within school we need nurture and inclusive education so that we have a therapeutic learning environment will the minister say what she be do to ensure that school local authority and other can feed into the white paper to share good practice and raise concern 
 i know that my hon friend care very deeply about this issue i can reassure she that we be actively collaborate with sector parent and expert on how we drive forward our send reform that include work closely with dame christine lenehan our strategic adviser on send and tom rees who lead the expert advisory group on inclusion change we make will focus on improve support for child and parent end that fight for support and protect exist provision we be listen very closely as we develop the plan 
 it be rare but very encouraging when a constituent come into a surgery with some solution a couple of month ago elizabeth cordle come into my surgery to talk about corefulness which be a series of short simple evidence base exercise programme to mature essential movement skill and help improve a child ’s readiness to learn and break down barrier to learn she be uncertain on how exactly it could be apply to assist with send but she be absolutely clear that through the national roll out that she be lead it have enormous potential will the minister to engage with i and elizabeth so that as the strategy be be develop we can examine whether that programme have a wide application 
 i agree that we need to take a constructive and collaborative approach in how we improve outcome for all child and intervene in child ’s life to ensure their need be meet at the early stage possible we will support school to do that in any way we can i would be more than happy to engage with the right hon gentleman on his constructive suggestion 
 what step she be take to reduce the time take for the adoption of child in foster care 
 where adoption be the right option for child it need to happen without delay and early permanence placement be a crucial way to offer child stability labour believe that child grow up in our country deserve the good start in life which be why we have provide £ in funding for adoption england to promote the practice the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill represent the big overhaul of child ’s social care in a generation and it be a shame that opposition members oppose it 
 i thank the minister for that response as an adoptive parent and a foster carer i know the transformative effect that early permanence can have on the life of child in care it be not right for every child or for every parent but adoption agency could make much wide use of it would the minister be willing to meet i and adoption charity to discuss how we can maximise the benefit of early permanence 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important topic he be a champion for child in cannock chase i agree that we should continue to promote early permanence adoption england have publish national standard to promote and shape early permanence practice across the country i regularly meet the organisation my hon friend have mention but i be more than happy to meet he too 
 adoptive parent right across my constituency be rightly concerned about the impact of labour ’s recent cut to the adoption and special guardianship support fund follow last week ’s spending review what hope can be offer to   family in my constituency and up and down the country who need the additional support that have be take away under those cut 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and for the concern she have express the adoption and special guardianship support fund have not be cut demand be ever increase and we have choose an approach to manage tight resource in the face of increase demand for support the adoption and special guardianship support fund still enable those eligible to access a significant package of therapeutic support tailor to meet their individual need 
 what step she be take to improve mental health support in school 
 what step she be take to improve mental health support in school 
 this government be commit to break down the barrier to opportunity which be why we be provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school and expand mental health support team so that every child can access early support before problem escalate 
 in the stroud area school be now teach mental health aid to year old many student have receive a form of qualification which they can use for application to job and university at rednock school these student be wear coloured lanyard so that other student can recognise they and ask they for help with their mental health would the minister support and extend this innovative scheme 
 i be happy to hear about the successful project in my hon friend ’s constituency and i be interested to learn more as we share further detail separately to support education staff the department provide a range of guidance and practical resource on promote and support pupil mental health and wellbeing 
 the brilliant school in my constituency know that good mental health be the foundation for pupil enjoy school fulfil their potential and get ready for life in addition to roll out mental health support for nearly a more young people this year will the minister confirm that this government will ensure that every child who need mental health support will get it by the end of this parliament 
 i agree with my hon friend but would add that it be not just see through the expansion of mental health support team with an extra £ in government funding this year the government be transform mental health service for child in reading west and mid berkshire and across the country hire more staff deliver more talk therapy and get waiting list down through our plan for change so that child can have the good possible start in life 
 what be the principal difference between this government ’s groundbreake plan to introduce mental health support team to school and the previous government ’ already in progress programme to deliver mental health support team to school as i like this minister mr speaker let i give he a hint this have be a rhetorical question 
 the difference be that we be deliver it to every school in our country to make sure that every child can succeed and thrive 
 my constituent john clifton chair the west sussex parent carer forum last week john write to i and all west sussex mps outline a number of the forum ’s concern include the provision of mental health support for child who have special educational need and be neurodiverse how will the minister ensure that the support that will be provide be inclusive for all child regardless of their need 
 the secretary of state have recently meet the parent carer forum to discuss these issue and will continue to do so we be committed to introduce more mental health support worker across the nhs and create youth mental health hub in all community 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 last week ’s spending review be about invest in britain ’s renewal and invest in excellence for every child so that background will not determine what they can go on to achieve through our settlement we will continue to make high quality early year education more accessible and affordable we will rebuild our crumble school estate and we will improve outcome for child with special educational need and disability with our support approach we will also continue our overhaul of child ’s social care open up training opportunity for young people to get great job in grow industry crucially we will lift child out of poverty through an historic expansion of free school meal to cover all family in receipt of universal credit it will save parent nearly £ per child per year that be the difference that a labour government make 
 i recently meet young people from the west yorkshire youth collective they tell i that funding for work experience opportunity for those age between and have reduce in recent year particularly in science technology engineering and mathematic and the art what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that young people particularly those from low income background can access the opportunity that they need to succeed 
 my hon friend be right to highlight this important area as she will know our manifesto commit we to expand work experience and career guidance so that we can support young people into fulfilling job create opportunity and drive growth   our wide skill reform will also create training opportunity over the course of this parliament if my hon friend would like to share more detail of the discussion she mention i would look carefully at they 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 it be a pleasure to welcome my old primary school teacher mrs case to the chamber today i hope we all remain on our good behaviour my question be very simple do the education secretary believe that primary school teacher be indeed teacher 
 i join the right hon lady in pay tribute to her teacher who join we today we all know that a brilliant teacher and the contribution that they make can always stay with we i be slightly perplex by the right hon lady ’s question she be obviously right but after year of tory failure many of our teacher be sadly have to pick up the piece of wide societal challenge whether that be too many family be in temporary accommodation or the grow number of child in poverty we be determine as a government to turn that around 
 i be grateful for the confirmation that the education secretary do accept that primary school teacher be indeed teacher but why be she then say that they no long count towards her manifesto pledge to recruit more teacher be it because contrary to the department ’s social medium post teacher number be in fact go down not up 
 i do not know where the right hon lady have be but she certainly have not be pay attention we have be clear that we will make sure that we have more teacher in secondary and specialist education and in further education college this year alone we have few child in primary school and that be why we be focus our recruitment effort in area where we be see growth it be common sense it be this labour government who have deliver pay rise for teacher because we the labour party value our brilliant teacher 
 the work of fife college be essential in equip thousand of my constituent with skill for success do the minister share my deep concern at the real term cut that the snp scottish government be inflict on the college as they deprioritise fife in favour of glasgow edinburgh and aberdeen will she join i in urge they to think again 
 i agree with my hon friend that it be time for a new direction for scotland with scottish labour in england we be make over £ of additional investment per year in skill by to support young people into the industry of the future that be because we be unlock opportunity and drive growth through our plan for change 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 philip augar the chair of the previous review into post-18 education funding state recently in the financial times that a handful of university be receive secret bailout will the secretary of state confirm what emergency financial support the government have already provide to struggle institution and commit to inform parliament of any future emergency financial support for individual institution 
 it be this labour government ’s priority to ensure that our world lead university be put on a much more sustainable footing that be why we take the difficult but necessary decision to increase student fee and it be why we be reform the office for student to have a much sharp focus on financial regulation and sustainability we together with the office for students continue to keep under review any institution that may face difficulty but the hon member will appreciate that these sensitive issue be well deal with properly and seriously through the office for students 
 in rossendale and darwen the valley leadership academy be a vital school serve some of our most disadvantaged community yet it be recently identify as a stuck school follow successive require improvement ofsted assessment the staff and leadership at the school be work incredibly hard to drive improvement and we be start to see positive sign will the minister therefore please update i on what labour be do to support they 
 labour be deliver a new era of high and rise school standard because we know that when standard slip it be disadvantaged child who suffer and we will not let that happen that be why labour ’s regional improvement for standard and excellence team be spearhead a strong fast system prioritise stuck school send in adviser with a prove track record of turn school around and back that up with up to £ 
 order 
 may i invite the secretary of state to come and visit the outstanding market field special school in my constituency which be rebuild and dramatically expand under the conservative i have be listen to what she have be say about expand special need provision will she give an assurance that the number and capacity of special school will continue to be expand and that we will not return to the fail policy of the previous labour government 
 i assure the hon gentleman that we will ensure that we have the right number of specialist placement in the part of the country where they be need our capital budget in the spending review will allow we to do that but alongside that we need to ensure that we have more specialist provision in mainstream include partnership with the specialist sector to train and support the workforce to make that a reality 
 do the minister agree that plan to make all child in household in receipt of universal credit eligible for free school meal will build on the government ’s brilliant work to tackle pupil absence the incredible number i have hear mention about this academic year be few child persistently absent and extra day in school 
 i completely agree with my hon friend provide over half a child from the most disadvantaged background with a free nutritious lunch every school day will lead to high attainment improve behaviour and well outcome include on attendance mean that child can get the good possible education and a chance to succeed in life 
 although the department be provide some extra fund to meet the additional cost of nic in school those with a high number of send pupil such as all saint primary in maldon will still receive less than of the increase will the secretary of state look again at that aspect which be another disincentive for mainstream school take send pupil 
 in wide reform later this year through the school white paper include to the send system we will look at every way in which we can improve outcome for child include those with send that will include look at the funding mechanism we inherit from the conservative party 
 i set up the corby and east northants send roundtable to help seek solution to fix the broken system of the outcome of the discussion be the need to improve send provision in our mainstream school what be the minister do to engage with teacher to make school more inclusive and maximise the potential of every child 
 we be invest significantly to make mainstream school more inclusive for send student by strengthen our evidence of effective inclusive practice we be equip teacher with prove tool and strategy to deliver excellent inclusive education support by expert teaching and a world class curriculum we will set out more detail in our white paper in the autumn 
 scottish education be once the envy of the world but under the snp it be be destroy datum show that a quarter of year old in scotland be not achieve expect literacy level do the minister agree that the snp need to drop its weird obsession and get back to the basic of sort out scotland ’s education 
 it be only through deliver a labour government in scotland next year that we will get the change that the hon gentleman be seek i agree that scottish education use to be the envy of the world i spend many a long day speak to my grandfather about his experience of the scottish system but it be   only with a labour government in scotland that we will once again see the focus on standard that our disadvantaged young people badly need 
 early this month i open the launch pad a new send provision at sandhurst school and i be show around by ben who tell i how the launch pad have help he to access education as the government work at pace to fix the broken send system what be the minister ’s message for young people like ben 
 we know that there be lot of great example of mainstream school deliver specialist provision such as the my hon friend recently open enable child to achieve and thrive in mainstream school and provide excellent support to child with speech and language need we have allocate £ to support mainstream school to increase their send provision and we want to reassure his constituent that we will continue to prioritise that in our work 
 another private school queen margaret ’s school for girl in york have announce its closure month after the carrdus school in my constituency announce its closure over child have leave the private sector in this year which be more than time what the government expect do the minister believe that the impact assessment of the introduction of vat on private school be correct will she look again at the flawed case for it 
 around mainstream private school close each year the level of fee charge by private school be not a matter for the department it be a contractual matter between private school and parent 
 just in young people recall receive any financial education at school and those who do so often receive less than an hour per month while i welcome the government ’s children ’s wellbeing and schools bill which will require all school to teach financial literacy do the minister agree that the curriculum and assessment review give we an opportunity to go even far will she meet i to discuss how government industry and civil society can ensure that child in my constituency get this vital life skill 
 i absolutely agree with the importance of financial education we be look at the curriculum and assessment system and make sure that we take the advice of the independent review on these matter i would be more than happy give my hon friend ’s enthusiasm and parent enthusiasm for this subject to discuss it far with he 
 last week the chancellor commit £ over the next year to the school rebuilding programme hornsea school and language college in my constituency be in dire need of a full rebuild so can the secretary of state commit today to include it in the next tranche of rebuild if she need any persuading i would be delighted to invite she to make a short detour on her way back to sunderland and to come and have a look for herself 
 we have significantly increase investment to improve the condition of school or rebuild they ensure that school have the resource and building that they need be key to our plan for change if the hon member would like to write to i about that school i would be happy to update he on this matter 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group on british sign language i know that the thousand of bsl language speaker in this country be very supportive of the introduction of a new bsl gcse however i understand that progress on that have slightly stall so i would be grateful if the minister could provide an update on the roll out 
 the british sign language gcse be a key feature of our commitment to enhance the status of british sign language both in education and   in society ofqual be currently run a public consultation on its propose assessment arrangement and expect to confirm its decision on the qualification rule in autumn 
 in april i write to the minister for school standards about the angel hill free school which will provide desperately need place for child with send in my constituency i thank she for her response in which she say that we would get an update shortly i ask again when do she expect construction of the angel hill free school in rosehill to begin 
 i thank the hon member for raise this important project i can confirm that work at angel hill free school be expect to commence in september subject to the contract be award in august 
 with permission i will update the house on the audit the government commission from baroness casey on child sexual exploitation and grooming gang and on the action we be take to tackle this vile crime to put perpetrator behind bar and to provide the innocent victim of those crime with support and justice 
 the house will be aware that on friday man be find guilty of commit the most horrendous crime in rochdale between and they be convict of treat teenage girl as sex slave repeatedly rap they in filthy flat alleyways and warehouse the perpetrator include taxi driver and market trader of pakistani heritage and it have take year to bring they to justice i pay tribute to the incredible bravery of the woman who tell their story and fight for justice for all those year they should never have be let down for so long 
 the sexual exploitation of child by groom gang be of the most horrific crime child as young as ply with drug and alcohol be brutally rap by gang of man and disgracefully let down again and again by the authority that be mean to protect they and keep they safe these despicable crime have cause the most unimaginable harm to victim and survivor throughout their life and be a stain on our society 
 month ago i tell the house that our most important task be to stop perpetrator and put they behind bar i can report that that work be accelerate arrest and investigation be increase i ask police force in january to identify case involve grooming and child sexual exploitation allegation that have be close with no further action more than case have now be identify for formal review and i expect that figure to rise above in the come week 
 let i be clear perpetrator of these vile crime should be off our street behind bar pay the price for what they have do far rapid action be also under way to implement recommendation of past inquiry and review include the year independent inquiry into child abuse recommendation that have sit on the shelf for too long in the crime and policing bill we be introduce the long overdue mandatory reporting duty which i call for more than year ago as well as aggravate offence for groom offender so that their sentence match the severity of their crime 
 early this year i also commission baroness louise casey to undertake a rapid national audit of the nature scale and characteristic of gang base exploitation i specifically ask she to look at the issue of ethnicity and the cultural and social driver of this type of offend analysis that previously have never be do despite year of concern be raise i ask she to advise we on what further review investigation and action would be need to address the current and historical failure that she find 
 i tell parliament in january that i expect baroness casey to deliver the same kind of impactful and no holds bar report that she produce on rotherham in so that we never shy away from the reality of these   terrible crime i be grateful that louise and her team have do exactly that conduct a hugely wide range assessment in just month the finding of her audit be damn at its heart she identify a deep root failure to treat child as child and a continue failure to protect child and teenage girl from rape exploitation and serious violence and from the scar that last a lifetime she find too much fragmentation in the authority response too little sharing of information too much reliance on flawed datum too much denial too little justice too many criminal get off and too many victim be let down 
 the audit describe victim as young as often those in care or child with learning or physical disability be single out for groom precisely because of their vulnerability perpetrator still walk free because no join the dot or because the law end up protect they instead of the victim they have exploit and deep root institutional failure stretch back decade where organisation that should have protect child and punish offender look the other way baroness casey find that 
 blindness ignorance prejudice defensiveness and even good but misdirect intention 
 all play a part in that collective failure 
 on the key issue of ethnicity that i ask baroness casey to examine she have find continue failure to gather proper robust national datum despite concern be raise go back many year in the local datum examine from police force the audit identify clear evidence of over representation among suspect of asian and pakistani heritage man baroness casey refer to 
 example of organisation avoid the topic altogether for fear of appear racist or raise community tension 
 these finding be deeply disturbing but most disturbing of all as baroness casey make clear be the fact that too many of they be not new as her audit set out there have be year of report review inquiry and investigation into the appalling rape exploitation and violent crime against child detail over page of her report but too little have change we have lose more than a decade that must end now baroness casey set out recommendation for change and we will take action on all of they immediately because we can not afford more waste year 
 we will introduce new law to protect child and support victim so that they stop be blame for the appalling crime commit against they new major police operation to pursue perpetrator and put they behind bar a new national inquiry to direct local investigation and hold institution to account for past failure new ethnicity datum and research so that we face up to the fact on exploitation and abuse new action across child ’s social service and other agency to identify child at risk and further action to support child victim and tackle new form of exploitation and abuse online take together this will mark the big programme of work ever pursue to root out the scourge of grooming gang and child sexual exploitation 
 those vile perpetrator who have grow use to the authority look the other way must have no place to hide so let i spell out the next step that we be announce today baroness casey ’s recommendation be that we must see child as child she conclude   that too many grooming case have be drop or downgrade from rape to less charge because a to year old be perceive to have be in love with or consent to sex with the perpetrator so we will change the law to ensure that adult who engage in penetrative sex with a child under face the most serious charge of rape and we will work closely with the crown prosecution service and the police to ensure that there be safeguard for consensual teenage relationship we will change the law so that those convict for child prostitution offence while their rapist get off scot free will have their conviction disregard and their criminal record expunge 
 baroness casey ’s next recommendation be a national criminal investigation as i have set out arrest and investigation be rise but the audit recommend that we go far so i can announce that the police will launch a new national criminal operation into groom gang oversee by the national crime agency it will bring together for the time all arm of the police response and develop a rigorous new national operating model that all force across the country will be able to adopt ensure that groom gang be always treat as serious and organised crime and so that rapist who groom child whether their crime be commit decade ago or be still be commit today can end up behind bar 
 alongside justice there must also be accountability and action we have begin implement the recommendation from past inquiry include professor jay ’s independent inquiry and we have say that further inquiry be need to get accountability in local area i tell the house in january that i would undertake further work on how to ensure that those inquiry could get the evidence that they need to properly hold institution to account we have seek response from local council too we ask baroness casey to review those response as well as the arrangement and power use in past investigation and inquiry and to consider the good mean of get to the truth her report conclude that further local investigation be need but they should be direct and oversee by a national commission with statutory inquiry power we agree and we will set up a national inquiry to that effect 
 baroness casey be not recommend another overarch inquiry of the kind conduct by professor alexis jay she recommend that the inquiry be time limit and its purpose must be to challenge what the audit describe as continue denial resistance and legal wrangling among local agency we will set out further detail on the national inquiry in due course 
 i warn in january that the data collection we inherit from the previous government on ethnicity be completely inadequate the datum be collect on only of suspect baroness casey ’s audit confirm that ethnicity datum be not record for third of groom gang perpetrator and that the data be 
 not good enough to support any statement about the ethnicity of group base child sexual exploitation offender at the national level 
 i agree with that conclusion frankly it be ridiculous and help no that this basic information be not collect especially as there have be warning and    recommendation stretch back year about the woefully inadequate datum on perpetrator which prevent pattern of crime from be understand and tackle 
 the immediate change to police recording practice that i announce in january be start to improve the datum but we need to go much far baroness casey ’s audit examine local datum in police force area greater manchester west yorkshire and south yorkshire where high profile case involve pakistani heritage man have long be investigate and report she find there that the suspect of group base child sexual offence be disproportionately likely to be asian man she also find indication of disproportionality in serious case review 
 although much more robust national datum be need we can not and must not shy away from those finding as baroness casey say 
 ignore the issue not examine and expose they to the light allow the criminality and depravity of a minority of man to be use to marginalise whole community 
 the vast majority of people in our british asian and pakistani heritage community continue to be appal by these terrible crime and agree that the criminal minority of sick predator and perpetrator in every community must be deal with robustly by criminal law 
 baroness casey ’s review also identify prosecution and investigation into perpetrator who be white british european african or middle eastern just as alexis jay ’s inquiry conclude that all ethnicity and community be involve in appal child abuse crime so that there be accurate information to help tackle serious crime we will for the time make it a formal requirement to collect ethnicity and nationality datum in all case of child sexual abuse and exploitation we will also commission new research on the cultural and social driver of child sexual exploitation misogyny and violence against woman and girl as baroness casey have recommend 
 the audit ’s final group of recommendation be about the continue failure of agency that should be keep child safe to share vital information or act on clear sign of risk worryingly the audit find that although the number of report to the police of child sexual abuse and exploitation have go up the number of child sexual abuse case identify for protection plan by local child ’s service have fall to its low ever but no have be curious about why that be the audit also detail an abysmal failure to respond to year of recommendation and warning about the failing of inter agency co operation we will act at pace to deliver baroness casey ’s recommendation for mandatory information sharing between agency and for unique reference number for child build on work already be take forward by my right hon friend the education secretary my right hon friend the transport secretary will also work at pace to close loophole in taxi licensing law 
 i want to respond to other important issue identify by baroness casey in her report but on which she have not make specific recommendation on support for victim my right hon friend the health secretary will fund additional training for mental health staff in school on identify and support child and young people who have experience trauma exploitation and abuse baroness casey report that she come across case involve suspect who be asylum seeker we have ask her team to provide all the evidence they   find to the home office so that immigration enforcement can immediately pursue individual case with the police let i make it clear that those who groom child or commit sexual offence will not be grant asylum in the uk and we will do everything in our power to remove they i do not believe that the law we have inherit be strong enough so we be bring forward a change to the law so that anyone convict of sexual offence be exclude from the asylum system and deny refugee status we have already increase the removal of foreign national offender by since the election and we be draw up new arrangement to identify and remove those who have commit a much wide range of offence 
 finally baroness casey describe way in which pattern of groom gang child sexual exploitation be change and evidence that rape and sexual exploitation be take place in street gang and drug gang who combine criminal and sexual exploitation i do not believe that this kind of exploitation have be investigate sufficiently the report also describe sexual exploitation in modern slavery and traffic case most significantly of all it describe the huge increase in online grooming and horrendous online sexual exploitation and abuse include through the use of social medium app to build up relationship and lure child into physical abuse the audit quote a police expert who say 
 if rotherham be to happen again today it would start online 
 we be pass world lead law to target those who groom and exploit child online and invest in cutting edge technology to target the high harm offender but we need to do much more or the new scandal and shameful crime of the future will be miss 
 when the final report of alexis jay ’s year national inquiry be publish in october the then home secretary grant shapps issue a profound and formal public apology to the victim of child sexual abuse who be so badly let down over decade by different level of the state as shadow home secretary at the time i join he in that apology on behalf of the opposition and extend it to victim of child sexual exploitation too to the victim and survivor of sexual exploitation and grooming gang on behalf of this and past government and the many public authority that let you down i want to reiterate an unequivocal apology for the unimaginable pain and suffering that you have suffer and for the failure of our country ’s institution over decade to prevent that harm and keep you safe 
 but word be not enough victim and survivor need action the reform that i have set out today will be the strong action that any government have take to tackle child sexual exploitation there will be more police investigation more arrest a new inquiry change to the law to protect child and a fundamental overhaul of the way organisation work in order to support victim and put perpetrator behind bar but none of that will work unless everyone be part of it and everyone work together to keep our child safe i commend this statement to the house 
 hopefully the report will be available in the table office for those member who wish to see it the home secretary quite rightly take long than expect and i have no problem with that i say to the leader of the opposition and to the lib dems that it be available to they to do the same 
 i thank the home secretary for advance sight of the statement although when i listen to it i could not believe my ear it be as if this be the government ’s plan all along when we all know it be another u turn after month of pressure the prime minister have finally accept our call for a full statutory national inquiry into grooming gang and i welcome our finally reach this point we must remember that this be not a victory for politician especially not for the one like the home secretary and the prime minister who have to be drag to this position this be a victory for the survivor who have be call for this for year however i have be speak to many who do not have confidence that a government who ignore their concern will deliver 
 before i turn to the detail of the home secretary ’s statement i want to recognise the tireless work of those who refuse to let this issue be bury survivor like fiona goddard who bravely waive her anonymity the parent of survivor like marlon west who i speak to this morning maggie oliver whose courage in speak truth to power have be instrumental in bring we to this point the late andrew norfolk whose fearless journalism bring these crime to light baroness casey for her review and charlie peters who have consistently be a voice for the voiceless 
 the prime minister ’s handling of this scandal be an extraordinary failure of leadership his judgment have once again be find want since he become prime minister he and the home secretary dismiss call for an inquiry because they do not want to cause a stir they accuse those of we who demand justice for the victim of this scandal of jump on a far right bandwagon a claim that the prime minister ’s official spokesman restate this weekend shameful 
 time and again it have be leave to the conservatives to force this issue times—[interruption they can all mutter now but these labour mp vote against a national inquiry time the liberal democrats do not bother to vote at all asleep at the wheel labour mp vote against a reason amendment to the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill and in committee they vote against the bill at committee stage of the crime and policing bill—[interruption 
 order mr swallow i want you to set a good example this be a very serious statement and temper be run high but i certainly do not want to see you point shout and bawl in that way 
 mr speaker they can point and shout as much as they like they know the truth just as we on the conservative benches do times—[interruption i will repeat myself labour mp vote against the reason amendment to the child ’s bill in committee they vote against that bill and they vote against the crime and policing bill in committee they vote against a national inquiry and at prime minister ’s question the prime minister repeatedly rule out a national inquiry to the cheer of all the labour mp who be now pretend that they believe in an inquiry all along 
 no doubt in her response to i the home secretary will try to claim that the previous government do nothing a wholly false assertion that she should not   repeat today the conservative government take extensive action start with the original jay report commission in by the then home secretary theresa may a year later she commission the independent investigation into child sexual abuse and sajid javid commission ethnicity datum collection in it be wrong to claim as the home secretary do that ethnicity data collection have not be do i remind she that the foreign secretary criticise sajid javid at the time say that he be bring the office of home secretary into disrepute and that he be pander to the far right for do exactly what the home secretary say she will now do they should be ashamed of themselves 
 we accept all the recommendation make by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in except the recommendation to have a new cabinet minister which would not have make any difference at all to the victim of this scandal the home secretary claim that the recommendation sit on the shelf but let i be clear that we go far than those recommendation it be the conservatives who establish the grooming gang taskforce which support police force to make arrest for group base child sexual exploitation last year so do not tell i that we do nothing 
 it be vital that this inquiry be robust swift and above all independent 
 there be legitimate concern about institution investigate themselves especially as some of the most egregious case of institutional failure occur in labour control authority interruption labour members can moan as much as they like but the people out there believe that be why nothing have happen yet in greater manchester operation augusta be prematurely shut down in rotherham which have be under continuous labour control since we see repeat failure in telford where labour have predominantly hold power the current mp   the hon member for telford shaun davies initially reject call for an inquiry while serve as council leader 
 this inquiry must have tooth it must start with known hotspot such as bradford and rochdale and i commend my hon friend   the member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore   for his persistent advocacy on this issue we need clear commitment for example will the inquiry examine the role of ethnicity in these crime confront hard truth about potential cover up motivate by fear of appear racist interruption there be no point in labour members mutter the home secretary say it herself 
 i speak to the father of a survivor just this morning and he tell i that survivor need to have someone who be independent and who they can go to and trust it be no use they be force to speak to the same authority who ignore they in the place will this inquiry ensure that no whether police officer councillor or council official be beyond scrutiny 
 the government ’s approach to the casey review itself raise serious concern while the review ’s finding be crucial we as legislator be send here to make decision not to outsource the difficult one the prime minister have wait month for someone to take this decision for he that be the kind of dither and delay that the survivor complain about 
 we need answer to the following question the house deserve to know what change the prime minister ’s mind from think that this be dog whistle far right politic to something that he must do when exactly do baroness casey submit her finding to downing street and do the government request any change to her report do the home secretary agree that anyone in authority who deliberately cover up these disgusting crime should be prosecute for misconduct in public office and that those prosecution should happen alongside not after the inquiry we believe that anyone in the police local authority social service or even the cps who cover this up because they care more about so call community relation than about protect vulnerable girl as young as year old should be pursue 
 we welcome the home secretary ’s comment about perpetrator not be able to make asylum claim i remind she that we put forward an amendment to the border security asylum and immigration bill and she and all her colleague vote against that very measure do she now agree that the perpetrator should also not be able to make human right claim to avoid deportation and will she legislate to do that will the inquiry be conclude within year and will every of the town affect be cover include bradford which be still refuse to conduct an inquiry into this will those local inquiry have the power to summon witness or be that power only for the national inquiry most critically we need a clear timeline for conclusion and action the victim can not wait another decade for justice we should be able to do this in year 
 finally we do not need to commission a report to tell we what we already know will the home secretary apologise on behalf of herself the labour party and the prime minister for waste so much time and vote against this dismiss the concern of the survivor the house the british public and most importantly the many brave survivor deserve clear answer from a government of dither and delay 
 i do not think the leader of the opposition can have read the report and see the seriousness of its conclusion because it set out a timeline of failure from to repeat report and recommendation be not act on on child protection on police investigation on ethnicity datum on datum sharing and on support for victim for of those year her party be in government include year in which she be the minister for child and family then the minister for equality cover race and ethnicity issue and violence against woman and girl i do not hear she raise any of these issue until january this year she will know that the prime minister do not just raise they but act on they he bring the prosecution against groom gang and call for action to address ethnicity issue in she will also know that the safeguarding minister my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips and i have raise these issue repeatedly 
 the leader of the opposition refer to professor alexis jay ’s independent inquiry into child sexual abuse i call for that inquiry and strongly support it and we want it to work on a cross party basis we support its conclusion but the leader of the opposition ’s party do absolutely nothing to implement they time and again recommendation just sit on the shelf and it have take this government to bring forward the mandatory   duty to report she say that we should ensure that people who have engage in cover up be prosecute i agree which be why the labour party be change the law to make that possible so that cover up can not happen and people be hold to account 
 the leader of the opposition also know that in the vote she refer to what she want to do the amendment she table would have wreck the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill that bill include of baroness casey ’s recommendation to strengthen child protection recommendation that the leader of the opposition and her party refuse to introduce over year i be sorry that she choose not to join in the apology to victim and survivor for decade of failure in that apology be a cross party which if she really have victim interest and the national interest at heart it should be again 
 i listen with cold fury to what be come out of the mouth of the leader of the opposition because much of it be beneath contempt i commend the home secretary for her statement and for commission a fiercely independent figure such as louise casey to conduct this national audit without which we would not have have today ’s outcome 
 in rochdale we know all too well how many year it have take for victim to get the justice they deserve they have wait many many year to see these sick criminal lock up and put behind bar only last week we have more of these pervert lock up in rochdale which be a testament to the police and the prosecution who finally get those case together however the victim also want accountability for anyone in a position of authority as the home secretary have say anyone who find out about this or know about it and fail to act do she agree that no councillor from any political party no social worker no police officer no council officer and no ethnic group should hide from the fierce scrutiny of this national inquiry 
 my hon friend be right to raise the appalling case in his constituency where people be convict on friday he will also know that further criminal investigation be still ongoing it be shameful how long it have take to get justice for those victim i agree with he that no can hide from justice on this appalling issue on which victim and survivor have be let down for far too long i hope that support that aim will be a cross party process 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 child sexual abuse and exploitation be among the most abhorrent crime imaginable and we must all support every effort to deliver justice for victim and prevent these vile act from happen again it be of course right that the government follow the recommendation of baroness casey ’s report include a new national inquiry survivor must be at the heart of this process their voice experience and insight must shape both the inquiry and its outcome and i would welcome hear more from the home secretary about how she intend to ensure survivor be hear be respect and essentially be allow to build on their exist testimony without be ask to repeat themselves and relive their abuse again and again 
 the year inquiry into child sexual abuse chair by professor alexis jay deliver its final report in and the government at the time deliver none of its recommendation leave survivor wait for justice in her remark the home secretary mention of professor jay ’s recommendation be introduce through the crime and policing bill a mandatory reporting duty and aggravate offence for groom offender what do this new inquiry mean for the remain recommendation of professor jay will victim and survivor see all recommendation implement while the new inquiry be be carry out 
 any new inquiry must be more than symbolic it must be robust victim centre and capable of drive real change a duty of candour would require public official and authority to co operate fully with such an inquiry so it continue to be disappointing that the government have delay bring that provision forward i ask the home secretary plainly what be stop the government from introduce a duty of candour via a hillsborough law now 
 finally now that baroness casey have complete her review i welcome her appointment as chair of the independent commission into adult social care i trust that she will bring to that hugely important role the same determination to challenge injustice and to champion the voice of those too often leave unheard 
 the hon member make important point about the seriousness of this crime and she be right too that we need to continue to implement the recommendation of the overarch inquiry into child abuse the safeguarding minister update the house before easter on those recommendation and the action we be take forward on they i can tell the hon lady that in the home office measure be already well under way and we will continue to do that it be important that we do not simply have recommendation sit on shelf thing have to be implement 
 on the hillsborough law we be work at pace to get the detail right and to bring it before the house the hon lady will understand that it need to meet the expectation of the hillsborough family as well as be right for the house we will continue to work on the wide issue too in her foreword baroness casey say 
 if we ’d get this right year ago see these girl as child rap rather than wayward teenager or collaborator in their abuse collect ethnicity datum and acknowledge as a system that we do not do a good enough job then i doubt we ’d be in this place now 
 we lose a decade we can not lose another
