 small and medium sized bicycle manufacturer be important for our green growth ambition through the government ’s industrial and trade strategy we be back innovation sustainability and skill development to help business include cycle manufacturer to scale up so that they can compete globally and continue drive forward the uk ’s cycling economy 
 i too wish robert a happy next new adventure mr speaker and i wish her majesty the queen a happy birthday

 i associate myself with your statement mr speaker and with the comment of the hon lady 
 i recognise that there be concern about this issue among cycle manufacturer the hon lady may be aware that some anti dumping measure have be extend until but some have be lift as a result of the work of the trade remedies authority we be always happy to meet cycle manufacturer to discuss their concern whether it be with the hon lady or directly with industry i be very happy to ensure that such a meeting take place 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be not just cycle manufacturer that be have to pedal hard to survive under this government with business survey after business survey state that tax be the big worry for business will the minister take this opportunity to assure business that the chancellor will not be come back to burden they with more in her budget this autumn 
 i commend the hon lady for the humour in her question as she will recognise this be business and trade question time not treasury question time where tax measure be usually deal with but i be sure that the treasury will note her comment i should perhaps point she to recent survey of business confidence the lloyds bank business barometer point out that business confidence be at a year high i be sure she will be delight by that news 
 well except for the fact that the whole house will have hear that the government be not prepared to rule out saddle cycle manufacturer and other business with more taxis this autumn will the minister at the very least assure the house that he and his fellow business ministers be make representation to the treasury that business really can not take any more tax rise 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her suspicion that i have considerable influence with the treasury we be always in discussion with treasury colleague and indeed colleague across government about what more we can do to support business another indicator of improve business confidence be a survey by the american express business barometer which point out that almost quarter of small and medium sized enterprise boss be confident about the future again up from last year 
 what step he be take to support work family through the parental leave system 
 through our landmark employment rights bill we be make paternity leave and unpaid parental leave day right this align then with maternity and adoption leave but we be go far we have launch the parental leave review fulfil our manifesto commitment the review   will explore how the system can support work family and our modern economy it will assess the system against key goal support maternal health boost economic growth through increase labour market participation enable flexible balanced childcare choice and of course ensure the good start in life for our child 
 improve our paternity leave offer will be good for parent good for child and good for our economy i recently organise an event with labour colleague the union of shop distributive and allied workers and dad shift where we hear from tesco about the benefit that week of fully pay paternity leave have bring to its business as part of the parental leave review which i warmly welcome will the minister proactively reach out to business such as tesco that be lead the way on paternity leave 
 i thank my hon friend for his effort in this area and indeed for highlight the excellent work that some business be already do go far than the statutory minimum as we know when it come to support work parent every little help this review will be evidence base it will reflect and consider the view and experience of those who engage with the parental leave and pay system i encourage all business to contribute to the call for evidence which be launch early this month i can assure my hon friend that i plan to engage constructively with business include tesco and business representative throughout the period of the review 
 hugh ’s law would have bring in job protection and financial support for parent of child age between day and year and guarantee parental leave while those child be receive palliative care the government vote down an amendment last night to the employment rights bill that would have bring that in this campaign have be fight by ceri and frances menai davis and many government back bench mp have stand side by side with they through that campaign why have the minister turn his back on those parent and those child 
 we be not turn our back on parent or child we be actually have the big expansion in worker right and family friendly policy that we have see in a generation clearly we will not be able to satisfy every issue in this area but that be the point of the review we be look at the system in the round it need improve and modernise and that be what we intend to do

 i be delighted by the hugely positive response that the industrial strategy have receive it be a plan to lift every part of the country make it easy and quick to do business and to invest for north wales with its formidable prowess in advanced manufacturing   it be a very significant set of proposal the same be true for wales as a whole as i demonstrate on monday at port talbot at the groundbreaking of the new electric arc furnace which will get the enhance supercharger discount energy price 
 i totally agree with my right hon friend this government ’s industrial strategy back business in wales not just with word but with action and billion of pound of investment over the next decade in wrexham we be fortunate to have fantastic business such as kellogg ’s and hydro aluminium among other which have exciting ambition for high tech expansion barrier that need to be overcome be sufficient power supply to the industrial and trading estate where they be base will the secretary of state please update i on how the strategic site accelerator will support they in do so and the propose timeline for its implementation

 if he will suspend the export of uk produce f-35 component to israel 
 i be conscious of the hon member ’s long stand interest in these matter i can assure he that export of f-35 component directly to israel be already suspend where they be for use by israel and not for re export to other country 
 our strategic export licensing criterion state specifically that licence should not be grant where there be 
 a clear risk that the item might be use to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law 
 give that the court have send this question back to parliament do the minister accept that israel be commit breach of international humanitarian law do he accept that the export of f-35 component be aid in the commission of these wrongful act and if he maintain that we be not in breach of our own arm export law will he explain on the floor of this house the basis for how he think we be compliant with our own law 
 the f-35 programme be the large international collaborative defence programme in the world the hon gentleman refer to the recent high court judgment and as the high court itself note the uk can not make change to the f-35 programme unilaterally that require agreement across all the partner nation and the availability of a workable programme level change to isolate end user across thousand of different component 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the industrial strategy on teesside 
 my hon friend ’s area be of the most exciting investment location in the world in clean energy opportunity carbon capture and storage and offshore wind but also in creative and digital investment chemical production and steel specific intervention for the tees valley include recommit £ for its investment zone enhance support for the teesside freeport for clean energy industry and a lot of money for transport for city region fund of particular interest to business in his area will be the new british industrial competitiveness scheme which will reduce electricity cost by £ to £ per megawatt hour for many business in teesside 
 i be pleased that the government have be listen to we and back teesside business with serious investment i have be push for investment in clean power and advanced manufacturing last year the uk tech job report name middlesbrough as the uk ’s fast grow tech destination will ministers work with i to bring in investment in frontier technology such as artificial intelligence to our region as well 
 my hon friend and his colleague be incredible champion for bring investment into the area and i recognise and thank he for that support he be right to say that some of the perhaps more traditional industry though very exciting for the future be not just the only story in his area he have mention tech and the creative industry too and i would say they be huge opportunity specifically our investment in skill to make sure that there be a pipeline of talent in every part of the country be a formidable and significant contribution to deliver on those opportunity i look forward to continue to work with he on these issue 
 what recent step he have take to support postmaster seek redress for harm cause by faulty it system 
 by the end of last month approximately £ have be pay in total redress to almost claimant this represent a fourfold increase over the past month with more than victim receive compensation for the time we have   also commit to extend redress to family member as the house know there be still much leave to do and we be consider carefully the recommendation that sir wyn williams make last week in this regard 
 i thank the minister for his answer he will be aware of a northumberland constituent of mine who be a victim of the faulty horizon system lead to she lose her job and her business and become a victim of abuse in her own community despite my assistance my constituent remain without an outcome to her claim will the minister please look into this case and ensure that her claim be progress as quickly as possible so that she can receive justice 
 my hon friend describe just example of the terrible human impact that the post office scandal have have on many good people up and down our country who serve their community and who be treat unbelievably badly by the post office i will of course look into the case that my hon friend have raise we be determined to do more to help not just her constituent but all those who be still wait for compensation 
 i thank the minister and the government for all they be do in this area the frustration be that those who deserve compensation have be traumatise physically emotionally and financially have wait many year for the redress that they should be get there seem to be a delay for some who should be receive the money now indeed they be now be tell that it could be another year before they will receive any money i genuinely urge the minister and government to make sure that people get the money asap in other word let we get it do this year 
 i and i suspect the whole house share the hon gentleman ’s frustration there be many opportunity to stop the post office scandal and compensation should have be pay out to all the victim a long time ago we have quadruple the amount of compensation pay out in the past month and victim who have not receive compensation month ago have now do so be that good enough of course not there be a lot more to do and the recommendation that sir wyn williams make last week be helpful in that regard 
 what progress his department have make on implement recent trade agreement 
 the uk continue to make progress across its trade agreement programme to bring prosperity to community across the country on   june for the us we implement legislation create new quota for import of beef and ethanol and the us remove tariff on uk civilian aerospace good and reduce tariff on uk auto as agree in the uk us economic deal that we announce back in may 
 of the business that stand to benefit from the eu trade agreement be a butcher and deli in my constituency that import a lot of its product from spain at the moment its shelf be unfortunately half empty because its small spanish supplier effectively a man with a van say he simply can not cope with all the brexit form fill however he have say that he expect thing to get well from later this year thank to the government ’s deal with the eu which be great news will the minister set out what step be be take to implement the removal of the brexit red tape of sanitary and phytosanitary check include the likely timetable 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i express my regret that that business like so many across the country find itself bury in red tape as a consequence of the implementation of brexit by the conservative party there be technical aspect of our agreement with the european union that need to be work through but business across the country such as the butcher and deli he describe will be willing we on in that endeavour 
 when be a trade deal not a trade deal it have be week since the prime minister announce a deal to protect steel from us tariff and week since the secretary of state say that the india deal be sign seal and deliver will the secretary of state publish the detail of these important deal without delay before recess or will he apologise for mislead the house 
 order we do not accuse other member of mislead the house a little word before that—“inadvertently”—would support that question no doubt the hon member will wish to withdraw that 
 indicate assent 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i be struggle to keep up with the conservative party ’s position as to whether deal have be do as i recollect worker in jaguar land rover know exactly the difference that a labour government be make give the challenge they would have face with more than tariff have it not be for the work of the prime minister and the business secretary but that be only sector of the economy in relation to steel and aluminium of which the hon member speak we be continue to work with the united states to ensure that the agreement to remove tariff on uk steel and aluminium can be implement as soon as possible but we be unique in the level of tariff set compare with every other country in the world 
 may i thank the secretary of state for meet regularly with i and my colleague regard the challenge face the ceramics industry i look forward to continue to work with he to seek solution for the challenge we face what assessment have the department make of the potential impact of its trade strategy on british business and in particular the ceramics industry 
 i see that the general secretary of the gmb be focus on exactly those issue in relation to the ceramics industry this week and i applaud the   concern he have show for a key part of many local economy across the country i assure my hon friend that we have give regard to every sector of the uk economy when negotiate the trade deal secure by the government with the united states as we just discuss as well as with the european union and critically with india 
 the united kingdom internal market act be a restrictive piece of legislation that centralise power to the uk government and allow they to override the scottish parliament yesterday the labour government confirm they would not repeal or amend that tory act indeed the secretary of state for scotland previously say that the act be bad and damaging and undermine devolution and the business and trade secretary vote against it when in opposition will the business and trade secretary confirm whether he would vote against it again now do he agree with the secretary of state for scotland that this tory act be an attack on the integrity of the scottish parliament 
 well well well the grievance machine be be fire up again by the scottish national party even at the last business and trade question the reality be that the change make to the united kingdom internal market act be proportionate target and focus critically on support the many scottish business that contribute to the consultation i respectfully suggest to the hon gentleman that he should listen to scottish business which disproportionately benefit from the removal of barrier and the avoidance of new barrier go up in the critical single market that be the united kingdom 
 what step he be take to support high street sme 
 what step he be take to support high street business 
 what step he be take to support high street business 
 to breathe life back into britain ’s high street we be address antisocial behaviour and crime roll out banking hub stamp out late payment establish a licensing taskforce empower community to fill vacant property and reform the business rate system there be more to do and our forthcoming small and medium enterprise strategy will set out further step 
 warrington south be home to brilliant business such as gourmand an award win french café mamars a wonderful artisan bakery and deli hideout which serve the good piña colada in warrington apparently and the soon to open zak ’s shack a new parent and child focus café in stockton heath such business be the beat heart of our town build by local entrepreneur who serve the community they   love however set up cost business rate and other barrier make it hard for they to operate will the minister outline how the department specifically support the independent hospitality and food retail sector 
 my hon friend make warrington sound like a particularly attractive place for a business minister to visit so if she do not mind i will add that to the list of place that i be keen to visit independent business as she rightly say play an important role in support local growth and community cohesion we plan to introduce permanently low business rate for retail hospitality and leisure property with a rateable value of under £ and we have introduce a hospitality support scheme to co fund project that aim to help those furth from the job market into employment and to boost productivity i think that will help many of the business in her constituency 
 when i be out and about in my constituency i be always impressed by the dedication of staff and small business owner who bring our high street to life place such as blaydon ’s precinct and consett ’s middle street be at the heart of local pride and identity but after year of austerity and a cost of living crisis empty shop and the loss of vital amenity such as bank have take a toll especially in the north east what be the government do to support local business and revitalise high street such as those 
 before i have hear about the attraction of warrington i have hear about those of consett i be pleased to visit my hon friend ’s constituency and meet many of the great business there just before christmas 
 we have introduce measure to fill empty property include high street rental auction power for council which can free up space for new business we be also protect vital service on the high street through the roll out of banking hub with open so far this week we publish our green paper on the future of the post office which set out our plan to do even more to provide banking service on high street which again i hope will help to bring more footfall on to the high street and help business such as the one that she know only too well 
 in the last budget the government commit to a fair business rate system that protect the high street make sure online retailer pay a fair share of rate will help support business on the high street in sunderland will the minister update the house on the engagement and design work that his department be carry out so that that new fair system can be announce in the budget 
 the chancellor announce last year that from the next financial year we intend to introduce permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure property a permanent tax cut will ensure that those business will benefit from much need certainty and support treasury colleague have be engage business on their proposal for a fair business rate system the government plan to publish an interim report on their work and more detail will also be set out in the budget in the autumn 
 small independent business like kitchen croxley in my constituency have suggest that to counter this government ’s national insurance contribution increase they will need to serve cold coffee and replace staff with touchscreens just to afford to stay open what will the minister do to ensure that small business be encourage to grow rather than be punish for be entrepreneurial so that local bakery like kitchen croxley can keep serve we cake and coffee 
 we have take a range of measure to support business such as the the hon gentleman mention my right hon friend the secretary of state announce our plan for a business growth service to make it much easy for business to get the advice they need on how they can start up and scale up the chancellor set out in the spending review a third increase in the capacity of the british business bank which will make it a lot easy for business to access the finance they need to start up and scale up as many hospitality business continue to point out the significant crime and antisocial behaviour in town centre the extra police officer that we have recruit and our commitment to recruit still more will make it easy to bear down on shoplifting and other antisocial behaviour 
 labour lead west suffolk district council now charge cafés and restaurant £ for pavement licence for table and chair in front of their premise their justification for the cost be that the process for grant a pavement licence be more complex than it may initially appear as it involve a number of check with highway authority the police and counter terrorism adviser will the minister look at pavement licence as an example of where we can deregulate 
 the hon gentleman make an interesting point about what further measure we can take to bear down on the cost of regulation for small business it be reason the chancellor set up a licensing taskforce that have bring forward a series of recommendation and will shortly publish its conclusion which the government will respond to quickly we be absolutely determined to do what we can to bear down on the cost of regulation for sme 
 i refer the house to my registered interest as a small business owner retailer in my constituency include city centre retailer tell i that they be on their knee cripple by soar cost rise national insurance contribution rise antisocial behaviour expensive and poor parking and a lack of any city centre regeneration these long stand independent business the lifeblood of our community be now consider closure have the minister consider their clear ask which be reduce or freeze business rate and have affordable and accessible parking and community focus event to revive our high street 
 measure that the hon gentleman reference be business rate as i say in answer to previous question we be determined to introduce permanently low business rate for the retail sector for business with property under a value of £   i hope that will make a difference to business not only in leicester in his constituency but more generally across the country 
 i call the shadow minister 
 at the heart of every high street be wonderful hospitality sme pub cafés restaurant bar and coffee shop yet the budget be a hammer blow to they with £ of extra cost in restaurant face closure this year indeed labour ’s budget have already cost hospitality job for context in the same period the previous year hospitality create new job can the minister assure the house that business that be hang on by a thread will not face a hard landing this winter 
 the hon gentleman be of those conservative front benchers who have yet to tell we if they do not like the increase in national insurance contribution how they would pay for the extra investment in hospital school and our police force i gently say that the difficult decision the chancellor of the exchequer have to take in the budget last year be a direct result of the £ black hole leave to we by the conservatives our small business strategy will set out further measure that we will take to have the back of british entrepreneur 
 that answer be simply not good enough for the of employee in the hospitality sector whose job be on the line yet we now read in the press that the government appear set on force restaurateur to monitor customer calorie consumption another crippling blow of red tape on top of national insurance hike minimum wage hike and the regulatory firestorm of the employment rights bill jeremy clarkson be not wrong when he say that the chancellor be 
 use a machine gun on publican 
 can the minister really look hospitality sme on our high street and beyond in the eye and say that this be somehow good for business 
 reason the hon gentleman ’s party lose the confidence of business be that it promise many many time that it would reform business rate and never do the chancellor of the exchequer have set out our commitment to permanently low business rate for the hospitality sector we have already take step in that regard and she will set out our plan to do even more that be way in which we be back up our commitment to sme in the hospitality sector and more generally 
 what step his department be take to ensure that sme in buckingham and bletchley constituency can access capital and export finance as part of the uk ’s recent trade agreement 
 on   june the department publish our trade strategy announce the expansion of uk export finance ’s capacity to £ we also   announce measure to give small firm include those in buckingham and bletchley well access to export protection insurance the significant increase in the capacity of the british business bank will also help to improve access to capital for sme include potentially in my hon friend ’s constituency 
 innovative high growth company such as envisics in bletchley be develop and export world lead technology drive product but face difficulty secure the domestic capital need to scale up too often overseas investor and sometimes government offer both finance and other incentive for they to relocate will the minister set out in more detail how his department be work across whitehall to ensure that domestic financial institution include government back entity be help company like envisic to firmly anchor their innovation here in the uk 
 we hear during our sme consultation that of the big issue face small and medium sized business that want to scale up relate to access to finance indeed since the stock of bank lending to sme relative to gdp have fall by around which graphically demonstrate the significance of my hon friend ’s point we have be work closely with treasury colleague in particular and when we launch the industrial strategy we also launch a funding arrangement for the british business bank that will provide £ of capital to our high growth innovative business to ensure that they remain anchored in the uk and be able to scale up here 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the industrial strategy on cornwall 
 as we have hear the industrial strategy be a plan to lift every part of the country and it specifically recognise clean energy opportunity for offshore wind and nuclear in the great south west the strategy also highlight foundational industry relevant to its sector supply chain include spotlight critical mineral cluster in cornwall it include the launch of a new uk export finance loan guarantee scheme for domestic supplier sell critical mineral to uk exporter the upcoming critical mineral strategy will aim to secure a steady supply of mineral optimise domestic resource and enhance international collaboration 
 as the secretary of state mention with its vast renewable energy and critical mineral resource cornwall be uniquely position to become a key driver of uk economic growth although the industrial strategy emphasise the role of mayoral strategic authority and city region particularly in the north and midland do the secretary of state agree that cornwall ’s immense industrial potential must not be overlook and can he reassure i that unleash the cornish celtic tiger with the economic investment that we need be not contingent on join a mayoral combine authority 
 i can give my hon friend that assurance i be dismay this morning to wake up and hear the reform party actively argue for less investment   in britain and tell business they should not invest in the uk i find that absolutely absurd there be a whole range of tool for local area to shape their economy in the industrial strategy some relate to mayor but many do not it have the mix of tool that be require to unleash the potential of every part of the country include his own 
 far to that very encouraging response from the secretary of state do he acknowledge that cornwall be the poor region in the united kingdom it have great opportunity as   the hon member for camborne and redruth perran moon   point out but it have be hamper since lose the high level of eu structural aid if we be go to take the opportunity and overcome the challenge that cornwall face would the secretary of state be prepared to meet the hon member for camborne and redruth i and other cornish members to establish a bespoke strategy for cornwall to drive the private and public investment need 
 let i say that as someone who use to spend their family holiday in cornwall i must protest i have have question from cornish colleague and not a single invite to visit cornwall over the summer holiday i really think that be unacceptable 
 the economic history of cornwall be particularly interesting i have have this discussion with my hon friend   the member for camborne and redruth perran moon and i recognise some of the specific issue that   the hon member for st ives andrew george   have identify there of course i be always willing to meet he either in cornwall or here in parliament to have that discussion i believe there be key part of the industrial strategy that will deliver the opportunity and the tool require to unleash what both colleague be try to achieve 
 what step he be take to support independent retailer 
 we have freeze the small business multipli for protect over ratepayer from bill increase and we be create a fairer business rate system that protect the high street and support investment our forthcoming sme strategy will set out further plan to help business on the high street and beyond 
 in corby and east northamptonshire retail and wholesale job account for the large share of employment support thousand of job will the minister confirm that unlike the last tory government which promise to reform business rate but do absolutely nothing this labour government be commit to deliver a fairer business rate system to support the vibrant high street that our community deserve 
 i know that northamptonshire have a thrive retail and wholesale sector and i commend my hon friend for champion the job and business in his constituency he rightly say that the conservatives   promise to reform business rate what he do not say be that they promise many time to reform business rate and never do so we have commit to permanently low business rate for retail hospitality and leisure business the government be commit to publish soon an interim report that set out further detail on the direction of travel and confirmation of our plan will come at the autumn budget 
 i recently meet the owner of bababing in my constituency who have open up new premise in keighley they want to grow and expand as quickly as possible but they tell i that this government be stifle business growth for not only bababing but many other sme across the country due to the decision they make in the budget last year to increase employer national insurance and the minimum wage and the employment rights bill which be come down the line do the government recognise that they be stifle growth and if so what be they do about it 
 i welcome the establishment of bababing in the hon member ’s constituency i recognise that difficult decision have to be take in the budget i be sure he have point out to the owner of bababing that those difficult decision be take as a direct result of the £ black hole that his party leave we to tackle our small business strategy will set out a range of measure we be take to support business which i hope will help bababing and other business in his constituency 
 what step he be take to support the hospitality sector 
 what step he be take to support the hospitality sector 
 we recognise the vital role hospitality play in drive growth and strengthen all our community that be why we have commit to permanently low business rate for the sector from and announce a hospitality fund to co invest in project that boost productivity and help community pub adapt to local need it be also why we have launch an industry lead licensing taskforce to reduce red tape and other barrier 
 i regularly meet the harrogate business improvement district and the chamber of commerce and we have a thriving hospitality and tourism sector in harrogate and knaresborough i recently meet alison a constituent who run a number of local bar and restaurant and she be worried that with the increase in employer nic rise energy cost and the other pressure that this government be not get to grip with business like hers will not be there to see the benefit of business rate reform what be the minister do with treasury colleague to support local hospitality 
 of the most important measure that will help the hospitality sector be business rate reform we have set out our commitment to do that and we be work with all the different part of the business community include the hospitality sector to get our reform proposal right as i allude to in a previous answer we will publish an interim report give more detail of our thinking on business rate reform and the chancellor of the exchequer will confirm our plan in the budget later this year 
 i hope the minister will join i in thank all the hard work hospitality staff who be about to have a very busy summer particularly in edinburgh west where they be about to be immerse in the edinburgh international festival to which the minister and the secretary of state all the ministers in fact be of course invite we be very hospitable in edinburgh 
 the hospitality industry be worth £ to my constituency but business be suffer because of the national insurance change and in scotland we will not benefit from business rate reform with the national insurance change and the impact of brexit and covid it be a very uncertain time what else will the minister do to help business across scotland that will not have the benefit of business rate reform 
 i thank the hon lady for her kind invitation it be possible that i will be darken the door of business in her constituency this summer 
 we be determined to continue work with hospitality business whether in scotland or in the rest of the country as i say in an early answer we have set out plan for a licensing taskforce to look at what else we can do to lower the cost of red tape and regulation as the hon lady rightly say we be take measure to reform business rate and perhaps the scottish government might like to follow our example 
 in my constituency lydia and frankie both run business that employ around individual they both have covid loan and energy loan on top of the usual business pressure they suffer beyond maintain the current discount on business rate may i urge the government urgently to review business rate reform which be so desperately need 
 i recognise that my hon friend be a great champion of business in his constituency and i be pleased to meet of they when i be there recently i absolutely recognise the significance of business rate reform the chancellor have be very clear that she be commit to business rate reform and we will set out further detail on our plan in the budget later this year 
 despite public transport link people from the braes bonnybridge bainsford and beyond to falkirk the high street have be dwindle over the past year snp and tory councillor decide to cut the free after parking scheme for falkirk town centre business and far drive footfall away from our high street restaurant cafés and pub in the forthcoming small business strategy will the minister   consider look at how this labour government can support accessible and cheap parking in scottish town centre 
 i very much sympathise with my hon friend ’s frustration about what both the snp and the conservatives have do to free parking in his constituency i sympathise because the tory run council in my constituency have take similar step to curtail free parking which have undoubtedly have an impact on the town centre i hope that the concern my hon friend have articulate today will be hear loud and clear in his constituency and that action will be take our sme strategy will set out a range of step that we be determined to take to back small business and help entrepreneur across britain 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the value that hospitality business bring to their local community go far beyond their economic contribution they also provide a vital social value and essential entry level job flexible hour and condition in the sector help those with other responsibility such as carer and new parent to access work while also offer many young people their job however retail and hospitality business have be hit hard by tax change in the october budget and they be report reduce hour cancel investment and closure there have be nearly hospitality job loss just since october as economic strategy be roll out what step be the minister take to ensure that department for work and pensions goal to get people back to work be not be undermine by policy that shrink job opportunity in these sector 
 i completely agree with the hon lady about the huge importance of hospitality to all our community and to help many people who have difficult route into employment to get their step back into a job of the step we have take be to set up our hospitality fund work with the great organisation pub be the hub to help landlord to diversify what they offer and drive more footfall into the pub the fund also support charity that be work with those furth away from the job market to get into job it be strongly support by hospitality business through the hospitality sector council as i have say we have a commitment to a small business strategy and we will set out further measure to help hospitality in that regard 
 what recent assessment his department have make of trend in the level of operating cost for sme 
 over the past year sme have face a challenging operate environment because of the consequence of the liz truss budget the poorly negotiate trade deal with europe covid and increase global uncertainty interest rate have come down time under this government we have negotiate a new trade deal with europe and complement our industrial and trade   strategy we will bring forward an sme strategy to put in place far long term support to help sme start up and expand 
 in my constituency and across scotland small and medium sized business have take blow after blow the conservatives bungle brexit increase import cost and energy cost be soar most recently the hike in national insurance contribution be decimate job opportunity in small and medium sized business what be the government do to support sme which be at the heart of our economic growth and to get people off benefit and back into work 
 order shorter answer please minister 
 yes madam deputy speaker i gently say to the hon lady that in a recent survey almost quarter of sme business be confident about the future she be right to challenge we to go far in increase support for sme of the way that we be do that be by increase access to finance for sme through the significant expansion in the capacity of the british business bank

 absolutely we want to hear from business up and down the uk across different sector about the practical measure that we can take to support they and their plan to grow and develop if my hon friend have particular example of business that want to make representation i be sure that we as a ministerial team would want to hear from they 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal democrats welcome the plan in the recently announce industrial strategy to reduce some of the world ’s high industrial energy price however business across the uk especially in hospitality and on our high street be still struggle with unaffordable energy cost what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that small business can benefit from more sustainable pricing will he encourage his cabinet colleague to consider proposal set out by the liberal democrats yesterday to break the link between gas price and energy cost which would halve energy bill in a decade so that people and business across the country can enjoy the true benefit of cheap clean and renewable power 
 i have to apologise to the hon lady because i have not yet see the liberal democrats policy proposal but i look forward to that treat over the summer i be grateful to she for back our plan on energy   cost we be support a pilot in the west midland to help sme to reduce their energy cost it offer full energy audits and funding to implement measure that can bring down energy cost the scheme seem to be work well and we have recently extend it

 this have be a year of real achievement for the department for business and trade from hold our record break international investment summit which see £ commit to the uk to intervene decisively to save british steel ’s scunthorpe site and all the shipyard at harland and wolff we have safeguard thousand of job we have reform the competition and markets authority change the emission vehicle mandate alter the remit of the low pay commission and introduce the employment rights bill 
 we have quadruple compensation payment to victim of the horizon scandal we have agree trade deal with india the eu and the us and publish a comprehensive trade strategy to help we to secure great access to global market for british business we have bring forward our industrial strategy and last week a survey by deloitte find that britain have become the most attractive place to invest in the world we be deliver this government ’s plan for change put money into people ’s pocket drive growth and kickstarte a decade of national renewal 
 the secretary of state have try to paint a glowing picture of what be happen but i can tell he that in northern lincolnshire there be grow concern there have be a number of business failure in the last few week in the grimsby and immingham area and he will be aware of the threat to hundred of job at the prax oil refinery all that make it even more important that the scunthorpe steelwork have a long term future can he update the house on the state of thing at scunthorpe 
 i be always keen to update the hon member and colleague on the situation with british steel we have cancel the redundancy consultation and remove the immediate risk to job we have take on new apprentice and invest significantly in improve health and safety on the site we have provide significant work capital that do not take into account yet the future revenue that will come i be sure he will have be pleased to see that network rail have award british steel a contract worth £ we will continue to ensure that there be a long term future for british steel and we will keep the house and himself update to that effect 
 the government ’s £ investment to support under represent entrepreneur be hugely welcome by business leader in my constituency but access to capital be only part of the challenge many still face entrenched barrier around network mentoring and market access will the minister set out   the step that the government be take to ensure that that investment be complement by wide reform to break down any structural obstacle to scale business in milton keynes and buckinghamshire 
 the government back invest in woman taskforce be address many of these issue through its ecosystem working group which promote well access to network to support and to procurement opportunity my hon friend be absolutely right though to say that we need to go far the small business strategy will set out a range of further measure in that regard 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i start by pay tribute to norman tebbit he be a former secretary of state for trade and industry and a great reformer who do a great deal to unleash growth in this country 
 the only thing grow under this government be the unemployment queue today the office for national statistics reveal that the number of payrolle employee have fall by over the last year and in the last month alone unemployment have be high in every month since the chancellor have be in office in the last hour we have hear news of another job loss at jaguar land rover this be a great country with great people when the secretary of state talk to business what reason do they give to he for unemployment rise 
 it be always nice to hear from the shadow secretary of state as he know the office for national statistics workforce survey show that the overall number of job be high after a year of this government than it would have be if the conservatives have remain in government there be additional job he mention payroll job of course they be important they be key factor as be wage which as he know have rise fast in the month of this government than they do in the year of the previous government our productivity figure have also rise and of course we closely monitor the impact of technology 
 the shadow secretary of state ask what business say to i they say that this government have bring stability after the mini budget disaster which he be a key part of they say that we have bring openness to the world and be navigate a difficult trading environment well than anyone else and they recognise that our pro business pro growth measure be deliver there be nothing like the list i just give of problem after year of the previous government 
 that answer be complacent and unsympathetic it be the most vulnerable those look for their shot their chance who pay the price of unemployment 
 let we start again last night in the other place the unemployment bill be improve with sensible amendment to probation period a definition of seasonal worker that protect hospitality and agriculture and provision   for a consultation about the impact on the small business those measure have be propose by employer and by independent business group such as the confederation of british industry make uk and the federation of small businesses who say that the bill in its current form be deeply damaging if the secretary of state will not shelve the bill entirely will he at least commit to accept those entirely reasonable amendment 
 the shadow secretary of state talk about vulnerable people which government leave in young people not in education employment or training while net immigration hit it be absolutely shameful and we will take no lesson from conservative members he talk about tackle barrier who give we the high industrial energy price in the developed world the conservative party who be deal with that who have put million into skill and training finance and the tool that local area need those be the thing that business want 
 the shadow secretary of state also talk about the employment rights bill i regret the conservatives knee jerk ideological opposition to it they could have be pragmatic the bill be a manifesto commitment and we will deliver our manifesto commitment in full there be issue on which we have to get the balance right such as probation period and the future monitoring of hour contract and the commitment be of course real pragmatic engagement would have be a more constructive way forward than this knee jerk ideological opposition 
 the business and trade committee ’s inquiry on small business be still open for evidence from member from across the house on tuesday we take evidence from the chief executive of ofgem who make it perfectly clear that a complete collapse of regulation in the year after covid lead to thousand of business across our country pay high energy bill than they need to can the secretary of state assure the house that the small business strategy when publish will contain a strategy for bear down on the energy rip off that be challenge small business across our country 
 i be always grateful to the chair of the select committee for his helpful and pragmatic work and engagement i recognise the issue that he have highlight a lot of small business be lock into uncompetitive contract after covid and the legacy of that have be very difficult of course we will always look at measure to address that fundamentally we must break the link that mean that gas set the price of electricity in the uk there be no shortcuts to that we have to get enough clean energy on to the system to make that possible which be exactly what the government be do 
 on monday tina mckenzie the policy chair of the federation of small businesses say 
 for the time in the history of the small business index more small business be predict they will shrink than expand mean that as a country we be potentially face a very dangerous situation 
 i have listen carefully to what the economic secretary to the treasury have say about the concierge service which i welcome and have see the leeds reform this week much of which i welcome however will the minister respond to that stark warning from a very credible source of information 
 i have a high regard for tina mckenzie and the federation of small businesses more generally and we have be work extremely closely with they on think through what measure should be in the small business strategy to help business start up scale up and thrive more generally i gently point the right hon gentleman to the slightly more positive picture paint by the fact that the boss of small and medium sized enterprise have more confidence we will continue to talk to the federation of small businesses and will do so in a lot more detail 
 do the secretary of state agree that the uk labour government be get on with the serious business of deliver an industrial strategy that will support job in my livingston constituency that be in sharp contrast to the fail snp government who have no industrial strategy no plan for worker and no plan to support scotland ’s key sector 
 i very much agree with my hon friend nationalism be fundamentally a creed base on grievance rather than real solution and that stand in contrast to our approach there be specific instance where we could deliver billion of pound of investment to scotland if there be a change in policy from the scottish government be it on new nuclear in place where scotland could benefit from small modular reactor or on the recent decision to pull support for the rolls royce lead plan for a welding centre for apprentice in the defence sector which would enable they to support the maintenance of royal navy submarine the snp government be actively make decision that get in the way of that investment if we can not change their policy let we change the scottish government 
 eastbourne ’s postie be legend include manuel who cover my patch upstream issue in the royal mail however mean that constituent like michaele be not receive letter for medical appointment until after the appointment time have pass will the minister meet i to discuss these appalling delay and the urgent action that must be take to ensure that our resident get their post on time 
 the hon member be right to pay tribute to the tremendous work that postie do up and down the country rain or shine to deliver the mail there have of course be issue with performance in the royal mail i be happy to discuss that far with he and to make sure with the help of ofcom that we get the service that everyone deserve 
 on friday the select committee on science innovation and technology publish its report on social medium algorithm follow the southport   riot indeed there be a select committee statement on the report this afternoon stakeholder have express concern that ongoing trade negotiation with the united states might prevent the government from respond to the report ’s recommendation hold social medium company to account and keep the public safe online can the minister reassure we that that be not the case 
 i can reassure my hon friend and all colleague that those decision will always be in the domain of this government and this parliament in the uk there have be a lot of speculation during the trade negotiation about what may or may not be involve but we have show that we deliver on job good and service and that be the basis of sound trade negotiation 
 my constituent mr and mrs greathead supply specialist industrial product to business across the uk and europe since brexit they have face many extra layer of difficulty delay and cost and they be in the middle of a year battle with his majesty ’s revenue and customs to ensure that correct tariff be charge will the minister please look into the barrier that my constituent face when trade with europe and ensure that excessive red tape do not hold they back 
 i sympathise with the hon member ’s constituent on the difficulty that they face on the challenge that he say they face with hmrc he may want to get in contact with my colleague the exchequer secretary to the treasury who have responsibility for hmrc 
 at a panel discussion early this year i join a group of lead woman in the hospitality sector who repeatedly highlight that the lack of female representation in leadership role and ownership be a persistent barrier to progress in the sector what step be the minister take to support woman in the hospitality industry into leadership and ownership role 
 this be an important issue the invest in women taskforce be look at some of the very real barrier that woman entrepreneur face both in hospitality and more generally access to finance be of the challenge that we have hear back about a fund be be put together to help woman entrepreneur with that but we need to do more and our sme strategy will set out our plan in that regard 
 we have hear this morning that the review of the uk internal market act somehow trample on holyrood but in fact the government say 
 devolve government will have great flexibility to set rule 
 be there not a danger that this invite the snp government to introduce change for the sake of change and divergence for the sake of divergence thus damage trade right across the country 
 well if i be simultaneously be criticise by the snp and the conservative party i be pretty sure that we have get the balance right   the uk internal market act seek to strike the appropriate balance between give devolve government flexibility on policy and avoid unnecessary barrier for uk business i believe we have get that balance exactly right 
 the over employee at the lotus plant in south norfolk and norwich north be the pride of our constituency and i thank the secretary of state for his support in recent week may i ask for a meeting with he and my hon friend   the member for norwich north alice macdonald so that we can talk about our discussion with local employee 
 i can absolutely guarantee my hon friend that we will have that meeting i appreciate the work that we have be able to do together react    to the medium report that initially surface there be some clarity from the company but not the full degree of clarity that we need i will make sure that we get that meeting set up for he and his colleague 
 we have just have our consecutive month of job loss announce and research show that as many as of company be consider redundancy what be the government ’s analysis of why this be happen 
 i gently say to the hon gentleman that we have have interest rate cut almost job have be create our industrial strategy have be hugely welcome and we have have deal so it be perhaps not a surprise that recent survey point to a year high in business confidence 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for housing communities and local government if she will make a statement on the new policy announce in the government ’s strategy for election 
 the government have today publish our strategy for modern and secure election when we come into power just over a year ago the government commit through our manifesto to bring forward measure to strengthen our precious democracy and uphold the integrity of our election the strategy we have publish today set out how we will legislate and implement provision to extend the voter franchise to and year old increase participation in our election tackle the inconsistency in voter identification rule and protect our democracy by overhaul our political finance rule 
 we recognise that there be a grow and worrying trend of candidate administrator and elector face harassment and intimidation which have a chilling effect on our democracy we be bring forward measure to tackle this issue i thank mr speaker and the speaker ’s conference for the work that be be conduct and the report that have be publish on harassment and intimidation we will fix the foundation of how election operate by take forward a range of practical measure to ensure that election continue to be deliver successfully 
 our democracy be central to who we be as a country we can take pride in its evolution and in how it continue to inspire the government have a responsibility to protect and strengthen it the plan we have announce today will future proof our democracy secure our election and protect they against interference we will deliver on these plan during the lifetime of this parliament through a programme of reform which will include an election bill that will be introduce in due course through this strategy we will usher in a new chapter in our democracy that reflect our principle and restore faith in our politic i look forward to work with colleague from across the house on this very important agenda 
 i call the shadow minister 
 yesterday the department give notice of a write ministerial statement on the government ’s new strategy for election which be a significant policy document on change to election law and political finance law something that affect we all in this house instead of the minister use this democratic chamber to announce a new and wide range strategy on democracy the government choose to announce it to the press in monday ’s no lobby briefing typical government by press release in fact it have just be announce on bbc news there will be no opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny until september due to the pende recess 
 why do the minister not choose to come to the house to announce this policy despite we have be give word through a write ministerial statement that the government would do so why do she not think it right to come here of her own accord to announce it   why have there be no consultation of political party to date this be contrary to the approach of the last government who actively consult on change 
 this strategy have finally reveal the government ’s ambition to allow a year old to vote in an election but not to stand in it probably because young people be abandon the labour party in drove why do they think a year old should be able vote but not be allow to buy a lottery ticket or an alcoholic drink marry go to war or even stand in the election they be vote in be not the government ’s position on the age of majority just hopelessly confuse 
 do the minister agree that while foreign donation be already illegal and should remain so step should be take to tighten the law to prevent donation from those who be not properly on the electoral roll include the funnelling of money from impermissible source we welcome the u turn on not scrap voter id but will use bank card not undermine the security of the ballot box and what security measure will she bring in now that automatic registration have be announce 
 finally what step will the minister take to tackle the important issue of intimidation in public life will the government still abide by the long stand convention that the government of the day do not unilaterally impose measure directly affect political party without proper engagement and discussion and will they stop announce constitutional policy by press release 
 this government be elect on a manifesto that commit we to grant year old the right to vote and protect our democracy from foreign money i remind the hon gentleman that his party lose the general election in the bad general election defeat for decade so it be no wonder that the conservatives be scared of the electorate the truth be that young people deserve to have a stake and have a say in the future of our democracy young people can vote for any party they like and it speak volume that he would prefer they to be silence 
 i remind the house that the hon gentleman ’s party sit in government for year and do nothing to close the gap loophole allow foreign interference and foreign money to enter our system despite independent expert call for change the intelligence and security committee ’s russia report expose malign effort to channel foreign money into uk politic both the committee on standards in public life and the electoral commission have call for strengthened regulation and great transparency in political donation alongside modernise enforcement we make no apology for finally take the tough choice and protect britain ’s democracy from malign foreign interference 
 the real question for the hon gentleman be whether the conservatives will finally end their addiction to donation from shell company under the new law they will not have a choice and we will not stop there because they will finally have to update their weak due diligence check and conduct enhance check we will give the electoral commission the power to administer a hefty fine of up to a maximum of £ to deter bad behaviour instead of point the finger the hon gentleman should be welcome these change and take the opportunity to finally clean up his party 
 we have publish the election strategy and we have lay a write statement i have respond in the public administration and constitutional affairs committee and the speaker ’s committee on the electoral commission i will continue to engage with parliamentary colleague in the come day over the summer recess and in the autumn 
 we want to make a series of change and i be determined to make sure we get as much cross party agreement as possible i look forward to work with the hon gentleman because i believe that there be common ground on a range of issue he know all too well the harassment and intimidation and threat to our life that many of we have face it be really important that we work on these agenda together 
 on move towards automated voter registration which the hon gentleman mention we will carefully consider how we implement those change to ensure they be do safely and i look forward to work with colleague on that we have retain the voter id change make under the previous government but we recognise that certain group of legitimate voter particularly disabled voter be exclude we need to address that gap and i know his party recognise that challenge so we will ensure that we do not exclude legitimate voter i look forward to work with he on issue of common interest and agreement 
 i call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee 
 i thank the minister for the write statement and for her work behind the scene 
 we should welcome the opportunity for more people to be enfranchise we should be very clear that person lose the right to vote at the ballot box be person too many it be really important that we look at the issue around voter id and ensure more opportunity for people to have other form of voter id at the ballot box it be important that we enfranchise our young people to vote they participate in public life already so they should also be entitle to vote 
 it be really important to have system where it be easy to be register to vote when you move home before you have even unpack you get a council tax bill the council already have your detail so it be good that we be look at a system to ensure people be register to vote for far too long we have knock on door and people have say that they be interested but not register to vote so that be vital 
 on ensure candidate still feel safe this be a big challenge and a threat to democracy will my hon friend outline what work she will be do with the electoral commission on the intimidation and abuse face by candidate 
 order we do need question and answer to be short 
 i thank my hon friend for her question she do important work in her committee the change we be introduce will ensure that elect representative   candidate campaigner and electoral staff who play a unique role in our democracy be properly protect we will give court the power to increase sentence for those who be hostile to candidate an aggravate factor for intimidatory offence will be introduce allow court to pass tough sentence we will also remove the requirement to publish candidate address we will consult with the crown prosecution service the sentencing council and other judicial body 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we be very pleased that the government have publish the strategy many aspect of which have the support of the liberal democrats we have for many year champion vote at and we be really glad that the government have listen to those call we also welcome the measure to tackle dark and illicit money in our politic and the recent plan to introduce supplementary voting for mayoral election 
 however i be concerned that the strategy show nowhere near the kind of ambition that we need to fix a system of election that have leave large swathe of the public feeling like their vote simply do not count as member across the house will know last year ’s general election turn out the most disproportionate result in history with nearly of people who vote not represent in parliament by the candidate they vote for 
 this opportunity can not be waste will the government go far will they look at scrap voter id in its entirety will they look at introduce further measure to ensure that foreign oligarch such as elon musk be not able to interfere in british politic include through party funding and will they finally scrap past the post and introduce fair vote via proportional representation 
 the hon lady have a lot of question the government have no plan to change the electoral system for uk parliamentary and local election her party in the coalition government have the opportunity through a referendum to campaign and institute the appropriate change our focus be on ensure we address the manifesto commitment we make include a voting age of i be grateful to she and her party for their support we be also take action to tackle illicit finance and foreign interference i very much hope that she and her colleague will work with we on that very important agenda 
 i declare an interest as a member of the speaker ’s conference which be look at the security of mps candidate and election do my hon friend agree that a wide number of behaviour in our democratic system be intimidate candidate and indeed member of this house and that that be detrimental to our value and democracy will she expand on the measure in the strategy that will seek to alleviate those very serious problem 
 i thank my hon friend for his question in the year i have be a member of parliament we have see a rise in hatred and hostility towards candidate and elect official and have sadly face the loss of our dear colleague jo cox and sir david amess this government be determined to ensure that elect representative   candidate and election official be protect because this trend be have a devastating chilling effect on our democracy we need to work together to protect our democracy while protect freedom of speech i would be happy to speak to my hon friend on the specific proposal as we proceed with their implementation 
 i thank the minister for her statement but i have not hear she say anything about the work of the boundary commission for local government and constituency i think they should form part of this discussion particularly to ensure that constituency can be make up of genuine community by get rid of the pointless rule that a constituency can not go beyond a certain region area of essex near my constituency for instance can not be include within romford which only go into london similarly local council ward would surely be well if they be member ward whereby they could be like mini constituency look after a particular community would that not be a well way forward and would the minister consider it as part of the review 
 the hon gentleman will understand the process and work of the boundary commission this strategy be focus on the theme that i speak to early and that be what we will be focus on 
 as the chair of the all party parliamentary group for fair election i warmly welcome this policy paper i think my hon friend the minister and i be much more poorly equip to vote when we be than today ’s year old so i warmly welcome that measure i also welcome the english devolution and community empowerment bill introduce last week with the government say that past the post 
 can lead to individual be elect with only a small proportion of the total vote cast 
 and that mayors and police and crime commissioner 
 should be elect with a great consensus among their elector 
 the government have also claim that this change will give the local electorate an increase voice and will 
 well support the democratic mandate of people elect to such position 
 give the flawed nature of past the post will the minister consider also review the system for election to this place 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his work with the appg he be aware of the policy of the labour party and this government on past the post i refer he to my previous answer on that question 
 fair election must be election that we can all trust the most important element of our electoral system be that it be a secret ballot and that it should be down to the individual to make up their own mind i be therefore deeply concerned that the widespread use of postal voting across the country be allow dangerous fraud with many voter still intimidate and coerce into use postal vote on the instruction of somebody else the review cover many practical aspect of postal voting but what step be the government take to ensure the accuracy and honesty of the postal voting system 
 the hon gentleman will be aware that his party introduce a series of change include on voter id and other check as elector register to vote i be all too aware of the area that need particular focus we have retain the protection on postal voting the hon gentleman be aware of a number of issue around postal vote but i reassure he that there be law to ensure that forgery and personation do not happen we will retain the appropriate check and safeguard that be introduce in the past 
 may i put on record my profound thank to the minister for her personal commitment to ensure that we renew confidence in democracy i warmly welcome proposal around move away from the past the post system in regional election and restore that part of our democracy will she outline how she will tackle the illicit finance that be flow into our democracy i have real concern about how foreign influence damage our democracy and i would be grateful for more information on how this strategy will deliver for our country 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her work in this area as i mention the intelligence and security committee ’s russia report expose malign effort to channel foreign money into our politic we be ensure that the electoral commission will have the appropriate power to support political party make sure that they do know your donor check where party fail in this area a fine of up to £ can be apply we will apply that fine proportionately in recognition of the resource issue of small party 
 i very much welcome what be in the government ’s policy particularly vote for and year old we already have this in scotland for the scottish parliamentary election and i have also campaign for the change to be make for general election will the minister confirm that this will be in place in time for the next general election and how the information will be pass out to and year old that they will now be able to vote in general election 
 i thank the hon lady for her support we be look very closely at the work in scotland and wales we want to make sure that we take the time to implement the appropriate change in time for the next general election but we will work with the relevant institution include the electoral commission education establishment the department for education charity youth organisation and other interested body to make sure that we get this right 
 i welcome the measure to take out dark money from our politic but they will mean nothing unless we move forward aggressively to ban cryptocurrency donation in british politic they be use for money laundering and to disguise dark money they have no role in british politic will the minister confirm that the election bill will ban cryptocurrency donation 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for his work in this area through his committee and for raise these issue there be already a number of rule   in place on political donation and they must be abide by regardless of the type of donation make include cryptocurrency donation our reform of political finance to far strengthen our democracy will also apply to all donation include those in cryptocurrency 
 democracy be fragile and here in the united kingdom our democracy be strongly in the crosshair of nefarious state include russia and china which do not share our value we be see increase activity online particularly to distort the outcome of election via platform include tiktok which have link to communist regime in china can the minister update the house on what step be be take in particular to protect our democracy from misinformation that vehemently seek to distort the outcome of election 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that important question he will be aware that the defend democracy taskforce be lead the work on a range of issue include of course in relation to the point that he have make we be take action to bear down on those issue with a cross government approach the online safety act be important in relation to some of the point that he have make as i have point out we be also aware of the danger of foreign interference and foreign state actor and these reform be really important to protect the integrity of our system and our democracy 
 as a member of the speaker ’s conference i have hear evidence that have shock i to my core so i know how much need these reform be 
 this week i have hold my summer school with and year old this week of they have be learn about how they can make a change not only in their community but in the country they live in do the minister agree that they deserve to have their voice hear at the ballot box too 
 i thank my hon friend for her work to support young people to participate in our democracy young people can work at pay taxis and join the army there be no reason that they should not have the right to a say in who represent they and the right to shape their future they be passionate about the issue affect their community and country i know that at hand from the work i have do over the year to support young people in their leadership journey and in participate in our election 
 the snp welcome that the uk government be catch up to scotland where we have have vote for year old for the last year however it be clear that real change also require look at this parliament ’s electoral system recent poll have show that the lead party currently would win a majority of seat in the next election on less than of the vote be it not long overdue that this government reform the uk parliament ’s break electoral system and introduce proportional representation as welsh labour be do in the senedd 
 i refer the hon gentleman to my previous answer the government have no plan to change the electoral system for uk parliamentary or local election 
 i welcome this announcement and i can only speculate about why the conservatives do not decide to clean up party funding when they be in government i want to echo some of the comment about proportional representation personally i feel that it be at the heart of many of the problem the country have face in recent time i absolutely accept that proportional representation be not part of the government ’s proposal but will the minister keep an open mind and look at how other strong democracy around the world have be able to use pr to both strengthen their democracy and create a more collaborative political culture 
 i refer my hon friend to my previous answer on the labour party ’s position the government have no plan to change the electoral system he be of course right that we should always learn from international experience we be certainly do that on a range of different agenda include some of the theme of this strategy and we will continue to do so 
 the prime minister have previously talk about extend the franchise to include additional foreign national will the government take this opportunity to rule out ever extend the franchise to foreign national beyond exist rule 
 the focus of this strategy be on eligible voter in this country 
 the minister will be aware that the joint committee on the national security strategy which i chair have be do a lot of work on defend democracy i be sure we will welcome the proposal particularly on illicit finance and crack down on unincorporated association i gently urge she to look closely at cryptocurrencie which be clearly the currency of choice for criminal and rogue state for example individual have rout £ into political organisation in this country through such a currency 
 my hon friend be right to be concern about new challenge in relation to crypto and i refer he to my previous answer on this point we will look very closely at these issue to make sure that loophole be closed but i reassure he that the current power cover donation through crypto and the change we be make will also include crypto 
 there be lot in the strategy that the liberal democrats and i welcome could the minister explain why there be a difference between westminster election and combine mayoral election we know that the majority of the british public want to see the scrapping of past the post and we know from when we have a minute rule bill on this subject during this parliament that the majority of member in this place want to see the scrapping of past the post indeed we know that a   majority of labour members want to see the scrapping of past the post so why be there a difference between the different type of election 
 the hon member may have critique of the past the post system but it provide a direct relationship between member of the legislature and local constituency which be really important the liberal democrats in coalition with the conservatives for year have the opportunity to introduce a referendum but they lose that referendum the supplementary voting system be implement on the introduction of both mayoral and police and crime commissioner election we believe that it be more appropriate for select single person executive 
 i declare a former interest as a lawyer specialise in election law i can say from that previous life that the previous tory government leave our election law in an unfair and dangerous state unfair in that they make it hard for people to vote and dangerous in that they do nothing to prevent foreign actor from spend million of pound rouble or dollar to interfere with our democracy do the minister agree that it be high time to take robust action to make our democracy safe and fair for everyone and will she assure the house that this will be a speedy and fair process 
 i look forward to use the expertise of colleague not only in my party but in other so that we get this right it be in all our interest to close the loophole that be so dangerous and damaging for our democracy 
 there be much to welcome in these proposal to enhance our democracy particularly on the safety of candidate reform be very much against vote for and year old who it be interesting to note be completely split down the middle on this issue however i urge the minister to consider our grave concern with particular regard to postal voting its security and the risk of personation i have see people carry bag load of postal vote to a polling station on election day surely that be completely wrong 
 i reassure the hon gentleman that we take those issue very seriously personate another voter be a deliberate act of fraud it completely undermine our democracy and be a serious criminal offence that will continue to be prosecute if he have example he should report they to the police 
 for year young people in my constituency be frustrate by politician who simply do not listen to their concern on affordable housing on the climate crisis or on good local job do the minister agree that listen to young people and engage they in the process be a key step in rebuild some of the damage do to our democracy over the year of incompetence we see from the tories
