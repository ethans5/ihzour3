funnily enough early today i be talk to the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for taunton deane rebecca pow about exactly that issue the hon gentleman mention that there be no mandate year ago and i be discuss how the reporting and so on be go we know that not only be there the benefit of redistribution for individual but there be a significant environmental benefit for not put that food in landfill and create methane so arguably there be a double win when do sensibly redistribution enable other to do the same as charity such as the felix project which freeze food and make it available to people 
 the economy have turn a corner inflation have more than halve and be forecast to fall below in while wage be rise in real term and have do for the last consecutive month price for food and non alcoholic beverage rise by in the year to march ease for the consecutive month however we recognise the financial challenge that many be still face which be why as inflation come down to the target we be continue to provide support for the period this include uprating working age benefit by well ahead of the current inflation rate and uplift the local housing allowance to the percentile of local rent which will benefit about private renter by on average £ a year as the hon gentleman indicate alleviate financial pressure throughout the system for individual 
 far there be additional support for family include free school meal which be be claim by some of the most disadvantaged pupil the £ that the department for education have put into stimulate the breakfast club and healthy food scheme such as healthy start which provide a nutritional safety net to more than child i look after the healthy start policy when i be at the department of health and social care get the uplift to £ a week so that pregnant woman and child over and under receive £ every week for a child under it be £ every week this can be use to buy or be put towards the cost of fresh frozen or tin fruit and vegetable fresh dried and tin pulse milk and infant formula i remember well meeting daisy who speak to i very clearly about the difference it make have fresh produce as the hon gentleman have already mention come into her life and those of her child and the nutritional benefit it give they 
 for those who still need extra help while inflation continue to fall we be provide an additional £ to enable the extension of the household support fund for a further month include funding for the devolved administrations through the barnett formula mean local authority in england will receive an additional £ to support local people with the rest be distribute to the other nation independent   charitable organisation do fantastic work that also help in this space whether they be our local church or organisation provide lunch and community pantry scheme as the hon gentleman mention they all help individual and family when they be in need 
 this morning people be charge with offence under the official secrets act of those individual be a parliamentary passholder at the time of the alleged offence this matter be now sub judice and under the term of the house ’s resolution on matter of sub judice member should not refer   to it in the chamber i know that hon and right hon member will understand how important it be that we do not say anything in this place that might prejudice a criminal trial relate to a matter of national security 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to reform the private rented sector 
 the renters reform bill will have its report stage on   wednesday april the bill abolishe section eviction move the sector to a system of periodic tenancy and introduce a private rent sector property portal and ombudsman improve the system for responsible tenant and good faith landlord 
 minister promise to end no fault eviction year ago since then household have be threaten with no fault eviction include a constant stream of resident in putney do the minister not agree that that be ample time to implement the necessary improvement and that the delay have cause immense suffering to people in the private rent sector 
 i agree with the hon lady that we need to abolish section eviction as soon as possible when it come to the bill we publish the white paper in we publish the bill in and we be bring forward the report stage on wednesday 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 in the uk government announce plan to outlaw no fault eviction notice however just last week the housing charity shelter reveal that almost   renter in england have be serve no fault eviction notice since that announcement while the government seem to be unable to get the rental reform agenda past their conservative back benchers the scottish parliament ban no fault eviction back in do the minister agree that that be yet another example of the scottish parliament deliver for the people while westminster dysfunction only let they down 
 as i say to   the hon member for putney fleur anderson we be abolish section eviction the bill will return to the house on wednesday 
 what recent estimate he have make of the additional cost to the public purse of council deliver public service in coastal area 
 cornwall be of the most beautiful area of the country only to dorset interruption thank you it have the long county coastline in england and as such its council face unique challenge in deliver service the government be commit to reform the local government fund landscape in the next parliament to deliver simple fair and long settlement as part of that process the government have previously publicly announce that they be explore option for specific formulae for flooding and coastal erosion we will engage council about those option as reform progress 
 the government have already accept the additional cost of deliver service in rural area through the rural service delivery grant but they have not yet accept those additional cost for coastal area would the minister consider establish a coastal service delivery grant to ensure that coastal region such as cornwall which as he say have the long and most beautiful coastline in the country get the funding that they need 
 most beautiful i remind my hon friend he make an important point represent as he do his constituent and the wide county of cornwall and an interesting suggestion strong point sit behind his argument i would be delighted to meet he to discuss that far but he make good point and give i food for thought 
 the cost of deliver service in somerset be rise with care cost rise by between and yet urban council receive about more government funding spending power per head than rural council what step be the department take to address that inequality and help rural council to deliver vital public service 
 as the hon lady will know the rural service delivery grant try to reflect that as well but if only the lib dem leadership of her council have get on as dorset do and deliver the benefit of go unitary rather than fiddle while rome burn her situation might be a little well 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of metro mayors on their local economy 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of metro mayors on their local economy 
 what step he be take to increase engagement between his department and elect mayors 
 our mayors play a powerful role in drive economic growth improve public service and give local area a powerful voice on the national stage i meet all the mayors as a group before christmas as well as mayor brabin as chair of uk mayors this year and a number of mayors on an individual basis i look forward to meet and work closely with all the mayors collectively and individually after the may election include the new mayors who will be elect for the east midlands the north east combined authority and york and north yorkshire 
 since he be elect in andy street have deliver £ of new investment to the west midland region more housing particularly on brownfield land and much need investment in transport infrastructure across the region do the secretary of state agree that when voter go to the poll next week they should support andy street to continue that track record of delivery for the west midland 
 i agree with my hon friend andy street have be outstanding at deliver job and more home in the west midland than in any other region accord to housing target he have do so despite the failure of birmingham city council which be drive into bankruptcy by labour 
 can my right hon friend far update colleague and my constituent on the progress of the greater lincolnshire devolution deal follow the deal approve at upper tier council level early this year 
 we have be consult and we have listen and we will have to wait until after   may   to say more i be look forward to work with my hon friend to make lincolnshire great again 
 give that after   may   there will be metro mayors directly represent people in england do the secretary of state think that there should be a dedicated formal structure that will enable the metro mayors to work more effectively with whitehall government rather than the somewhat ad hoc structure that be currently in place 
 that be a fair point the ad hoc structure that the hon gentleman describe work well all the exist mayors work well together and all party politic aside it have be instructive to see the   kind word that andy burnham have direct towards andy street and vice versa now that the mayoral model which have work overall with or slight bump in the road have reach a level of maturity his point be very fair 
 voter in the upcoming north yorkshire mayoral election be face significant economic hardship and deserve to know that their money be be spend responsibly do the secretary of state share my concern that candidate in the north yorkshire mayoral race have make over £ of unfunded spending commitment for the county could central government perhaps provide an assessment of the economic impact of such spending commitment 
 it be strike that the conservative candidate in north yorkshire be the only who have a plan for growth and a long term plan for york and north yorkshire ’s economy when it come to value for money for our mayors i should point out that the conservative mayors for tees valley and for the west midlands ben houchen and andy street levy not a penny in extra mayoral taxation unlike the labour mayor in london whose spendthrift way will see he throw out on   may 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 despite that love in as the mayor of the west midlands andy street have over promise and under deliver almost of devolved housing fund have not be use and he have do nothing to tackle rogue landlord the mayoral model can work and sadiq khan ’s affordable housebuilding in london be evidence of that when do the secretary of state last meet andy street and do he raise those failure with he 
 i talk to andy street constantly because he be a model of what a strong mayor should be the right hon lady talk about housing there be housing target set at a regional level which mayor miss they by most sadiq khan in london which mayor have exceed those target andy street in the west midland sadiq khan have fail on housing fail on crime and fail on transport and he will be kick out on   may 
 roll on a general election sadiq khan have be build a well london for everyone if the right hon gentleman want more evidence of mayors work he should look up north tracy brabin steve rotheram and andy burnham have be bring transport service back under public control give well value for money in the tees valley we see the opposite the review into lord houchen ’s mishandling of teesworks find 
 the principle of spend public money be not be consistently observe 
 so why will the secretary of state not give the national audit office the chance to investigate 
 i be sure the right hon lady be very very keen that all sort of matter be investigate properly by independent figure who can be trust but in the tees valley ben houchen have do more than   any other metro mayor to bring job and investment into his region the thousand of job create in teesworks stand in stark contrast to labour ’s failure from london to liverpool to bring in the job require andy street i should reinforce be the single most successful mayor in the country that be why both andy and ben will be re elect on   may alongside conservative mayors in york and north yorkshire the east midlands and of course london 
 what step he be take to help prevent a leaseholder and b tenant pay for the remediation of fire defect 
 no qualifying leaseholder in a building above metre in england will be liable for clad remediation cost where we be able to do so and where they still exist we be make those who cause these issue pay to resolve they 
 in my constituency resident be ask for transparency in their service charge they be fearful that they be be charge for survey for fire remediation work which be the responsibility of the developer and not the people who live in the flat and who be not the cause of those problem what will the government do for people in master gunner place or grove place in my constituency where people be ask question but not get answer on why they be pay these excessive charge in case there be a increase in the service charge the government be make all the right noise but i do not see much result at the sharp end for my constituent 
 i totally agree with the hon gentleman that it be absolutely vital there be transparency in how when and why leaseholder be be charge that be why we have do thing and be do another thing in the past few week alone last week on the new building safety approach for high rise building we be very clear in a joint letter about highlight the importance of temperate remuneration and cost secondly we need to continue to bring forward the reform in the leasehold and freehold reform bill which will see a transformation in transparency on service charge the government bring that bill forward and it will come through as soon as the other place have conclude its observation 
 the minister have do good work in protect leaseholder and renter from remediation cost above metre as a leaseholder myself i be a bit baffled as to why people be not protect when fire remediation measure be necessary below metre i would be grateful if he could explain the government ’s reasoning 
 when the building safety act which put in place the differentiation be go through we be very clear and ask colleague on the floor of the house for any example of where there be potential issue below metre if my right hon friend or any other member have an issue i would be very keen to hear from they the reality be that over the past   year nearly we have receive only potential issue of those we can count on hand where there have be a problem we be work with each of those building to make the progress we need to make 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 the select committee welcome the more than £ provide through the building safety fund to private leaseholder with regard to remediation due to fire safety work on the other hand social housing provider receive only £ which be about of the amount go to private leaseholder how can it possibly be fair that in a block of flat a private leaseholder get their remediation cost pay but in the same flat next door a social housing tenant have to pay for the total cost out of their rent that simply be not fair minister have accept the unfairness in the past when will they do something about it 
 as my constituency neighbour recognise there be rightly a substantial amount of taxpayer subsidy for remediation we be try to ensure that that taxpayer subsidy be then claw back from those responsible for the problem in the place where there be challenge and issue with register provider we be very happy to talk to they we have do that and we have make change where necessary 
 follow a fire last summer timber and unplasticized polyvinyl chloride cladding on home in the borough of barnet be identify as need remediation a number of those home be in my constituency homeowner be face bill of £ will the government help they with those bill 
 this important issue be very much on our radar and that we be work through i have meeting about it only a few day ago and i continue to do so perhaps i could update my right hon friend separately outside the chamber with further information about our propose approach 
 i call the shadow minister 
 soar service charge be place an intolerable financial strain on leaseholder and those with share ownership across the country among the main driver of the eye watering demand with which many have be serve over recent month be stagger rise in building insurance premium and the passing on of significant cost relate to the functioning of the new building safety regime give that many leaseholder be be push to the very limit of what they can afford do the government now accept that the service charge transparency provision in the leasehold and freehold reform bill and plead with freeholder to take a temperate approach be not enough and that ministers should explore with urgency what further measure could be include to protect leaseholder well from unreasonable charge and give they more control over their building 
 the hon gentleman be aware that our substantial reform package set out clearly and transparently the change that be be introduce and what people be expect to pay it could not be clear than it be in the legislation which be of my reason for want it to proceed as quickly as possible when there be issue we be keen to look at they and where we can take action but the leasehold and freehold reform bill be design to improve transparency and reduce problem and i be sure that it will do that once it have complete its passage here and in the other place 
 whether he have make an estimate of the number of planning authority that do not have an up to date local plan 
 at the end of march local planning authority a of the total have adopt a local plan in the past year while have plan that be more than year old of those more than half be make progress towards update their plan the government have make it clear that authority should continue to update their plan because that be the good way to deliver development that be in the interest of local community 
 my liberal democrat run local council be of those without an up to date local plan in fact it have now delay its plan until which mean that place such as burbage have housing without full protection that put pressure on our gp service our school place and even our road what more can the government do to persuade liberal democrat run hinckley and bosworth borough council to ensure that its plan be establish and update so that my resident have the require protection 
 my hon friend have raise this matter in the chamber before and it be a great example of why it be so important that bosworth have this conservative member of parliament to highlight the challenge and failure of the liberal democrat council ultimately the government will not hesitate to take action against council that be not fulfil their obligation indeed my right hon friend the secretary of state have do so over the past few month and we will continue to do so because we expect council to do their job and put their plan in place when liberal democrat council fail to do that we will call they out 
 york have of the bad housing crisis in the country yet we have not have a local plan to restrain developer for year why have it take this tory government more than year to deliver a local plan for york 
 i be relatively clear that the labour party have be in charge of york for a substantial proportion of the last year if the hon lady want an answer to her question about why there be no local plan she should look to her own party 
 to help local authority finalise their local plan my hon friend and his ministerial colleague have make significant   change to the planning rule as a result wiltshire have cut its house building by north somerset have reduce its house building plan by and rivers and other be do likewise to ensure that local plan well reflect their community do my hon friend expect all local authority to consider whether the new rule apply in their community 
 it be vital for local council to follow what be in the national planning policy framework we know that where local plan be in place council build more house but most important they build more house in the right place so that community can be confident that they be be build where they be need 
 the problem with the government ’s developer lead approach to planning be that it mean that we see house build for demand but not for local need in a community such as the lake district developer will sell anything they can build but will it meet the need of local community often it will not will the minister ensure that local authority and national park put together local plan be allow to designate land specifically and exclusively for genuinely affordable housing so that they can say no to the house we do not need and yes to the one we do 
 as the hon gentleman know the planning system have a substantial amount of flexibility it be of the frustration to ensure that local council do the right thing where they do the right thing they should be celebrate where they do not we should criticise they and hope that they be throw out if the hon gentleman be argue against developer lead planning capitalism as it be otherwise know that be a very interesting place for liberalism in this country to go 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the community ownership fund on local community 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the community ownership fund on local community 
 community ownership can boost local connection and pride of place and bolster resilience so far we have award about £ to project across the uk we be work with an external evaluation partner on an evaluation of the fund we be already see some great example of cof project make a real difference to their community such as grow the glens in northern ireland and east boldre community store in the south east of england 
 there have already be worthy beneficiary of the community ownership fund in my constituency the village shop in llandyrnog the salusbury arms in tremeirchion which the minister have visit and rhyl football club which hop to secure the future   of its ground belle vue his department have be very helpful throughout but what further advice and guidance can be provide for applicant in future round 
 i enjoy visit the salusbury arms with my hon friend and raise a glass to the community there ahead of round we launch a brand new expression of interest process which provide interested applicant with an outcome within minute to support applicant at the stage we have also update the prospectus and other guidance on gov.uk we want to help as many community as possible to benefit from the fund spread the benefit of level up nationwide 
 do the minister agree that the recent grant of £ to the owain glyndŵr hotel in corwen in clwyd south be a wonderful example of the hugely beneficial impact of the community ownership fund on local community the grant will enable this much love hotel to play a central role in the town again and to benefit from the reopening of corwen station and the other project in corwen arise from my clwyd south levelling up fund 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight that exciting project which seek to secure the future of the owain glyndŵr hotel and develop it into a community social hub showcase the life and history of the area i agree that the project be a great example of what the community ownership fund seek to do across our united kingdom the fund not only safeguard priceless and much love local asset but support ambition and build opportunity in local area i will be visit north wales in the very near future and will test my diary to see whether it be possible to swing by and say da iawn 
 the minister mention pub that have be rescue and secure for the community but where historic local pub which be at time hub of the community have be wreck by absentee owner and therefore require capital investment do he envisage the funding be use in that regard as well 
 the fund be open to community group charity and town and parish council i can not promise the hon gentleman that the pub to which he refer would be eligible but i be more than happy to meet he follow this session to get further detail 
 mr speaker i know you know that there could not possibly be a well project to receive funding from the government than the rhondda tunnel which would connect blaencwm and blaengwynfi i be very happy to dangle all the ministers down the hole and into the tunnel if they ever want to come and see it i know the secretary of state know all about it because i have meeting with he about it several year ago i have meet lot of ministers who have privately be very supportive and tell i to apply for this that or the other fund but not a single penny have yet transpire an official have recently tell rhondda cynon taf county borough council that it should make a specific exemption for an application for money be that still a possibility to ensure that the rhondda tunnel come to pass 
 i do not think that the community ownership fund be the appropriate fund as i have just say to   the hon member for leyton and wanstead john cryer the community ownership fund be open to charity to community group and to town and parish council but with regard to the hon gentleman ’s tunnel project i would be more than happy to meet he and identify what funding opportunity be available 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the town fund on local community 
 as part of their town investment plan place be require to consult extensively with local community and to evidence how this feedback shape their plan the impact of the town fund on local community be also a crucial part of the town fund impact evaluation to be publish in early 
 success of the town fund be the breadth of project which in king ’s lynn include shakespeare ’s st george ’s guildhall a new community library and adult skill centre and a school of nursing study can my hon friend confirm that the very welcome extra £ through the long term plan for town that lynn have just be award can be use to complement those scheme as well as to secure other investment into the area 
 i thank my hon friend for his commitment to level up in king ’s lynn and across norfolk our long term plan for town put power back into the hand of local people each town must set up a new town board comprise of local community representative and the members of parliament for the respective area who be responsible for develop the long term plan for their area underpin by evidence of extensive community engagement this plan can include the regeneration project that my hon friend have mention if that be consider a local priority i look forward to work with he and to see the plan when they be finally bring forward 
 i thank the minister for his answer he will recall that i ask some time ago about the ards and north down council ’s whitespots project a historical project for tourism that relate to the world war and also to the history of mining in the area the minister say that when the northern ireland assembly be up and run he would be keen to ensure that the project could take place can he confirm that the money necessary for the project be there and will he ensure that he as minister do everything he can to make it happen 
 i can not give the hon gentleman the assurance that he seek but i can say that the £ that be set aside for northern ireland in round of the levelling up fund have be give to the northern ireland executive as part of the executive reformation fund i be in northern ireland over the recess where we be celebrate more than £ of levelling up funding go to northern ireland since 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be now approach year since the town fund be launch promise £ of investment to level up the country most of it remain unspent and the cross party public accounts committee have say that the department for levelling up could not 
 give any compelling example of what have be deliver so far 
 that be a damn assessment of this year of the fund never mind after year in power so minister why be this government such a failure 
 i think that be quite poor mr speaker the hon gentleman ’s constituency have itself benefit from £ of uk share prosperity funding and £ from the levelling up fund next to he i see   the hon member for oldham west and royton jim mcmahon whose constituency have benefit from £ from the town fund oldham be also the recipient of £ from the future high street fund we be level up right across the country include in the hon gentleman ’s constituency 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the level of government funding allocate to local authority 
 in answer to the hon lady ’s question we make continuous assessment with regard to the adequacy of funding in this financial year we have make £ available to local government in england an above inflation increase for local authority as their real term increase in core spending power be now up to £ or in cash term that include the additional measure for local authority worth £ that we announce on   january have listen to the view of local government to her view when she engage in the consultation and to the view of hon and right hon friend across shropshire 
 i thank the minister for his answer but we have see shropshire council make £ of cut this year and we be tell that there will be £ of cut next year to avoid a section notice local resident be particularly concerned about the potential closure of recycling centre and a likely increase in fly tipping across our beautiful countryside do the minister agree that rural council be in danger of deliver nothing more than statutory service if thing continue will he consider adjust the way that funding be allocate so that rural council be give an amount that reflect the cost of deliver service in their area 
 the hon lady be right to point to the need to review the formula which be a commitment for the next parliament she will probably be aware i hope she be of the £ extra that shropshire council receive this year through the rural service delivery grant in order to deliver those sort of service do i think rural council have to reduce to statutory service   alone no all my engagement with the sector point to a vibrancy and a commitment to innovation shape place and improve the life of people up and down the country include in shropshire 
 trevor from the drighlington memory café trevor have be ably support by our fantastic morley town mayor nicola from the morley grief group dan from wf3 kindness and christine from the veteran luncheon club be just some of the amazing volunteer and community group in my area who give up their time to help local people will the minister join i in thank and pay tribute to the unsung hero in our community across the country 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we should never lose an opportunity to trumpet our thank to people like trevor christine and all our volunteer up and down the country who make such a difference to people ’s life they work alongside council and other body to make life well and happy and to make place more pleasant to live i thank they unreservedly 
 funding cut be add to the clear pressure on local government around the country such example be developer who come armed with substantial fund and resource to contest their planning application locally warwick district council have an application just last week that the planning committee be essentially advise to allow because of a fear of not have the financial resource to contest it i have write to the secretary of state about this issue should we be extremely concerned about it nationally 
 each planning authority have a quasi judicial role to adjudge planning application against national and local plan and i have every confidence that plan committee up and down the country do that if the hon gentleman wish to refer to a cash term increase for local government in this financial year as a cut that be a very eccentric definition even for a labour member 
 minister be aware that maldon district council be allocate £ of levelling up funding my right hon friend   the member for maldon sir john whittingdale the council and i have be inform that the funding must be spend on cultural project despite our have a local plan that will see the closure of st peter ’s hospital we want the money to be spend on level up health and wellbeing which be of the principle of level up will ministers urgently review all our representation so that we can work at pace to sort out this terrible issue and level up our health situation 
 my right hon friend make a powerful point and i know st peter ’s hospital pretty well from a previous life the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend   the member for redcar jacob young have signal to i that he be aware of the issue have sympathy with my right hon friend and will be happy to meet she in pretty quick time to discuss further detail 
 i call the shadow minister 
 work people be pay the price of the cost of living crisis but be it not the truth that the liz truss mini budget do not occur in a vacuum there be a pattern of the tories shift the tax burden on to hard press household council tax bill have rocket by almost £ since the tories come to power on top of which conservative council charge resident almost £ more than their labour counterpart as voter go to the poll on   may do the minister hope that they will somehow forget the council tax bombshell face they or do he expect that more candidate will follow the lead of the west midland campaign and ditch the toxic tory brand completely 
 the hon gentleman win prize in the brass neck of the afternoon competition i remind he gently and politely about the situation in birmingham it be well know by resident up and down the land that conservative lead council be more efficient deliver great improvement at pace and be far more focused on deliver for their resident colleague and i will take that proud record to the voter during this local election campaign and i have every confidence we will triumph in it 
 what the criterion be for allocation of round of the community ownership fund 
 our decision make criterion for the community ownership fund can be find in the publish explanatory note on gov.uk round window have now close and will be assess accord to those criterion round window will open in the come week 
 i be delighted to hear that so many project have receive a large amount of money to take over community centre heritage building pub and sporting facility the list also include green space so will the minister confirm that if a community group want to buy part of a chalk stream that be for sale for the benefit of that community that would be within the scope of the community ownership fund 
 i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss this matter we have fund similar land purchase but this will be dependent on the factor locally 
 what progress he have make on end rough sleeping 
 what step his department be take to end rough sleeping 
 the government be commit to end rough sleeping we publish our cross government strategy end   rough sleeping for good in september and we be invest an unprecedented £ to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping over year rough sleeping level be low in than they be at the peak in and they be low than pre pandemic level 
 this government and department have preside over a litany of failure the conservative party have pledge to end rough sleeping by the end of this parliament i have to disagree with the hon lady because rough sleeping number be yet again on the up instead of fulfil their manifesto commitment the government have prioritise criminalise the homeless rather than end homelessness even many conservative back benchers can not support that so when will this department ’s leadership grow a backbone and tell their colleague in the home office to shelve the pernicious plan that exist within the criminal justice bill 
 this government be absolutely committed to end rough sleeping which be why we be invest £ importantly £ be go into prevention so that we prevent homelessness before it happen i want to address the point about the criminal justice bill the government be clear that no should be criminalise for have nowhere to live the bill give power to the police and local authority only where behaviour cause damage distress harassment or disruption guidance will be issue that make it clear that outreach and support should be prioritise 
 i welcome the fact that the government be invest £ on tackle homelessness and rough sleeping notwithstanding what the minister just say do she agree that we need to help people off the street not risk criminalise they as be regrettably propose in part of the criminal justice bill 
 i thank my hon friend for his word welcome government expenditure on tackle rough sleeping and homelessness the government be very focused on help the most vulnerable in our society who be often rough sleeper that be a cross government effort for instance i work closely with the department for education on care leaver and i work closely with the department of health and social care on those who have addiction i reassure my hon friend that no will be criminalise simply for sleep rough 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as well as try to criminalise rough sleeper put they in jail and give they a hefty fine it be crystal clear that the government will not meet their target to end rough sleeping by the end of rough sleeping be all too plain to see as we walk into this place or go to any city or town we see the tragic consequence of government policy be it not now time for minister to do the right thing end section no fault eviction for good no if no but no excuse and narrative about the court and build the home for social rent at the scale the country need if they do not do that we will 
 we be abolish section and build affordable home where be affordable home not be build in london 
 what step he be take to help improve the efficiency of the planning system 
 we be take significant step to speed up the planning system in large infrastructure project that be through the nationally significant infrastructure project action plan and the get great britain build again policy paper in relation to the tcpa we be offer great clarity through the republication of the national planning policy framework great consistency through instruct local council to ensure that they discharge their responsibility and great capacity through additional support for local council 
 can i convey the extreme irritation of parish in my constituency that have have location for a mobile phone mast turn down give that mobile connectivity be now an essential requirement be it not time that local authority advise on which technically feasible location they would be prepare to grant planning permission local people could then say where they be happy for such project to go and we would end this stupid cat and mouse game that waste time and mean people do not get the connectivity they need 
 my hon friend be right that connectivity be vital in all our community it be incumbent upon local council include his council in bedfordshire to ensure that they be provide the great clarity possible for that connectivity and that it be put in place 
 what step his department be take to help promote interfaith dialogue 
 this government be extremely supportive of effort to bring together people of different faith and belief the faith minister meet regularly with faith leader to encourage these effort and the department have fund a range of partner include near neighbours and strengthen faith institutions to organise local level interfaith dialogue 
 i thank the minister for her answer but month ago the secretary of state announce that he would pull funding from the inter faith network which be the large interfaith charity on these island it will close next week after year it be an astonishing decision by the uk government to close britain ’s main forum for jewish muslim dialogue now the secretary of state could still reverse that very poor decision but that would have to happen this week what be the chance of that 
 let i explain what occur the closure of the inter faith network be a matter for the inter faith network as an independent charity it be not a matter for government we have always make it very clear to all charity that receive government funding   that they need to have sustainable source of other funding in my response to the urgent question about a month ago i make clear the reason for the closure to repeat the decision to withdraw the funding be take because of the appointment of a member of the muslim council of britain as a trustee government of various different hue have decide that they will not deal with the muslim council of britain

 i just remind everyone that we be on topical question 
 i think snp press release have suffer recently as a result of the travail that the chief executive of that party have be suffer but as snp press release go that have to be of the weak i have ever hear in this house the scottish government be close visitscotland centre they can not deliver ferry scotland be plunge down the educational league table and when it come to deliver service in scotland theatre community centre and council be come to we for cash the scottish government be a disaster and all the hon lady can do be repeat the fail talking point

 in constituency such as aldridge brownhills our green belt be precious and once it have go it have go forever but in the west midland thank to the leadership and vision of mayor andy street and his brownfield approach we have see new home build and thousand of new job on brownfield land do my right hon friend agree that that clearly demonstrate that we can build the new home we need and protect the green belt and that it be andy street who be set the pace and lead the way in the west midland 
 that be spot on it be andy street and conservative council in walsall dudley and solihull that be deliver house and protect the green belt that be well for economic growth well for the environment and well than bankrupt labour birmingham 
 over family in luton south be stick in temporary accommodation with wait time range from   to month for a bed property to to year for a bed across the country there have be a staggering increase in temporary accommodation number since do the minister agree that that be just a direct cost of year of conservative failure on housing 
 the government be very focused on temporary accommodation that be why we be invest £ of which £ be specifically for the homelessness prevention grant in the last budget we increase the local housing allowance rate to the percentile that be worth £ we have also increase the local authority housing fund 
 please can my right hon friend set out what the government be do to ensure that more young people can live in their own home as early as possible in their adult life and specifically whether great consideration can be give   to mechanism that result in only affordable payment be make a month rather than mortgage payment and rental payment 
 my hon friend make an important point we need to look to reform both the mortgage market and our planning system we will bring forward further step on both in the come week 
 in community such as kendal appleby allithwaite and milnthorpe developer have use viability assessment to renege on build desperately need and genuinely affordable home so will the government give planning authority the power to declare null and void any planning permission where the developer can not or will not deliver the affordable home that they have promise 
 i know how important it be to deliver affordable home in the lake district in the hon gentleman ’s constituency we will take a close look at the example he cite to ensure that we be not kill the goose that lie the golden egg 
 tourism be vital to bournemouth ’s economy and half our visitor come by car a few choose to park on double yellow line for the day as the parking penalty be only £ unlike here in london where it be £ increase to £ if not pay promptly do the secretary of state agree that it would be immensely helpful and would ensure that emergency vehicle access be not block be bournemouth allow to operate the same penalty as we have in london 
 my right hon friend be right antisocial parking be a blight outside london and we need to review extend the power that be currently exercise in london to other part of the country 
 time and again leasehold owner come to i with unfair bill for service charge they be inflate and they be even for undelivered service when i get involve they be often drop by a instantly what will the government do to ensure that developer be not try to rip off homeowner and instead get bill right the time 
 fair point frank dobson say that he be go to reform the leasehold system in we be do it now the leasehold and freehold reform bill which the minister for housing planning and building safety my hon friend   the member for north east derbyshire lee rowley be pilot will bring relief to leaseholder 
 a raft of labour councillor in kirklees have resign from their party with of they describe their leadership as a toxic swamp so it will come as no surprise to my right hon friend that the local conservative campaign to split kirklees and get well leadership and accountability be really gather momentum do he agree that leadership need to be locally drive and that the good way to achieve that be to vote for more conservative councillor on   may 
 order this be not fair just tell i which question you do n’t want and it will make my job easy 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we need change in kirklees the good way in which people can demonstrate their desire for change and the reconfiguration of kirklees be by vote conservative on   may 
 today be earth day the government introduce the carbon home standard and the code for sustainable home and then scrap they the future home standard now have centralise support but local authority such as leeds want to go above plan policy to reach high standard why will the secretary of state not allow leed to build even well carbon home 
 we have a good relationship with leeds city council and indeed with its leader and chief executive so let i investigate 
 ben houchen have do a remarkable job of save our airport oversee the redevelopment of teesworks and secure new job do my right hon friend agree that give ben ’s record of deliver and the promise of more voter should back he on   may 
 that be an easy 
 it be an easy you be right mr speaker everyone should back ben houchen 
 let i help it be an easy for you to answer now let we move on 
 i thank the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities   the hon member for north dorset simon hoare for his reply to my letter of   march he say that a short paper on the topic of the union be prepare by official and present to the uk government in july however a media report at the time suggest that an employee of hanbury strategy have provide datum and help to prepare that paper for the cabinet be public money use for the insight that hanbury strategy prepare for that paper and when will the public get to see they 
 once again i have to admire the sheer chutzpah of scottish national party member talk about the misappropriation of cash however as i mention early the scottish government ’s budget have lead to the closure of tourist information centre and a variety of other venture that be try to get investment into scotland whereas the uk government be provide investment in scotland prove once again that we be well together 
 my constituent be increasingly concerned about the number of planning application be approve particularly in rural area when the infrastructure and public service quite evidently can not cope with the demand what plan do minister have to ensure that local resident have more say in future 
 the new national planning policy framework as enact by this front bench team will ensure that local voice determine the shape of local community 
 my constituent who live on the abbottsmoor estate in port talbot be lock into pay unjustified and extortionate ground rent fee and charge for poor maintenance will the secretary of state commit to strengthen the leasehold and freehold reform bill by ensure that all leaseholder have the right to vary their lease set ground rent to a peppercorn ensure that premium be as cheap as possible regulate manage agent and abolish forfeiture 
 i always listen with respect to argument make by a kinnock and in this case i think the hon gentleman be broadly broadly in the right territory 
 what step be be take to ensure that planning authority and more importantly the planning inspectorate be utilise the power in the new nppf to protect land use in food production 
 the nppf could not be clear about that the new chief executive of the planning inspectorate be very aware of how important it be to ensure that there be public confidence in the nppf 
 my constituency have some of the high level of health inequality in the country which have be far increase by the cost of live crisis and the continual cut to our council budget if the government be serious about level up why be bradford east ’s bid to reduce health inequality knock back 
 the labour leadership in bradford council must look to its performance i think there be a distinction to be draw between the labour leadership in leeds and in bradford bradford could learn a lot from what leeds have do this be not a party political point it be a point about failure specifically in bradford 
 my constituent have significant concern about crime and antisocial behaviour in the town centre public space protection order can play an important role but the local labour council refuse to use the power it have we have group of man drink alcohol in the middle of the town centre and the council do nothing do the secretary of state agree that yet again ipswich labour should step up 
 it be sad but not surprising that labour in ipswich have fail again that be why it be so important that people vote conservative at the police and crime commissioner election on   may there be few more effective scourge of crime than the conservative police and crime commissioner tim passmore and my hon friend who do such a brilliant job in ipswich 
 urgent question to ask the deputy foreign secretary if he will make a statement on the government ’s response to the crisis in sudan 
 i thank the hon lady for her question 
 britain be pursue all diplomatic avenue to press   the war party into a permanent ceasefire allow unrestricted humanitarian access protect civilian and commit to a sustained and meaningful peace process i visit eastern chad last month where i meet with refugee who have lose everything and be flee conflict and hunger i be greatly move by what i see and reaffirm britain ’s steadfast commitment to the people of sudan some of those cross the border be woman and child 
 on monday to mark year of brutal conflict in sudan britain announce its raft of sanction target entity link to the rapid support forces and entity link to the sudanese armed force on the same day my noble friend lord benyon represent the uk at the paris humanitarian pledge conference for sudan and its neighbour on behalf of the uk he pledge £ a near doubling of uk overseas development aid for sudan from the previous year he deliver a strong message with international partner which along with britain ’s sanction send a clear signal to the war party that they must stop fight and meaningfully engage in the peace process 
 we continue to lead at the united nations security council where we hold the pen on sudan on   march the un security council adopt a uk draft ramadan ceasefire resolution call for immediate cessation of hostility on   march we warn that obstruction of humanitarian access by the saf and rsf be result in the starvation of the sudanese people over the past year britain have provide £ in humanitarian aid to support people in sudan include £ to unicef for nutrition activity and approximately £ to the sudan humanitarian fund for multi sector response include a high proportion of food security intervention 
 britain have also help those flee to neighbouring country last year we provide £ to support new and exist sudanese refugee in south sudan and £ to chad we continue to advocate for a return to a civilian lead government and we urge all sudanese stakeholder to engage in an inclusive dialogue that will deliver the peace and stability that the sudanese people deserve 
 i be grateful for that answer 
 the sheer horror unleash by the general war   in sudan be appal to recount we be approach   people forcibly displace with evidence of systematic sexual violence and heinous mass atrocity in darfur and elsewhere some sudanese child under the age of be acutely malnourish and massive famine be now see as almost inevitable some model project up to a death as the un secretary general say this be 
 a war on the sudanese people 
 and it must end with an immediate ceasefire 
 i strongly welcome the sanction from last week and the additional humanitarian funding but be there go to be a dedicated high level sudan envoy and what conversation be minister have with those who continue to fund and enable this war because great co ordination have to be the priority all state must recognise the truly disastrous consequence if sudan collapse not just for the sudanese people but for the entire region 
 but there be hope because through all the horror and the destruction despite the block on humanitarian access the sudanese people be still stand together in their own community the resistance committee and the emergency room be sometimes the sole source of relief as famine spread and medical access run out for the sick and injure and they be the undaunted spirit and hope of a sudan free from the general and their catastrophic war how can we correct the mistake of the past and back sudanese civilian directly 
 i thank the hon lady very much for the eloquent way in which she have outline the position in sudan and she be absolutely right on the subject of the sudan envoy let i assure she that there be a very strong and very experienced envoy who cover the horn of africa and she focus particularly on sudan the hon lady eloquently set out the wide effect of sudan continue on this path in the region and i agree with she and she also make clear the benefit that the emergency room sometimes the only source of relief be provide 
 the hon lady ask about the mistake that have be make in the past in respect of civilian rule britain have call i think from across all part of this house for a ceasefire so that the general take their troop back to barrack and the political space have a chance to advance she will know that abdalla hamdok and taqaddum the civil society political grouping have be work together support by britain in a conference in addis ababa and elsewhere we be very committed to try to work with they so that there be sensible but broad political offer for sudan as and when the chance of a ceasefire and the political track re engaging take place 
 i call the chair of the intelligence and security committee 
 do the government have any evidence that they can share with this house of the involvement of major foreign power in what be happen in this terrible conflict in sudan 
 my right hon friend will have see the open source reporting of various outlet the point the british government make on all occasion be that any arm supply into sudan merely prolong this conflict and we urge anyone who be think of supply either side or supply either side to think very carefully and to desist 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 last week the raoul wallenberg centre for human rights release a detailed report on the genocide in darfur the report describe atrocity crime include massacre sexual    violence the burning of village and the destruction of key infrastructure all target darfurians in the region the author of the report say 
 just year after the genocide the same perpetrator be commit the same atrocity against the same innocent group all while evade accountability 
 can i ask the minister whether he have read the report and be his department planning to meet the raoul wallenberg centre what be the government ’s own assessment of the risk of genocide in darfur and how be they plan to implement their obligation under the genocide convention finally have a joint analysis of conflict and stability be carry out on the situation in sudan and if not why not if it have will he share those finding with the house 
 the hon gentleman be right to focus on what be happen in darfur he will know that we have fund the centre for information resilience which investigate attack on civilian and be monitor and keep record wherever possible so that at some point day there can be accountability and no impunity he will also be aware that the position in darfur he ask i this question specifically bear all the hallmark of ethnic cleansing i visit darfur in and again in with the foreign secretary it have be a significant preoccupation of this house and rightly so the hon gentleman may rest assure that we be do everything we can to support the poor and long suffer people of darfur in every way we can but he will equally understand the physical constraint on be able to do that in the way that we would wish 
 this have be describe as the world ’s bad humanitarian crisis in decade and the war that the world choose to ignore last week member of the all party group on sudan and south sudan hear from eyewitness and aid worker we hear of people on the brink of famine of aid convoy be hold at gunpoint of aid be loot and of aid worker murder the war the misery have go on for a year and it be get bad people want to know what the uk as the penholder at the un be do to try to shift the dial and bring peace on behalf of the all party group i ask what pressure be we put on the united arab emirates and iran to stop they supply arm what action be be take to enable the aid convoy to move what be be do to end the culture of impunity why have those already indict for genocide never be hold to account and why will the uk not appoint a dedicated envoy so we can show that we put all our diplomatic weight behind effort to find peace 
 we always consider whether the issue of the envoy could be boost and as i say to my right hon friend we think that the position at the moment be provide maximum effect but we keep such matter under review i pay particular tribute to she and the appg for the work they do she be entirely right in what she say the un issue a white note on   march warn of the risk of conflict induce famine at least humanitarian aid worker have be murder people be displace and nearly people be suffer acute level of food insecurity that be of the population and among they be child who be face the deadly form of malnutrition 
 as have be say almost people in sudan be in need of assistance more than people have be leave displace and the life of child and new mother be at grave risk due to famine the united nations office for the co ordination of humanitarian affairs report that $ be need to meet the huge humanitarian need in the country i note from what the minister say that the uk have double the humanitarian aid that it have commit but do the minister agree that that still fall far short of the threshold ultimately it will achieve very little if there be not a ceasefire and an end to the fighting to allow that aid to be distribute safely what be the uk government do along with our international partner to ensure that we achieve that immediate and lasting ceasefire soon rather than later 
 the hon gentleman be right to say that a ceasefire be essential with troop return to barrack and the opening up of a political track and that be the central thrust of the british government ’s policy he acknowledge that we have manage nearly to double aid to £ this year for south sudan this of course also address many of the problem of sudan the figure for this financial year be £ which be more than double what it be that include multilateral and bilateral spend the fact that britain have double its contribution give it a locus which be well use by my noble friend lord benyon last week in paris at the sudan conference to make the point about other country also support give the desperate plight in which so many in sudan find themselves 
 i welcome this urgent question and the government ’s response we regularly talk about what be go on in ukraine and the middle east but we do not focus on the continent of africa or sudan which be turn into a fail state there be every prospect of what be go on in sudan spill out into other part of central africa and the sahel will the deputy foreign secretary update the house on whether we have any presence in port sudan he talk about peace talk egypt have also engage in those so can he update the house on the prospect of what be happen bring the necessary party together 
 in respect of my right hon friend ’s final point we be hopeful that the set of negotiation in jeddah will take place the saudis commit on   april   to that happen in early may and we be extremely grateful to the saudis for that and for invite the uae egypt the african union and the intergovernmental authority on development to be part of the negotiation the former chairman of the defence committee be right about the danger of contagion across the region we be do everything we can to support abdalla hamdok and the taqaddum as i mention early in term of our support within sudan the ambassador be currently base in addis ababa and be work energetically with all the relevant party to try to make progress 
 the sudanese community in liverpool riverside will be decidedly underwhelme by the minister ’s response to this urgent question he mention support people move to   neighbouring area but he do not mention the sudanese who have live work and contribute for year to the uk bring over family member who be flee the conflict or extend student visa or protection for sudanese asylum seeker what will it take for the uk to provide a visa programme for sudanese asylum seeker similar to the ukrainian scheme 
 the situation be not analogous if the labour party want to launch a campaign for extra visa and a special scheme match the in ukraine i look forward to hear detail of it 
 my wife and i spend a wonderful holiday in sudan a few year ago and it be wonderful to see the amazing people there as well as the rich cultural heritage that sudan have to offer there be many world heritage site such as the pyramid of meroë there be more pyramid in sudan than egypt ancient cathedral and even lord kitchener ’s boat we hear that fighting have spread to some of the world heritage area unesco be protect world heritage area meroë and gebel barkal under the heritage emergency fund to which the uk government contribute but what further work and money can the uk put in to protect this world heritage bolster unesco and protect these ancient and important aspect of our civilisation 
 my hon friend be right about the great heritage and deep link include heritage link between britain and sudan over many year the truth be that we have to do everything we can hold the pen on sudan at the united nations as we do to achieve this ceasefire and the reopening of political space if we can do that we can focus directly on the point that he make 
 what discussion have the minister have with other country to apply pressure to stop the flow of arm into this conflict and to try to bring it to an end as soon as possible 
 these discussion be take place in the margin of the united nations and at the conference that take place in paris on monday last week the hon gentleman be right to emphasise that we need to ensure that arm do not fuel the conflict and that be why britain urge everyone to ensure there be no further arming of either party the arm embargo go all the way over darfur and would be over the whole of sudan if the chinese and russians be willing to sign up with the rest of we to implement it 
 i call jim shannon 
 thank you mr speaker you have catch i off balance i be just about to take my diabetic tablet when you call i i thank the minister for his answer to the uq he will be aware that more than people have be kill and nearly displace and christians be face persecution what support be the government offering to non governmental organisation on the ground such as church missionary who seek to help displace christians not only feed child but provide they with a semblance of an education and most importantly hope of a future life 
 the hon gentleman will understand the great difficulty in help directly on the ground i know the matter be of great interest both to he and to the prime minister ’s envoy for freedom of religion or belief my hon friend   the member for congleton fiona bruce we must continue to find every possible way of support the important group that he mention 
 i draw the minister ’s attention to a report on the bbc website in case he have not read it by zeinab mohammed salih a sudanese journalist she recall 
 people have tell i of ethnically target killing and sexual violence they remain traumatised month afterwards 
 the minister may be aware that month before the war break out sexual violence and gender base violence be be use against woman in june it be estimate that there be more than survivor of conflict relate sexual violence in sudan and we continue to see report of sexual violence what step be the government take to address that really important issue and to prevent further case of violence and of rape be use as a war weapon 
 i be afraid that the hon lady be entirely right we have read these report and many other with horror that be of the reason why we be support the centre for information resilience so that we can do everything we can to deter there be any question of impunity but it be extraordinarily difficult as she rightly say what be happen in darfur bear all the hallmark of ethnic cleansing 
 the attention pay to the conflict in sudan do not reflect the enormity of the suffering there with million displace and face famine violence and insecurity as chair of the all party parliamentary group for africa i thank my hon friend   the member for west ham ms brown   for secure the urgent question the minister speak about the limited arm embargo such as it be be he aware that it be be break on a grand scale and that there be a pervasive flow of arm into sudan what be he do to monitor that and to try to reduce that flow of arm which be fuel the conflict 
 on the hon lady ’s point i have set out the clear message from the british government about the supply of arm on her point she be right that conflict elsewhere in the world particularly in ukraine and gaza have to some extent take attention away from sudan and indeed ethiopia on which in geneva last tuesday britain be lead the effort to raise money to head off a famine part of the benefit of the urgent question be that we can make clear the threat what be happen in sudan and what britain be do to try to assist 
 sudanese student at heriot watt university in my constituency be desperately worried about their family member in sudan when i meet they last year at the request of the university chaplain many of their family member need help flee to neighbouring country and other have seek family reunification with british citizen   already live here what be the government do to help british citizen to save the life of their relative in sudan 
 the hon and learn lady will know the step that britain take a year ago to help those who be seek to leave but since then the vast amount of migration have be across the border into chad and south sudan and indeed into ethiopia britain have contribute £ to help those whom i see near adré on the border between sudan and chad at the end of last month in respect of south sudan where there be a significant and increase programme of humanitarian support we have directly contribute nearly £ 
 i recently meet the community president and secretary general of the sudanese community association of greater manchester we discuss the horrific civil war in sudan and the desperate need to bring about a peaceful and sustainable end to the conflict the war may be take place in sudan but it have huge implication for sudanese community in britain like the in manchester what support be the foreign commonwealth and development office provide sudanese community in britain who be try to support their love one who be flee from violence to reach a place of safety 
 there be very little we can do until those people reach a place of safety as i say many have flee across the border into chad and south sudan we be actively help those people in the way that i describe 
 sudan be experience the bad displacement crisis in the world it be not so much a civil war but a war on civilian who be lose their home livelihood and live on a scale that be hard to comprehend the sudanese people feel forgotten so it be vital that both aid and political focus be forthcoming will the minister work with his home office colleague to support sudanese people in the asylum system who be beside themselves with worry about family member will he well facilitate reunion for those uk citizen who have family among the most affected and who be able to leave 
 we will do everything we can to assist the hon lady will understand the constraint we work within but i will note what she say if she have any specific case that she wish to raise i hope she will do so 
 give the level of death despair and starvation we need an immediate ceasefire in sudan cross border and cross line humanitarian aid access be be block and impair by both side even though they be in effect starve their own people to death what step be the government take to get the adré crossing open and to expose the impact of rsf extortion on humanitarian aid convoy 
 i be in adré when i visit the border between chad and sudan i see the weight of human misery cross that border—88 of those crossing be woman and child which show that the man have either be murder or go into hiding the hon   gentleman be quite right about the importance of adré he be right about the general effectively wag war on their own people starve their own people as he say that be why everyone be urge the general to desist get their troop back to barracks and give a chance for a political track to reconvene and re emerge 
 what assurance can the minister give the sudanese community in newport who as other have say feel that the conflict and its catastrophic consequence have go largely unseen that the government be do all they can to get aid in through the adré crossing and be try as hard as they can to build consensus among neighbouring and regional state that the war must end 
 i hope that today ’s urgent question will be of some comfort in respect of what the government be seek to do and the role we play at the united nations where we be the penholder and in the troika with norway and the united states to try to bring this awful crisis to a conclusion 
 the information that we have receive via al jazeera and other about the situation in sudan be truly horrendous people have leave their home be experience food shortage and cholera measle and other disease be rife unless there be a rapid ceasefire the planting season simply will not begin and there will be even great and deep hunger not just in sudan but in neighbouring country do the minister have any realistic hope that the combination of the un and the african union and anyone else who can intervene will bring about a ceasefire to allow at least people to return to their home and to be able to feed themselves 
 the former leader of the opposition make the case very clearly the figure he set out show the scale of the disaster that have engulf sudan when i be on the border between chad and sudan near adré i see for myself the work that be be do by organisation such as the world food programme which britain strongly support but also the international rescue committee and médecins sans frontières the work be go on wherever it can but it be extremely difficult because of the circumstance he set out 
 what assessment have be make of the potential level of food insecurity and the level of response need if the conflict go on through the summer and disrupt the next planting season 
 the hon lady be entirely right the world food programme tell i when i be in chad that it effectively have supply of food only until the end of may that be of the reason why britain have increase so substantially its bilateral aid and why my noble friend lord benyon go to the paris meeting on monday last week to make sure that other too put their money where their mouth be and support the desperate situation she describe 
 this morning i have the pleasure to meet some brilliant organisation work   on behalf of people in sudan who be desperate to be reunite with family here in the uk they want answer to question give the circumstance people be have to live in why be it take over a year for many application to be decide secondly why do the government demand that these people make dangerous and illegal cross border journey before they will even consider their application because they have to enrol biometric information that seem completely counterintuitive will the right hon gentleman give the home office a polite kick up the backside and urge a change in approach 
 if the hon gentleman would like to give i detail of any specific case i will of course make sure they be look into 
 what step be the government able to take to stem the flow of resource not only weapon but fuel to the rsf across the border from libya be the government monitor the potential for onwards flow to sudan as a result of continue russian supply of arm within libya 
 we urge all party not to supply weapon to the belligerent in sudan it will merely extend and continue the appalling situation that exist there that be why britain be so clear that we should seek to starve this conflict of any additional weaponry 
 the opposition welcome the government ’s atrocity monitoring and prevention work in sudan even though it be belate it be important to join up that work with our diplomatic effort in support of talk in jeddah next month that be inclusive and effective be there a strategy to use target pressure to help isolate those responsible for atrocity and bring they to justice and to bring both war party to the table 
 in respect of target pressure the hon lady will have see the recent announcement about sanction against both the rsf and the saf and the early step that be take she be right to focus on jeddah which look to be the good bet at the moment for progress britain be give very strong support to that process 
 on monday the government announce sanction against business supply the saf and the rsf what assessment have    the deputy foreign secretary make of how effective they will be in the great scheme of all the arm that be be supply to those war faction 
 the hon lady be right to focus on the sanction although we do not talk about future plan on sanction across the floor of the house the way these thing work be that when we see that sanction be not work as well as we have hop we will always seek to reinforce they that be the nature of impose sanction as we have see in other area we will do everything we can through the sanction regime to advance the objective that she and i share 
 the minister refer to the problem of food security it do seem very likely that the planting season will be disrupt again this year what be the implication for food security in sudan and south sudan this autumn and into next year have a target be set for the amount of international aid to be gather to deal with that loom crisis 
 the target that be require be the subject of continuous discussion particularly with the world food programme and at the united nations and they help to inform the discussion that take place in paris last week however the right hon gentleman be right about the danger of the harvest fail the lean season approach in other part of africa too include ethiopia this be the nature of climate change and sometimes factor like el niño and it be extremely worrying the effect of the harvest failing and the onset of the lean season be very serious in term of nutrition and food dependency 
 i thank the minister for his previous engagement regard a number of my constituent whose family member have be stick and affect by the ongoing conflict in sudan may i ask what conversation he have have with his counterpart in egypt who as far as i understand be still suspend the issue of visa to sudanese national who be hold uk travel document with the result that people be stick in egypt when they could well be here with their family right now if that be not be hold up by the egyptian authority 
 we have an extremely effective embassy team in cairo and elsewhere in egypt with very close relation across the top of the egyptian government and in all part of it if the hon lady wish to raise any specific case with i again i hope that she will do so and i will certainly take they up for she 
 on a point of order mr speaker last week on   april i say 
 all trans child and young people deserve access to high quality and timely healthcare and support around study have not be include in the cass report and we need to know why ”—[official report   april vol c. 
 i be quote from stonewall ’s briefing there be some fallout from that so i have spend the weekend in conversation with stonewall and dr cass it seem that by quote from the briefing i may have inadvertently mislead the house as you know mr speaker i have be throw out of parliament for call the then prime minister a liar so it mean a lot to i to be able to come back and correct the record and practise what i preach 
 i spend the weekend speak to dr cass and i be very grateful for her time she have make it clear not just to i but to the trans and lgbt+ community in a number of valuable clarification on the radio and in other medium that all report be include and that research of both high and moderate quality be consider as part of the evidence review dr cass have also say that her report be be misrepresent and hijack but not by i mr speaker let i make that clear my question to the secretary of state for health be about additional funding for child ’s mental health service the report be be hijack by anti trans group and that be why it be important that we can be as factual as possible about the research 
 i be also concerned about the advice that dr cass be give about her safety and be shock that some people imply that i be partly responsible for 
 order i be really bother about this it be mean to be just a quick correction rather than open up a debate i be grateful to the hon lady for be honest and correct the record she have absolutely do that and have make it very clear that she be correct it other member wish to speak so i have to move on we can not open up a debate the clerk be get very worried 
 on a point of order mr speaker last week during question to the secretary of state for culture media and sport my hon friend the members for bristol west thangam debbonaire and for slough mr dhesi raise the issue of ticket touting in response the minister for media tourism and creative industries   the hon member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez   make claim that i believe be inaccurate 
 the minister claim that legislation in the consumer rights act and the digital economy act deal with some of the issue relate to bot in the secondary market however there do not seem to have be a single conviction specifically for bot use and there be a great deal of evidence that bot be still be use secondly the minister claim that measure to cap resale price in ireland have increase fraudulent activity in fact there be no evidence whatever that such activity have increase fraud be actually report to be down in ireland in the last quarter of and the irish government ’s post enactment report on their sale of tickets cultural entertainment recreational and sporting events act conclude 
 this be a positive endorsement of the operation of the act and mean that the objective of the act be be meet whereby genuine fan can attend event at affordable price 
 i seek your advice mr speaker on how we might encourage the minister to correct the record 
 i thank the hon member for her point of order and for notice of it it be for minister to correct the record if they wish to in the meantime she have certainly put her point on the record for everyone to see 
 presentation and reading standing order no 
 sarah olney present a bill to require the secretary of state to apply for an order for special administration in relation to thames water and for connected purpose 
 bill read the time to be read a time   friday june   and to be print bill 
 consideration of lords message 
 relevant document report of the joint committee on human rights safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill hc and the government response hc 
 i can confirm that nothing in the lords message engage commons financial privilege 
 i beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment 3g. 
 with this it will be convenient to discuss lords amendment 10f and government motion to disagree 
 it appear that i be indeed optimistic last week when i foresaw the end of ping pong and look forward to the time when we be not debate this particular piece of legislation it be disappointing that we be back here again of course the other place should undertake its role as a revise chamber and of course it be entitle to ask the government to think again but we do think again with the house now vote for the time as part of ping pong and strongly endorse this bill we need to bring the process to a conclusion 
 the labour party have vote against our measure to tackle illegal migration time and time it have tell the british people that it oppose our tough immigration legislation enough be enough the opposition have delay this bill for too long and we must get on with it 
 i be sure that like i the minister will have read the law society of england and wales ’s briefing on these amendment have he see the polling it have report which show that the majority of voter think the government should either accept some amendment to the rwanda policy or scrap it altogether only a quarter of the public think the government should try to get the bill through in its current form and all the lords amendment be support by the majority of the public have he see that polling and will he stop try to turn this matter into a political football and address the gravaman of the amendment 
 i certainly will i be very grateful indeed to the hon and learn lady because she get to the point of the amendment she be absolutely right to say that we should address they in detail and i will do just that
