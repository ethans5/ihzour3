it have always be clear to i in my conversation with the bereaved and survivor and with family and next of kin that the demographic in term of race speak their own story and that be similarly the case with disability that be why it have inform our policy in peeps which i will talk to shortly as well as our entire agenda around resident voice in social housing which i will also come on to 
 my hon friend   the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi   and i be in the very early stage of our time as member of parliament in and i know exactly where i be sit during the discussion we have then i can see it but metre from here as i have say in every debate of this kind since i have be a minister if we have say to ourselves then that in year we would have achieve as little as we have we would have think that a significant failure it be a significant failure and i want those watch this debate to know that we understand that my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater say that the progress be glacial that be exactly right and it behove we to change that with real intent that be my commitment and the deputy prime minister ’s commitment 
 last september sir martin moore bick publish the inquiry ’s final report it be a hugely important staging post and driver for action the finding be clear the system fail at every point public private local national family be fail resident voice be ignore dishonest practice be propagate the prime minister have apologise on behalf of the british state for its part in the failure that lead to entirely avoidable death i want to repeat the prime minister ’s word it should never have happen 
 we publish our response to the inquiry in february we accept the finding and commit to deliver on all recommendation and to go far through a broad approach to reform include with regard to construction product last month we publish our progress report on delivery and we will continue to report on a quarterly basis the next progress report in september will be a very big because we will also publish our full implementation plan set out how we will deliver the recommendation i agree with my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater that the legacy must be system change 
 i agree with what my hon friend   the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter   say about it be a long time and i know from speak to the bereaved and survivor that they be frustrated that some of the recommendation will take time the commitment i will make from this dispatch box be that nothing will take a day long than it have to take we be work with urgency and intent and we will be very transparent as we do 
 reading oppose and defer until   tuesday june   standing order no 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what progress his department have make on advance the track-2 acorn cluster 
 happy birthday mr speaker we have always be clear that we support the acorn project my colleague and i have have many discussion with the industry and we know what an important proposal it be as we have say the decision be a matter for the spending review but we be close to have those decision i thank the hon member for speak up on behalf of the acorn project as many hon member across the house have do 
 many happy return mr speaker proposal for carbon capture and storage near peterhead in my constituency have be kick into the long grass by successive uk government last week a report by professor paul de leeuw of robert gordon university warn of the need for urgent action to protect the energy supply chain and accelerate the just transition he warn that thousand upon thousand of job be at risk while i know the secretary of state recognise that the acorn project be a strategic cornerstone of the transition to a low carbon future and economic growth in the north east of scotland and the nation will the government finally commit the funding necessary for the project to proceed 
 we know how important carbon capture usage and storage be the climate change committee say there be no route to net that do not include carbon capture with of course up to good well pay job across the uk the government have already show their commitment to carbon capture   with a £ investment i be afraid that the hon member will have to wait until the spending review for the final decision but i hope he agree that we be put in place ambitious substantial carbon capture plan that will drive growth across the country 
 acorn would go some way to reindustrialise area of scotland which be much need i welcome the government commit £ from the national wealth fund for future industry at grangemouth in my constituency to avoid we again be in the precarious position of have private capital or foreign government ownership dictate our future energy industry do the government plan to take any ownership stake in the industry that will be come at grangemouth 
 my hon friend be right to say that we lose thousand of job under the previous government whether in ceramic chemical or steel the previous government see foundational industry through the rear view mirror but we know that these industry will forge our future that be why we be rush to get to clean energy by so that we can bring price down why we be support our industry through the supercharger and why through the industrial strategy we be look to provide more support not less to those crucial foundational industry 
 what step he be take to reduce reliance on fossil fuel 
 happy birthday to you mr speaker we have be busy since we last meet for oral question we have confirm that rooftop solar panel will be standard on all new build home and have fund £ of clean energy upgrade for over building we have also deliver the solar project for school secure royal assent for great british energy the uk ’s national publicly own energy company in year launch the marine energy taskforce sign a green industrial partnership with norway and kick start community energy right across the country we be ambitious in our plan there be much more to do but we be do more than any other government to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel 
 happy birthday mr speaker most of the farm in westmorland and lonsdale have river or beck run through they since we be the most beautiful and indeed wet place in england that be an awful lot of potential and mostly untapped energy will the secretary of state and the minister meet i and hydro energy expert to consider a new nationwide project to support farmer to have small hydroelectricity scheme on their farm to diversify farm income provide clean energy for the farm and harness natural renewable energy for the wide economy 
 i will not be draw on confirm whether the hon gentleman ’s constituency be the most beautiful part of england i will leave that to he   however what he propose sound like a fantastic idea and i be happy to meet he to discuss it far we see huge potential for a whole range of renewable those kind of innovative project small scale as well be what could deliver not just benefit for the system but real benefit for the community that host they 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 happy birthday mr speaker move from gas to electricity in home heating be an important part of reduce our reliance on fossil fuel yet at the select committee hearing last week we hear real concern that people in energy debt be unable to disconnect from gas and be therefore still stick pay standing charge will the minister say what the government ’s plan be to remove that problem and ensure that more people can take up the opportunity present by electrify home heat 
 my hon friend make important point on the importance of decarbonise heating across the country the electrification of home heat will be an important way of deliver cheap bill for people and reach our decarbonisation target secondly on the important matter of debt i know the minister for energy consumers have be do work with ofgem and we have be look at a debt relief scheme for exactly those sort of question clearly we want to support as many household as possible to move on to cheap heating in the long term we will continue to push forward that work 
 happy birthday mr speaker change in the language by the uk government on the moroccan autonomy plan pave the way for a bright new future between the kingdom do the minister therefore feel that the time be right to finally make a decision on the uk morocco power project that could potentially add of the uk ’s grid requirement and clean energy for the future 
 the right hon gentleman and i have discuss this in the house before he be right to point out that we see an important partnership with morocco across our economy and we have outline more of that in the last few day the proposal he discuss be from a private company and like the previous government we have be look at it we will say more in due course 
 a very happy birthday to you mr speaker give the enormous potential for renewable energy generation across scotland include in my constituency do the minister recognise that accelerate community own energy project and crucially improve local transmission infrastructure would not only reduce fossil fuel reliance but deliver direct economic benefit to local people 
 my hon friend be absolutely right represent as he do a beautiful part of scotland and with huge potential for such scheme that be why great british energy announce £ of funding for community energy project in scotland work with the scottish government to drive those forward we see as my hon friend rightly point out   the huge benefit not just of deliver clean power but of the social and economic value for the community that host it we be clear that community own energy have huge untapped potential and huge benefit for community we want to see much more of it and great british energy will help deliver it 
 happy birthday mr speaker i thank the minister for his response on reduce the reliance on fossil fuel no more backing for oil and gas be essential for protect our child ’s future however that positive change require a plan to future proof british industry that work for everyone particularly those who be currently work in those high carbon sector will the minister and his colleague commit to publish an energy job plan for how those worker can be support in that transition particularly around be provide with retrain opportunity 
 we consult on a detailed plan around the future of energy in the north sea which include a detailed section on workforce planning i be sure the hon lady be able to submit a response to that consultation and we will look carefully at her view we take the question of workforce incredibly seriously job will be create right across the clean power mission include in the big upgrade to the transmission infrastructure that we have see in this country for many year much of which her party seem to oppose 
 happy birthday mr speaker today ’s brilliant announcement back rolls royce to deliver small modular reactor create more skilled job while also deliver clean secure energy that do not rely on fossil fuel even when the sun do not shine and the wind do not blow do the minister agree that the decision show british business support by this government again lead the way 
 my hon friend will not be surprised that i completely agree with she today we have announce a new golden age of nuclear power in this country after decade of dither and delay in fact i think that the last switch on of a nuclear power station be before i be even bear interruption it be not that long ago we be drive forward the real potential that we see in nuclear power and the secretary of state will make a statement on that later that be how we deliver thousand of well pay skilled job across the country and the important energy security that we need i hope that we will see smr in every part of the united kingdom include in scotland 
 what step he be take to support rooftop solar power project 
 what step he be take to support rooftop solar power project 
 what step he be take to support rooftop solar power project 
 what step he be take to support rooftop solar power project 
 what step he be take to support rooftop solar power project 
 happy birthday mr speaker you look young every year if i may say so last week we launch the new future home standard which will ensure that the vast majority of new build house will have solar panel instal as standard this will end the absurd situation the previous government leave where new housing be build without solar panel we be kick start a solar rooftop revolution and the upcoming solar road map will lay out how we be bring cheap clean power to family and business across the country 
 happy birthday mr speaker only of school currently have solar panel brigstock latham ’s primary in my constituency do not that be why its year pupil have write to i ask for panel on their roof they tell i that this would cut their carbon footprint reduce bill and help improve their education pupil write 
 we may be a small school but we can be big sometimes 
 will my right hon friend support their inspire campaign and perhaps visit these young community activist in my constituency 
 i congratulate the pupil of brigstock latham ’s primary school on their incredible spirit young people right across the country care about these issue also they be point out something really important which be that we have this free resource of the sun and we should use it that be why put solar panel on school and elsewhere be big project for great british energy 
 happy birthday mr speaker in my stoke on trent south constituency business such as the bestway group which own well healthcare in meir park and goodwin international in newstead be keen to invest in rooftop solar but they can not get national grid connectivity in the case of well healthcare it will have to wait until meanwhile resident in my village area be frustrate at the growth of solar farm on agricultural land when there be acre of empty flat roof on industrial estate will the secretary of state meet i to discuss the many challenge and opportunity for transition to clean energy that businesse in my constituency face 
 my hon friend raise some important point the be on grid connection with the grid reform that we be do we be go to end this zombie queue where project be take up space when they be not go to connect or not go to connect in time that will open up the future to project such as her on the point about industrial estate i can give she a sneak preview and tell she that this be part of the solar road map she make important point and the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks   have volunteer to meet she 
 thank to great british energy meadway health centre in my constituency be set to have solar panel instal which will cover its entire energy bill for the summer my local hospital wythenshawe will also benefit save my local nhs trust some £ to £ a year which can be reinveste back into frontline service despite the doom mongering on net that we hear from the opposition benches do the secretary of state agree that this show the power of help our public service and create job 
 i congratulate my hon friend on have hit the jackpot with the nhs benefit from what great british energy be do he make such an important point here which be that the net agenda be about low bill for example it be about cut energy bill for frontline service and put the money back into those service who could possibly be against that 
 happy birthday mr speaker in my chatham and aylesford constituency clarion housing be work with octopus energy in snodland to install roof solar panel and heat pump in social housing unit can the minister confirm how we can expand on such scheme use the tenant power tariff for example to reduce energy cost for our most vulnerable constituent 
 my hon friend make a really important point and this be something that we be work on there be huge potential in work with energy company with social housing provider and other to find way in which this can be a true part of an anti poverty strategy this be something that we be work on and we will have more to say about in the week and month ahead 
 i wish you a very happy birthday mr speaker i welcome the news that of great british energy ’s major project will be to install solar panel on school and hospital and i hope that some of the school in doncaster east and the isle   of axholme will benefit i have hear from local sport club that be keen to be part of the green energy revolution but face installation and funding barrier will the secretary of state consider extend great british energy and other scheme to help community sport facility to go green 
 i love my hon friend ’s idea it be such a good local sport club and lot of other community organisation can benefit from that project i will suggest the idea to great british energy 
 mr speaker the times have tell the world how old you be today 
 they get it wrong 
 i do not propose to write it into the record but i note that you be catch up on i laughter happy birthday 
 let we move on 
 yesterday a minister say from the dispatch box that only of farmland be be damage by development yet solar panel be smother    east kent ’s good farmland it must stop give what the secretary of state have say what further step will he take to protect our farmland and really do move solar panel on to rooftop car park and public building 
 there be a few question in there and i will try to answer they as briefly as i can even for the big solar ambition less than of land would be cover the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that we need solar rooftop too that be why we have put an end to year of dither and delay and last week announce that new home will have solar panel fit as standard it make total sense 
 the solar panel on my roof start work last week and i be very excited if you do not have any solar panel mr speaker maybe you could give yourself a birthday present and ensure that you have an array too mine be make possible by the solar together scheme organise by bath and north east somerset council such scheme be so important to encourage people to install solar panel on their roof will the secretary of state ensure that funding for those scheme will continue 
 i congratulate the hon lady on have take that step she make an important point lot of people want to do this but there be an up front cost barrier thing that my department be do be work with the private sector social housing provider as i have say and other to ask how we might break down up front cost barrier so that more people particularly those who can not necessarily afford those cost can benefit from solar power and cheap bill 
 grand union community energy in my constituency be a non profit community group that have do excellent work in kings langley to raise funding to install solar panel on the roof of local school development and car park it also educate local resident on how they can utilise community energy to reduce energy bill which we have all see rise under this government what step be be take across government to ensure that community project such as grand union community energy be implement more widely 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his excellent question i agree with he about the role of community energy provider i hope that he can persuade his front benchers to convert to support great british energy because of thing that it will do we will be happy to work with he on this be unleash a wave of community energy across our country do precisely the thing that he talk about 
 i be delighted that the government have see the light on solar photovoltaic and recognise what an important step they be on the path to the sunlit upland of home that be genuinely fit for the future do the secretary of state recognise that energy efficiency be a crucial part of energy security and will he meet i to discuss   how the future home standard might ensure that every home be truly fit for the future include by be   carbon 
 let i wish the hon member luck on her leadership bid anyone who want to be a leader of a political party should take the idea under advisement in my experience i see the former liberal democrat leader   the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron nod we want the future home standard to really work it be a plan that the previous labour government have for but the conservative government get rid of it we want it to make a real difference and it make financial sense because it mean that we do not have to retrofit home at much great cost 
 i wish you a very happy birthday mr speaker your i be guess i be really impressed that holy trinity church in colden common which be a heritage building manage to increase its energy efficiency rating from f to a. can the secretary of state give any advice or guidance to community who wish to improve heritage building list building and other old property which often face planning issue when seek to install solar panel or insulation or take other energy efficiency measure 
 let i congratulate the hon member ’s community group this whole set of question have show the huge untapped potential in the constituency of member in all part of the house i will say thing in answer i will take this back to gb energy because i think the role of community group as potential partner be really important secondly he make an important point on plan guidance sometimes the planning rule be okay but the guidance be the problem and it create bureaucratic hurdle i be work with the minister for housing and planning to make sure   the guidance be clear to local council where there be barrier that they should not be put in the way 
 what step he be take to increase grid capacity 
 what step he be take to increase grid capacity 
 increase grid capacity be critical we be halve the development time for new transmission infrastructure through reform to planning and supply chain so that we can deliver the grid capacity need to achieve clean power by and meet the doubling of electricity demand by 
 i thank the minister for his response he will know that some project be wait up to year to connect to the grid and the secretary of state early refer to the zombie waiting list could i push he far and ask precisely what concrete step the department be take to drastically cut that waiting list 
 we have outline significant reform to the connection queue there be currently more than gw in that connection queue clearly that be an unsustainable amount of demand for connection to the   grid and most of it do not really exist as my right hon friend the secretary of state point out we have put forward significant reform so that we prioritise project that be ready to connect to the grid and have strategic importance to the grid the clean power action plan will drive forward what those strategic outcome be that work be under way and the national energy system operator be consider those proposal it will free up a huge number of project from the connection queue allow new project to join and crucially allow for demand project that will help deliver economic growth 
 in my oxfordshire constituency of didcot and wantage site at culham harwell campus and milton park host a grow range of scientific and high tech business include a propose artificial intelligence growth zone at culham major housing growth also continue and the new valley park development will use air source heat pump however the future oxfordshire partnership have raise concern that grid constraint be cause significant delay to decarbonisation activity and creation of local power grid what step will the minister take to address these problem and create an electricity grid fit for century oxfordshire 
 the hon gentleman make an incredibly important point that outline why this work be so important there be part to it the connection reform be crucial so that we have a queue of project that be strategically relevant and ready to be deliver the part be that we have to build significantly more grid infrastructure and it be incumbent on all member of this house to not oppose that grid infrastructure and then come here and say that they want new demand project to be able to connect instead they need to take a practical approach and say we ’re go to have to build some new grid in this country if we want to unlock the huge potential of ai growth zone and other demand project in the economy 
 the strategic defence review of this government and the previous government highlight the risk pose to our security by climate change do the minister agree that the increase opposition by the conservatives and other opposition members to clean power infrastructure and increase our grid capacity across the country be not just economically illiterate but a risk to our national security 
 as so often my hon friend be correct on these matter he usually have a quote that show that just a few month ago opposition front benchers agree with we on many of these matter but have suddenly change their position as my hon friend say our proposal be not only critical to deliver energy security in an increasingly uncertain world but to tackle the climate crisis which have such an impact on our life now and in the future and to the economic opportunity of the century 
 i call the shadow minister 
 happy birthday mr speaker we need to ensure that the technology that we import to increase grid capacity be secure us official recently find kill switch in chinese make component   for solar farm the conservatives have be clear about the security risk that china pose in our energy supply chain so will the secretary of state confirm whether he discuss that issue in his recent meeting with chinese official if not why not 
 on a day when we be announce new nuclear scheme i be almost tempt to ask which party bring chinese investment into the heart of our nuclear infrastructure the conservative party in every decision take about the energy sector and more widely if there be question about national security they be take forward in the usual way we invest hugely in ensure that all our critical national infrastructure be safe and secure from cyber threat and other threat that work continue and be a top priority for the government we be build the clean power system that deliver energy security and the conservatives be oppose it 
 what estimate he have make of the number of additional job in clean power industry since july 
 since the election over £ of investment have be announce in clean energy create good job with good wage and by the industry could support hundred of thousand of new job we will soon publish our clean energy workforce strategy which will set out in more detail where and how we will deliver the job of the future the risk of vote for the conservatives or reform be that they would put all those job in jeopardy 
 the department for energy security and net ’s clean power action plan be accelerate the transition to renewable energy source and create quality job in area like mine in north wales a major expansion at the port of mostyn will create new job as it prepare to increase its support for the offshore wind farm sector do the minister agree that this be not the time to hold back and that we should invest in green energy to tackle climate change secure our energy supply and provide skilled job for my constituent in clwyd east 
 i thank my hon friend for that speech—[interruption i mean for that beautiful short question i welcome the job that be come to the port of mostyn this labour government be drive investment in our community from carbon capture hydrogen nuclear wind and solar energy opposition member have to explain to the british people why they want to leave they cold poorer in the pocket of dictator and with less good job 
 i hear that it be your birthday mr speaker congratulation the uk government have announce £ for new extremely expensive nuclear energy project while crucial shovel ready green development in scotland be receive nothing at all both cruachan and the acorn project be await the minister ’s approval to create new green job in scotland when will that money be make available 
 when we hear the snp oppose job it seem sad for the people of scotland we be support job up and down scotland the hon gentleman do not have long to wait to hear about acorn because the spending review will be publish later this week 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 happy birthday mr speaker and very many happy return we obviously welcome new job when they be create but will the minister acknowledge the destructive impact of her government ’s policy on job in oil and gas in the north sea on friday evening in westhill in my constituency i meet many worker who be terrify for their future their family and their community because the skilled job in the supply chain that be maintain by oil and gas be not be replace at the pace need by renewable that be due to a slowdown in offshore wind deployment and a steep decline in oil and gas activity will she not admit that the government have get this dreadfully wrong 
 under the previous government we lose job in the oil and gas industry and more than job in the ceramics industry we produce only of the steel that we need in this country and the chemical industry fall by the conservatives record be shocking we be put together a plan that will ensure we can transition a lot of people from oil and gas to renewable as the hon gentleman know the skill be very similar we be try to make that easy through our passport system we be develop a workforce plan which we will publish in due course that will involve hundred of thousand of job why do conservative members oppose that 
 there have be no contrition or acknowledgement of the people lose their job today in this country as a direct result of the government ’s destructive policy some job be lose in july robert gordon university estimate that there be job loss every week offshore energies uk predict that there will be job loss unless there be significant policy change the just transition commission warn that job may go by and that there be no prospect of a just transition because the supply chain be just up stick and move overseas will the minister not acknowledge that this be the wrong course to take will she at least apologise to the man and woman lose their job today 
 the north sea will continue to play an important role for year to come which be why we be keep exist field open for their lifetime this be a decline base and the hon gentleman know that this be not where the job of the future will be they will be in the clean energy transition which we be invest in at pace there have be huge announcement today on nuclear and there be the spending review announcement to come we be invest in the job of the future he be stick in the past 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of extend the warm home discount to all household in receipt of means test benefit on people receive those benefit 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of extend the warm home discount to all household in receipt of means test benefit on people receive those benefit 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of extend the warm home discount to all household in receipt of means test benefit on people receive those benefit 
 happy birthday mr speaker we be extend the warm home discount to more than household double the number of family that will get support this winter that be the difference that a labour government make we be provide support for those who need it while we sprint to clean power by so that we can get off the energy rollercoaster and bear down on bill for good 
 a very happy birthday to you mr speaker i welcome the extension of the warm home discount to all household on mean test benefit from this winter many low income household be exclude because their home be not class as have a high cost to heat in wolverhampton north east only of household benefit from the discount in can the minister confirm that the new scheme be simple fair and focus on those who be most in need 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that really important point i can confirm that we will remove the hard to heat criterion which mean that support will go to low income household that we know need help with their energy bill 
 i thank the minister for outline the support available to household with high energy bill some household in my constituency benefit from the warm home discount but many in barking and dagenham alongside almost other household in this country be deal with high energy debt what plan be under way for energy debt relief scheme or   a scheme to help those who build up debt under the previous government so that we can support they now unlike the conservatives we do not abandon those household suffer from debt that arise as a result of the legacy of past government 
 we be work with ofgem to put in place a debt support scheme to deal with the huge rise in energy debt that we see during the energy crisis which the conservatives fail to deal with that will provide much need support whether through debt write off or debt repayment plan it will mean that household that can not afford their energy bill be struggle and will never pay that debt be provide with support 
 happy birthday to you mr speaker the government be target measure base on people ’s income but will they look at the issue of rural home many thousand of people live in poorly insulate home in isolated area family there be leave in the cold in the winter 
 we know there be part of the country where home be not up to standard and family be struggle with bill that be why our warm home plan be so important we will target home across the country and ensure that we provide a range of measure from insulation through to solar and heat pump so we can ensure that home be warm and cheap to run 
 happy birthday mr speaker like i you do not count the year you make the year count you be do very well at that 
 i welcome the minister ’s answer she have in the past be keen to ensure that northern ireland do not lose out on scheme yesterday the decision on the winter fuel payment be announce to the house which we all welcome the under secretary of state for work and pensions   the hon member for swansea west torsten bell be clear that the legislation start here but help for northern ireland will come from here as well will there be the same help for those in northern ireland who need it as much as people here 
 we be work across all nation to ensure that household get the support that they need i will be in northern ireland next week where i will talk to the devolved administration about how we can work together to ensure that home across the country be support 
 what step his department be take to decouple electricity and gas price 
 accelerate the clean energy transition away from insecure and expensive fossil fuel towards cheap clean renewable and nuclear power will help decouple gas and electricity price as a result we will reduce the exposure of consumer bill to volatile international crisis and ensure that we never again face the kind of cost of living crisis that the last government preside over 
 new solar be cheap than the low cost fossil fuel and onshore wind be cheap yet the marginal pricing system that tie electricity cost to the market price of gas have result in british consumer endure the high global energy price during a cost of living crisis do the minister agree that decouple electricity price from the gas market be essential if consumer be to enjoy low cost energy 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his expertise in this area which he often bring to the house he be absolutely right that decouple from volatile and expensive gas price be critical and the journey we be on to develop clean power by will do that our objective be to deliver a clean power system where gas only provide the back up rather than set the price as it currently do too often—80 of the time we rely on gas to set the price we be try   to remove that and to build a clean power system for the future 
 i think we all agree that it be important for we to protect all consumer from the volatile oil and gas price that my hon friend have mention however while we shift and undertake that reform have the minister consider the benefit of have an energy social tariff to protect customer now from those volatile oil and gas price and to prepare they for a clean well and reform energy market in the future 
 i always agree with my hon friend but on her initial point i probably do not i be not sure that we do all agree in this house that we should remove the volatility of fossil fuel price some want we to remain link to fossil fuel for long and long we be determined to remove that vulnerability from people ’s bill so that we do not face the price spike that many family still struggle with she be right to point to target support as well we be look at social tariff part of the challenge be that the phrase mean different thing to different people but we be clear that bring down bill for everyone be a top priority for this government and the clean power mission be how we will do it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 happy birthday mr speaker the energy secretary have say that there be a principled case for remove green taxis from electricity bill and the cost be meet by increase in green taxis on gas bill that would be a net tax rise for every household—80 of the country that use gas this be not an argument that he make before the election so can the minister take this opportunity to rule out any increase in taxis charge or levy on gas bill 
 on the government benches we be try to cut people ’s bill as quickly as possible the hon gentleman be a core part of a government who fail to do that for many year i be surprised that he do not rise to congratulate great british energy on its investment in solar panel on school and hospital because his constituent be benefit from on a hospital and on a school he should welcome that 
 if the hon member want to talk about my constituency he can talk about the betrayal of the sunnica application which be be impose on my constituency by the energy secretary the public will see that the answer be not a no from the minister family across the country should be worry this be become a pattern for week i ask ministers about their plan to align with the european carbon price for week they deny that it would happen and then once the local election be do they do it increase electricity bill by stealth for every family and business in the country now it be the same for gas bill when will the minister be straight with people and admit that the government be add to the bill of family and business not cut they 
 the house will have hear the shadow minister ’s failure to welcome solar panel on a hospital and a school in his constituency but he can deal with his own constituent on the question of the emission trading system on side we have national grid energy uk the carbon capture and storage association   make uk and the confederation of british industry welcome it on the other side we have the shadow minister and the deputy leader of the reform party   the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice i think i know who i would take my advice from 
 what step his department be take to ensure that the transition to net support rural economy 
 happy birthday mr speaker the government be commit to ensure that everyone can access the benefit of our net transition include rural community which will play a vital role in create job and host infrastructure that be why we have set up the £ great british energy community fund to support clean energy project development include in constituency like my hon friend ’s 
 many happy return mr speaker chipping community energy in my constituency be a brilliant ground source heat loop feasibility project we know that grid infrastructure be weak in rural area and there be a risk that more remote area get leave behind in the move to decarbonisation in the same way that they do with the broadband roll out will the minister share what role she see local initiative like chipping community energy play in our overall plan for energy security and affordability and what step she be take to help such project to provide more cheap energy to our rural community 
 that sound like a great project we be absolutely committed to recognise the role that community energy group like the chipping community land trust can play in ensure that community directly benefit from the energy transition the trust be award £ through the former rural community energy fund and gb energy be continue that work through its community fund help to unleash the wave of community energy project that the secretary of state speak about early the government and ofgem will be work to tackle policy and regulatory barrier to these project happen 
 in the spirit of try to get as many birthday wish into hansard record as possible mr speaker from part of the great county in the country to another i wish you a very happy birthday 
 in the context of the dash to net rural economy can also be damage by the infrastructure that be be put in the morgan and morecambe wind farm cable corridor and substation will cause damage to rural business over mile along the cabling route include disruption cause during the construction stage what effort be the minister make to assess case in which the infrastructure that be be put in place do more damage to rural economy than it benefit they 
 if rural community be to benefit from the clean energy transition it be important that they play a role in hop to host the infrastructure   when the great british energy bill go through parliament there be much discussion about ensure that community that host the new infrastructure do not lose out i can send the hon gentleman detail of exactly how his community can engage with that process 
 what step he be take to improve the energy efficiency of home 
 in alone we will upgrade up to home through the warm home plan and other measure that be more than double the number of home upgrade last year later this year we will set out more detail of a warm home plan to upgrade up to home and there will be more detail in the spending review tomorrow 
 happy birthday mr speaker my lib dem predecessor the much miss andrew stunell push for the carbon home programme during his time in the to government have bring in his bill on that subject back in sadly those standard be scrap as soon as the conservatives be govern on their own the energy and climate intelligence unit have estimate that have those standard be reach in household would have pay £ less in energy bill as a result of live in well insulate and more energy efficient home the secretary of state early mention the future home standard which be bring in welcome step on solar panel and so on when will the government go far to reach carbon home standard with a fabric approach 
 the hon lady raise an important question the failure to have a carbon home standard or future home standard in place have mean that we have build over home since then that be now go to have to be retrofit that make no financial sense it be right to put those upgrade in as standard from the get go and we have do a lot of work with the ministry of housing communities and local government and house builder to make sure that can be do in a way that also mean we can build lot of home 
 what be the secretary of state do to make it more affordable for household to make their home energy efficient the current model be that those who can afford to outlay some funding then get a taxpayer fund subsidy but those who can not put down those few do not get that support 
 my hon friend raise an important point i be work with the minister for energy consumers and other across government on this as part of the warm home plan we have to make sure that those who can least afford it can take advantage of the huge opportunity of insulation solar panel and battery 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 warm wish for your birthday mr speaker and i be go to talk about warmth as you might expect over the last decade we have see so many household live in dickensian condition with dark damp and cold home and have to choose between heating and eating with the warm home plan widely recognise as the most cost effective way of make home warm healthy and cheap to heat can the secretary of state confirm exactly how many home will be cover be the current scale of the plan truly sufficient to meet the challenge we face 
 the hon lady be absolutely right to be ambitious on these issue energy efficiency make such sense for our country we commit in our manifesto to upgrade home and we intend to meet that commitment i do not want to steal the chancellor ’s thunder but we will be say more about that tomorrow 
 what step he plan to take in relation to the rosebank oilfield 
 the consent to develop the rosebank oilfield be deem unlawful by the court the developer will need to reapply for consent include an assessment of emission from burn the fuel produce we will produce guidance on the environmental assessment of those emission in due course 
 have a good mr speaker 
 the big issue to consider in this decision make process will be the economic and environmental impact as the government develop their thinking will they consider and report to the house on another issue ithaca be of the company seek to benefit from the large profit from the rosebank development it be own by delek an israeli oil conglomerate that have be list recently by the un for human right abuse in the occupied palestinian territories i do not believe that our government would want to be associate with a company like that and many pension fund be now divest from that company too can we have a report as the government ’s thinking develop on that crucial matter 
 i will be careful about what i say in this particular case and on the specific application for obvious reason we will be publish guidance very soon on how the scope emission the end use emission will be assess any developer with any project that wish to reapply will then be able to do so each project will go through a regulatory process and be consider on its individual merit 
 cabinet office guidance state that government departments should aim to publish a response to a consultation within week of the consultation closing the consultation on environmental impact assessment close on   january which be week ago tomorrow when will the department publish the guidance because it be cause delay to project in the north sea today 
 we publish the consultation on what we will do with the eia guidance as quickly as we could we be now analyse that it be a complex issue as i be sure the hon lady will understand we will publish the response and the process that will now be put in place as soon as possible any developer that wish to reapply will then be able to do so 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since the last energy security and net oral question the government have confirm that rooftop solar panel will be standard for all new build home deliver the solar on school project scrap the absurd metre heat pump rule secure royal assent for the great british energy bill and alongside ofgem deliver compensation for victim of the prepayment meter scandal that happen under the last government 
 the east of england have a unique energy mix from offshore wind hydrogen and nuclear i welcome the game change investment in sizewell c today can i ask specifically about wind a new report from eastwind and opergy say that in the east of england we need more than extra offshore wind farm worker do the secretary of state agree that the east of england be central to our energy mission and can he outline how we will deliver those skilled job 
 the east of england will be a clean energy powerhouse for the country my hon friend raise an important issue about workforce and we will be publish the workforce plan soon 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in the dim and distant past in the secretary of state describe the rosebank oilfield as 
 a colossal waste of taxpayer money and climate vandalism 
 do he still agree with that 
 as with any application there be a process that my department will go through we will look at any application in a fair and objective way 
 i forgot to say this early mr speaker a very happy birthday from i and my constituent 
 i commend the secretary of state for see the need to reform our energy sector give that people across north wales be currently pay some of the high energy bill in the country will he assure i that any propose alternative to the current energy model will not put any nation or region at a relative disadvantage 
 we be develop proposal that will minimise cost and ensure a fair outcome for consumer throughout the country 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the north sea ’s future lie in clean energy but despite the uk ’s billing as a wind superpower we still import most of our wind turbine component while community around the north sea be lose job trade union and industry be unite in call for £ a year to build up domestic renewable manufacturing but the chancellor have commit barely half that will the secretary of state work with his cabinet colleague to secure the investment that be need to realise the job create potential of the green just transition 
 the hon lady be absolutely right we be try not just to build the renewable that we need for the future but to bring the good job the manufacturing and the industry along with they the prime minister have announce £ of support for supply chain through great british energy and there will be much more to come we be also work individually with project and developer to ensure that we bring the job here and that be why the clean industry bonus be so important 
 over recent month i have receive numerous email from constituent in hade edge express concern about repeat energy outage the most recent incident occur on may affect customer what step be the government take to ensure that energy supplier such as northern powergrid invest in upgrade their infrastructure so that community like hade edge no long have to worry about outage 
 my hon friend raise an important point the uk ’s energy grid be very resilient but we be invest to make sure that remain the case in the decade ahead ofgem require transmission owner and distribution network operator to make sure that there be an efficient economic and co ordinated system of electricity transmission in the country and to make sure that it work but if he wish to raise any specific issue i would be happy to hear from he 
 on may the government publish their work paper on community benefit but contribution be unlikely to be make mandatory before a decision be make about the huge botley west plant in my constituency do the minister agree that a responsible developer would offer my constituent a level of benefit in line with that propose by the government 
 yes and i be grateful for the opportunity to meet the hon gentleman recently to discuss exactly those point we encourage all developer to provide a range of local community benefit and we be consult on whether that should go far but in the meantime we want to see community benefit scheme that be as strong as possible for all energy project right across the country 
 happy labubu birthday mr speaker 
 our most climate friendly nation require investment to adapt to the effect of climate change but sadly a number of they be face a debt crisis and be spend a lot of money on pay sky high interest rate to lender give that of the debt contract be govern by english law will the government ensure that private lender take part in debt relief scheme in order to tackle the climate emergency effectively 
 this be the subject of ongoing discussion between our department and in particular the foreign commonwealth and development office we want to ensure that we be not give with hand and take away with the other that be part of the remodelling that will enable we to supply international climate finance to the people who need it most 
 i wish you a happy birthday mr speaker in its manifesto last year the scottish labour party promise to create scottish job in the clean energy industry of the future but on the sunday show the scottish labour leader be unable to answer any question about that may i ask how many job have be create so far how this be progress and when the target will be meet 
 the hon gentleman be right in that we have ambitious plan in our manifesto to create thousand of job fund through great british energy something that he fail to vote for so he be now against the investment that will come we have secure £ worth of private investment since we come to office with hundred of job and many many thousand to come 
 thousand of my constituent in barking receive their energy via a heat network provide by their landlord or a housing association in many case they be not eligible for the warm home discount what plan do the government have to make sure that those constituent receive the support they need 
 we have have challenge with heat network across the country that be why we be bring forward regulation to make sure both that there be a fair price for people on heat network and that technical standard drive up the quality of heat network so that people can have cheap bill 
 standing order charge be make energy bill unaffordable particularly for those on low income what step be minister take to address this 
 the hon lady raise a really important point about the level of stand order charge and this be something that ofgem have consult on the complexity be that if we redistribute stand order charge it can have significant adverse distributional effect but ofgem be seek to have low standing order charge for some customer 
 wasco coatings in my constituency have invest significantly in its hartlepool operation in anticipation of the ambitious net plan on teesside we now learn that there be a possibility that the contract may go abroad which threaten hartlepool job do the minister agree that british investment must back british job and do she have a message for those decide on the contract 
 the northern endurance partnership which be develop the infrastructure to transport co2 across teesside and the humber will create thousand of job there be a local content target but we want to exceed that and i urge the partnership to use british supplier i think my hon friend be meet its representative this week we stand ready to do so and we want everyone to buy british 
 research from centrica which be headquarter on my patch show that hive have save domestic customer half a pound on their energy bill since its inception do the secretary of state agree that smart datum which give consumer the ability to control their energy use without the need for top down ban taxis and mandate should be a key plank of the warm home plan 
 the hon gentleman raise a really important point minimum half hourly charge will also help customer to use smart solution and make saving and all the evidence collect under the last government show that when consumer lead flexibility be offer people really take advantage of it 
 make community energy the centrepiece of the government ’s clean power plan will foster support for new scheme by put the public in the drive seat to choose where and at what scale project can fit into local landscape to unleash the full potential of community energy will minister consider implement the long stand proposal to enable these scheme to sell electricity directly to local people 
 the government ’s licence exemption scheme already allow small scale supplier include many community energy group to come to market to supply local customer the secretary of state have also commission ofgem to work with the department to explore some of the policy and regulatory barrier to local supply 
 in formula will be use a fully sustainable drop in fuel in all its car do the secretary of state agree that this provide an exciting opportunity for the uk to lead the world in use research and development from formula to support the pursuit of net for all motorist and will he agree to meet i and representative of motor sport to discuss this issue far 
 yes that sound really good 
 happy birthday mr speaker at the former chatterley whitfield colliery in my constituency of stoke on trent north and kidsgrove the council have launch an ambitious   plan to go from black to green create a combine digital and eco park that include an ai growth zone will the secretary of state meet i alongside my constituency neighbour and hon friend   the member for stoke on trent south dr gardner who have champion this cause and partner to see for himself the potential of our coalfield community 
 that also sound really good and it sound like a really important initiative the idea of ai growth zone which have be promote by my right hon friend the secretary of state for science technology and innovation be great and i congratulate my hon friend 
 may i extend an invite to the secretary of state to come to aberdeen and meet the highly skilled energy workforce whose job be be put at risk as a result of his policy 
 i absolutely meet north sea worker and company what we need to do for they be build the clean energy future so that they can transition that be about carbon capture and storage hydrogen and offshore wind and it be about nuclear as well something that snp members oppose this government be go to make the investment to make it happen 
 lang may yer lum reek mr speaker 
 the minister may know that we use to have nuclear power in ayrshire create many well pay job do he think we could see small modular reactor at hunterston and what do he think of the snp ’s abject failure to bring nuclear to scotland even though it have plan for an independent scotland to rely on english nuclear 
 the snp ’s be an anti job anti investment and anti clean energy position and snp members should be ashamed of themselves 
 during the last election campaign the secretary of state say he would cut energy bill by £ could he set out for family and small business in bridgwater the timescale for fulfil that promise 
 we say we would cut energy bill by up to £ by and that remain our commitment 
 penn bloodh lowen mr speaker 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment to nuclear energy as a means of reduce our reliance on fossil fuel but i be concerned that far less attention have be give to another low carbon low marginal cost firm baseload power source deep geothermal by some estimate there be over gw of geothermal energy potential in the cornish granite batholith alone what be the government do to assess and unlock this untapped geothermal potential 
 as always my hon friend be a great champion for his local area and its different energy source i be very happy to meet he as geothermal   have huge opportunity i think some of it have yet to come to market but we look at all opportunity for deliver clean power 
 happy birthday mr speaker i suspect you may be relieve that we can not sing in the chamber 
 i be recently approach by a small business owner in my constituency of edinburgh west who face bill of almost £ for the period of lockdown when her business be closed she be get no sense out of british gas lite about why she be face this bill and i be get no response from it will the minister meet i to discuss how we can find out what be happen 
 a quick yes will do 
 yes 
 happy birthday mr speaker 
 the york central development site at the heart of my constituency have be find to be a rich source of deep geothermal energy will the minister meet i to look at how we can bring this on stream to heat the home and support the job there will be on that site 
 i be very happy to meet my hon friend there be a number of scheme like this already the mining remediation authority have a number of project under way there be huge potential and i be happy to meet she to discuss it 
 happy birthday mr speaker and despite what have be say by colleague on the benches in front of i you do not look a day over laughter 
 while the minister be claim to save the world by close down the oil and gas industry in the united kingdom centrica have sign a £ deal with norway to supply gas to the united kingdom how do he justify the loss of british job give away tax revenue and put growth in jeopardy by close down an industry that be still much need 
 the right hon gentleman be wrong on front we be not close down oil and gas it will continue to play a part for many year to come but there be a transition under way as there have be for many year the truth of the matter be that while we want to create the job that come next he turn his face against all the investment in what those job will be which mean that under his plan the transition will not lead to a future for that incredibly skilled workforce we be determined to do it differently so that there be good well pay job in the future and a secure energy mix for decade to come 
 i thank everybody who have wish i well for my birthday i get the good birthday present and that be the knighthood for sir billy boston who have to leave wales to play rugby league this be the knighthood for rugby league so it be the good present i could have have 
 with permission i would like to make a statement about government plan for investment in new nuclear power 
 year ago in as energy secretary i deliver a statement to this house identify potential site for new nuclear i say 
 we need to use all available low carbon source new nuclear be right for energy security and climate change and it will be good for job too”.—[official report   november vol c. 
 that be true back then and it be even more true today russia ’s invasion of ukraine and the cost of living crisis that follow show how vulnerable we be as a country because of our dependence on fossil fuel at the whim of market control by petrostate and dictator the imperative of energy security and the demand of the climate crisis mean that we must shift as fast as possible to clean home grow power the demand for that power as we shift away from gas be expect to at least double by so we need all the low carbon source possible to meet the demand we face 
 the advice from expert include the climate change committee be clear we need new nuclear to meet our climate obligation this government support new nuclear because of our belief that the climate crisis be the great long term threat face our country and our world not in spite of it because of the imperative of energy security and because of the good skilled job that nuclear provide in britain today there be too few industry that offer the secure well pay job with strong trade union that the british people desire and deserve time and again i have hear from people up and down the country about the importance of nuclear job to their community for all these reason the government be take decisive step today to usher in a new golden age of nuclear for britain 
 back in the late 2000 when i be energy secretary i identify sizewell as a potential site for new nuclear it have take year but i be incredibly proud that today we be announce £ of public funding for this spending review period to build sizewell c the government fund and own nuclear power station in britain since the 1980 a strategic partnership with france with edf intend to invest alongside we 
 i recognise the contribution of my hon friend the members for lowestoft jess asato and for ipswich jack abbott in advocate for this project and my hon friend   the member for warrington north charlotte nichols   for her advocacy for nuclear as a whole i also acknowledge the work of   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie who be not in his place when he be minister for nuclear 
 sizewell c will power the equivalent of around home with clean home grow energy for year   and will be a job and growth engine for britain   support job at peak construction and create apprenticeship well pay highly skilled job in east anglia and community across the country i thank the gmb unite and prospect trade union which be brilliant champion for the nuclear industry   sizewell have already sign £ worth of contract with company and will eventually work with supplier in all nation of the uk 
 this project be good value for money for the taxpayer because there will be a clear economic return on the investment and for the bill payer because all the due diligence we have do demonstrate that the cost of the clean power it will supply will be cheap than the alternative we expect the final investment decision on the project include through the capital raise from the private sector to be complete in the summer when we will set out further detail this be a new generation of nuclear power promise for year and deliver by this labour government 
 secondly small modular reactor offer a huge industrial opportunity for our country and we be determined to harness britain ’s nuclear expertise to win the global race to lead in this new technology i can inform the house that follow a rigorous year competition today rolls royce smr have be select as the preferred bidder to develop the uk ’s smr subject to final government approval and contract signature this initial project could create up to skilled job and power the equivalent of around home 
 in the spending review we be commit to the public investment need to get the smr programme off the ground with more than £ in funding over the period the project will be deliver by great british energy nuclear a publicly own company headquarter in warrington an allied company to great british energy which be headquarter in aberdeen subject to government approval the contract will be sign later this year our aim be to deliver of europe ’s smr fleet lead the world in the nuclear technology of the future with more good job and energy security fund and make possible by this labour government 
 thirdly beyond the immediate horizon nuclear fusion offer the potential of an energy abundant future britain already lead thank to the pioneer work of the uk atomic energy authority but unlike in the past we be determined to make the investment to stay ahead as a country today we be pledge to invest more than £ in nuclear fusion include in the step spherical tokamak for energy production programme which will help to progress the new prototype fusion plant at west burton i congratulate the mayor of the east midlands claire ward on her tireless advocacy for this project as well as my hon friend the members for bassetlaw jo white and for rushcliffe james naish on their advocacy this will be the fusion plant of its kind in the world and it will be on the site of a former coal fire power station under a labour government britain will lead the clean energy transition and trailblaze the technology of the future 
 fourthly our nuclear ambition do not stop there as we move ahead on these project we see huge potential right across the country that be why we be look to provide a route for private sector lead advanced nuclear project advanced modular reactor and smr to be deploy in the uk and we will task great british energy nuclear with a new role in assess proposal with the national wealth fund explore potential investment opportunity my message to the private sector be that if it want to build new nuclear britain be open for business 
 i can also tell the house that follow the incredible campaigning work of my hon friend the members for whitehaven and workington josh macalister for carlisle ms minns for penrith and solway markus campbell savours and for barrow and furness michelle scrogham my department have ask the nuclear decommissioning authority and cumberland council to consider the potential of privately lead clean energy development in moorside deliver job and growth in cumbria 
 we also know that this be an industry that demand long term thinking therefore have announce these step today we will build on our clean power action plan and set out our plan for the energy system include our ambition and next step on nuclear into the 2030 and beyond 
 take together the step that i have announce today will kick off the big nuclear building programme that britain have see in half a century double down on our nuclear strength to take the late step forward in our mission to make britain a clean energy superpower when people ask what clean energy and net mean for our country this be what it be all about for too long our country have not make the crucial investment in energy or infrastructure that we need the british people have pay the price for this short sighted failure to invest in low living standard insecurity and decline public service this week ’s announcement signal a decisive change in approach to invest in the future and make the right choice for energy security the right choice for job the right choice for climate our child and grandchild the right choice for britain and the right choice of investment over decline i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement 
 the conservative party be a pro nuclear party and we welcome any decision back by investment that increase britain ’s nuclear capacity because we can not deliver cheap reliable and secure energy without it although the investment announce today by the secretary of state be significant it be a fraction of the £ cost which will ultimately be bear by consumer of his plan to decarbonise the grid unlike the intermittent technology back at such cost by the secretary of state nuclear provide reliable baseload power it generate inertia to stabilise our grid nuclear power plant require substantially less new grid infrastructure compare with disperse generation from wind and solar it be to the shame of successive government over many year that britain relinquish its status as a world leader in civil nuclear technology in we have more nuclear reactor than the united states the ussr and the rest of the world put together between and we build nuclear power station but we give all that up the contribution of nuclear to our power generation peak in and have fall consistently since then 
 labour come to power in say that it see no economic case for the building of any new nuclear power station in the coalition agreement rule   out public investment in nuclear it be the last conservative government who plan the large revival of nuclear power in year and it be thank to that work that the secretary of state have be able to make many of these announcement today can he reiterate despite the headline this morning that the final investment decision have not yet be make he say in his statement that he will announce it in the summer but can he give we a more precise date when we will be tell the total government investment and the private capital raise 
 this statement be a downgrade on what the previous government put in motion today the energy secretary have announce only small modular reactor there be no clear target to increase nuclear power generation and no news on wylfa the nuclear industry be expect news of a gigawatt scale reactor the previous government purchase the land and commit to build but on this today the energy secretary say nothing can he commit to the planning inherit for a gigawatt scale plant at wylfa and will he recommit to the conservative policy of gw of nuclear power by 
 although it be good news that rolls royce will build our small modular reactor this be a downgrade on what be previously plan can the secretary of state tell we why he have award just technology rather than as set out previously furthermore will he commit as other country have to go fast 
 canada have approve a plan for smr by as thing stand britain will not have smr connect to the grid until the 2030s the contrast between this caution on nuclear and the government ’s rush to decarbonise the entire grid in just year while bet the house on unreliable and intermittent renewable technology and shut down british oil and gas in the north sea could not be clear we need the energy secretary to focus on the positive not to stake our country ’s future and people ’s bill on ideology 
 i feel a bit sorry for the hon gentleman it be hard on a day like this to be an opposition member nevertheless i will try to answer his question such as they be on the question about the final investment decision he will be aware that we be currently do the private sector capital raise when that be complete we will proceed to the final investment decision which will take place this summer that be obviously important 
 on his fundamental question i do slightly scratch my head because he say that this be a downgrade we have announce the large nuclear building programme in year what he say might have look good in the mirror this morning but it do not bear much resemblance to reality the question which go to the point i make at the end of my statement be this why do the conservatives make all these promise on nuclear but fail to deliver they there be a simple answer it be not because of a lack of diligence from his colleague   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie the simple reason be that they do not put up the money they do not make the investment the thing that have bedevil the nuclear programme be a failure to invest public money 
 in this spending review we be put in £ for sizewell £ for smr and £ for fusion those be significant sum of long term capital investment the conservatives make all these promise   but they do not put in the money i be the guy who identify sizewell and i be back here deliver sizewell this government be willing to make the investment we welcome the support from   the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy such as it be but he need to learn some lesson public investment not decline be the answer for britain 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 i warmly congratulate my right hon friend on deliver on his promise from and confirm sizewell c along with the vast array of commitment to a bright nuclear future for this country the select committee look forward to our inquiry in the autumn into the future of nuclear we will be take evidence and make recommendation to support the work that the secretary of state have set out we visit sizewell c and i also visit the nuclear physics department at the university of liverpool i learn in both case about the job that will be available across the country can the secretary of state confirm that he see this as the start of both gigawatt construction of new nuclear and a big expansion into smr and amr which be still a nascent technology to support a very good future for nuclear generation in this country 
 my hon friend speak very well on this subject i agree with he about the huge job potential from new nuclear and the timeline my priority when we come into office be to get these thing over the line because there have be so many promise make by the last government long term promise be make under boris johnson for but they do not deliver anything towards the gw target my priority be to get on and deliver these thing and get they over the line which we be do then we can look at what the energy need be go forward and how we meet they i agree with my hon friend that nuclear have an essential part to play alongside all the other clean energy technology electricity demand be go to double by so we need all of they 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we welcome the government ’s renew focus on energy security through nuclear power as part of the energy mix it be long overdue after year of dither and delay from successive conservative government it have be year since sizewell c be announce in and now prime ministers later we be finally see real movement that be not a success story but a warning short term thinking poor delivery and exorbitant cost 
 be you quote nick clegg 
 will the hon member let i continue 
 order i will decide when thing be out of order i do not need any help i want you to get the question finish quickly so come on 
 i can not help but wonder whether the secretary of state imagine when he stand at his dispatch box back in that he would be back in still announce funding for the same project 
 we support investment in clean home grow energy small modular nuclear reactor have real potential to reduce our dependence on foreign gas from tyrant like putin and help bring down bill so we welcome the government ’s backing of the nascent technology of small modular reactor and their choice of rolls royce which be recognise as a mover across all of europe that be where the focus should be not on large scale project like sizewell c that cost billion take decade and so often go over budget we have to ensure that this do not land consumer with high energy bill that risk be very real the government must be transparent about how this will be pay for because family can not afford another hit to their household budget 
 the liberal democrats believe that the good way to cut bill create good job and boost energy security be to invest in home grow renewable such as solar wind tidal and geothermal and to upgrade our national grid to deliver that clean power we look forward to see more detail on the long overdue reform of the outdated come serve grid connection system which be hold back renewable energy project and could even delay the roll out of new smr today ’s announcement be a step in the right direction but the real test be in the delivery of cheap bill strong energy security and a modern energy grid fit for the future 
 i thank the hon lady for her contribution i feel bad about mention this but she have slightly airbrush out the role of the current leader of the liberal democrats who be energy secretary for a period but we will trotsky”—to use a familial term of origin that out of the record 
 i sincerely welcome her support for this programme and she put the case very well it be a lesson to some of the opposition members sit behind she that we need all the clean energy technology we should not choose between they be in favour of nuclear do not mean that we be against wind i be the big enthusiast for offshore wind onshore wind solar and all these technology let we have all of they to get off fossil fuel and meet our electricity and energy demand 
 thank you mr speaker and happy birthday you be bear only a few month after the opening of calder hall the world ’s civil nuclear power plant so you share that 
 the secretary of state have make the major decision which be incredibly welcome in west cumbria to unlock up to acre of land at moorside for clean energy project include new nuclear this issue have be stick for many year and i welcome the secretary of state ’s effort on it the decision he make and the work he have do with the cumberland nuclear future board to make it happen will the secretary of state continue to work with i and local partner to drive the project through so that we get something deliver at the site secondly can he say more about the regulatory taskforce that be be undertake at the moment so that we can cut through the bureaucracy and build reactor more quickly 
 to reassure you mr speaker you look much young than the calder hall nuclear power station 
 and it be be decommission that be even bad 
 absolutely right there will be no decommissioning of you mr speaker 
 i congratulate my hon friend on show incredible leadership for his constituent on this issue it have be a pleasure to work with he and other colleague on these question he be right about the potential he be also right about the regulatory question we have some of the high standard of regulation in the world but it be always right that we look at how we can improve standard of regulation and avoid change in regulation during the course of project which be crucial for success that be the work we be get on with 
 happy birthday mr speaker to give credit where it be due i totally welcome today ’s announcement on nuclear where i disagree with the secretary of state be on his persistence to plough ahead with inefficient technology such as solar and the associate paraphernalia such as battery storage which trash the buckinghamshire countryside and indeed the wide british countryside nuclear work solar work about of the time will he have great courage and plough ahead with this much more efficient nuclear technology and drop solar 
 i thank the hon member for part of what he say if not most of it we have a fundamental disagreement solar and wind offer cheap power for our country why would we possibly say no to that the big threat to the countryside be the climate crisis and solar and wind alongside nuclear be the way to tackle it 
 i too wish you a happy birthday mr speaker i very much welcome the statement which be about the future visione and future proofing of our energy security and production i particularly welcome the £ investment in fusion include for the step spherical tomahawk for energy production programme at west burton in north nottinghamshire i thank ministers for their work to secure that which be very welcome indeed the process have already start with the tender outcome for the construction and the design and technology to be announce later this year i be champion british company which be very much part of that process 
 i be excited about the thousand of job and skill in new infrastructure that will be develop because of this programme the work have already start on the skill partnership which be stretch right across region include the east midland lincolnshire and south yorkshire that partnership be work with our further education college our university and the advanced manufacturing centre in rotherham do the secretary of state agree that left behind red wall area such as mine be where we need investment to revise our energy production and our industry this be where we start and i want to see more 
 i thank my hon friend for her advocacy when i be in discussion with the chancellor i do think that if this do not go ahead i would have to answer to my hon friend and to the mayor of the east midlands so she be a motivate force in ensure that the project do go ahead her point be crucial this be about good job in area of the country that really need those good job last night i be talk to an apprentice from sizewell she go there at age and have be there for a year about the experience she have have she give credit to sizewell we can see her career in front of she and we want that for lot more people 
 assume that the large nuclear power station at sizewell c and the small modular reactor both prove to be successful as we trust they will be what be the government ’s think about the respective role of each of those very different type which do the secretary of state think will be the well bet in the long term for the future of the country can he assure we that china will have no part in any of this 
 on the latter point yes i can assure the right hon gentleman of that he ask a typically astute question if i may say so the truth about these technology i think be that the answer be both we can not really make a judgment about this until we see the smr programme develop the smr programme offer something that have elude nuclear for a long time which be modularity and replication and that as we know from other technology be the way to bring down cost and speed up delivery there be huge potential in both but large scale gigawatt can also play an important role 
 i warmly welcome the smr announcement which be great news for sheffield as rolls royce be already do significant work at the advanced manufacturing research centre when i meet rolls royce recently it say that of its bid could be build and produce in great britain how will the government hold rolls royce to account for that and ensure that the announcement deliver great job and great investment right across the uk 
 i thank my right hon friend for her incredible advocacy on this issue include at the amrc she make such an important point this will be taxpayer money and we need to ensure that as much as possible be build in britain i make absolutely no apology for say that the answer to her question be that as we negotiate term with rolls royce over the come month that will be a key part of our discussion 
 this £ splurge on english nuclear power plant come on top of £ for english carbon capture and storage while there be nothing for scotland ’s acorn project with grangemouth allow to close and the fiscal regime ruin the north east ’s energy job this late announcement show that scotland be not an afterthought scotland be not a thought at all if nearly £ can be find for english energy project why have money never be find for scotland ’s carbon capture project 
 maybe a change in the snp ’s position be come absolutely if the hon lady want let we have a discussion about scottish nuclear power station we be in favour of the acorn project and will say more about that in the come week but on nuclear power snp members have really get to think again they be stick their head in the sand this be about job investment and clean energy they should really rethink 
 if i have know it be your birthday mr speaker i would have bring you down a chorley cake but never mind as you know my constituency host heysham and nuclear power station as the secretary of state be aware i be push for heysham also to host new nuclear will he tell i how today ’s announcement support nuclear community such as mine and will enable the next generation of nuclear across the country 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to get slightly into the weed the new planning framework that we be consult on open up possibility for new nuclear today we have set out the public money that we can commit to new nuclear at this stage we be see this a bit in the us and in other country with a increase in nuclear investment last year globally my message to the private sector be that if it be interested in partner with we and say to we we want to build in place other than those where you ’ve put the public investment we be absolutely open for business and dialogue 
 the secretary of state will be aware that it be originally propose to build a nuclear power station base on a chinese design at bradwell on sea in my constituency be a station it will not be chinese at bradwell still a possibility or could it be allocate an smr 
 good nuclear site include bradwell be always go to be possibility as far as i be concern we be not go to have china build our nuclear power station but if the right hon gentleman want to discuss this with my department we will be happy to do so 
 it be clear that this labour government be put pound behind promise to deliver clean energy and good skilled job in all part of the country with that in mind give its importance to north wales will my right hon friend confirm that great british energy nuclear will prioritise wylfa 
 i be glad that my hon friend have ask that question wylfa be an incredibly important site that have huge potential for our country obviously over the month ahead great british energy nuclear will look at the role that wylfa can play in relation to smr and large scale nuclear 
 the secretary of state ’s message to the private sector be if you want to build new nuclear britain be open company have tell i that they need decisive and committed leadership from the uk government to be confident to invest in a new project at wylfa i have raise that time in the   chamber yet today there be no mention of wylfa will the secretary of state make it clear that the uk government support the delivery of new nuclear project at wylfa 
 yes we do again we be open to discussion with the hon lady and other colleague 
 i will not say happy birthday to you again mr speaker perhaps we can arrange to sing it next time so that we do not all have to repeat it 
 the secretary of state ’s statement be welcome the other welcome news today be the government ’s commitment to £ of investment at sheffield forgemasters that be primarily for defence nuclear but it also provide extra capacity for civil nuclear there be a bit of concern about rolls royce ’s link with czechia so will my right hon friend commit to use forging from sheffield forgemasters in the of its type smr in this country and build the supply chain so that the vast majority of job be provide for british worker 
 i definitely believe that sheffield forgemasters have an incredibly important role to play in our civil nuclear programme contractual detail for rolls royce and our discussion with the company be for a bit down the road but in my view forgemasters be central to our plan
