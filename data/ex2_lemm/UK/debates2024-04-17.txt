 what step the government be take to regulate ai 
 what step the government be take to regulate ai 
 what step the government be take to regulate ai 
 what step her department be take to regulate artificial intelligence 
 in our white paper on ai regulation we set out our ambitious pro regulation pro innovation framework outline cross sectoral principle to be apply by exist regulator in february we publish our response set out how we be support regulator to deliver the framework and strengthen our global ai leadership that include new funding and guidance for our regulator and we have establish a central risk function to support 
 yet we hear just a few month ago from the prime minister that the uk ’s answer be not to rush to regulate the competition and markets authority have be clear about the potential harm that unregulated ai could generate from bake in bias that affect certain demographic and general purpose model that could get out of control why have the government drag their foot on safeguard for the most advanced ai model or be the secretary of state simply wait for the next labour government to control the new ai model 
 mr speaker this be absolute tosh we have lead the world when it come to ai safety we have set up a long term process in the ai safety summit and the next will be in seoul in just a few week we have also set up the world ’s ai safety institute which be test both pre and post deployment we have also be clear we will not rush to legislate we will grip the risk and well understand they rather than produce out of date legislation as a gimmick 
 tomorrow the tuc will officially launch its bill on ai regulation and employment right which recognise that transparency observability and explainability be all key element of a fair and just workplace what will the government do to ensure that ai do not lead to a weakening of worker right 
 we want to garnish the opportunity of ai for the british public which include the comple- mentary aspect that it can pose for job especially in teaching and medicine by take away some of the admin and bureaucracy we be also very realistic that technology always change labour market need in of the job we now have do not exist that be why we have undergo a revolution in our skill system include the launch of the lifelong learning entitlement next year 
 it be all very well the government say that they will take their time over this response but the point be that the federation of small businesses be say that a regulatory framework be urgent and dr rogoyski of the university of surrey be point out that delay could mean the uk probably have no choice but to follow the approach of the us and europe on ai regulation can the secretary of state set out exactly what the timeframe will be for regulation 
 the hon member be get confuse between regulation and legislation we already have a plethora of regulation and world lead regulator that we be support we be clear in our white paper response that we will legislate as will every nation around the world but we want to get that legislation right she comment on the us ’s approach we be work hand in glove with the us and i sign the world ’s memorandum of understanding on ai institute just a few week ago 
 what assessment have the government make of the united nation ’s plan to internationally regulate artificial intelligence what be the implication for uk sovereign security 
 the uk government be commit to unlock the opportunity of ai while mitigate the risk that require both domestic and international action the uk be a lead voice internationally have host the ai safety summit which deliver the world bletchley declaration as well as actively participate at the un that include our proactive role shape unesco recommendation on ai ethic 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 the secretary of state know that lead ai developer be expect imminently to release new more sophisticated ai model can she confirm that our ai safety institute have have access to those model as be agree at bletchley park be it the case that the developer have make change to their model where they have be request by the institute 
 i know that my right hon friend share my passion and enthusiasm for this topic as well as a desire to make sure we grip the risk our institute be   the in the world to be do pre and post deployment testing in line with the agreement we make at bletchley park i can not get into the specific of which model we be test as i be sure he will understand as that be highly commercially sensitive information but i can assure he and the house that where risk be find we expect relevant action to be take the responsibility of developer be to ensure that their model be safe but the government be commit to hold they to account 
 do my right hon friend agree that spread good practice in this field be perhaps the most important thing for example the health benefit of ai have already be mention such as in the diagnosis of bowel cancer and that be about promote the health of the public at large those thing need to be push forward with urgency it be not enough just to try to slow thing down and over regulate 
 i absolutely agree ai have the potential to be revolutionary especially in area such as healthcare that be why at the summit we announce a £ pot to accelerate some of our exist healthcare mission we be work hand in hand with the department of health and social care on this important topic 
 i call the shadow minister 
 ai be an incredible new technology and it can help the nhs to save life but there be also risk such as the danger of deepfake the government have be warn about those risk yet time and again ministers have dither and delay and the government ’s failure to act be highlight in the financial times this week have the government run out of idea or be they just scared of their own back benchers 
 as the hon member will know we have the defend democracy taskforce which be dedicate to this very subject and be lead by the security minister my right hon friend   the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat we as a team be actively participate in that and we also work with social medium company and our international counterpart it be something that i personally put on the agenda at the summit and that i have personally discuss in forum such as the g7 the deputy prime minister be also lead the way with his ai compact there be no easy answer to this but we be work in a conciliatory and speedy manner to ensure that we address all opportunity and answer 
 what step her department be take to help protect the personal datum of individual 
 the data protection and digital information bill before parliament build on the high standard that we already have for personal datum protection it strengthen and modernise the regulator so that it can enforce standard must more robustly to protect people we be   look at what we can do to strengthen our cyber resilience and data infrastructure all the time as new technology develop 
 i thank my hon friend for that answer it be clearly vital that the enormous amount of personal datum collect by departments and private company be safeguard i have receive a number of complaint about people ’s personal datum be abuse by company and indeed about public sector datum be sell to company who then use it just this weekend our greater london authority candidate have his phone hack and his social medium destroy that be equally important as a demonstration of what can happen to democracy when datum be abuse will my hon friend take further action to safeguard people ’s personal datum 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight that case i regret what have happen to the gla candidate which highlight some of the risk in relation to technology that be why we have high data protection standard but there be a range of way in which we need to tackle this problem we have the national cyber strategy which be work to ensure that we can deal with the cyber threat we face we be take measure to protect our data infrastructure and try to do thing to stop fraud in the national stop think fraud strategy as well as new law on security of device such as connected device we need to do a whole range of thing but we need to keep make sure that we be vigilant about the risk 
 when my year old mother die i take on her landline for purely sentimental reason for month and month after that i keep get scam call offer all sort of dodgy product do the minister agree that the elderly almost more than anyone else must have their personal datum protect 
 i be sorry to hear of that experience which i be afraid be share by constituent across the country that be why we have take new measure in the datum bill to try to deal with scam call by try to ensure that we can see where those number be and take action by block they on bulk i appreciate what the hon member say it be something that we must tackle 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we be tell that this be the general election year in other country we already see those who want to manipulate democracy use ai to scrape together personal detail include someone ’s face and voice allow they to falsify candidate view what   the hon member for harrow east bob blackman   raise about the gla candidate be pertinent as we quickly approach the half of the year when we be tell the prime minister will finally call the election will the government commit to ensure that personal detail be protect for candidate voter and above all democracy as a matter of urgency 
 we absolutely share those concern that be why we have a defend democracy taskforce work across every department to look at the threat   to our democracy we face a substantial threat and it be that we must all be mindful of in how we conduct ourselves as candidate ai fake and the protection of datum be element of that but i assure the house that we be take a whole range of measure to ensure that the protection of the come general election be robust 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 individual personal data be not safe in tory hand a recent article in the guardian report that senior tory party official plan to make million from sell off their own member datum through the true blue app if the tory party be happy to sell off its own member personal datum how can the public possibly have confidence that their datum be safe under the government 
 the allegation that the hon lady have put forward be write in the guardian and i have not see they myself i be preside over the datum bill and i have see no evidence to suggest that we be try to bring forward law that would do such a thing 
 what step her department be take to implement the online safety act 
 ofcom be the independent regulator of the online safety act the government be work with it to implement the act as quickly as possible include the relevant secondary legislation ofcom be take a phase approach to bring the duty into effect and be consult on guidance and code of practice offence around serious online abuse come into effect on   january   this year 
 the online safety act introduce many measure to keep child safe but give the increase concern about child ’s online safety do the secretary of state agree that it be time to go even far and introduce a child safe phone that would ensure that at a minimum all phone intend for child be properly fit with parental control to stop child access harmful content 
 the government produce world lead legislation on online safety which put the onus on social medium company not parent i know that my right hon friend have speak about information which be particularly important to make it as easy as possible for parent she raise an important about device level control and i assure she that i be listen not just to member of this house but to parent 
 yesterday the government finally back labour ’s call and announce that they would make the creation of deepfake porn a criminal offence however it be disappointing that the government continue to adopt an intent base approach over of consent in relation to these crime why be minister prioritise a man ’s right to have banter over a woman ’s right to feel safe will the government look at the regulation of ai app such as nudify and clothoff which be freely available easy to use and exist only to humiliate and violate woman 
 i share the hon member ’s passion in this area which be why we put it in the online safety act with regard to the sharing of that content we have now go step far and be in the process of make it illegal to create that content in the place 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of ai on democracy 
 the government be clear that artificial intelligence be the define technology of our time with the potential to transform humanity positively we also recognise the challenge that ai can pose as have be say we be work to ensure that we respond to the full range of threat to our democratic process include through the defend democracy taskforce dsit be engage with social medium platform civil society group academia and international partner to tackle the risk that ai can pose to democracy 
 in the long term i agree that ai have enormous potential to support participation in politic and we should seek to harness that but in the short term disinformation and deepfake often put together by foreign actor threaten to have the most immediate impact on democracy what risk do the minister believe ai pose to this year ’s election in particular and what step be he take to alleviate those risk 
 let i be very clear the uk will not tolerate malicious cyber activity that target our democratic institution the deputy prime minister have already come to this dispatch box and take definitive action where that have happen the defend democracy taskforce and government team be work collaboratively to ensure that we respond to threat to our democratic process include digitally manipulate content the online safety act will force company to take proactive preventive action against illegal state sponsor content online via the foreign interference offence include deepfake and other ai generate content within the scope of the act 
 in short sentence will the minister reassure we that ai will not destroy not just democracy but the human race 
 sentence mr speaker i can confirm that the government be take a proactive approach to ai the defend democracy taskforce be work very hard to protect our democratic process 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i want the british people to be able to seize the extraordinary opportunity that ai offer but that can happen only if we address the   risk at bletchley park we kick start a global conversation and since then the bletchley effect have see country from around the world collaborate on the development of safe responsible and trustworthy ai week ago i sign an agreement with the united states to allow we to collaborate seamlessly on ai safety testing last week we announce the date of the ai safety summit in seoul we also remain laser focused on implement the landmark online safety act which will make britain the safe place to be online last month we see the sentencing under the cyber flash offence that we bring in in january 
 a fast and reliable internet connection be vital for everyday life and so many local business i conduct a broadband survey in east devon which show that some rural part of my constituency sadly still lag behind such as sidbury fluxton marsh green and talaton what step be the government take to ensure that broadband provider improve connection across our county 
 i be glad to say that over of premise in my hon friend ’s constituency can access gigabit capable broadband that be up from in but we want to do more so we have include mid and east devon in our cross regional framework for project gigabit that be currently undertake pre procurement market engagement we hope to give he news very soon 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the act of the prime minister be to promise a government of professionalism and integrity yet here we have a secretary of state who use her position to accuse a british scientist of be a terrorist sympathiser she go on to use public money to settle her libel case and then she try to cover up just how much taxpayer money she have waste be those the action of someone with integrity and professionalism yes or no 
 as the minister responsible for uk research and innovation i be alert to a tweet by official in my department which state this be disturb 
 and to the comment 
 suella braverman urge police to crack down on hamas support in uk 
 with no further context or wording that be post by a representative of an equality diversity and inclusion board that sit under ukri at the time like many other i be indeed concern and use the forum that the person use to alert ukri to my concern this be highlight use that medium but on receipt of the letter ukri itself say that it be deeply concern and launch an investigation 
 whatsapp can be very handy but it can also be very dangerous its end to end encryption mean that even the most vile illegal content such as child sexual abuse can not be police or prevent give the obvious danger to child do the secretary of state agree that it be woefully irresponsible of meta to reduce the age for use whatsapp to 
 we be pro innovation but also pro privacy however it be clearly not right for anyone to be expose on any service to harm such as sexual abuse extortion or grooming platform must have robust process in place to safeguard child in line with the online safety act responsible encryption have an important role to play in protect privacy but it should not compromise safety and ofcom will take robust action when that be compromise 
 at the lords science and technology committee the secretary of state say there have be no surveillance of academic in that case what be the evidence then on which she base her decision to write to the ukri chief executive 
 i have answer that multiple time an official alert i to those concern i then see the tweet myself and ask the department for further advice

 i too welcome the postmaster in the gallery in their quest for justice 
 this week we mark year since the disaster at hillsborough and the endure courage and determination of the family must be mark by the passing of a hillsborough law 
 we also lose lord richard rosser a lifelong member of the labour party he will be greatly miss and our thought be with his wife sheena and his family and friend 
 i be privileged to be the proud owner of a copy of the former prime minister ’s new book it be a rare unsigned copy it be the only unsigned copy it be quite the read she claim that the tory party ’s disastrous kamikaze budget which trigger chaos for million be the happy moment of her premiership have the prime minister meet anyone with a mortgage who agree 
 all i would say be that the right hon and learn gentleman ought to spend a bit less time read that book and a bit more time read the deputy leader ’s tax advice interruption 
 order i want to get through prime minister ’s question 
 we have a billionaire prime minister and a billionaire—[interruption both of whose family have use scheme to avoid million of pound of tax smear a working class woman interruption the former prime minister have a long list of people to blame for the economic misery conservative members do not want to hear it but they make her prime minister and million of people be pay the price she blame the governor of the bank of england the treasury the office for budget responsibility the american president be blame at point we even learn that the poor old lettuce be part of the deep state do the prime minister agree that it be actually much simple than that it be the tories unfunded tax cut ten of billion of pound of unfunded tax cut that crash the economy and leave million pay more for their mortgage be n’t it 
 everyone know that year ago i be not afraid to repeatedly warn about what my predecessor ’s economic policy would lead to even if it be not what people want to hear at the time i be right then but i be also right now when i say that the right hon and learn gentleman ’s economic policy would be a disaster for britain he would send inflation up mortgage up and tax up and work people would pay the price 
 i appreciate the prime minister have the stomach to say that out loud but everyone know that it be the tory party ’s obsession with wild unfunded tax cut that crash the economy we know it he know it and his party know it and the whole country be live it when be he finally go to learn the lesson from his predecessor ’s mistake and explain where the money be come from for his own completely unfunded £ promise to scrap national insurance 
 when my predecessor be run for leader i do have to use the right hon and learn gentleman ’s word the stomach to argue out loud about her economic policy i have the conviction to say   that they be wrong not once but twice he try to make his predecessor prime minister despite he oppose nato and trident ignore antisemitism and side with our enemy it be clear what the right hon and learn gentleman do he put his own interest ahead of britain ’s 
 actually when the prime minister be run for leader he explain how he be funnel money from poor area to pay it into rich area we know what his record be 
 i notice the prime minister be not deny the £ promise to scrap national insurance but he be refuse to say where the money will come from we have be try for month to get to the bottom of this so now be his chance no more spin no more waffle no more diversion i know that will be difficult this be the choice either he can cut the state pension or the nhs which national insurance fund that be route or he can put up income tax which be it 
 we have just cut taxis by £ for a typical worker we have deliver the big tax cut for business since the 1980s but while we be cut taxis labour be already put they up in wales it be put up taxis right now for small business in birmingham it be put up council tax by in london the labour mayor have put up taxis by this be just a glimpse of what they would do if they get into power a few week ago the right hon and learn gentleman finally admit it to the sun what do he say he would do he say we would put up taxis it be always the same high taxis and work people pay the price 
 no single politician have ever put tax up more time than the prime minister have but hang on he be just give the chance to rule out cut the nhs or state pension to pay for scrap national insurance i be a lawyer long enough to know when someone be avoid the question so i be go to give he another chance will he now rule out cut to the nhs cut to the state pension or put up taxis to pay for his unfunded £ promise to scrap national insurance which be it 
 i make absolutely no apology about want to end the unfairness of the double taxation on work the nhs be receive record funding under this conservative government pensioner have just receive a £ increase under this government if the right hon and learn gentleman want to talk about tax let we have a look at what labour ’s brand newly appoint tax adviser have to say this adviser think that support pensioner be a complete disgrace he believe their free tv licence be ridiculous if it be not bad enough this adviser have call for increase in income tax national insurance and vat it all make sense now that be who the shadow chancellor have be copy and paste from 
 this be genuinely extraordinary chance to rule out cut to state pension cut to the nhs or income tax rise to fund his promise to abolish national insurance—[interruption 
 order mr holden i want you to set a good example not a bad 
 this really matter the prime minister have have chance to rule out cut to the nhs cut to pension or tax rise this matter to million of people watch who will want to know what be go to happen to their nhs and pensions—[interruption it really do matter to million of people who be watch so i will be really generous now and give he last chance it be very simple and very clear be his £ promise to abolish national insurance be pay for by cut to the nhs cut to the state pension or yet another tory tax rise 
 the right hon and learn gentleman have really get to keep up it be this government who have just deliver a £ increase to the state pension it be this government who have already commit to the triple lock for the next parliament he have have opportunity but i do not think i hear he say that when it come to the nhs you would much rather be treat in the conservative run nhs in england than in the labour run nhs in wales it be another week where all we have hear be political sniping not a word about their plan for the country he have fail to acknowledge that since we last meet taxis have be cut by £ the state pension have go up free childcare have be expand wage have rise for month in a row and just today inflation be down again to our plan be work and the conservatives be deliver a bright future for britain 
 mr speaker you will not be surprised to learn that i very much welcome the £ allocate to carlton in my constituency as part of the long term plan for town i be eager to see that this money be spend accord to local wish i know that there will be consultation follow the setting up of the town board so will my right hon friend join i in urge carlton resident to take part in those forthcoming consultation to make sure that their voice be hear and to ensure that this money be spend on what the people want 
 i thank my hon friend for his tireless campaign on behalf of the resident of carlton our long term plan for town mean that town across the country include carlton will benefit from £ each to invest in their local area crucially as he have say it will be in the hand of local people to decide on their priority for the place where they live whether it be regenerate local high street invest in park and green space or tackle antisocial behaviour we be level up across the country and he deserve enormous praise for his role in secure that investment 
 i call the scottish national party leader 
 this week a former prime minister who oversee a financial crash before be unceremoniously turf from office tell the public the truth and i be not refer to that mr speaker on monday gordon brown tell the people of these isle that 
 the force pull britain apart be great than the force hold it together 
 maybe the prime minister can find some time this afternoon to agree with just of his predecessor 
 where i do agree with my predecessor very strongly be that scotland would be far strong inside the united kingdom 
 gordon brown be also correct in state that scottish independence be not simply off the agenda those remark be echo just yesterday by the general secretary of the scottish trades union congress who state that it remain an unresolved issue—[laughter conservative members may laugh at she but she go on to say 
 that can be a very dangerous place to end up in when you be not allow people to express their wish in a democratic manner 
 do the prime minister welcome the fulsome wholehearte and warm support of the labour party in deny the people of scotland the opportunity to have a say over their own future 
 we do have a democratic vote on that topic but i would suggest to the snp that rather than obsess about independence and waste time crack down on free speech and try to lock up j. k. rowling he should focus on what the people of scotland care about school hospital job and our new tax cut 
 i abhor a tier policing system and we must ensure that everyone be treat equally under the rule of law the labour police and crime commissioner who investigate the beergate scandal hand their police chief constable a new year contract while the investigation into the labour party leader and deputy leader be ongoing now former mp be oversee the force due to investigate the labour deputy leader do the prime minister agree that complete transparency throughout this investigation be of the utmost importance 
 my hon friend make an important point a key principle of our country be that there be the same rule for everyone on this topic the labour leader should show some leadership stop read the legal advice simply publish it and get a grip of the situation it say a lot about his priority that with his famed legal expertise he be more than happy to help defend hizb ut tahrir but refuse to help his deputy 
 the recently publish kenova report make it clear that the ira be riddle with british agent from top to bottom those agent be involve in the abduction torture and murder of british and irish citizen the british government successive british government know all about it and do nothing the report also call for an apology from the government to those victim will the prime minister take this opportunity to make that apology 
 as the hon gentleman will know the report be an interim as the secretary of state have lay out we can not comment on the finding until we get the final report but we would never condone wrongdoing where there be evidence of that i will also say because it be not say enough that the overwhelming majority of the police armed force and intelligence service serve with great distinction they defend democracy in the face of some horrendous violence and without their service and their sacrifice there would   have be no peace process they help ensure that the future of northern ireland will never be decide by violence but by the consent of its people 
 do my right hon friend agree we do not agree on everything that anyone who want to see why the government introduce strong mayors need look only at ben houchen in the tees valley from save our airport to introduce our freeport to bring steelmaking back ben deliver do my right hon friend also agree that the good thing be that ben have do this without charge any mayoral tax which his labour opponent would need to do to fund his unfunded spending plan 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right to raise the great work of ben houchen i share his concern about the pledge of the labour candidate over £ of unfunded spending show that labour can not be trust we see the result in labour run birmingham with taxis go up by the story of labour in local government be of work people pay the price that be exactly why my right hon friend and i completely agree that the people of teesside should vote ben houchen and vote conservative 
 last year in shropshire people wait for more than hour in a&e. that be people over wait on hard plastic chair or on trolley in our accident and emergency department the prime minister tell we that he have get a plan for the nhs but people in north shropshire want to know how long they will have to wait for he to get on and fix the issue where we be 
 with the record funding that we be put into the nhs our urgent and emergency care plan be deliver more ambulance and more bed with fast discharge through our hospital to speed the flow and that plan be work of course there be more to do but this winter we see ambulance and a&e wait time improve from the year before for the time in many year and if we stick to the plan we will continue to deliver improvement for the hon lady ’s constituent and everyone else

 robotic surgery allow laparoscopic surgery to be perform with increase precision flexibility and control this can result in reduce patient complication rate reduced length of stay in hospital and reduce hospital readmission however there be currently no robotic surgery provision in cornwall as a result resident of cornwall must travel to devon for robotic procedure a journey of more than mile for those from west cornwall and mile for those from the isles of scilly will the prime minister commit to ringfence capital funding for cornwall to establish a robotic surgery service and address the health inequality our constituent have live with for far too long 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight the potential of this innovative technology for patient care i be delighted that more generally cornwall be benefit from our new hospital programme provide a new woman and child ’s hospital at the royal cornwall hospital in the centre of cornwall which he and i discuss when i be last with he nhs england be actively explore opportunity to expand robotic assist surgery any decision on fund new allocation will factor in health inequality such as area with less access to robot to date i will ensure that the current access to robotic surgery in my hon friend ’s local community be appropriately consider by the relevant health minister

 i be pleased to speak with prime minister netanyahu who thank the uk for its support of israel ’s security over the weekend we discuss the situation and how iran be isolate on the world stage i also make the point to he that significant escalation be not in anyone ’s interest and that it be a time for calm head to prevail i also reiterate our concern about the humanitarian situation in gaza i welcome the statement and commitment that the israeli government have make about significantly increase aid into gaza and now we need to see those commitment deliver 
 resident in smalley and denby now face huge solar farm application there be only a metre gap between they and both site be wholly in the green belt do the prime minister agree that we should change plan guidance to make it absolutely clear that productive farm in the green belt be not the right place for solar farm and that the investment and the time be spend should go on site that might be appropriate such as car park brownfield land or roof of industrial building rather than waste people ’s time and cause fear 
 my hon friend be right that particularly at a time of increase geopolitical risk we must protect our nation ’s food security and therefore our most valuable agricultural land we do want to see more solar which be of the cheap form of energy but as he say on brownfield site rooftop and away from our good agricultural land that be why our recently publish national infrastructure planning rule set out the requirement for solar not to be place on what be describe as the good and most valuable versatile land where possible the secretaries of state for energy security and net and for environment food and rural affairs be ensure that developer and planning authority strike the right balance so that we can deliver what my hon friend want which be more british food grow here at home 
 i go out recently with chris mcewan the mayoral candidate in teesside it be clear that resident be really worried about crime level in tory run teesside be among the high in the country the residential burglary rate be high than anywhere else in the country when will the prime minister realise that he have lose control not only of his party but of crime in this country 
 mr speaker what a joke we have police and crime commissioner election across the country and the hon lady really should look at the record under this government crime have be cut by and we have more police officer let i give she the fact because this be why it be so extraordinary to hear what she say people with a labour police and crime commissioner be more likely to be victim of burglary and twice as likely to be victim of robbery the fact completely speak for themselves so people should vote conservative for safe street 
 every month in my constituency the labour run warrington borough council spend nearly £    on interest payment to cover its £ debt it have use borrow to spend on an energy company that go bust office in birmingham and manchester and even a business park that it purchase through an offshore company presumably to avoid pay tax do the prime minister agree that it be time to send in the inspector warrington borough council have go too far in its money make scheme local council should be focus on deliver great service and the way to achieve that be by vote conservative on may 
 this year the government announce a furth £ in extra funding for local council a real term increase as have be the case in every single year of this parliament but we all know what happen when labour be in charge whether it be rack up debt in warrington as my hon friend say increase council tax by in labour run birmingham slash service in nottingham or as i have just say high crime on average in each labour police and crime commissioner area it be crystal clear that whenever labour be in charge it be work people who pay the price 
 while people be on the waiting list for a council house in the west midland family be live in hotel cold and damp home and mouldy flat the mayor of the west midlands andy street have build social home in year do the prime minister think that that be good enough 
 andy street be absolutely deliver for the west midland unlike the labour mayor in london he have deliver on all his housing target it be the labour run council in birmingham that be impose on the hon lady ’s constituent and other a council tax rise and what be they get in exchange job loss and cut to service on some street they be even turn off the light what labour have do to birmingham the conservatives will never let it do to britain 
 i ask the prime minister to thank my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport for hold further meeting with hitachi this morning and indeed with the union representative we be all glad to see what happen with alstom yesterday but it be important that we do the same to support the factory up at hitachi in aycliffe 
 i thank my hon friend for his role in champion the rail industry in the uk as he rightly say the department for transport and the secretary of state have be actively engage with company to ensure that we have a robust supply chain as my hon friend know we be invest record amount in rail particularly in the north and we be pleased to see that that be be deliver 
 the prime minister be no doubt aware of the collapse of ssb law and many constituent include hundred in my constituency have be affect and have bill of up to hundred of thousand constituent have to sell his wedding gift and his father have a heart attack with the stress people be have to raid their pension pot they be   get bill and bailiff be knock on the door will the prime minister meet i and my constituent representative on the collapse of ssb law and make sure that the government respond to this injustice that have happen to people across the country 
 i be sorry to hear about the situation impact the hon lady ’s constituent i will be more than happy to make sure that the right minister look into it and that we get back to she as soon as possible 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 the deputy foreign secretary be regrettably unable to respond to this question in person as he be at the world bank spring meeting in washington i will respond on his behalf early this month we pass a grim milestone month since hamas ’s horrific terrorist attack on israel the uk government have be work with partner across the region to secure the release of hostage include british national we want to see the release of all hostage 
 palestinian civilian have spend these month suffer with condition worsen by the day the humanitarian situation in gaza be dire the iran attack and our support for israel have not change our focus on ensure that israel meet its commitment to enable at least aid truck a day to enter gaza to open ashdod port for aid delivery to expand the jordan land corridor to open a crossing into northern gaza and to extend hour at kerem shalom and nitzana we be push as hard as we can to get aid to palestinian civilian as this house know we have be urge israel at the high level to take immediate action on the bottleneck hold up humanitarian relief we have recently see a small increase in the number of aid truck be allow to enter gaza but not all of they be full and number be not yet close to reach the level require give the severity of the humanitarian situation that we   now see 
 we will continue to press israel to take immediate action to open ashdod fully for humanitarian aid meanwhile we recently announce new support for a life save aid corridor by sea to gaza include the deployment of a royal navy ship which have now arrive in the mediterranean and be ready to integrate with the us pier and provide a command and control platform 
 we be also commit up to £ for aid delivery through that corridor as well as provide logistical expertise and equipment in recent week the royal air force have conduct airdrop along the gazan coast deliver more than tonne of food the uk med field hospital fund by the uk be up and run in gaza and have already treat more than people a high proportion of they child we need to see the operating environment in gaza improve so that more aid get in and can be distribute quickly safely and effectively israel must ensure that the un have the access equipment and staff that it need to   do that 
 we be horrify by the attack on the world central kitchen convoy which kill aid worker include very dedicated british national israel must do more to protect aid worker include through guarantee deconfliction for aid convoy and other humanitarian work to ensure that they can operate safely the finding of israel ’s investigation must be publish in full and follow up with a wholly independent review to ensure the utmost transparency and accountability 
 month on however much we might wish otherwise the fighting have not yet come to an end we can not and will not stand by the foreign secretary be in the region this week press for further action 
 thank you mr speaker for grant i this urgent question 
 condition in gaza be desperate and intolerable famine be take hold sewage be pool in the street and the water have still not be switch back on almost nothing be reach northern gaza where people be already die of starvation the healthcare system have be utterly devastate yesterday lead non governmental organisation tell i about specific block and restriction that they face from israeli authority in do their life save work aid be sit wait unable to reach those in need with some rotting where it stand item be remove from truck without explanation and doctor be reuse single use medical equipment take from patient who have die today a un report say that woman have be kill that be a description of hell on earth it can not go on 
 for month we have demand that aid flow without restriction unfettered and unimpeded at a level that meet humanitarian need the un security council have demand it the international court of justice have order it however despite the pledge that have be make un figure show that more aid go in on some day in january than go in yesterday so i have question for the government 
 can the minster be clear that israel be not meet its commitment and about what pressure the government be apply to change that secondly why have the government not yet announce that they be restore future funding to the united nations relief and works agency it be shock that in the face of famine the uk be of the last major donor yet to resume funding without explanation thirdly why be the government seemingly soften their message to netanyahu on rafah let we be clear palestinians shelter there have nowhere safe to go 
 there can be no humanitarian operation to meet the scale of need without an immediate ceasefire now both side must agree to comply we note that it be hamas and their leader sinwar who reject the late ceasefire deal both side must urgently agree to end this war now to prevent the further loss of innocent life to free the hostage still cruelly hold by hamas and to allow a surge of aid into gaza 
 important point have be make it be important to welcome israel ’s commitment to increase the amount of aid get into gaza and the limited step that have be make but and this be an important but more must be do as the right hon gentleman say to realise those commitment and we continue to urge that that happen as i say the foreign secretary be in the region and we be work hard on those issue 
 the right hon gentleman also talk about unrwa the final report from catherine colonna be due at the end of april we will review that and make a decision on future funding we recognise the important role that unrwa play on the wide more strategic point about our approach it be clear that we want to see a humanitarian pause before then push for the condition for a sustainable ceasefire 
 do my hon friend agree that the position of the hostage be absolutely key and be he able to report any more progress he have explain that hamas have not agree to the late proposal but do he agree that pressure need to be put on they by their interlocutor who be work with they to do something solid on the hostage problem and to do it speedily 
 as i have say the government continue to call for an immediate humanitarian pause to allow for the release of hostage while we can not provide a running commentary on negotiation which be highly sensitive and ongoing the uk be use all our diplomatic channel to support international negotiation effort facilitate by egypt qatar and the us 
 we now come to the snp spokesperson 
 under standably perhaps the world ’s attention have be on the shocking iranian missile attack at the weekend but we can not and must not forget about the humanitarian crisis in gaza and the plight of million of innocent civilian face a man make famine and live with the constant threat of attack neither can we forget the immensely brave humanitarian aid worker particularly the world central kitchen employee whose status as humanitarian appear to have offer they little or no protection from the israel defence forces despite the promise make the united nations have report that this week more than of what it try to take into gaza be reject those of we who have be to the border and see the effort of the egyptian red crescent and its warehouse full of reject medical equipment have a pretty good idea of what those item be this be an area that have no single operational hospital 
 the elephant in the room though be arm export licence for how much long be the uk go to send humanitarian aid to gaza while simultaneously license weapon sale to israel would not the good form of humanitarian aid for the people of gaza be to stop supply israel with the weapon that will kill they 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight what happen in iran recently and of course we must not forget the humanitarian situation on the ground in gaza as i highlight in my opening remark we be work very hard to make sure that the aid he talk about can come through he also talk about export the late assessment carry out by the foreign secretary leave our position on export license unchanged that be consistent with the advice ministers have receive we will continue to keep that position under review but the hon gentleman should remember his opening point about iran and what happen recently i will leave it there on export control 
 humanitarian aid get into the gaza strip be very important have my hon friend notice that in the last couple of day the white house national security spokesman say in an interview with nbc that the aid get into gaza have increase by a large amount in the past few day more than truck have be able to get in include about truck in the past   hour alone bakery have reopen in northern   gaza in the past week produce some pita bread daily and food aid convoy be now continue via the newly open northern crossing of course there be always more to do as i have say that be very important but do my hon friend accept that there have be significant improvement consider that this be still an active war zone 
 i be grateful for the comment of my right hon and learn friend as i say in my response to the opposition spokesman sorry could he remind i of his question again 
 it be about aid improve 
 we have see limited improvement my right hon and learn friend say that it have be significant and it have but from a low base and as i have set out our aspiration be clearly a lot high there be a number of key area in which we want to see further improvement and we be work closely with israel on that 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 airdrop promise of harbour and promise of money to come be not even touch the side of the problem give its scale people be starve to death at the beginning of march my committee publish a report call on the uk government to press for more than truck of humanitarian aid a day to be allow into gaza for all the crossing to open for the israeli military to co operate well with aid agency and for deconfliction so that humanitarian worker can live and also safely carry out their vital work despite the foreign secretary ’s optimism about great humanitarian flow the average be just over truck a week why be this government not do more to persuade israel to meet its responsibility under international law and facilitate aid to the people of gaza how many more people have to die 
 i understand the hon member ’s concern particularly give her position as chair of the international development committee but i have highlight already that we be press incredibly hard on israel to make further progress and there have be limit progress the foreign secretary be in the region and he continue to press this case as do my the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my right hon friend   the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell who be do important work in this area as well 
 i be sorry to question the minister again on the same theme but he will be start to appreciate the frustration in the house over the last month we have hear the government beg plead with and press israel and have telephone call meeting and conversation with it we even have the raf in the sky rightly to defend israel from iran yet it occur to many of we that the israeli government care little for what we say to the extent that medical aid for palestinians report that a famine in gaza over the next few week be all but inevitable when will we realise that say thing be make no difference and that we have to act not least to take   step to enforce the judgment of the international court of justice when will we actually do something concrete to save life 
 as i have say we be press incredibly hard to make sure that we see further progress in this vital area i have highlight that of the key thing we be do be commit £ for aid delivery through the life save aid corridor to gaza through the sea that be a material step it be action that be be take but clearly we will continue to put pressure on the israelis they have make commitment and we want they to stand up and realise or allow agency to realise those commitment 
 crossing be still not open truck be go in half empty and of the un ’s request to send aid into northern gaza be be refuse by the israeli government that be the reality on the ground the colonna report come out this saturday on   april not at the end of the month when will the government come to this house to tell we when they will reinstate funding to unrwa which be the only aid organisation with the infrastructure on the ground to deliver aid at scale 
 as i have say we will review that report when we receive it we will make our final decision and we will come to parliament to explain that decision as i have also highlight and more importantly as the development minister have highlight we recognise the vital role that unrwa play 
 the foreign secretary be very proud to announce that the united kingdom have set up a contact group for the middle east which have member from europe the middle east and the united states there be a key link to the humanitarian situation in palestine and gaza in that all the group ’s member and the european commission have decide to fund unrwa the contact group aim to find a solution in the middle east why be it take we so long to make a decision when our european counterpart have make theirs i also ask the minister to ask the foreign secretary i have raise this with he and the prime minister to set up an international donor conference for palestine as we do in the case of the friends of syria we need to move forward urgently and show our leadership on this matter as the situation be get critical 
 as i have say and i will say it again we will wait for the final colonna report before we make a decision on unrwa this situation be particularly concern so we need that report in order to make a decision my hon friend will remember that we treble the amount of aid we provide to the occupied palestinian territories now our task be to make sure that we can do that and find way to get that aid in 
 yesterday oxford doctor nick maynard and deborah harrington brief parliamentarian very movingly on their experience of treat people in gaza they impress on we how important it be that they be keep safe and how many of their colleague have die   i be sure that the minister and the whole house will thank they for their tireless work as well as other aid worker and anyone who give over their safety to save other they also point out that the malnutrition that we see be make patient more vulnerable to infectious disease a report release by the london school of hygiene tropical medicine project that if the situation continue as it be there will be excess death that be that number will die over and beyond the number who have die by bomb if something be not done.[official report   april vol c. 6wc correction do the minister agree that we need not only an immediate bilateral ceasefire but rebuild of the medical situation in gaza now not later because that be what be stop people get the life save treatment that they desperately need 
 i join the hon member in praise the vital work of aid worker in the most challenging of circumstance and i highlight the courage and bravery that they demonstrate obviously we want to create condition in which they can operate more safely she call for a ceasefire we call for a pause that can lead to a sustainable ceasefire of course as we move to such a situation some of the thing she talk about particularly the extra medical support can be provide 
 access to the north of gaza for those provide humanitarian aid be still dire and child be report to have die of malnutrition and dehydration unrwa continue to be disproportionately affect by access restriction and it be last able to deliver food to northern gaza at the end of january as we have hear other country be restore funding to unrwa include the united states so why be we take so long 
 we want to see the report and then we will make our final decision we recognise the important role of unrwa and we also recognise the importance of open a crossing in northern gaza as my hon friend highlight in her opening point we be press the israelis to stand up to their commitment 
 yesterday i attend a meeting of british doctor who have recently be in gaza and they describe the systematic targeting of healthcare in gaza let we be clear that be a war crime a un special rapporteur recently warn at a meeting that mps organise that government ministers and official involve in arm export to israel should be absolutely clear that they could be individually criminally liable for aid and abet war crime in gaza will the minister say on the record in this house and ahead of next week ’s high court hearing that the legal advice that the government have receive confirm that there be no such risk and that arm sale be in line with international law 
 after our late assessment of our position on export licence it remain unchanged and be consistent with the advice that minister have receive we will continue to keep the position under review 
 as have be reference our close ally in the united states have commend israel for step up the amount of aid get into gaza but once aid truck be on the gazan side of the   border hamas have seek to hijack the truck and to cynically use the distribution of aid as a political weapon as have be recognise by this government what assessment have my hon friend make of the level of control that hamas exercise over unrwa and the distribution of aid 
 my hon friend make important point which set out why we be wait for the final report as i have say repeatedly before make a final decision the underlying situation relate to unrwa be very challenging and we need to make sure that aid be use for the appropriate purpose 
 the government rightly condemn iran for risk destabilisation in the region and for demonstrate that it be intent on sow chaos in its own backyard yet we have have month of israel kill civilian doctor and aid worker destroy almost all civilian infrastructure in gaza cut off water fuel and electricity and severely limit the supply of aid that be all in clear violation of international law have destabilise the region and have sow chaos in israel ’s own backyard so will the minister condemn the action of israel too 
 we recognise that israel have the right to defend itself and as i have say we be call for an immediate pause in order to get aid in and the hostage out we also recognise the destabilising action of iran and its acolyte and we must ensure that we push back and seek to de escalate the whole situation 
 by now there could have be a humanitarian pause and aid could be flow into gaza to help those poor individual threaten with famine and war but of course just as the last humanitarian pause be breach by hamas hamas refuse to accept a ceasefire on the term that have be agree such a ceasefire would mean that the hostage could be come back now and the people of gaza could be receive aid do the minister agree that hamas be clearly the obstacle to peace in the middle east 
 clearly hamas be an obstacle to peace their action provoke terrible atrocity in israel back in october which we find abhorrent now we want to ensure that we find a way of tackle the terrible humanitarian situation as i have describe and tackle far destabilising activity by iran 
 in reply to my write question on   april the minister say 
 we want unrwa to give detailed undertaking about change in personnel policy and precedent 
 have the minister or any of his colleague actively seek those undertaking and change from unrwa by contact it directly if so in what state be that request last make 
 the broad issue about unrwa be that we be wait for the final report and then we can make decision i will raise the hon gentleman ’s detailed point with the minister of state my right hon friend   the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell and get back to he 
 will the minister confirm that it be inconceivable that the money we would earmark for unrwa will not be give this year and will he either set out what alternative agency he think could do achieve the same outcome on the ground or confirm that we will have to give unrwa the money anyway in which case we might as well get on with it 
 i have already say that unrwa carry out important work and have a vital role but the concern about its activity mean that we must have this report we then want to look at our approach and our funding in relation to that 
 oxfam have report that people be project to be face catastrophic level of food insecurity in gaza and child be now starve samantha power administrator for usaid tell the us congress last week that northern gaza be now experience famine do the government share that assessment and how will aid get there 
 we continue to be very concerned about the humanitarian challenge in gaza and as i have highlight we be press hard and take step ourselves we have increase the amount of aid that we be commit to the region and we be focus laser like in seek that israel should step up to the commitment it have make it have already make limited progress we need to see more 
 israel ’s right to self defence come with clear responsibility gaza have become a conflict hellhole and the delivery of more humanitarian aid from the international community include the un be non discretionary will the minister please confirm that everything possible be be do with the israeli government to ensure that non combatant be be support and be not be inadvertently target or hit 
 we have highlight that with the israeli government and i confirm that we be push incredibly hear not only be we increase the amount of aid that we give to the region but we want to ensure that it get through we have already deploy a number of airdrop which have help but a lot more need to be do 
 as have be say more than people have be kill of whom be woman and child the international court of justice have warn of genocide and more than a people have be leave starve while almost be displace from their home even as the foreign office ’s own legal advice which it continually refuse to make public be purport to declare that the israeli military be break international law and as the un security council pass a resolution call for an immediate ceasefire the reality remain that nothing have change bomb be still fall child be still starve and civilian be still die let i ask the minister a simple question do international humanitarian law mean anything anymore when the uk and the international community continue to refuse to draw a line 
 i understand the hon gentleman ’s passion and concern about the area and we continue to have grave concern about humanitarian access however that be not sufficient to undermine our judgment that israel be commit to comply with ihl in general 
 israel ’s military be report to be use lavender an artificial intelligence system to help choose its bombing target in gaza that be machine decision making over human decision making and it arguably sacrifice accuracy in favour of speed the lavender system identify target which be review for only second before authorisation of a strike what discussion have the minister have with colleague in the ministry of defence about the use of ai in combat the concern over error rate and the humanitarian impact on the ground 
 too many civilian have be kill and we want israel to take great care to limit its operation to military target and avoid harm civilian and destroy home that be the message we give when we engage with the israeli government 
 the situation in gaza be have its impact on the west bank tragically this week a year old israeli child be find dead and that set off a process of settler rampage across the west bank we now know that palestinians have be kill and other brutally attack and the evidence be that idf soldier stand to side and allow that to happen at a meeting with israeli colleague this morning we hear that the israeli government be now arrest legal and peace observer in the west bank will the government make it clear to the israeli government that observer should be allow to operate within the west bank and ensure that peace be maintain may we have a detailed report on the sanction that the government be apply to israeli settlement and settler 
 i do not know the detail of some of the early point the right hon gentleman raise but i will welcome receive that my understanding and memory be that we put sanction on individual we keep this issue under constant review because those action and what happen in the settlement be important give the implication that have for the west bank 
 the escalation of recent day be deeply worrying with nuclear armed country exchange ballistic and neither with any reputation for care of civilian life and both with agenda of their own that escalation have occupy the headline but the people of gaza continue to suffer unrelenting military attack and starvation the rule base order and international law have suffer last damage include by the targeting of aid worker and medic the uk ’s influence with an out of control netanyahu government have yield little but of the few legal tool available be the suspension of arm export licence when will the government use that 
 as i say in a previous answer our assessment on export licence remain unchanged we have of the most robust export system in the world enshrine in law through the export control   act and implement through our strategic export licensing criterion it be important that the hon lady recall and note not just the humanitarian situation in gaza but also what be happen through iran ’s destabilising activity 
 humanitarian agency have conclude that we have pass the point of be able to avert famine in gaza whatever we do now we will be too late for those people who will have starve to death by the time aid arrive and that be a stain on the international community will the minister update the house on what specific step the government have take to bring about the full implementation of resolution which be pass by the un security council over week ago plead with pressure and press the israeli government be clearly not a strategy that be work so why do the uk government not recognise that consequence and concrete action can start with the stopping of arm sale to israel 
 we be urge we be plead and we be do everything that we can to make our case we be also treble the amount of aid to £ as i have say we be also take action to have this lifesave aid corridor by sea to gaza those be important action that we be take forward 
 have see the drone attack on israel at the weekend it be disappointing to watch the government and the us administration basically tell the israelis to roll over and accept this aggression by iran it be however encouraging to see an alliance of air force assist the israelis to protect their people i wonder why there be little condemnation of this aggression against israel and little continued acknowledgement that have   october   never happen none of this would be happen what be the government do to ensure that both gazans and israelis be free from hamas and iranian aggression respectively and can live normal life as we say in the uk israel have the right to defend itself 
 i agree and the government agree that israel have the right to defend itself as part of our approach to enable a sustainable ceasefire to be put in place hamas have to be put clearly in their place they must not have the influence they have at the moment and their ability to fire rocket into israel need to be completely diminish to enable that sustainable ceasefire 
 the minister will know that his word be not cut through hamas be wrong to reject the ceasefire but what israel do next be not inevitable yet the israeli minister for defence on monday evening say that israel be wait for aid to be deliver to rafah and for civilian to leave and then it would begin the military operation he will know that there be nowhere for these people to go and there be no food elsewhere it be an impossible choice for people a few pitta bread will not cut it for million of people at risk of starvation and at risk of harm from a military operation in rafah what can the uk do if israel proceed with its threat to enter rafah 
 as the hon member know i respect she enormously and we have work together on a number of issue on her vitally important point we want to urge restraint about this propose military operation by the israelis we be also call for restraint in response to what have happen with iran although notably the raf and other be there to provide support to defend israel from that attack the foreign secretary be in israel and the region this week to tackle these very issue and to address the point i have make 
 on monday in response to my question about restore unrwa funding the prime minister say that along with ally he be review the interim finding in subsequent response to other member he say he be wait for a final report which be due towards the end of the month on   april can we have a government statement on monday in which the government set out a clear pathway back to restore funding the uk be the only major donor aside from the united states that have not restore its funding time be run out and life be be lose 
 i recognise the importance of the point that the hon lady make all i will say be what i have say previously we be wait for the report and then we will update parliament on our decision we need to review this report in detail 
 repetition of we be wait for the report will become the new definition of complacency the more i listen to those on both front benches describe the bloody putrid sea of misery that be gaza the more i be amazed that both side continue to support the supply of british arm and military component to the country that be do all this no could understand that the minister say how hard they be try personally i believe he he seem a sincere chap but why be it not work if the government be try so hard while scramble their jet to defend israel and give arm to israel why will israel not listen 
 i say with respect that the question i have be ask be entirely appropriate and understandable give the circumstance i have respond as good i can from the government ’s perspective the hon gentleman know from his extensive experience that the situation on the ground be hugely complex we be work night and day and our official in the fcdo be work flat out we be provide the support we can to israel and to help tackle the destabilisation i understand the passion with which he ask his question but he should also understand that these be incredibly complex situation we be endeavour to do everything we can to make our case with israel but it be also have to think about the implication of what be happen and act after a terrible tragic attack by hamas and the response by iran 
 i be concerned to hear the allegation make by several organisation that the truck go in be half full or less which make the amount of aid get into gaza by truck a difficult statistic to use what be the minister do to make sure that tonnage of aid be get to the right   place clearly the israeli authority seem to be not able to deliver on their duty under international law to get aid to the right place what more can he do to put pressure on the israeli authority to do what be legally bind and right to do 
 the hon lady make an important point that we need to think not just about truck but tonnage i will speak to the development minister about this particular issue and make sure that we have extra focus on it we need the truck but we need the tonnage as well it be vital 
 it be good to finally hear those on the labour front bench seemingly find their voice on this issue after ten of thousand of death and month of shameful prevarication although they be still willing to sell arm to israel on the uk government ’s policy on arm sale the criterion for halt arm sale do not require a legal confirmation that a breach of international humanitarian law have occur but only that it might have occur do the minister not consider that the ongoing investigation by the international criminal court of war crime and crime against humanity and the consideration by the international court of justice of potential genocide be indication that breach of international law might have occur in any event why be we so keen to sell arm to someone we have be press so hard to cease operation 
 we continue to have grave concern about the humanitarian situation on the ground but those be not sufficient to undermine our judgment that israel be commit to comply with international humanitarian law in general we have already talk at length about the export licence and our control around that we recognise israel have the right to defend itself 
 the belgian foreign minister state that israel be engage in tactic of starvation last month the foreign minister of the republic of ireland state 
 the use of starvation as a weapon of war be a blatant violation of international humanitarian law 
 this month belgium ’s minister of development and co operation state that israel ’s use of hunger as a weapon of war be 
 a flagrant violation of international law 
 the israeli defence minister be on record as say 
 i have order a complete siege on the gaza strip there will be no electricity no food no fuel everything be closed we be fight human animal and we be act accordingly 
 when will this government wake up to the reality that innocent palestinians be die and take action to stop they die from hunger and starvation 
 we be work hard to get the aid in as i have highlight that be critical we be also call out the israeli government recognise that too many civilian have be kill we want to see israel take great care to limit its operation to military target and to avoid harm civilian and destroy home as he have indicate
