apology but i feel that i should keep go 
 means test benefit can help where appropriate universal credit for example pay an extra £ a year to unpaid family carer i do not underestimate the challenge within the universal credit system and we want to ensure that carer who need it get that support as i be say to the right hon member for kingston and surbiton a moment ago we be look at different aspect of the system include by review universal credit to ensure that it do the job we all want it to do we will set out the detail in due course 
 pension credit can also be pay to carer at a high rate than what those without caring responsibility receive and over carer receive an extra amount of pension credit because of their entitlement to carer ’s allowance however we think that as many as pensioner who be eligible for pension credit be not receive it which be why the government have already take action to drive up pension credit take up last month we start a national campaign to encourage eligible pensioner to check their eligibility and apply we be ask local authority to support that and as the house will know the secretary of state and the deputy prime minister write to they in august 
 follow that we have see a increase in application for pension credit since   july with almost application in just week in november we will write to around pensioner in receipt of housing benefit who may be eligible but be not currently claim pension credit and i encourage all family carer to check that they be receive all the support to which they be entitle the gov.uk website have lot of information on carer ’s allowance and of people claim online although traditional paper form be available for those who want to claim it that way i know that organisation such as carers uk and citizens advice be also on hand and do a fantastic job of give advice 
 financial help for carer be really important but it be only pillar of a proper support system all of we need a balance in life and that be important for carer too most carer of working age want to consider work in some form and not just for financial wellbeing but to enhance their life and the life of the person for whom they care we want to help family carer combine their caring responsibility with pay work where they can we will review the implementation of the carer ’s leave act which give unemployed carer a right to time off work for the time and we will explore the benefit of pay leave while be mindful of the impact of any change on small employer through the employment rights bill we will ensure that flexible working which can play such an important role in help carer to balance their work and caring responsibility be available to all worker except where it be genuinely not feasible 
 the government will carefully consider the finding of lord darzi ’s independent review of the nhs which be very clear about the need for a fresh approach to   support family carer caring be a demanding role in which no can function at their good without ever have a break and the well care fund include money that can be use for unpaid carer support include short break and respite service for carer as i mention at the beginning of my contribution we will ensure that family carer voice be hear as we develop plan to create a national care service as part of our reform to adult social care 
 every day unpaid family carer step up when love one need their support without the contribution of family carer our country would not function the pressure on social care in this country be already unbearable without unpaid family carer it would become completely untenable 
 i be pleased to be able to respond to this vital debate which in both tone and importance have be of the good i have hear in my year in this place i also add my thank to   the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey   for bring forward the opposition day motion today because this issue be clearly of concern to many member and they be right to be concern 
 the right hon member be of many right hon and hon member to have make important contribution and speak with great passion on this crucial issue the hon member for salford rebecca long bailey and for carshalton and wallington bobby dean my hon friend   the member for hertford and stortford josh dean   the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins my hon friend the members for wirral west matthew patrick for harlow chris vince and for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter the hon member for stratford on avon manuela perteghella and for maidenhead mr reynolds and other rightly speak about the important role that million of family carer play in provide support for disabled or elderly relative who need care at home i echo those comment and add my own tribute to all family carer much of their tireless work go unseen and unrecognised 
 like other member i be privileged to witness glimpse of carer dedication through my correspondence and through event i attend in my constituency run through today ’s debate be an underlying and understandable anger at the position we inherit from the last government whereby family carer try to do the right thing have be leave with staggering overpayment often run into thousand of pound as my hon friend   the member for birkenhead alison mcgovern   set out early we be make sure that we understand precisely what have go wrong so that we can put the system right for the long term our family carer deserve no less 
 many member include the hon member for eastleigh liz jarvis and for north east fife wendy chamberlain my hon friend the members for shipley anna dixon and for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis and   the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone and of course my hon friend   the member for city of durham mary kelly foy   and the right hon member for kingston and surbiton speak about their own experience as carer or the work they do locally to support organisation help family carer i grow up watch my grandmother care for my grandad struggle with parkinson ’s disease before later see my mum of the many hidden carer up and down the land care for her mother my nana in her final year battle alzheimer ’s disease 
 none of we in this house be blind to the work that carer do they be fortunate to have some wonderful advocate those include their mp as we have see today but also organisation such as carers uk the carers trust and the learning and work institute to name but the minister for social security and disability my right hon friend   the member for east ham sir stephen timms and i have already meet a delegation of carer and carers uk and he will be do so again shortly he will also meet separately with the carers trust and the learning and work institute because we be determined to ensure that the voice of family carer and the organisation support they be at the heart of everything we do 
 i also want to pay tribute to the hundred of dwp staff largely base in the north west who provide financial support to a family carer through carer ’s allowance day in day out the government will spend record amount to support unpaid carer real term expenditure on carer ’s allowance be forecast to rise from £ in to just over £ a year by 
 i turn to some of the other point raise during the debate with apology that time will permit i to address only some of they let i take the opportunity to congratulate and pay tribute to my hon friend the members for clwyd north gill german and for weston super mare dan aldridge and   the hon member for torbay steve darling   on their excellent maiden speech they paint vivid picture of their constituency and i feel certain that they will go on to make significant contribution in this place 
 on the wide point i will begin with the question of the adequacy of carer ’s allowance set as it be at £ per week carer ’s allowance will be increase in april by the consumer price index to help ensure that it maintain its value as well as carer ’s allowance carer in low income household can claim income relate benefit such as universal credit and pension credit those can be pay to carer at a high rate than to those without care responsibility through the carer element and the additional amount for carer respectively for example over carer household on universal credit can already receive an additional £ a year through the carer element that say the house should be aware that issue beyond the scope of the independent review announce today be not be ignore this be merely a step towards progress the government be also look at the broad question of how to provide the good possible support for family carer although i do not want to pre empt that work today 
 let i turn to the question of a taper which be raise by a number of right hon and hon member at the moment introduce a taper in carer ’s allowance would significantly complicate the benefit with award have to be adjust manually on a weekly basis for some of those declare earning that would add to administrative cost and could mean more fraud and error those also receive universal credit would need to have that adjust if their payment of carer ’s allowance change because of an earning taper rate a taper could be introduce only follow significant change to the it system that support payment of carer ’s allowance for the moment therefore it be not possible 
 on the potential writing off of overpayment which be at the heart of many of the excellent contribution that we hear an overpayment can occur through fraud   or through claimant or official error the secretary of state have an obligation to protect public fund and ensure that wherever possible overpayment be recover but determine what good we can do to support those who have accrue overpayment be within the scope of the independent review as be how such overpayment occur and what we can do to ensure that we take all the step we can to reduce the risk of such incident happen again 
 let i turn briefly to the comment of the shadow secretary of state   the right hon member for central devon mel stride he list the many intervention that the last government supposedly make to improve the lot of carer seemingly include the private member ’s bill of the hon member for north east fife but after year of conservative government we see carer who find themselves in heartbreaking situation have rack up huge overpayment however the right hon gentleman correctly set out the incredibly complex nature of the carer ’s allowance system with allowance for legitimate expense pension contribution and so on and why resolve this matter be therefore not straightforward that be why the independent review be the correct mechanism and next step to fully understand what go wrong and why and how we can put thing right i welcome his support for the review 
 many colleague refer to the role that family carer play in ease pressure on the social care system and indeed in support our economy and they be entirely right to do so i acknowledge everything that carer do they be hero we appreciate how much society rely on unpaid carer we recognise the challenge they face and we understand the need for change support carer be both a moral and an economic imperative so we will help carer stay in pay work we be spend record amount on carer ’s allowance and we will sort out the overpayment scandal we inherit that be why we have announce the independent review today so that together we can rebuild the trust that have be lose and ensure that those who offer comfort dignity and support to the one they love be give all the help they need in return i hope right hon and hon member will acknowledge that work today by support the government amendment 
 question put standing order no 31(2 that the original word stand part of the question 
 i be honour to make my maiden address during this debate on carer ’s allowance we all know people who be work tirelessly to care for love one indeed make life well for those who sacrifice so much be of the main reason i make the decision to run for election to this place in weston super mare it have be a privilege to get to know some of our resident who care tirelessly for love one in the most challenging circumstance i pay tribute to carer in my constituency and specifically to pat o’connell jan quan and everybody at the parkinson ’s uk weston super mare branch for be so fearless in fighting for appropriate care service for their love one i be in awe of their love compassion and conviction to secure well care and respite service not just for themselves but for everyone it be a real tragedy that the care system be not able to provide they with suitable respite from the care they provide i continue to fight their corner and that of all carer across the constituency 
 weston super mare be an extraordinary place full of a vibrant mix of people since my family move to the village of kewstoke in weston and the surround area have become deeply intertwine with our life i may still have my stokie accent and a love of pottery and staffordshire oat cake but weston be now where my heart be it be a town where we find people with root from across our nation and from across the world my young sister emily and lauren have become expert code switcher between stokie and west country base on the situation but my young brother scott have embrace the local lingo and i can almost hear he now say alright my lover

 i have spend most of my work life in the nhs but speak for the time in the house i must start with a confession as some of the northerly member will recognise from my voice i be not bear in the west country it be now year since i be post to what be then raf chivenor on the beautiful north devon coast while serve in the royal air force at the time my flight sergeant at raf laarbruch in germany tell i that go to north devon would probably turn out to be an adventure i confess to the house that i do not think this place be quite what he or i have in mind 
 i want to thank my family friend and all my supporter over the year especially my year old grandson clayton who probably win i or vote as without they i would not be here my constituency be fortunate to be famous for its stunning landscape and area of outstanding natural beauty with beach moor farmland and forest that draw countless visitor every year farming and tourism sustain many of our rural community with historic market town such as south molton set in roll countryside give way to stunning seaside destination such as woolacombe instow and braunton 
 chivenor where i be so lucky to be post all those year ago be now home to the royal marines commando logistic regiment and my area have a proud military history now famous surfing beach such as woolacombe and saunton sand be once use as training ground to prepare ally force for the normandy landing behind the natural beauty the challenge that my area face be stark like many rural and coastal constituency it suffer from low wage which be nearly £ a week less than the national average and an acute housing shortage that price young people out of our community or prevent they from start a family in north devon as i do 
 even in the 2020s part of my constituency still face real deprivation in some part of ilfracombe for example the proportion of young people attain level qualification be barely above while life expectancy be year low than other part of devon out of uniform i join the nhs start out as a mental health nurse at north devon district hospital the most   remote acute hospital in mainland england visit patient across unique community such as combe martin and lynton and eventually lead the campaign to build a chemotherapy and day treatment unit my area suffer from shortfall in important medical service such as pharmacy nursing and in particular dentistry our hospital now have intensive care unit and operating theatre that be approach year old and be desperately in need of investment from the new hospital programme 
 however i have be astonish by the possibility on offer in my constituency numerous coastal seat across the south west mine include stand to benefit massively from investment in float offshore wind in the celtic sea clean energy an extended supply chain and high pay job could be a shot in the arm for the economy of the great south west i pay tribute to my predecessor selaine saxby who identify how that massive opportunity could if do right benefit the region for decade to come 
 north devon district hospital will soon be home to a £ clinical research centre that will lead groundbreake study into heart condition joint problem and osteoarthritis few people know that barnstaple where i live be also home to accord healthcare a pharmaceutical group that manufacture a staggering of all the medication use in the nhs and be a vital part of this country ’s critical supply chain it have just announce a new groundbreaking orally administer medication for prostate cancer that be hot off the press this week and may benefit as many as cancer sufferer and it be among the medication of its kind another remarkable firm systems engineering and assessment or sea have just win a £ contract to supply cutting edge defensive countermeasure system to the royal navy thank to its hard work and some innovative engineering on an industrial estate in my constituency young people will be keep safe as they serve their country in uniform

 it be an honour to have be elect to represent my constituency of newton abbot an area that i have call home for some year i tend to find that people in westminster either ask where be newton abbot or they say that they know it well through personal experience we be on the south coast of devon between exeter and torbay between the sea and the gateway to dartmoor with the rivers teign and exe the constituency name reflect our large market town but it could add dawlish teignmouth kingsteignton let alone the many village from starcross kenton bishopsteignton abbotskerswell ogwell denbury ipplepen broadhempston and many more 
 i have be wonder what to tell hon member about my constituency perhaps the creative and innovative people include newton abbot ’s own ollie watkins the member of muse or peter cross usually see at england rugby fixture with his resplendent cross of st george hat and coat or the history of brunel ’s engineering of the coastal railway today ’s mining of ball clay or previously the granite use to rebuild london bridge the british museum and other quarry from dartmoor and transport via the templer way a tramway itself create from granite all ship via the port of teignmouth or the story of dawlish violet jane austen ’s visit keats poem or how dawlish become the home of black swan perhaps the protect shore of the exe estuary and dawlish warren home to many thousand of wildfowl and wad bird each winter suffice it to say the area be steep in history fame and natural beauty member will find much more than devon cream tea and scone with cream and jam the right way up of course 
 grow up in a royal navy family we move around an awful lot move to dawlish be a natural choice but i suspect it be also my parent ’s influence that cause i to set my sight on this place in the 1950 they meet in downing street when my mother work in churchill ’s office my father tell we story of race to the parking place outside no in his old mg 
 speak of previous politician i pay tribute to my predecessor anne marie morris and her dedication to the constituency her maiden speech tell of the wave gently break over the train on the dawlish seawall the storm however show we that the force of the sea and the increase storm due to climate change be both serious and urgent since then network rail have construct a new seawall rebuild the station and more however it be the catastrophic cliff collapse near teignmouth that cause the long interruption of rail service cut london off from the south west peninsular we be still wait for fund to be confirm for that work climate change be a real and present threat to we on the coast and we can not stop it with just   flood defence and mitigation we must do everything we can to reduce the use of fossil fuel and carbon dioxide emission 
 turn to healthcare devon have both an age population and few hospital bed per head of population than the national average local hospital be fall into disrepair and be often overlook in the model of care it be during my week in this place that i hear from the local nhs trust that it be cancel the plan new teignmouth health and wellbeing centre that would have replace the crumble hospital due to increase cost and a recent cap place on its capital budget bizarrely because of revenue overspend the project be cancel the new centre be to have become the home to local gps and local nhs service i do write to my pen pal the secretary of state but have yet to hear back

 the most recent statistic which be available for the old shape of the hon gentleman ’s constituency suggest that of property there have g connection however i be not sure that the statistic reflect the live experience of most people in his constituency or i suspect any other constituency in the land that be not good enough which be why our ambition be for all populated area to have stand alone g by

 in constituency such as bridgwater and carlisle poor mobile coverage force people to rely on their fix line service do the minister share my concern that the switch off of the public switch telephone network will leave constituent unable to access service in the event of an emergency 
 i welcome my hon friend to her place she make a really good point as we take away the copper line and move over to the new technology which we need to do it be absolutely essential that we ensure there be a safe transition even if it be only for people who have telecare device on which they rely for their own safety i be sure we all have relative who have of those i have already meet all the operator and i be determined to crack the whip on this issue

 i call the shadow minister 
 the secretary of state in of his act in his new role cut £ worth of funding that would have be transformative for enable cutting edge research and development in britain i note that he have also ditch our ambition to turn britain into a science and technology superpower we set a target of £ for r&d which    we meet but he have set no such target will he be set a target and can he today promise that there will be no cut to r&d expenditure

 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i join the prime minister ’s word of tribute to alex salmond and the holocaust survivor lily ebert and thank he for his kind word about sir david amess whom we remember fondly we be think of all their family at this moment 
 this week china have carry out unwarranted aggressive and intimidatory military exercise in the taiwan strait our ally be rightly concern after worry report that the government may have intervene to stop a visit to the uk by the former taiwanese president will the prime minister confirm that the foreign secretary will use his meeting in beijing this week to condemn china ’s dangerous escalatory act in the strait 
 the continued military activity in the strait be not conducive to peace and stability stability in the taiwan strait be in all of our interest on the wide point that he raise we will co operate where   we can as permanent member of the un security council on issue such as net and health and trade compete where we have different interest and challenge the point he make be absolutely right where it be need to protect national security human right and our value we will put that challenge in 
 give what the prime minister say i agree of course that we must engage and should use that engagement for our national interest i hope that the foreign secretary will unequivocally condemn this military escalation and stand up for democracy in taiwan 
 the whole house will be concern about the fate of the democracy campaigner jimmy lai he be a british citizen who have be wrongly imprison in hong kong for year the previous government pressure china for his release do the prime minister agree that this be a politically motivate prosecution and that it be a breach of china ’s legal obligation to hong kong under the sino british declaration 
 yes and that case as the right hon gentleman will understand be a priority for the government we call on the hong kong authority to release immediately our british national the foreign secretary raise this case in his meeting with china ’s foreign minister and we will continue to do so 
 i thank the prime minister for that answer as he know china have become a decisive enabler of russia ’s war against ukraine now supply the vast majority of russia ’s import military micro electronic and component and worsen the suffering of the ukrainian people will the prime minister confirm that he be prepared to sanction any chinese business or individual involve in aid russia ’s invasion of ukraine include impose secondary sanction on financial institution 
 yes we have call for that in the past and we continue to do so i hope that this be an issue where we can have unity across the house 
 yes i assure the prime minister of our support it be something that the last government begin the united states recently expand their sanction and i hope the new government will continue to look at do the same 
 the last government also establish a new system of registration and monitoring to protect the uk from interference from foreign state include china russia and iran the foreign influence registration scheme be describe as essential by mi5 in the fight to help to keep britain safe but since the prime minister take office he have halt its implementation why 
 that be not correct 
 that be very clearly what the government have say only last week the prime minister say at the dispatch box that he would give the security force 
 the power that they need”.—[official report   october vol c. 
 if he be to fulfil that promise i urge he to get up to speed on this issue and implement the scheme 
 furthermore parliament ’s intelligence and security committee have warn that british university be increasingly a rich feeding ground for china to exert political influence over we that be why we pass the higher education freedom of speech act with new power to help to defend university from that threat but the new education secretary have since block it can the prime minister tell we how without that tool the government will prevent chinese influence over our university 
 i really do not think that party political point on security and intelligence—[interruption throughout the last parliament we stand with the government on all question of security and intelligence because it be important to the outside world that we do so i work with the security and intelligence service for year prosecute case i know at hand as a lawyer the work that they do i have know at hand as the prime minister the work that they do we support they in everything that we do and the right hon gentleman know that 
 the fir scheme and the higher education freedom of speech act be new tool new set of power that the previous government pass in order to give our university and security service the power that they need to tackle a grow threat the opposition will of course continue to support the government in protect our national security but we believe that those tool be need and we be concern by report that the new government have pause their implementation or indeed scrap they 
 finally the chinese government have sanction multiple member of our parliament for champion human right as a result they have face intimidation abuse and surveillance i commend you mr speaker for your defence of the right of every member of this house to speak out on crucial issue without fear of retaliation from foreign state i know that the prime minister will agree with that too so this week will the foreign secretary in his meeting not just raise the issue but tell the chinese government to lift those sanction on our colleague 
 yes we speak with voice the right hon gentleman speak about the record of the last government that record be year of failure year of austerity year of brexit logjam then johnson truss and the present leader of the opposition utter failure this government be elect to do thing differently make fair choice and most importantly give britain its future back we will fix the foundation with a long term plan to grow our economy protect work people and rebuild our country 
 year ago thurrock council be lead into effective bankruptcy by the then conservative administration in no small part due to an investment of hundred of million of pound in a solar farm scheme run by a conman give the prime minister ’s commitment to integrity in public life will he support my call and those of my constituent for a public inquiry so that those responsible can finally be hold to account 
 i thank my hon friend for her question because year of underfunding have leave council face huge budget pressures—[interruption opposition members yawn they do not know the impact that it have on work people up and down the country who rely on public service what have happen in thurrock be shocking we be commit to reset the relationship and help those under intervention to recover and reform year be a long time of destroy local service and it be clear that it will take time to fix they we will get council back on their foot by provide multi year funding settlement but ultimately we have to grow our economy i be surprised that the leader   of the opposition do not welcome the £ of investment that we be able to announce on monday 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i echo the prime minister ’s tribute to alex salmond sir david amess and lily ebert 
 i welcome the news that minister be go to review the carer ’s allowance repayment scandal after campaign by carer organisation the guardian and the liberal democrats culminate in our motion on the order paper today but do the prime minister agree that the evidence need for the review be already long establish and many of the decision self evident will he and his colleague vote for our motion today so that we can write off the overpayment end the crazy cliff edge to the earning limit now and have a full review of the support that carer deserve 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise that really important issue which be affect a number of people we have launch an independent review into the carer ’s allowance overpayment to look at the circumstance of the overpayment and see what go wrong and what can be do to put it right because carer must get the support that they deserve i be grateful to he for raise it and i be glad that we have be able to take this action today to go forward on that really important issue 
 i thank the prime minister for that answer and ask he that minister listen to the voice of carer throughout the review 
 let i turn to the middle east israeli finance minister smotrich have say that starve people in gaza might be justified and moral national security minister ben gvir call settler who kill a year old on the west bank hero after my visit to israel and palestine last february have witness the damage that those extremist ministers in the netanyahu government be do i call on the last uk government to sanction they they refuse but we now learn that the former foreign secretary be consider it will the prime minister now sanction ministers ben gvir and smotrich 
 we be look at that because those be obviously abhorrent comment as the right hon gentleman rightly say along with other really concern activity in the west bank and across the region the humanitarian situation in gaza be dire the death toll have surpass and access to basic   service be become much hard israel must take all possible step to avoid civilian casualty to allow aid into gaza in much great volume and to provide the un and humanitarian partner the ability to operate effectively along with france the uk will convene an urgent meeting of the un security council to address that

 the difference be that we now have a westminster government who want to work with the welsh government to deliver for the people of wales for long year the welsh government be in a position where the then uk government be in conflict with they now we will work together collaborate and ensure that we deliver across wales

 as evidence by some early question issue surround send local government finance and adult social care affect all of our constituent let we be honest for too long both party have duck and dodge take the difficult but necessary decision in order to give certainty to our constituent and confidence to those who provide those vital service do the prime minister share my assessment that there be considerable merit in formal cross party work on those issue so that we can share take those difficult decision in order to improve outcome for our constituent 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise the question of send because it be a really important issue i think this be the time in prime minister ’s question times that it have be raise by member on both side of the house i quibble with his suggestion that it be both party since his party be in power for year but the spirit in which he propose that this work should be cross party be something that we should take up because send be such an important issue it affect so many child and parent so notwithstanding that quibble i be very happy to work across the house on an issue as important as send 
 the fairways networking group be a group of small business in my constituency all of which operate on tight margin can my right hon and learn friend help i to reassure this group that not only do they have nothing to fear from the employment rights bill but they have plenty to gain as exemplar employer 
 yes the employment rights bill be pro worker and pro growth and proudly so i do not believe we can build a strong economy by have people in insecure work the conservative party go against every protection for worker it be against the minimum wage and it be against these new protection but the vast majority of business large and small already know that invest in their human capital and treat people properly at work be what produce growth here be the big political divide the conservatives always oppose worker right and we will always champion they 
 i associate the green party with the prime minister ’s tribute to alex salmond and sir david amess
