the shadow foreign secretary have set out in eloquent term what be effectively the policy of the government and the entire house he chide the government for not offer a statement today but i suggest that the government have not be slow in come to the house with frequent statement and response to urgent question and we will of course continue to do so 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the government ’s discussion with prime minister netanyahu the prime minister the foreign secretary and indeed the entire government have be very clear about our advice to prime minister netanyahu and i have set it out repeatedly in the house when i last answer question from the right hon gentleman here i make very clear our position on rafah as well he ask about the consequence and how we deal with those britain and our ally through the united nations and i remind he that britain be pivotal in secure security council resolution and be work together to try to improve what be a terrible situation and we will continue to do just that with i hope the support of the whole house 
 i draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 this have be a typically excellent debate across the house i think there be an understanding that after or decade of relative tranquillity we be live with the threat of proximate warfare the price of freedom be of course eternal vigilance and that be generally agree across this house as evidence by the contribution make such as that of my right hon friend   the member for new forest east sir julian lewis i think my right hon friend be argue slightly cheekily for defence spending of of gdp although that be probably in the event of total war which of course we all want to avoid his proposition be that we should never have take a peace dividend post the cold war but i think that be a little harsh on our predecessor however plainly the situation have change and we must change with it i hope very much that europe will follow our commitment mean £ more for our collective defence against the primary aggressor i would have be very disappointed have my right hon friend not rehearse the argument for a continuous at sea deterrent which of course be tonne of eternal vigilance 
 the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey and for garston and halewood maria eagle who speak for the opposition i think give we the commitment we be seek which be to match the government ’s cash spend however the right hon gentleman be a bit flaky if i may say so on the   or at least on when it would be achieve and how they would pay for it that become clear from the intervention by my hon friend   the member for north wiltshire james gray for which i be grateful 
 the right hon member for wentworth and dearne be indeed an honourable man and i like he very much but i be bind to point out that his assurance that labour be the party of defence run contrary to its management until very recently by a right hon member who have very different idea indeed the right hon gentleman be very keen to recommend   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn   to the british public in as the prime minister of this great country and to serve under his leadership for nearly year but heaven love a sinner bring to repentance i be also bind to point out that defence be not short of review and another review would mean obfuscation i suggest that be the very last thing our armed force need right now at well it would introduce a huge measure of uncertainty when we simply can not afford it 
 the chair of the select committee on defence my right hon friend   the member for horsham sir jeremy quin rightly reflect on what across the nato alliance would mean where britain lead our european ally must follow we be not in this on our own he give a magisterial romp around the geopolitical societal and economic contribution of the whole defence enterprise 
 the hon member for west dunbartonshire martin docherty hughes   get tie up with nomenclature there be other rank in the army and the raf and ordinary seaman in the navy and i think that be the essence of his confusion either way there be nothing ordinary about the man and woman of our armed force and either way he be rightly concerned about the junior rank i recall a previous conversation we have in this place during which he confuse a pay award this year for they which be with the for senior officer i assume he be happy with that he want more europe in defence which i think mean more european union he may have miss for example the lancaster house treaty the attendant a400 m programme and unmanned aerial vehicle and he may also have miss the joint expeditionary force we be indeed co operate wherever we can with our european friend and neighbour 
 my right hon friend   the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois   give a very detailed and authoritative account of kit major on air defence he catalogue some of the procurement issue that have historically bedevil the defence enterprise but he resist reference to his favourite defence contractor for which we be very grateful i know that he support the integrate procurement model announce in february 
 the right hon member for warley john spellar to whom i always listen with a great deal of interest rightly highlight industrial skill i have say it before but i will say it again the ministry of defence be this country ’s no employer of apprentice and we be exceptionally proud of that he rightly imply that the man and woman of our armed force both civilian and people in uniform have a choice of course they do and they very often exercise it our economy be the well for it i make no apology for inject trade and skill into our armed force and our defence enterprise it benefit we all the trick be retain those people and then perhaps pull they back in at some future date he will be familiar with that because he have read the haythornthwaite report 
 my hon friend   the member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin   rightly highlight the peril of coalition but to be fair we have get the liberal democrats to commit to casd and maybe even casd with missile for that   the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord   have do we a great service today the point that my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex make about leadership be extremely well make 
 the hon member for halton derek twigg   speak about the recruitment and retention issue that the armed force certainly have in common with just about all our ally meanwhile we deal with all our defence commitment we be rightly proud of the man and woman who serve 
 the right hon member for north durham mr jones   be fight a bit of a rearguard action on defence spending which the opposition front benchers now say they support if he want to disregard the cost for ukraine he need to have a word with his colleague give that i need to face down putin ’s naked aggression he might as well carve out other part of the defence budget and say that they do not count either i be sure he would not want to do that 
 my hon friend the member for north wiltshire speak about vote in parliament and about warfighting and i agree with his analysis we forget do we not?—what a grave mistake the iraq war be have be heavily involve with the effort and the process i entirely agree with his remark about lgbt people and i salute the role that the all party parliamentary group for the armed force play early on in that process 
 the hon member for tiverton and honiton speak about a variety of subject interestingly at the end of his remark he commit his party to i think a regular army of i be not quite sure where that figure come from but i assume we will hear about the attendant spending pledge in due course or maybe not 
 my hon friend   the member for filton and bradley stoke jack lopresti   talk about apprentice defence relate job and r&d. that be not surprising give that abbey wood in filton put his constituency at the beat heart of the defence enterprise he be a constant advocate for both 
 the hon member for strangford jim shannon   be a strong advocate for the defence enterprise in northern ireland and his part in particular he rightly highlight the further opportunity in northern ireland which i know about full well as a former northern ireland office minister and chair of the northern ireland affairs committee 
 my hon friend   the member for bracknell james sunderland   speak of enablement and logistic of interoperability modularity and plug and play from a position of real expertise as a former senior logistic officer my hon friend   the member for isle of wight bob seely   rightly highlight the change nature of warfare mass matter but so do tech as we can see with potential game changer such as dragonfire i be not sure i agree with he about a400 m but we can perhaps have a debate later over a cuppa or some such 
 in our more dangerous world the government believe that spend of gdp on defence must become the minimum nato benchmark as putin ramp up his   wartime economy as part of a network of authoritarian state that be attack our ally and interest nato must respond and i be proud that the uk be lead among european ally through our defence reform and our commitment verifiable against nato rule our £ cash boost for defence from a flat cash baseline and our additional package of support for ukraine 
 as putin lay waste to his military and recklessly expose his strength and weakness to general view we watch we learn and we act our defence reform be make our industrial base strong our investment in our conventional force stockpile and innovation make we more capable and more lethal our investment in our alliance be make we and our friend more secure our investment in our independent nuclear capability will always make adversary back off 
 i finish by pay tribute to the man and woman of our armed force they be the good of we and as we enter a new age of high tech warfare we need to remember that day in day out it be our people and those who support they who put the great in great britain on that at least i hope we can all agree

 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of increase in the cost of live on household in 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of increase in the cost of live on household in 
 the office for budget responsibility expect uk living standard to grow in all year of the forecast period 
 the building societies association describe the housing market as break with time homebuyer face the tough housing market condition in year with the international monetary fund project interest rate to be around for the remainder of the year and the government reject the scottish national party ’s call to reinstate mortgage interest relief do the chancellor anticipate any relief for time buyer in the near future 
 the hon gentleman will know that the bank of england be independent the good news be that the obr expect inflation rate to fall to near target in the very near future 
 the warm this winter campaign have find that household will have to pay an additional £ to help energy company to cover bad energy debt what assurance can the minister give that the extra charge will be pass on to indebted customer to alleviate their debt burden rather than it be allow to just alleviate debt for energy company 
 it be good news that energy price be set to fall the hon lady will know that the chancellor abolish the surcharge in of his budgets 
 the uk be set to have the high level of inflation in the g7 and the low rate of growth in the entire oecd in bizarrely the chancellor claim ludicrously that the tories be win the war on inflation with gdp per caput continue to fall as part of the long unbroken decline since record begin who do the minister think in the real world really believe that this plan be work and that the cost of living crisis be ease 
 it be important to note that inflation have more than halve since the prime minister take office and be now at that will have a material impact on the cost of living pressure on household in addition support this year include cut national insurance rate across the uk and raise the local housing allowance benefit be up by the national living wage be up by and pension be up by we be on the side of the british people 
 as you know mr speaker it be not solely household who face increase cost pressure business across our community do as well particularly small music venue which be shut at the rate of a week ahead of the culture media and sport committee ’s inquiry into that issue what think have the minister give to a vat cut for grassroots music venue across our constituency 
 i know my hon friend care deeply about this matter i know she have a report come out in a few week and i look forward to read it 
 it be crucial to bring down inflation and ensure that we create the right climate for reduction in interest rate and further tax cut do the minister agree that be the good way to tackle the cost of living pressure 
 as ever my right hon friend be absolutely right 
 in the past financial year buckinghamshire council support people struggle with the cost of live through the £ of funding from the household support fund the council ’s helping hand scheme continue with £ of funding through to this september do my right hon friend agree that buckinghamshire household who be struggle with the cost of living should get in touch with buckinghamshire council to get the help and support that they need from the helping hand scheme which be fund by this government 
 my hon friend be completely correct the household support fund have do so much to help people struggle with the cost of living i commend the way that buckinghamshire council have hand out the money and indeed will continue to do so throughout the year 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 westminster ’s cost of live crisis disproportionately affect those on low income young people and people live in rural area with limited travel option example be the soar cost of car insurance which be inexplicably high in scotland than in most other part of the uk a year old with year driving experience might expect their premium to go down yet they pay on average £ more than they do when they pass their test at the age of why be the uk government do absolutely nothing to hold insurance company to account 
 i can not comment on the specific of car insurance company but what i can say be that for people struggle with the cost of living whatever form that struggle take working age benefit be go up by this year 
 clearly the minister have pay no attention to this matter at all this issue be exceptional to the uk while price for car insurance have more than double in the uk they have go up by only across the eu over the same period and car insurance have go down by in an independent ireland what be the reason be it brexit or shameless profiteer or as we suspect have westminster just give up on people in the cost of living crisis 
 i think that we have hear enough from the brexit zombie on the other side of the chamber 
 answer the question 
 i be if the hon gentleman would just like to listen the national living wage be up by this year which help with exactly the type of cost that he be talk about 
 what assessment he have make of the contribution of the co operative sector to the economy 
 the government acknowledge the vital contribution that co operative make to the economy the co operative and mutual economy report find that co operative generate a combine annual turnover of £ a increase from level 
 as the minister outline co operative be worth £ to the uk economy moreover they be on average more productive than other business twice as likely to survive the year of trading and have high rate of investment than other private business what more can the government do to encourage more co operative to thrive do he believe as i do that the creation of co operative development agency in every region have to be part of that 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point i note his long hold interest in the co operative sector and the work that he do on it so what be the government do they be do thing specifically they recently take the further step of back the co operative mutuals and friendly societies act they also commission the law commission to review   the co operative and community benefit societies act to make sure that co operative can do as much as possible to benefit the wide economy 
 over the past year rotherham council have spend £ promote co operative and employee ownership do the minister agree that this huge amount of money would be well spend on fix pothole and open youth club rather than on an ideological viewpoint with no measurable outcome for the people of rotherham 
 i do not wish to comment specifically on rotherham but the good way of promote co operative in general be to allow they to thrive as well they can and to support their member in do what they do good which be to help their local economy not necessarily through huge amount of public subsidy but through do what the co operative movement be found to do which be as i have say to support local economy and local people 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of his tax policy on living standard 
 what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of his tax policy on living standard 
 thank to a combination of national insurance cut and above inflation increase to threshold since the average worker on £ will pay more than £ less in personal taxis this year in addition maintain fuel duty rate at their current level represent a furth £ benefit to household over the year since the introduction of the freeze 
 the minister will know that people be still really struggle with the cost of living crisis way that the government could help be by seek a bespoke veterinary agreement with the eu that would not only cut cost for business but stop food price rise even more a future labour government would do that so why will the government not commit to it 
 the hon lady ’s comment be correct everyone in this house recognise the extreme cost of living challenge over the past few year and that be precisely why the government have adopt the strategy of a laser focus on inflation combine with tax cut and recently national insurance cut we have a very constructive and positive relationship with the eu and be always engage with it on a variety of matter 
 in the run up to last week ’s election the prime minister never stop talk about national insurance cut and the minister talk about they again today but the government have be give with hand and take away with the other do the minister recognise that accord to the resolution foundation the combined impact of all the government ’s tax change leave worker who earn less than £ a year bad off will he apologise to worker in south yorkshire whose average earning be close to that level for misrepresent the position 
 of course we recognise the challenge for those on the low income which be precisely why we have adopt a whole bunch of other measure include on housing allowance if the hon gentleman be so opposed to the national insurance cut that we introduce why do the leader of the opposition support they 
 congratulation mr chishti on your engagement at the weekend you be not cross the floor i understand 
 most definitely not 
 it have just be say that there be a real cost of live challenge and that be absolutely correct a key part of that relate to the war in ukraine which pose real challenge for energy supply to the united kingdom as a former minister who apply sanction to russia and look at the oil price cap i know that we need to ensure that what happen in ukraine be offset by action that hold russia to account and address the cost of living the us have seize russian asset to pay for the reconstruction of ukraine the uk should do the same that would help ease the burden on the uk economy and the taxpayer 
 it be always a pleasure to see my hon friend in his place he raise a variety of really important issue that show precisely why we work across government there be multiple departments involve on matter relate to sanction the invasion of ukraine have have an incredible impact around the world not just in the uk everybody in this house should welcome the fact that because of action take by this government and the bank of england and other measure inflation be now fall and will soon hit target 
 i call the opposition spokesman 
 the conservatives decision in this parliament mean that the average family will face a tax bill that be £ a year higher and pensioner taxpayer will pay £ a year more the director of the institute for fiscal studies say 
 this remain a parliament of record tax rise 
 high taxis squeeze living standard and weak public service that be the conservative legacy do the minister understand why the country have lose confidence in they 
 many people in this country remember the abysmal economic performance of the last labour government the tax free allowance be £ it be now £ more than people have be take out of pay income tax altogether the government have a focus now that the economy be turn we want to put more money into people ’s pocket that be exactly what we be do with the national insurance cut and other measure and i be surprised that the hon gentleman do not welcome that 
 if he will use outcome evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the public sector productivity programme 
 improve public sector productivity be a major focus for this government which be why i announce £ of funding to make our public service more efficient in the budget 
 as a former health secretary my right hon friend will know that evidence base medicine transform health productivity systematically cut out ineffectual treatment and replace they with one that work well use the evaluation task force and the what works centre to do the same for other public service include back to work programme prisoner rehabilitation and early intervention for support family could be the productivity improve silver bullet that he need so can i urge he to beat a path to their door 
 my hon friend be right to talk about the what works programme which have deliver more than trial and be recognise internationally there be some very good example in the nhs of what be work include the nhs app that be now use by of nhs patient include over-90 so let no assume that old people be not internet savvy 
 some £ be waste on defective personal protective equipment during the covid crisis much of it pay to people associate with the conservative party people do not have to be conservative party member to benefit from the fast track but it do not half help what be the chancellor do to get public money back from those people who sell that defective equipment to the nhs and do it not just show that we can not trust the tories with public money 
 what it show be that we take very difficult decision in the pandemic to speed up access to ppe for frontline worker who be literally die at the time but there should be no hiding place whatsoever for anyone who commit fraud on taxpayer which be why there have be over arrest 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the only productivity improvement we have see from this government be the awarding of wasteful contract on top of all the ppe waste that my hon friend   the member for eltham clive efford   refer to there be still £ worth of unresolved ppe contract that this government award but that have not be deliver on only company ppe medpro be face legal action why be the government not take legal action against the other company that have not deliver on their contract with member of the public 
 let i be clear there be absolutely no hiding place for anyone whether they be connect to the conservative party the labour party or any other party if they have defraud the taxpayer we will go after they 
 the chancellor say that he be make progress and that there be no hiding place but that money belong to our public service the government know that the contract have not be deliver on but   they will not reveal the name of the company and the contract that have not be deliver on if there be no hiding place why would the chancellor not name they today 
 because we be take legal action and as the hon gentleman know full well when we take legal action that information belong to the police 
 what step his department be take to reduce taxis 
 the spring budget deliver personal tax cut include cut to national insurance for worker that mean that someone on the average salary have the low effective personal tax rate since and that be the low effective tax rate of any g7 country 
 while responsible tax cut such as the £ cut to national insurance contribution be welcome can my right hon friend update the house on when we can expect vat to be abolish on high factor sunscreen that would not only help to protect more people from of the lead cause of preventable cancer but could save the nhs approximately £ 
 my hon friend and i have talk about this issue on many occasion she will know that high factor sunscreen be on nhs prescription for certain condition and be vat free when dispense by a chemist with my chancellor hat on i should say that we have have £ of request for vat relief since brexit it be great to have the freedom to make those change but we have to be honest about the trade off in particular we must ensure that if we do apply relief the benefit be feed through to consumer 
 this weekend i speak to a constituent who have invest heavily in a restaurant in my constituency over the last year he be in desperation because his business like other business that have already close in the town be be crush by vat business rate and increase in corporate taxis he find that he can no long sustain a business that have become the love of his life do the chancellor realise that the tax burden he be impose on small and medium sized business be crush this economy 
 we be do everything we can to support small business business like the that the right hon gentleman mention have receive for year in a row a discount on their business rate that be a massive leg up for business recover from the pandemic we have also make sure that any increase in corporation tax apply only to large business there be only major party in british politic that want to bring down the tax burden for business and it be the conservative party 
 whether his department have make a recent assessment of the adequacy of its guidance entitle the green book 
 in the treasury undertake a comprehensive review of the green book and how it be use in practice and we have make several change as a result we regularly update the green book to ensure that it remain fit for purpose and we publish a further technical update in 
 i represent a rural constituency in dorset in the south west of england my right hon friend will know that it be important to i and my colleague in the region that the government give due consideration to the south west when it come to allocate fund and investment opportunity to it typically the green book have not adequately allocate fund in favour of dorset and neighbouring county what step will she take to correct that 
 my hon friend be as ever a brilliant advocate for his local area i note that west dorset be get £ from the uk share prosperity fund and the wide dorset area be benefit from a range of other significant investment include £ from the future high street fund but i be happy to meet he to discuss the matter far 
 like   the hon member for west dorset chris loder i represent a rural constituency strangford be the reason i be here and i want to represent it well what step will the minister take to ensure that all update to and volume of the green book apply to northern ireland as well as to other area across this great nation 
 the hon gentleman raise an excellent point that i will be discuss with the northern ireland finance minister in a couple of week 
 what fiscal step his department be take to support small business 
 small business drive our economy and we support they to thrive use lever across government whether through our small business rate relief by increase the vat registration threshold or provide relief such as the annual investment allowance 
 in england many small business receive a reduction in business rate thank to action by this conservative government in wales the labour administration have cut that level of support to mean that excellent hospitality business such as martha ’s vineyard in my constituency must find thousand of pound more in tax do the minister agree that that be not the way to support the tourism and hospitality sector at a challenging time and that it be an example of the labour party say thing here at westminster and do another where they be in government 
 my right hon friend be right that in the autumn statement the government extend retail hospitality and leisure relief in england essentially to cut tax for business a tax cut worth £    the barnett formula allow the welsh labour government to offer similar relief to welsh business and it be disappointing if not surprising that they have choose not to 
 on friday i visit the k c jones motor repairs garage a medium sized business of very long stand in oswestry in north shropshire of the many challenge that it face alongside astronomical energy bill and a shortage of skilled labour be the business rate that it need to pay because it must have a high street presence in order for people to take their car there will the minister consider fundamental reform of business rate so that business that need a high street presence can continue to exist at the moment they be under huge pressure 
 as i be say we have a relief for most high street business i encourage the hon lady to look at the package as a whole we have increase the vat threshold bring business like the she describe out of pay any vat at all on top of a range of other measure 
 the cherished independent shop and restaurant that line the street of morley serve the lifeblood of our community in order to safeguard the very heart of our local economy what bold measure be the department take to counter the oppressive weight of skyrocket business rate impose by the financially reckless labour lead leeds city council 
 i know that my hon friend be a great champion of all business in morley and across leeds because i have see it at hand i point out to she as well that the government have reduce taxation on small business we have increase the vat threshold and we have a rate relief for retail hospitality and leisure business which she allude to it be this conservative government who be on the side of hard work people and business across morley and around the country 
 in the last decade more than music venue close every week include moles in bath that have result in the loss of job event over performance opportunity £ of income for musician and £ in lose direct economic activity what be the government do to support small music venue 
 we be do a lot we be increase the vat threshold and we have a rate relief package the recent spring budget be of the big package support our cultural industry that this country have ever see and i encourage the hon lady to look at it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 since almost community have lose their local bank branch which have have a devastating impact on local and small business despite witness the decline of the british high street the government have be drag their foot on roll out banking hub which would help local and small business will the minister finally back the labour party ’s plan to provide a banking hub in every community that need 
 banking hub be drive by commercial organisation any area that lose bank branch be entitle to get a banking hub of course we want to see more across the country but we also have to recognise that banking have change and the way in which people bank have move more towards digital so it be right that commercial organisation take commercial decision 
 what recent fiscal step he have take to help reduce regional economic inequality 
 at the spring budget we build on the £ of levelling up commitment make since we announce a trailblazer devolution deal for the north east mayoral combine authority and a £ extension to the long term plan for town 
 the cross party public accounts committee have reveal that the government ’s levelling up fund be subject to a worrying lack of transparency with rule for access funding change while bid be still be assess will the minister therefore apologise to the local authority reject for funding that be not tell in advance that their application have no chance of success 
 this be the government who implement £ of support for community outside of london and the south east which be of the reason why median pay growth be high in every region outside of london and the south east of course there be a robust methodology and criterion for select place for funding and i encourage the hon lady to look at those criterion 
 with the darlington economic campus now have pass employee and be well on its way to provide over role in my constituency what assessment have my hon friend make of its contribution to the local economy to reduce inequality and to our levelling up agenda 
 the darlington economic campus be an important part of this government ’s operation and of our government estate but it be also important to the people of darlington and not just in term of the job it have create of course it build on the back of significant funding on my hon friend ’s watch the £ town deal and the £ as part of the share prosperity fund that be of the reason why the people vote to elect ben houchen just the other day 
 regional inequality may be make bad by my constituent face have to pay again for funeral plan after they be sell fake funeral plan by legacy funeral director many simply can not afford to pay for those plan again and instead of have the funeral that their family want for they they will only be able to have the free service offer by the council do the minister agree that bank should offer more discretion when look at victim of fraud and will he meet with i to discuss this specific case far 
 i be very sorry to hear of the circumstance that the hon lady have describe my hon friend the economic secretary in whose portfolio this issue sit will meet with she 
 for many year coastal community have suffer economic inequality and we all know that the good way of change that be to create the condition for investment and the job that go with they despite the good work that the government have do we still need more funding in area such as cleethorpes could the minister outline what plan the government may have for bring forward further scheme in the near future 
 it be right to acknowledge that funding have go in i completely appreciate the specific challenge that coastal community face but it be important to look at the package of measure to level up not just fund such as the share prosperity fund levelling up fund and town fund but the devolution deal investment zone and freeport these be all package and measure that will help area such as my hon friend ’s but i will always keep his area in mind 
 what fiscal step he be take to support household with the cost of living 
 what fiscal step he be take to support household with increase in the cost of living 
 over the last year cost of living support have total £ or an average of £ per household as a result living standard which be predict to fall last year rise by nearly and we be on track to reach pre pandemic living standard year early 
 i welcome the support that the government have provide throughout covid and the recent energy crisis for my constituent in meon valley i thank the government it have make a huge difference to people ’s domestic budget but now inflation be fall and the economy be improve can we look forward to the government ’s continue support with a range of fiscal step include cut taxis 
 we can absolutely do that i thank my hon friend for point out that the big single thing we can do to help people with cost of living pressure be to bring down inflation that seem to be something that escape the shadow chancellor this morning when she say it be not a big deal to get inflation down to its target it be a very big deal for family face a cost of living crisis and she need to know that inflation fall by design not by accident 
 the chancellor can talk all he want about inflation fall but this be little comfort to my constituent who be still struggle to make end meet even with the national insurance cut annual post tax earning for the average family remain on course to be £ low at the start of than they   be in a gap not predict to close until this mean yet more year of lose wage growth so when will the government get serious about tackle the low wage insecure work that they have allow to become the norm in this country 
 could i suggest if the hon member really think that inflation fall from to be little comfort to her constituent that she might want to talk to a few more of they because actually it be the big single thing that we can do to deal with cost of living pressure if she say what be we do to tackle the scourge of low pay we have abolish it by raise the national living wage to £ this year alone for someone work full time that will mean an increase in their pay of £ 
 whether he have take recent step with cabinet colleague to ensure that people with disability can access their child trust fund when they turn 
 on   june the ministry of justice launch a programme to raise awareness of the mental capacity act in relation to how and when to access child trust fund the part of this programme be a new toolkit the ministry of justice will continue that programme of work to raise awareness of how to obtain legal authority to access a child trust fund for which a court fee waiver be available 
 the only way for parent of young people without capacity to access their child trust fund be through a deputyship order after consult on the introduction of a mental capacity small payment scheme which would allow a suitable person temporary access to release the fund ministers opt not to legislate and instead introduce a toolkit as have be say over young people in england and wales remain locked out of their child trust fund so would the minister agree to look at this again 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and i know how avidly she campaign in this area the house should know and you should know mr speaker that i recently meet my right hon friend   the member for horsham sir jeremy quin   and   the hon member for sheffield central paul blomfield   to discuss this very issue i be very happy to meet the hon lady as well to discuss it and to see if we can get a solution because we do want to get this problem fix 
 i be grateful to the minister for the meeting to which he refer will he compliment financial institution that be do their utmost to make it easy for their disabled customer to access their child trust fund and if his ministerial colleague can find a way of make that easy across the board would that have his support and that of his colleague in the treasury 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question indeed work with not just the ministry of justice but the department for work and pensions be key to deliver this as be work with the financial conduct authority to ensure that any financial institution   that do the right thing do not lose out or face any regulatory issue that be indeed something that have my support and that of the treasury and we will work across government to get this right 
 whether he plan to reintroduce vat free shopping for international visitor 
 as state in the spring budget the government be consider the finding of the review by the office for budget responsibility of vat free shopping alongside industry representation and broad datum we continue to welcome further submission and representation in response to those finding 
 datum from heathrow the united kingdom ’s large and busy airport show that despite a near full recovery in passenger volume post lockdown retail spend on affected good be below pre pandemic level that figure be shocking heathrow airport join hundred of business in call on the government to reintroduce vat free shopping for tourist or similar incentive will the minister acknowledge the figure listen to the industry and reinstate that popular policy as british business be demand 
 my hon friend will be pleased to know that i will not only listen to the industry but i meet heathrow just last week to hear its representation the challenge be the way that modelling and forecast and behavioural change can be confidently assess government estimate suggest that a worldwide scheme could cost as much as £ the challenge be the so call deadweight cost that could happen by subsidise spending that otherwise would exist anyway versus the incremental benefit that we could get from new visitor come to the uk of course that be a behavioural change base on a tax change it be base on a variety of assumption and therefore the modelling and assumption underlie it vary but i be listen to all representation 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of raise the high income child benefit charge threshold on household income 
 the high income child benefit charge threshold be raise to £ on   april the point at which child benefit be fully withdraw be also increase to £ and the government estimate that that will take family out of pay the charge in the government also plan to administer hicbc on a household rather than an individual basis by april 
 i have be contact by many south derbyshire parent who be catch in this unfair situation can the minister be even more precise about the saving that this will now mean for my affected constituent 
 i thank my hon friend for her comment and continual interest in this area the change to the high income child benefit charge mean that almost half a hard work family will gain an average of £ towards the cost of raise their child in she will recognise that that be a meaningful difference for her constituent and for those across the country 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 the shadow chancellor often like to ask what have improve over the past year so i think i would update the house on some of the late statistic about the british economy accord to un conference datum we have now overtake france the netherlands and japan to become the world ’s large exporter the international monetary fund say that we will grow fast over the next year than france italy germany or japan and there be more people in work compare with a year ago which mean that for every single day conservative government have be in office since there be more people in work many of whom will be very pleased that we be stick to our plan 
 we should add to the chancellor ’s statistic that we have the wide economic inequality in europe last week professor sir michael marmot publish new analysis show significant increase in health inequality how long we live and how long we live in good health and that be particularly the case between the north and south east england that be of course drive by the economic inequality that i have just refer to what assessment have the chancellor undertake on the loss in productivity directly as a result of that increase in health inequality 
 if the hon lady be concerned about economic inequality she will be horrify to know that they be even bad under the last labour government they have be reduce under this government when it come to health inequality it be this government who be phase out smoke for everyone under the age of of the big single thing in a generation that will reduce health inequality and mean that poor people live long 
 the government ’s plan for a carbon border adjustment mechanism will create a level playing field for british manufacturer face un green high carbon competition from abroad but to comply with free trade rule the cbam must be an environmental measure rather than revenue raise trade protectionism will ministers confirm that it will be fiscally neutral and that any net receipt will be return to taxpayer perhaps even by cut fuel duty or green levy on energy bill 
 i can confirm that we be very alive to cost of living pressure cause by fuel duty in fact we spend £ freeze the duty on fuel which will save the average motorist £ over the come year 
 i call the shadow chancellor 
 at the budget the chancellor set out his intention to abolish national insurance a £ annual commitment with no clear plan as to how it would be pay for way to do it would be to merge income tax and national insurance do the chancellor agree with analysis from the house of commons library that show that merge those would increase income tax by 8p in the pound 
 which be why it be not our policy 
 that be strange because the day after the budget the chancellor tell sky news that 
 you can end that unfairness of tax work you can merge income tax and national insurance 
 the late chancellor nigel lawson the prime minister ’s hero warn that merge they would 
 destroy the contributory principle and create many loser especially among the elderly 
 in fact a retired pensioner with an average occupational pension income of £ a week would pay an additional £ a year in tax be the reason that the conservatives will not come clean not that they be plan to pick pensioner pocket to fund the abolition of national insurance 
 if the right hon lady listen to my comment carefully and i do not always give her credit for that she would know that our policy be to abolish employee national insurance and that mean we want to bring it down to if labour ’s strategy be to win the election by frightening pensioner with fake news story i would just say that britain deserve well 
 the taskforce on nature relate financial disclosure come out with its framework last year i would like an update on where we be with the international sustainability standards board approach because just as it have be a huge success for company and for uk plc to switch to the recommendation of the taskforce on climate relate financial disclosure it be vital for our planet that we also start to have the tnfd framework as standard right across the board 
 my right hon friend be right that this issue be critical i be pleased that the issb recently announce its intention to commence a research project on a nature thematic standard carefully consider the tnfd ’s recommendation his majesty ’s government have establish a formal mechanism to assess the issb standard for suitability for the uk to ensure that with a general sustainability standard and more specifically with a climate sustainability standard we be do the right thing for the uk the government will publish an implementation update on sustainability disclosure requirement shortly to provide further information for industry watch this space 
 we have all see it the rich prime minister in history have spend the weekend tell the public that his plan be work well it be not work for people in leeds east whose taxis be go through the roof while our public service be on their knee would a well plan   not be to go after the tax dodger rather than make ordinary people pay the price for this government ’s abject failure 
 i have to say that i find this hypocrisy astounding if the opposition object to the national insurance cut why do the leader of the opposition say that he support they if the opposition be so keen on abolish tax dodging why do they not support our finance bill which have measure in place to do just that they do not support it they abstain on it 
 the bank of england have say that quantitative tightening be not an official part of its monetary policy targeting yet it be at risk of cost fiscally £ in loss underwrite by the treasury that be have a major effect on the fiscal situation of the country will his majesty ’s government encourage the bank of england to hold these bond to maturity take the carry cost rather than take the hit from sell they in the market and crystallise an enormous loss 
 in relation to the asset purchase facility and how that have work over recent year it be not his majesty ’s government’s or indeed the treasury’s intention to change the way in which that work with the bank of england but as with all measure the chancellor keep everything under close review 
 accord to the bank of england a typical family remortgage this year will pay £ a year more in mortgage payment do the chancellor accept that even if the bank cut rate those homeowner will still be pay a penalty because the government crash the economy 
 what i would say to those family be that the most damaging thing of all be to have inflation at now we have reduce it to and indeed we expect it to go low interest rate be also start to fall if the hon member be worried about family in her constituency she might be extremely worried by the shadow chancellor say that if interest rate fall it be somehow not a big deal it really be 
 may i encourage my right hon friend the chancellor to revisit his decision to change the tax arrangement of furnished holiday let in rural constituency such as my own those business make an important contribution to the local economy provide job and enhance the tourism offering indeed they stop depopulation rather than add to it his decision be create much concern among those who operate such business 
 we recognise the important role that fhl play in the tourism ecosystem right across the country the problem be that there be not a level playing field with long term let we be make sure that there will continue to be tax incentive and benefit from such letting but they need to be on par with short term and long term let 
 the consistently high price of fuel be make driver dig deep just to go about their daily business with a rise of 10p report since the start of the year and the average cost of fill a family car now £ what effort will the government make to help those people in my rural constituency and across the united kingdom who have little or no access to public transport and be dependent on their vehicle for work and family life 
 the hon member be entirely right that be why we freeze fuel duty at the last fiscal event a measure that cost £ and will save the average driver £ 
 may i place on record my thank to the chancellor who in his budget devote fund to bournemouth for a police violence reduction unit do he agree that these unit have a track record up and down the country of tackle knife crime by not just see extra police on the frontline but engage with school to ensure that youth and student understand the folly of carry a knife in the place 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right violence reduction unit reduce crime and save life i want to thank he because he be of the colleague who ahead of the budget bring to my attention how impressive the result be as a result i be able to make it a national policy in the budget 
 many of those campaign for justice in the contaminated blood scandal will have be encourage by the reporting in   over the weekend give that time be of the essence will the chancellor please indicate by which date the promise will be fulfil 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to say that the government be take this issue very seriously and we completely understand that speed be of the essence it be now only a matter of day before the report will be publish we have always say that we want to publish our response very quickly after that and i assure the hon gentleman that we will not hang around 
 the good way for a business to thrive and for customer to receive a great service be for company to employ individual on merit do the chancellor agree that the recent overreach by the financial conduct authority and the prudential regulation authority regard their equality diversity and inclusion policy be a step too far and that it be inevitable that those policy will have a negative effect on we all 
 my hon friend make an important point it be important that the fca bear in mind that it should not be distract from its core focus on conduct and regulation by thing that be more marginal for the people and business it oversee i urge the fca to take into account the representation make by my hon friend and by industry in that regard and many other 
 the chancellor recently claim that £ a year be not a huge salary do he realise how out of touch that sound to family in my constituency who be work hard earn much less than that and really struggle because they be pay more for their weekly shop than they be year ago and whose mortgage soar after the tories crash the economy 
 the hon gentleman know perfectly well that he have take my comment out of context i will tell he what be really out of touch the shadow chancellor say it be not a big deal if inflation fall 
 cramlington have a world lead pharmaceutical company organon which employ people and produce medicine for the uk market as well as abroad with a particular focus on woman ’s health will my right hon friend the chancellor please meet i to discuss the impact on pharmaceutical investment 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the pharmaceutical industry be worth some £ to our economy i be pleased to tell he that the industry have see a twelvefold increase in equity financing in just the past decade and i would be pleased to meet he to discuss that far 
 soar rent cost be the big reason why my constituent in bath be struggle the average monthly rent in bath and north east somerset have rise by more than £ in the past year what support will the government give to people who rent in the private sector 
 that be why we need to build more house the hon lady will be reassure to know that we be build record number of house in fact more in the last year than in any single year under the previous labour government 
 i would like the chancellor of the exchequer to know that high business rate be have a devastating effect on small and medium sized business in historic market town such as romford that be large retail centre as the government be business friendly will he please look at way to reduce the burden of business rate on local business in constituency like mine 
 may i say what a pleasure it be to be ask a question by my hon friend i think this be the time it have happen since he have be back there be no more formidable a champion for romford he speak about business rate and we have indeed be do what we can to bring they down at every fiscal event 
 what step have be take to support pensioner to know what benefit they be possibly entitle to i understand that people access pension credit but a great many more be entitle to it 
 the hon gentleman will know that this be an issue that be close to my heart as a former pensions minister we do a huge amount of work to increase the uptake of pension credit i know that this matter a lot to member and work be be do in everyone ’s constituency include the hon gentleman ’s 
 the lifetime isa be a positive instrument but i understand that under its term there be circumstance under which saver lose not only the benefit of the isa but also part of their capital investment that do not seem right will the minister please meet i to discuss it 
 i be happy to meet my right hon friend to discuss the lifetime isa which be a fantastic product bring in by this government to help young people to get on the housing ladder i be happy to meet he to discuss way in which we can make it more accessible for more people in more circumstance 
 on a point of order mr speaker 
 be it relate to treasury question 
 yes in his response to i the exchequer secretary say any area that lose bank branch be entitle to get a banking hub but i have numerous    example of town that lose bank branch apply for a banking hub and then have their application reject please could you advise i mr speaker on how i can get some clarity on this matter and what the minister say about any area that lose bank branch 
 obviously we can not continue the debate the hon lady have certainly put her point on the record i do not think this will be the end of it she know how to carry it on through the usual channel which i expect she will use no doubt start with the table office 
 on a point of order mr speaker the chancellor in answer to my question say that economic inequality actually increase under the previous labour administration a house of commons library publication release last month show that that be categorically not the case would he like to take this opportunity to correct the record 
 i believe the chancellor would 
 far to that point of order mr speaker the hon lady may have misunderstood i what i say be that economic inequality have fall since the last labour government 
 urgent question to ask the deputy foreign secretary to make a statement on the war in gaza 
 i thank the shadow foreign secretary for his urgent question 
 we want to see an end to the fighting as soon as possible well over month since hamas ’s terror attack against israel it be appal that the hostage be still be hold very many civilian be also die in gaza and this weekend hamas rocket kill israeli defence forces soldier and injure other as we have say the fast way to end the conflict be to secure a deal that get the hostage out and allow for a pause in the fighting in gaza we must then turn that pause into a sustainable permanent ceasefire 
 regard the situation in rafah our position have be consistent we be deeply concerned about the prospect of a military incursion give the number of civilian who be shelter there and the importance of that entry point for aid entry point for humanitarian aid include kerem shalom must be reopen quickly to allow aid in israel must facilitate immediate uninterrupted humanitarian access in the south especially the entry of fuel and ensure the protection of civilian and safe passage for those who wish to leave rafah as yet we have not see a credible plan to protect civilian 
 we be of course follow closely the late development on the hostage talk at this stage while event be still shift i cannot as the house will understand provide a detailed running commentary as the british government have say we want to see a deal agree that would ensure the release of hostage and a pause in the fighting a generous offer be on the table last week propose by egypt and accept by israel we need to see hamas accept a viable deal and we can start build the momentum towards a permanent sustained ceasefire 
 in parallel we continue to push as hard as we can to get much need aid into gaza via vital land route alongside sea and air to alleviate the suffering israel have now commit to significant step to increase the amount of aid get into gaza we now need to see that turn into action to ensure that aid actually get over the border and that it be safely and properly distribute we look to israel to meet its commitment to flood gaza with aid 
 ultimately we need a long term solution to this crisis this mean the release of all hostage hamas ’s rule dismantle their ability to attack israel remove a new palestinian government for the west bank and gaza and a political horizon to a state solution israelis and palestinians should be able to live together side by side in peace and security this be our goal we will continue work tirelessly to achieve it 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question but i have to say that it be extraordinary that the government do not come forward with a statement today this be a profoundly concern moment   in this awful war ceasefire negotiation appear to be go backwards today the war be not just continue but escalate 
 labour have be clear for month that we oppose an offensive in rafah which risk catastrophic consequence the united states have say that it would be a disaster the european union have say that the world must prevent it and the united nations security council have call for an immediate ceasefire benjamin netanyahu be ignore the warning of israel ’s ally and partner the united kingdom include 
 so can the minister tell i what the consequence will be we be already see the consequence for civilian airstrike in densely pack area the rafah crossing as well as kerem shalom shamelessly attack by hamas now close aid reportedly be block and northern gaza in full blow famine some people be shelter in rafah many of they order to go there by the idf in the place half the child in gaza be in rafah where can they go to be safe the french government say yesterday that the forced displacement of any civilian population be a war crime do the minister agree 
 hamas be a terrorist organisation and their cowardly tactic be reprehensible but that do not change israel ’s obligation to follow the rule of war or the government ’s obligation on arm export so can the minister say why he think that an attack on rafah do not present a clear risk of a serious breach of international humanitarian law can he also confirm whether he have receive any assessment not legal advice but any assessment or policy advice from foreign commonwealth and development office official that the threshold have already be meet now more than ever we need an immediate ceasefire the release of all hostage and unimpeded aid to gaza 
 the shadow foreign secretary have set out in eloquent term what be effectively the policy of the government and the entire house he chide the government for not offer a statement today but i suggest that the government have not be slow in come to the house with frequent statement and response to urgent question and we will of course continue to do so 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the government ’s discussion with prime minister netanyahu the prime minister the foreign secretary and indeed the entire government have be very clear about our advice to prime minister netanyahu and i have set it out repeatedly in the house when i last answer question from the right hon gentleman here i make very clear our position on rafah as well he ask about the consequence and how we deal with those britain and our ally through the united nations and i remind he that britain be pivotal in secure security council resolution and be work together to try to improve what be a terrible situation and we will continue to do just that with i hope the support of the whole house 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 i welcome the effort make by the foreign secretary the deputy foreign secretary and the minister for the middle east   who have be in and out of the middle east many time over the past week in order to hear from our ally however as we see the launch of the rafah offensive what reassurance have be receive that aid access and above all aid worker will be protect we can not see the entire aid industry flee from rafah junction as be currently be predict there be speculation about al mawasi as a safe zone for civilian but there be no infrastructure in what be essentially a desert and it be not safe on the last occasion when as we see the british charity medical aid for palestinians be bomb on which we have still have no answer finally have we have any proof of life for those israeli citizen who have now be hold for month for many there have be no proof of life since at least day what be we do to push for that proof of life which family so desperately need 
 my hon friend be entirely right to make that last point we do seek proof of life the family to whom she refer be desperate for information but that information have not be forthcoming we be deeply concerned about the humanitarian position in rafah any plan would have to respect international humanitarian law and we have yet to see such a plan the immediate priority as i set out in my opening remark must be a humanitarian pause in the fighting as the house well know such a pause would allow we potentially to get the hostage out but also to get aid into gaza 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 a week ago from that dispatch box the minister say 
 give the number of civilian shelter in rafah it be not easy to see how such an offensive could be compliant with international humanitarian law”.—[official report   april vol c. 
 despite repeat appeal for israel not to attack rafah just hour after the dash hope of a ceasefire that offensive be happen be this the breach of international humanitarian law you refer to last week and will that breach immediately end uk sale of arm to israel or be this yet another example of the uk declare a red line only for israel to completely ignore it without condemnation or consequence we know how this play out minister you plead with they they ignore you they do what they want and you find excuse for they a blind eye will be turn to the slaughter of ten of thousand of innocent civilian and while the uk government call for more aid to the survivor they will continue to issue arm export licence that have be the pattern of behaviour for month can we expect anything different now 
 on the hon gentleman ’s final point he will know that we be work flat out in these very difficult circumstance to achieve something different and we will continue to do so he quote what i say the last time i be at the dispatch box and i would point out that the word i have use today in answer the same question be virtually exactly the same i have make it clear that there would have to be a plan that   respected international humanitarian law and we have not yet see such a plan that be entirely consistent with what i say before 
 the hon gentleman ask about the sale of arm the foreign secretary announce on   april   that the british position with regard to export licence be unchanged we do not publish the government ’s legal advice but we always act in accordance with it i would point out that we publish datum on export licensing decision transparently and on a quarterly basis 
 yesterday i meet survivor of the nova festival massacre people who have fight singlehandedly for hour in israel on   october   against brutal hamas terrorist we all want peace and we all want to see the end of civilian fatality but sometimes country must fight for peace israel have a right to defend herself and a duty to protect her people from the brutal terrorist cult of hamas will the minister confirm that the government will maintain steadfast and resolute support for israel as she finish the job of eliminate hamas from gaza 
 i be very pleased to hear that my right hon friend have the chance to meet those survivor yesterday so that she can share with the house the hideous circumstance that they suffer she make it clear that israel have the right of self defence and she set out eloquently why that be the case but israel must also abide by international humanitarian law 
 i say to the minister if i may you ’re well than this we all condemn hamas ’s attack and we all want to see the hostage release but we be on the edge of witness a massacre a mass murder of innocent man woman and child at the behest of fanatical zealot in the israeli cabinet we need this government to lead an international exercise to prevent this attack now way to prevent it be to make it clear to netanyahu that if it go ahead this government will pursue he as a war criminal at the international court 
 the right hon gentleman know very well that the government be work with their ally with the power in the region and through the united nations precisely to ensure that that do not happen he also know that the foreign secretary the prime minister and other ministers who be in close contact with the israeli government have make it absolutely clear what the effect of a military campaign conduct within the small confine of rafah where so many people be kettle would be i have make very clear from this dispatch box the view of the government in that respect 
 a couple of day ago on holocaust remembrance day an israeli commander remind his man that on that day year ago the nazis lead jews to the oven for the sole crime of be jewish on   october at dawn on a public holiday hamas and their supporter invade israel and murder more jewish people include child and rap dismember and tortured people and yes they put baby alive in an oven to murder it they take dozen of hostage and still have many in savage confinement of a medieval nature 
 many voice put pressure on israel to do what they believe israel should do do the minister agree that more pressure need to be put on hamas to do what they should do what any civilised human being would call for which be to release the hostage and stop attack aid point such aid point be attack at the weekend kill israeli soldier an aid point that by the way british aid come through they be silent about that with every focus on israel and none on hamas 
 my right hon and learn friend make an important point i want to emphasise to he but also to the house that the hostage be not an afterthought they be at the very centre of this there be more than include woman and child and a holocaust survivor the government be try to strike a balance there be an urgent requirement for a pause in all the fighting to enable aid to get in and to negotiate the hostage out which might then lead as a process to a sustainable ceasefire which be what we be try to achieve 
 i think we all want an immediate ceasefire and as we see the start of the destruction of rafah and the impact that it will have on the civilian population we be horrified i want to ask the minister a practical question that might get we a step far how optimistic be he that a sufficient number of hostage will be release to ensure that agreement between the side can be reach and that israel will then accept an immediate ceasefire 
 the right hon lady who speak with authority and understanding on these matter will know that the question she have ask i be at the heart of the negotiation which still continue and which we very much hope will be successful as i have say before i can not give the house a run commentary on those negotiation but i can assure she that the logic she bring to this debate do inform the government ’s support for get a resolution to those negotiation 
 over the past few month member from all part of the house have question the deputy foreign secretary on the notion of consequence and we have hear that again today he be an experienced minister so he know that every equivocation every hesitation and every set of diplomatic nicety have lead we to this calamitous moment for the hostage for the palestinian people and for the interest of both people in the long term on   april the foreign secretary say that support for israel be not unconditional i shall ask the question in a different way be there any red line be there anything the israeli government could do that would so appal this government that they would feel the need to act if so what be it 
 my right hon friend talk about the calamitous situation that we have reach and no in the house will forget that it start on   october   with the brutal event that my right hon and learn friend   the member for northampton north sir michael ellis   just describe my right hon friend ask i a rhetorical question but the evidence will show that the government have do everything we possibly can to try to alleviate   the situation sometimes unpopularly and that our logic be accept at the united nations in the security council resolution that i mention 
 the israeli opposition leader yair lapid say at the weekend 
 a government that want to return the abductee 
 would be 
 send the team to cairo not crush the heart of the family 
 lapid be right but it be not only the heart of the hostage family that be be crush it be those of the palestinians who want nothing to do with hamas terrorist many of they be be chase around the gaza strip the uk rightly defend israel from the threat of attack by iran but will the british government also suspend arm export to israel 
 on the hon gentleman ’s point he will have see that both side have send team to cairo and we await development on that with a degree of hope and optimism on his point i have make it clear to the house where the government stand on arm export we follow the legal advice we do not publish it in accordance with precedent and we will continue to do so 
 member have say that the situation in rafah need to come to an end but what need to come to an end be the fighting unicef have say today that rafah be a city of child and we should not be dance around the issue or play with word as though it be a game of scrabble we should call this what it be and call for an immediate ceasefire family of hostage want the fighting to end now and my constituent in bolton demand that it do the international community be demand an immediate stop we be of the most influential country on the conflict so will the united kingdom call for an immediate end to the fighting 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for keep in touch with i on issue that be bring to his attention by his constituent as he know it be exactly the government ’s policy to try to achieve that pause which can then lead to a sustainable ceasefire we will continue to do everything we can to achieve that 
 what be the government ’s plan to get aid into gaza now that both rafah and kerem shalom be inaccessible even if they be accessible with an invasion now start there would be no way to distribute aid what be the government ’s plan to get aid in to alleviate the appalling suffering of the palestinian people 
 the hon lady be right to identify that yesterday rafah and kerem shalom be shut with no aid able to get in that be a matter of immense concern to the government she will know that as well as try to get aid in ourselves by road transport we have be a lead nation in assist with the maritime route and with airdrop some airdrop have be make of they by the royal air force 
 constituent be understandably devastate by what be happen in gaza right now which be desperate for those on both side i be conscious of what the minister have just say about aid be distribute but will he ensure that all the resource possible be there to enable we to carry on with maritime delivery and airdrop do he agree that ultimately it be in hamas ’s hand to return the hostage and remove any excuse for further action in gaza by israel 
 we will certainly continue to boost the maritime effort which as my right hon friend know be ongoing use both british military asset and our store in the region particularly in cyprus as well as technology for clear the kit that be available there we will continue to do everything we can in extraordinarily difficult circumstance as we have be to achieve great entry of aid into gaza 
 the real concern now be that netanyahu have objective which be to raze gaza to the ground that be what he be intent on do and it will include rafah this government along with all other western government have tell the israelis that they must not go into rafah i ask the minister once again what be the consequence if they do will it be a slap on the wrist and a do n’t do it again or be serious consideration be give to ban the sale of arm and to sanction individual and the israeli government collectively what be the government go to do be they go to do anything at all 
 i have make it very clear what the government be seek to do the hon gentleman have outline what prime minister netanyahu be say but there be many different voice in israel as we have see this weekend include significant demonstration in support of the policy of get the hostage back britain be do everything it can to help achieve that 
 for i the define feature of this appalling tragedy in gaza be that the civilian population be trap between the oppression of an appalling terrorist organisation and an appalling military onslaught give the increase compression of that population within rafah in a much small geographical area the need for precision restraint and proportionality from the israelis be ever more acute will the minister please assure the house that he be do everything possible to convince the israelis of the need to preserve the sanctity of human life 
 my hon friend will know that the government have repeatedly underline the importance of israel abide by international humanitarian law the foreign secretary and the prime minister have underline that point in their frequent contact 
 despite the blatant disregard that we have see for international law over the last few week the international community have warn that the israeli ground offensive in rafah will be a red line even the deputy foreign secretary tell this house last week that he could not 
 see how such an offensive could be compliant with international humanitarian law”.—[official report   april vol c. 
 with israeli troop now ready to move into the world ’s large and most densely populate refugee camp where people sit starve and fearful for the life of their child i have to ask the minister just why he do not come to the house today to announce a strong uk response that immediately support the international criminal court ’s war crime investigation and immediately end arm sale to israel 
 frankly it be shameful that the government have again come to the house with nothing will the minister please answer the question that we have all come to hear answer what be the uk government do to stop the bloodshed and the massacre that be about to happen hour from now in gaza 
 on the hon gentleman ’s point there be no difference between what i have say today and the response i give on the last occasion i be at the dispatch box to which he refer he set out in eloquent tone the nature of the problem we face but he must recognise that britain along with a large number of regional power the international community and the un be try to stop the very position he set out 
 month ago today many of we begin receive the most alarming message from friend and/or family in israel by the end of that day every red line of international law have be breach by the monstrous palestinian terrorist who rap countless woman murder people and take hundred of innocent people hostage 
 within hour people in this country and some pro palestinian activist be on the street cheer what happen that day since then we have see the dehumanisation of jews through the dehumanisation of israel the protocols of the elders of zion have be dust off and every antisemitic trope have be trot out some people in this house whom we would have expect to be ally when it come to gender base violence have have little or nothing to say about the horror of that day 
 now we hear call for israel to be deny the right to defend itself while arm continue to flow to hamas from iran and north korea there be nothing kind or compassionate about that message will the deputy foreign secretary confirm to i that any ceasefire which we all want because we all want this tragedy to end will include the complete removal of hamas from governance in gaza 
 my hon friend be right in what he say the rightful aim of defeat hamas will not be achieve by allow a humanitarian catastrophe in gaza as i be sure he would agree he mention gender base violence he will recognise that the government have supply funding particularly to try to tackle aspect of that where we be able to make a contribution and have some impact on what he say about the nature of some of what have be say in this house and outside the government make it very clear that we be absolutely opposed to antisemitism and islamophobia in all their form 
 last october the israeli defence minister disgracefully describe the palestinian people as animal and that be exactly how israel have treat they forcibly displace man woman   and child from the north to the south of gaza and now forcibly displace people again slaughter ten of thousand of innocent civilian and create famine condition now there be the risk of a massacre what we be witness this week be a clear escalation of israel ’s total disregard for civilian life and international law we need an immediate ceasefire but will the minister finally agree to impose stringent sanction on israel not simply on individual settler by end support for its military capability in gaza suspend arm export licence and offer support for icj and icc process investigate israel ’s criminal action where be our humanity 
 order emotion be run high i want to get everybody in but i be concerned that we will not achieve it at this rate please can we help each other 
 the hon lady set out in lurid term the issue we face and the problem the entire international community be try to address 
 indicate dissent 
 she shake her head but the fact be that the government be do everything they can as we have set out the foreign secretary have set it out the prime minister have set it out and i have set it out from this dispatch box to try to effect the change that she and i so desperately wish to see 
 i welcome the minister ’s statement with regard to the united kingdom support the people of gaza with humanitarian aid the minister know that i have write to the foreign secretary ask that the united kingdom host an international donor conference for palestine as it do with the international friends of syria group which be the large convening of humanitarian donor at a conference hold in the united kingdom i understand that the foreign secretary think that it be a good idea so where be the uk in lead the way in set up an international donor conference for palestine 
 my hon friend be right to identify a political horizon that be constructive when this ghastly fighting be over we hope that people will lift their eye to a political horizon britain be do a lot of work to try to support that opportunity when it come and at that point there may well be a role for britain in the international community to convene something of that sort 
 the invasion of rafah by the israeli army come alongside further discovery of more than body in mass graf at the al shifa and nasser hospital with the un confirm evidence of torture summary execution and instance of people be bury alive and other bury with intravenous needle still in their arm at the most recent foreign office question the deputy foreign secretary say that it would be hard to see how an invasion of rafah would not be in breach of international humanitarian law give what i have just outline do the uk government finally consider the invasion of rafah to be a breach of international humanitarian law yes or no 
 alas such question be not susceptible to yes or no answer we have make absolutely clear our view about an invasion of rafah the full reality of the specific incident the hon gentleman mention be not clear we need to recognise as the british government have make clear that full and transparent investigation of those matter be require 
 hamas have apparently say to mediator that they do not have live hostage who fall into the category of woman child elderly and sick that be an appalling body blow for the relative of those hold captive in gaza for more than day will the deputy foreign secretary take the opportunity to acknowledge israel ’s right to take military action to get those people home 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right to focus on the awful plight of the hostage as she have do repeatedly in this house she be also right to make it clear that under international law israel have the right to self defence and to take proportionate action to recover hostage 
 like many other i pray that pressure from this house and elsewhere can bring this conflict to an end but we all know that that will require agreement on an arab lead body to maintain peace order and security how close be we to that agreement 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right to try to lift people ’s eye to the political horizon so that from this intolerable misery can come hope for the future a great deal of work be go on to pinpoint and augment the sinew of such a political future the foreign secretary have be in the region repeatedly especially on the west bank and in ramallah we will continue to do everything we can to plan for that alongside try to resolve the desperate situation in rafah on which i have try to set out to the house what britain be do 
 the deputy foreign secretary remind we that we be now in the month talk be not make progress the hostage still have not be release and border crossing be close we be enter another dark chapter in this terrible conflict the un world food programme warn of a full blow famine unless more aid can be deliver this house be ask what we can do so will the deputy foreign secretary update we on the building of that new maritime port off gaza that be something that the international community can control of which we can have full stakeholder ownership once it be operational will british troop be involve in aid delivery 
 in respect of my right hon friend ’s final point we will have to see what be require secure the temporary pier off the coast of gaza be a way of get additional aid in swiftly he will know that the royal fleet auxiliary cardigan bay be in the area and be effectively the command post for this maritime effort britain be also thoroughly involve just as it be from the air and from land in detail in the maritime effort 
 the uk government have long warn israel that an invasion of rafah must not happen civilian life must be protect and aid must enter gaza prime minister netanyahu have show once again that he be not listen to his ally or the icj and that he be hellbent on turn the whole of gaza into a graveyard will the uk government urgently impose a full arm embargo on israel which be the only thing the uk can do to try to stop the starvation and potential genocide of those leave in rafah 
 the early part of the hon gentleman ’s question set out what we be all try to address on an arm embargo he will know that the amount of arm that britain supply be negligible equally we operate an arm sale regime that be strictly govern by the rule that i have previously set out to the house we act in line with the legal advice we receive and we will continue to do so 
 of course i be greatly concerned about the humanitarian situation in gaza right now but i be also greatly concerned that nothing happen that give hamas an increase foothold in gaza and put they in a position to inflict more evil and misery like that we see on   october i be also concerned that some of the propose ceasefire agreement seem to involve release hundred of hamas terrorist and do not involve all of the hostage be release will the deputy foreign secretary give i a commitment that we will intensify plan for a hamas free gaza so that innocent people in gaza can look forward with hope to a future of peace 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that hamas can have no role in gaza in the future much of the work we be do in that respect be design to help to build up the palestinian authority so that it can be involve in govern both the west bank and gaza as soon as the time be right 
 the deputy foreign secretary ’s answer today be virtually identical to those he give include to i last tuesday the situation have escalate but the government ’s response remain the same there be child hostage in rafah alone there be no proof of life from they but million of our people be watch on their phone today the proof of death and mutilation of many of they the government say they be do everything they can but they be not you could now stop send weapon to the people who be rain down this death and misery and the labour party could ask you to do that but do not 
 order the hon member say you but it be not i who be responsible 
 the hon gentleman say that the answer i give to he and other last tuesday be the same those answer reflect in so far as the parameter of the situation be the same the fact that we be pursue long term policy design to tackle the evil that have be set out so clearly this afternoon in the house he also make a point about the number of child who be deny food and medicine in rafah he will know that through medical aid and the british contribution   not least through a field hospital britain have be careful to ensure that where we can bring medical help particularly to child we be do so
