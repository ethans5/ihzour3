 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the online safety act in reduce child ’s exposure to harmful online content 
 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the online safety act in reduce child ’s exposure to harmful online content 
 protect child from harmful content online be a top priority for this government and for i personally because it be a deeply concern issue for parent and child across the country since implement the online safety act this summer site have take action to stop child see harmful content online but i will be pay close attention to what be work and will not hesitate to go far if necessary indeed on monday i add self harm material to the list of priority offence in the act so if company do not take down content that promote self harm or actively stop it appear they will face enforcement action i hope this show the house my determination to take all necessary step on this issue 
 it be so gratifying to see a watfordian at the dispatch box in my constituency of watford parent and family be rightly pleased with the protection be afford to child and vulnerable people through the online safety act we would not allow a child to get into a car and drive down the road to go into an off licence and buy tobacco or alcohol product or to go into an adult entertainment establishment so do   the secretary of state agree that child and vulnerable people need protection in the virtual world just as they do in the physical 
 i absolutely agree and that be why i be determined to do everything necessary to remove illegal content and to protect child from online harm many year ago when i be a member of the science and technology committee as part of a report we be do i speak to child in secondary and primary school in my constituency to see what they feel be the benefit and difficulty of be online it be an issue i have be concern about for many year i be determined to take action not just for the fabulous people of watford but for child and young people right across the country 
 i also welcome my right hon friend to her place do she agree that reform ’s reckless plan to scrap the online safety act would fail a generation of young people include all the parent and child in my constituency of kensington and bayswater who have join my local campaign to protect child online 
 yes if reform member be so concerned about the online safety act why be they not here in the chamber ask i question about it reform want to scrap the act which would mean rip up protection that crack down on revenge porn violent misogynistic content and post encourage self harm or suicide i commend my hon friend on his campaign family in his constituency want action and that be what we intend to take finally we be put child safety by take down illegal content taming toxic algorithm and make age inappropriate content hard to access we will go far if we need to 
 i welcome the new secretary of state to her position will she look at the downloading of virtual private network which allow people to get content from all over the world many vpn be base overseas once they be download parent have no control whatsoever if their child be then access immoral and illegal content 
 in the few day that i have be in post a number of mps and other organisation have already raise this issue with i i will always be drive by evidence i want to protect people ’s right to privacy but i want to make sure that nothing be do that will put people at risk if the hon member have evidence and want to send that to i i be more than happy to look at it because i want to take the action require 
 i have be contact by many constituent worried about the implementation of the act for example emily who be home school and have i struggle to access thing that help with her learning and her rural isolation alexander say that he have access gambling site but can not access suicide prevention content as we mark world suicide prevention day how can we make sure that the act be a little more nuanced 
 i be glad that the hon lady have mention that today be world suicide prevention day anyone who have experience it in relation to their family or friend or in their constituency know how devastating it can be 
 the hon lady raise an important issue from my constituency experience child and young people want to benefit from all the opportunity and learn they can but sometimes it be difficult to get it right it be a complex issue as a new secretary of state i need to get into the detail but i will always listen when the evidence be there i hope to take the appropriate action 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the secretary of state and the new ministerial team to their place and thank the former team who i have very much enjoy spar with over the past few month 
 in light of the report of the department ’s plan to review the implementation of the online safety act can the secretary of state confirm the scope of that review include whether it will address the apparent confusion in the medium between the power of the online safety act and the public order act will the review look at age verification to ensure that people ’s data be safe and secure and that the pass scheme they use be trust will it tackle the use of vpn particularly by child to get around age verification 
 i be always drive by the evidence we need to see how the act be be implement and whether and how it work and that be the absolute priority for i i will look at any evidence that hon member provide but the key thing for i be that we be take action we have of the strong protection anywhere in the world but i be very interested in the issue of addiction in child online and in how behaviour can become addictive in this very fast move world we need to be fleet of foot i think the truth be that the technology develop much fast than we make legislation and that be a nut that we have to crack 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i too thank the previous ministerial team and welcome the new i very much look forward to work together 
 follow the roll out of the online safety act there be evidence that harmful content be still be algorithmically show to young child and that artificial intelligence technology which have be link to teenage death be not cover properly in the act and concern have be raise about data protection and inappropriately age gate educational content we must get the act right so will the secretary of state consider our call for a digital bill of rights to set the standard in order that we can truly adapt to this era of technological change 
 we do need to adapt to this age of phenomenal technological development i have already have a discussion with the chief executive of ofcom and i intend to meet many other organisation include those that champion strong protection for child online the hon lady raise the critical issue that we need to protect people ’s privacy and we need to protect freedom of speech but we also need to make sure that illegal content and harmful content for child be remove i will leave no stone unturned in deliver on that objective 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help support the adoption of new technology in the workplace 
 new technology in the workplace can help company become more productive and efficient in make workplace more accessible so that people can get work and stay in work it be also good for people we be support company in a number of way especially through our industrial strategy and we have see great example of uk firm adopt tech artificial intelligence in particular ahead of their international peer we want to do all we can to support company in this area and i be determined to take action on that 
 i welcome the secretary of state to her place small business in my constituency be vital to economic growth what be her department do to ensure that small business can benefit from innovation and new technology 
 the hon gentleman raise a really important point my own constituency be dominate by small business and issue that they always raise be that we be great at start up in this country but we need to do more to help those company to scale up i be new in the job and open to idea so if the hon gentleman and the business in his constituency would like to say what they think they need to help they go from start up to scale up i would be more than happy to listen to they 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i thank the outgoing ministerial team for their engagement as i congratulate the new team on succeed to this important and inspiring brief 
 the government be commit to transform public service through the adoption of new technology at the june spending review departments publish their plan to deploy technology to achieve efficiency but we be yet to see the detailed and fully fund road map for delivery promise by dsit for this summer will the secretary of state commit to publish a road map that set out what will be deliver who will deliver it and by when and how much it will cost before her appearance before my committee as part of our digital centre of government inquiry in november 
 i have a feeling that will be of the gentler question that my hon friend ask i over the come month i be a passionate public service reformer and i believe there be huge potential for technology and ai to deliver well outcome for the people who use service and well value for taxpayer money i will definitely provide she with more detail on the question that she ask but let i give a fantastic example from my previous role in our jobcentre in wales there be big queue for work coach who be help people do their cv they use ai and it be well for the people who use the service and free up the work   coach to spend time with the people who most need help that be a small example we have to do more and i will absolutely commit to set out our further plan 
 what step her department be take to hold technology company accountable for the content on their platform 
 what step her department be take to hold technology company accountable for the content on their platform 
 minister welcome 
 thank you mr speaker 
 through the online safety act platform now have a legal duty to protect user from illegal content and safeguard child from harmful content ofcom have strong power to hold firm to account include fine of up to of qualify worldwide revenue ofcom have make it clear that it will act where platform fall short and have already launch investigation into suspect non compliance i assure my hon friend that we will continue to review this area carefully and will not hesitate to go far 
 i welcome the minister to his position 
 on world suicide prevention day i welcome the government ’s action require online platform to proactively protect user from illegal and harmful content but charity like the molly rose foundation remain concerned about whether major platform be fully comply with uk regulation especially on risk assessment what further step be the minister take to ensure that ofcom enforce the law and respond robustly to any breach 
 i thank my hon friend for an important and timely question it be important because i have be in the room with ian russell the father of molly russell and i have see the tireless resilience with which he and the molly rose foundation have campaign to protect child online it be a timely question because in memory of case like molly russell ’s suicide prevention must remain front and centre in our mind that be precisely why in the week of this new ministerial team the secretary of state announce that self harm content be now a priority offence ofcom have request risk assessment from over service include small but high risk platform and i know it be actively enforce compliance as well 
 i welcome the minister to his place 
 yesterday i sponsor a drop in event here in parliament with parent zone to highlight the hit pause campaign which aim to teach people to recognise conspiracy theory and misinformation online do the minister agree that although we can make online platform more accountable in other way these kind of initiative should be widely available to help equip   people with the mean to protect themselves when the tech company fail to take responsibility for the content on their platform 
 i be grateful for this chance to put on the record that even when other have put their interest my hon friend have always put southport above everything in do so he have inspire many of we from across the house 
 medium literacy include critically evaluate information it be a key skill in help people to be protect from harm online and i know that the technology company play a crucial role we welcome collaborative initiative like parent zone ’s hit pause programme and i encourage all platform to continue to expand their work to embed medium literacy into their product design 
 i welcome the minister to his place 
 when it come to hold tech company accountable for use copyright material on their platform without consent the government ’s data use and access act let down our creative industry the department ’s new work group on ai and copyright include just british tech firm alongside a host of foreign tech competitor will his government now give our tech sector and creative industry the proper voice they deserve 
 our technology sector our entrepreneur and our creator be close to my heart as i spend most of my professional life prior to come to this place in those contexts we have consult we have listen and we continue to listen as a new team across the board we will look closely at the evidence and make sure that we be back this country ’s entrepreneur and creator 
 over the last day in my constituency there have be of the most appalling and violent act by self style vigilante group in each case they livestream on facebook live and tiktok live those video disappear and the creator remain anonymous there will be a criminal justice response but may i ask the minister to relook at the protection for those who continue not only to abuse and act racistly in our society but to do so under the cloak of anonymity 
 the right hon gentleman raise an incredibly important point i be sorry and disappoint to hear of the instance he mention this be an incredibly important issue we will look closely at the evidence base and if under the code of practice for illegal harm already publish and implement by ofcom there be find to be deficiency in practice by any of the firm he mention we will i be sure take appropriate action 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i be delighted to join the department for science innovation and technology this be a crucial area for our country provide   opportunity for job and work and to improve our public service as secretary of state i be get to work straight away as i say on monday i have strengthen the law to add further protection from dangerous self harm material online social medium company now have to take action to not just remove that material but prevent it from come up in the place so that the internet can live up to its real potential as a place of opportunity where everyone can learn connect and be creative free from fear 
 i too welcome the right hon member to her place her predecessor   the right hon member for hove and portslade peter kyle warn that lose control of artificial general intelligence would be catastrophic yet he fail to deliver legislation to protect the public will the new secretary of state deliver on an artificial intelligence bill and ensure that the british people benefit from the advantage of ai without become its victim 
 i want to ensure that people business and creative throughout the country can benefit from the huge opportunity that technological development in ai promise and that people be protect too it be early day in this job and i be listen carefully to all those involve but wherever action be require i will take it 
 what   conversation have take place with uk research and innovation on the support and development of new sustainable transport technology and on how they might benefit constituency such as mine crawley 
 my hon friend will know that the uk be a world leader in research and innovation over the spending review period we be deliver £ for research and development a record amount ukri invest more than £ a year in transport innovation and sustainability be a key focus project include work to develop new aviation fuel production technology that could reduce emission by up to there be more that we can do i know he be passionate about this issue and either i or my ministers will be very happy to meet he to talk more about what we can do 
 we now come to the shadow secretary of state i welcome she to her new position 
 thank you mr speaker i welcome the new secretary of state to her place and of course i welcome her stellar team the minister of state department for science innovation and technology   the right hon member for edinburgh south ian murray be so hot that he snare job from the guy who just fire he the tech secretary replace the ozempic of whitehall   the right hon member for hove and portslade peter kyle who claim that his digital plan would shear £ of fat from the government by how much do it cut the civil service 
 i believe that use tech and ai to modernise our public service enable the people who work in the public sector to spend more time on the thing they want to spend time on serve the user of   public service and less time on red tape and bureaucracy much of which be put in place by the hon lady ’s government 
 i fully agree with the right hon lady but the number of civil servant have rise to a year high under labour if somebody in the private sector lead a reverse efficiency drive they would get sack labour make the person responsible business secretary for a welfare meltdown you get to be the minister for the future but while ai be scream for cheap electricity the prime minister can not sack his fail energy secretary why should the tech sector believe that this be a government of delivery 
 because this government believe that science technology and innovation be how this country will seize the opportunity of the future unlike opposition members we be determined to deliver that change for people in every part of the country no matter where they live because our people be our good asset we want to grow the economy transform our public service and sort out the mess leave by opposition members 
 too   many of my constituent in lichfield burntwood and the village be struggle with appalling mobile signal it be a problem we see across the country and it be often bad in rural area what step be the ministerial team take to ensure that the government ’s review of the mobile market lead to a fast roll out of g 
 we can not ensure that everybody in this country benefit from be online and from development unless everybody be join up to fast broadband we have put £ over the spending review period into make connectivity work i be work closely with building digital uk if my hon friend have concern about his constituent he should come and meet i and building digital uk to get they online because that be how they will seize the opportunity of the future 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday september 
 i start mr speaker by express our sincere condolence to his majesty the king and the royal family on the death of her royal highness the duchess of kent her life be fill with compassion and dignity she dutifully support our late queen elizabeth ii comfort the runner up at wimbledon and work anonymously as a music teacher in hull typical of her unassuming nature and human touch i be sure the thought of the whole house be with his royal highness the duke of kent his family and all those whose life she touch 
 turn to other event i condemn the strike that israel carry out in doha yesterday they violate qatar ’s sovereignty and do nothing to secure the peace that the   uk and so many of our ally be commit to i speak to the emir of qatar last night soon after the attack to convey our support and solidarity he be crystal clear that notwithstanding the attack he will continue to work on a diplomatic solution to achieve a ceasefire and a state outcome on which he and i be of the same mind that be why i meet president abbas on monday and will meet president herzog later today i will be absolutely clear that we condemn israel ’s action i will also be clear that restriction on aid must be lift the offensive in gaza must stop and settlement building must cease but however difficult the uk will not walk away from a diplomatic solution we will negotiate and we will strain every sinew because that be the only way to get the hostage out to get aid in and to stop the killing 
 last night russia launch drone into poland in an unprecedented attack i have be in touch with the polish prime minister this morning to make clear our support for poland we will stand firm in our support for ukraine with our partner and through our leadership of the coalition of the willing we will continue to ramp up the pressure on putin until there be a just and last peace 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 i have send a letter of condolence to the royal family on behalf of the commons follow the sad news about the duchess of kent let we now come back to dr luke evans 
 year on from the election the country have see a transport secretary resign over fraud an anti corruption minister investigate for corruption a homelessness minister make tenant homeless and a housing secretary not pay tax on her house we also have a prime minister who accept more freebie than any other mp in the previous parliament be this what the prime minister mean by integrity when he come to government 
 here be the difference i strengthen the ministerial code and the independent adviser the previous deputy prime minister refer herself to the adviser and there be a clear finding she do the right thing contrast that with the shadow foreign secretary   the right hon member for witham priti patel who be find to have breach the code under the previous government what do the then prime minister do he ignore it there be a resignation but it be of the adviser not the person who be find to have breach the code the right hon lady still sit on the opposition front bench that be the difference 
 after almost decade of the snp 
 hear hear more to come 
 order if the right hon gentleman carry on there will not be more decade of the snp in this chamber 
 thank you mr speaker after almost decade of the snp and year of the tories kirkcaldy high street have be in a state of decline that be why the chancellor be right to prioritise kirkcaldy for multimillion pound regeneration funding from the new growth mission fund to build on the enormous potential of our town and its beautiful sea front do the prime minister agree that investment over decline be key for this labour government and will he ask the new business secretary to meet i to discuss the funding 
 my hon friend have be a tireless campaigner for investment in her high street i can give her good news thank to funding commit by the chancellor and this labour government i can confirm today that subject to business case approval we will approve million to transform kirkaldy ’s high street and sea front i will make sure that my hon friend get the meeting she want with the business secretary the snp have squander the potential of high street for decade next year people can vote for positive change with a scottish labour government 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i associate myself with the prime minister ’s comment about the duchess of kent she live an exemplary life of public service and will be very much miss i agree with the prime minister as all of we in this house should we stand shoulder to shoulder with poland and all our nato ally against putin ’s aggression a nato country have just have to defend itself against russian drone now more than ever we need our ambassador to washington fully focus on this issue and liaise closely with america do the prime minister have full confidence in peter mandelson 
 let i start by say that the victim of epstein be at the forefront of our mind he be a despicable criminal who commit the most heinous crime and destroy the life of so many woman and girl the ambassador have repeatedly express his deep regret for his association with epstein and he be right to do so i have confidence in he and he be play an important role in the uk us relationship 
 this be interesting the prime minister say that the ambassador have express full regret but the victim of the paedophile jeffrey epstein have call for lord mandelson to be sack just so the house be aware in jeffrey epstein be convict of child prostitution and sex trafficking which take place between and that be the precise period when lord mandelson call jeffrey epstein his good pal be the prime minister aware of this intimate relationship when he appoint lord mandelson to be our ambassador in washington 
 as the right hon lady and the house would expect full due process be follow during this appointment as it be with all ambassador the ambassador have repeatedly express his deep regret and he be right to do so he be now play an important part in the us uk relationship 
 i ask the prime minister if he know about the relationship the fact that he do not answer indicate that he probably do know i be not ask a question about process i be ask a question about   his judgment the daily telegraph report today that while lord mandelson be business secretary he broker a deal with jeffrey epstein and that this occur after epstein have be convict of child sex offence give this new information do the prime minister really think that it be tenable for our ambassador to remain in post 
 the relationship between the us and the uk be of our foremost relationship and i have confidence in the ambassador in the role he be do 
 i think it be embarrass that the prime minister be still say that he have confidence in a man who be broker deal with convict child sex offender while sit in government that be a disgrace this government have repeatedly refuse to declare lord mandelson ’s full interest as part of the appointment there will have be extensive government vetting cover detail and timing of peter mandelson ’s dealing with jeffrey epstein will the prime minister publish all the document include those about lord mandelson ’s interest 
 as i say full due process be go through in relation to this appointment as would be expect as the right hon lady well know the publication of document be subject to a procedure that include an independent element this would have be subject to the usual procedure 
 the prime minister can not answer any question that be not the behaviour of someone who have full confidence the ambassador should be in the white house talk about how we respond to an incursion into nato airspace instead he be give interview about himself to the sun this be a man who have already have to be remove from cabinet twice and now we learn that he be broker pound deal with jeffrey epstein while he be business secretary 
 i do not get a proper answer the prime minister be talk about process but this be not about process this be about judgment just last week i tell he that he should sack his deputy prime minister labour members be all cheer and congratulate themselves but she be go day later his phase be break and he have a wholly new front bench team i will ask he again will he ensure that these document be publish will he actually instruct peter mandelson to publish all his correspondence with jeffrey epstein 
 the leader of the opposition say that the ambassador should be in the white house discuss nato he be we all be discuss that we do so through a number of international call this morning as well as ukraine and the attack in doha yesterday i see that she be finally catch up with the question that she should have ask last week about the deputy prime minister in the meantime we have open up a new school base nursery on monday we have the defence industrial strategy and on tuesday we publish nhs league table to push up standard we reopen doncaster sheffield airport yesterday and today we have set out how we be repair the concrete in our hospital 
 a load of waffle and whataboutery all labour members be interested in right now be their pointless deputy leadership election while the country out there be suffer from an economic crisis the prime minister have an ambassador mire in scandal not focus on nato he lose his deputy prime minister just last week for evade taxis he have a new home secretary and a new foreign secretary who be just learn the rope and not able to help with this issue we have strike cripple our capital city and damage our economy he could use the minimum service legislation that the conservatives introduce to make the life of the people out there well but he will not because he do not have the backbone to face down the union the union be run the government all the deputy leadership candidate be chase after they with this government it be more strike more scandal and more chaos be not the link between all this his bad decision his bad judgment and his total weakness 
 our deputy leader contest start this week and end on   october the conservatives leadership contest have be go on for month and will continue for a very long time interruption all this noise from the arsonist while we be put out the fire that they leave behind interest rate and waiting list be down wage investment and deportation be up now we be step up defence spending create new job drive up standard in our nhs and rebuild our crumble school and hospital this be a government of patriot fight for work people 
 this labour government be get our nhs back on its foot there be few patient on waiting list at my local trust since the election but there be still more to do include make it easy to see a gp will the prime minister set out how the government will give my constituent in east worthing and shoreham access to the healthcare that they deserve 
 i be pleased that we have make progress on the nhs we promise extra appointment in the year of a labour government and we have deliver not not but over extra appointment with extra gps we be clear up the dangerous reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete in our hospital the national league table that we publish this week will ensure that investment go where it be need most and our year health plan will see neighbourhood health centre in every community treat patient close to home there be more to do but we have make a lot of progress 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i join the prime minister in send our condolence to his majesty and the royal family on the death of the duchess of kent i also echo the prime minister ’s condemnation of netanyahu ’s attack on qatar those be not the action of a leader truly focus on get hostage home i hope that the prime minister will say that directly to president herzog later today on world suicide prevention day i thank all who be work to prevent suicide from professional to charity like the samaritans 
 when i talk to parent of disabled child there be complaint about government that come up time and again all the hoop that parent must jump through be it deal with ehcp the dwp or hmrc caring be exhausting enough without all the form and the rule that show no understanding of the reality of life as a carer that be something that emily and i know well and something that the former deputy prime minister bring attention to last week will the prime minister work with carer across the house to overhaul system for family carer so that government work much well for people look after their love one 
 i agree with the right hon gentleman there be too many hurdle and too many hoop that have to be go through that be why we be simplify the system and we will of course work across the house with all those who want to achieve that outcome 
 may i also thank those deal with suicide prevention probably everybody in this house know someone who have take their life it touch all of we and we must do everything we can together to prevent suicide 
 move on as the leader of the opposition say lord mandelson have admit to continue his relationship long after epstein be convict and that there be more embarrassing detail that we do not yet know people will be surprise by the prime minister give ambassador mandelson such strong support today will he tell the house whether he have ask the ambassador what other compromising material the trump administration might have on he as he lead britain ’s negotiation with the white house 
 as i have make clear to the house full due process be go through when the appointment be make 
 my constituent connor edwards live with ehlers danlos syndrome and craniocervical instability which in his word mean his head be slowly fall off his body have once enjoy fishing and mountain biking at the age of connor be now largely bed bind and say his condition have destroy his quality of life he be have to crowdfund for treatment in spain because the nhs can not give he the help he need will the prime minister ensure that i connor and eds charity have a meeting with the minister to discuss what more we can do to give thousand of people like connor their freedom back 
 i have read through the detail of connor ’s case which have just be summarise it be heartbreaking i thank my hon friend for consistently campaign and champion all those affect i will make sure that he get the meeting he need so that we can hear from connor and other and learn from their experience

 for the record we have suspend arm that could be use in gaza we have sanction extremist and we have suspend trade talk the point the right hon gentleman raise be a very serious we all want an outcome that ensure that there be peace that the hostage get out that aid get in and that there be a state outcome it be the only way we will get peace in a region that have suffer conflict for a very very long time i will not give up on diplomacy that be the politic of student 
 let ’s talk about fracke it contaminate the water table it cause air pollution and the test drilling in lancashire lead to earthquake will the prime minister stand up to the climate denier will he ban fracke once and for all do he agree that those who be back it be support fracke stupid reform 
 we will ban fracke for good and let we be absolutely clear that the big risk to energy price be stay hooked on volatile international fossil fuel market in stark contrast reform be ignore local community put green job and investment at risk and commit to high bill by warn renewable company not to invest that be shocking

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs to make a statement on the implication of israel ’s strike in qatar for peace and stability in the middle east and for uk foreign policy 
 the uk government be deeply concern by israel ’s strike in doha yesterday as the house hear a few minute ago from the prime minister he and the foreign secretary have condemn these flagrant violation of qatar ’s sovereignty which will set back the cause for peace and risk further escalation in the region the prime minister have speak to the emir of qatar to express the uk ’s solidarity and support and to reaffirm our share commitment to regional stability the prime minister also give his condolence for the death of a qatari security officer kill in the attack sadly qatar ’s ministry of interior have overnight confirm the death of a person 
 qatar be play a critical role in mediate the conflict drive effort to secure a ceasefire and to facilitate vital humanitarian access to gaza that must remain the priority this government continue to support it in its effort to push for an immediate ceasefire the release of all hostage cruelly detain by hamas the protection of civilian and the unrestricted flow of aid into gaza as the vital step towards long term peace and stability that be the only way to achieve last peace and security for palestinians and israelis alike that be why we be work with partner to develop a framework for peace that address governance security humanitarian access and political reform negotiation not more violence be the way to achieve that we be actively work together with our international partner include the g7 and the un security council to co ordinate effort aim at de escalation and to reiterate our full support for the sovereignty of qatar

 thank you mr speaker for grant my application for an urgent question i be grateful to the minister for his statement 
 last night ’s israeli strike against hamas official in qatar herald a new and grave escalation in this terrible conflict prime minister netanyahu ’s willingness to strike doha will undermine effort to secure the release of the hostage still hold in hamas captivity and set back the path to a desperately need ceasefire liberal democrats have call for more diplomatic pressure to be place on hamas by the qataris include the threat to exile   the leadership of hamas from doha unless we see the immediate and unconditional release of the remain hostage that be the kind of diplomatic pressure that must be bring to bear instead the israeli government have choose a path that even president trump netanyahu ’s big cheerleader appear appal by 
 let i be clear liberal democrats support the right of the state of israel to exist and its right to defend itself like all nation but israel have obligation under international law and duty to its ally both of which it have breach can the minister confirm whether any uk entity include the joint command at the al udeid airbase be inform by israel of the attack in advance will he confirm that in addition to what he have already say the prime minister in his meeting with president herzog today will condemn yesterday ’s attack in the strong possible term and make it clear that the uk view it as a flagrant breach of international law 
 last night ’s strike be inseparable from the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in gaza they have far erode our collective hope for an end to the suffering of both gazans and the hostage so it be time for meaningful action by this government will the minister confirm that the uk will take the step necessary today to end the export of f-35 part to israel and in the light of the further egregious breach of international law direct by netanyahu overnight that president netanyahu will be sanction 
 mr speaker as you would expect and as be our usual practice i will not be comment on sanction from the dispatch box the prime minister have set out to this house his intention for his meeting with president herzog later i can confirm that the foreign secretary meet president herzog this morning and raise these point among a range of other include the urgent need both to ensure that aid get into gaza and that there be further israeli support for british effort to medically evacuate injure child and to provide fully fund scholarship to the uk 
 i call dame emily thornberry chair of the select committee 
 what happen overnight illustrate a huge problem that the new foreign secretary will need to deal with i be pleased that the minister will be ably help she the problem be this there be an emboldened far right israeli government who believe that they can do whatever they like and there will be no consequence while on the other hand the country of qatar be genuinely work towards peace i know the minister have meet the qatari minister i have meet they too they could not be more sincere in the effort they be make yet they get bomb for their effort the question for the new foreign secretary be how we can make sure that we be not just bystander but play an active role in deal with this issue how will the prime minister be able to convey such a message to president herzog this afternoon 
 i thank my right hon friend for the question it be vital that at such serious moment that the un security council play its full part so i can confirm to she that the uk be support call for an emergency session of the un security council this evening the foreign secretary will be join call with   her e3 counterpart this afternoon and we will be discuss this matter as my right hon friend would expect with a range of g7 ally include the united states 
 we come now to shadow foreign secretary 
 this be clearly a very very serious moment for the middle east no in this house want to see a spiral of escalation of hostility both israel and qatar be important and value strategic partner for the united kingdom and we value and recognise the extensive effort by the qatari government to secure the release of hostage and work towards secure a ceasefire it be tragic as the minister have highlight that security guard be kill in this attack but there be some fundamental issue here and many of these point have be make from the dispatch box time and again 
 this be a moment for our country britain must contribute and provide the british expertise necessary for conflict resolution and support strong regional initiative include back qatar and the qataris on release the hostage and achieve a ceasefire 
 on top of that of course we must work with our ally in the united states and next week ’s visit from president trump be a crucial moment there can be no more equivocation as this issue continue to afflict the region day after day after day 
 it be also true that we certainly should not be mourn the hamas leader who have be kill hamas have hold innocent hostage in terrorist captivity for over day and they be responsible for the atrocity of   october which also kill british national 
 in recent month israel have be remove terrorist actor across the middle east the leadership of the houthis hezbollah and malign individual in the iranian regime too that mean that our government must play a strong role and stand firm on degrade iran ’s nuclear capability and that malign influence in the region in recognise the sensitivity of the situation in the gulf will the minister confirm what action he and the fcdo will take to stabilise effort to secure the release of the hostage what proactive step be be take to degrade hamas and their capability and of course how we can work constructively with our partner in the region to drive the right outcome include achieve a ceasefire 
 i thank the right hon lady for those important question the british government be fully commit with our gulf and g7 partner to effort to ensure that the current negotiation come to the conclusion that we wish to see those include conclusion in the short term we have long repudiate hamas ’s hostage taking so the hostage need to be release immediately and humanitarian aid must get into gaza as i say in response to   the hon member for bicester and woodstock calum miller there be also other question about governance and security and about the long term prospect for gaza for the west bank and for a state of palestine and a state of israel live side by side we be fully engage in that diplomacy as the right hon lady would expect 
 on the right hon lady ’s wide question about fragility in the region she will be familiar with the decision we have take on snapback i imagine that we will return to discuss iran in great detail at some point in the future as i be conscious that there be development over recess we have trigger snapback and we will continue to return to the house to discuss the threat of iran ’s nuclear programme 
 the long that israel be allow to act like a rogue state bomb sovereign country with impunity and expand its war in the middle east the weak our word look gaza lebanon yemen iran syria tunisian soil and now qatar why be we meet israel ’s president herzog today when his own word and those of netanyahu show a complete disregard for international humanitarian law 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for her work on a whole range of question include current effort to try to ensure the successful evacuation of vulnerable people from gaza it be important that we raise our concern directly to the israeli government both to contribute to the diplomatic process and to try to secure the practical and tangible help require to get people out of gaza the british foreign office on its own can not secure the speedy departure that we wish to see 
 do not the event of yesterday underline the critical need to secure a ceasefire and above all to move into a political process will the minister we be all pleased to see he continue in his role follow the reshuffle commit to building on the important work do by egypt turkey qatar and saudi arabia to effect that peace process all of they have underline the fact that there be no place for hamas in gaza or anywhere else in government follow the event that have take place 
 i be grateful for the kind word from the right hon gentleman and indeed for those i hear from the labour back benches i be continue in my role and look forward to appear before the house in the usual way he be right to emphasise not just the important statement from the uk and our western ally but the important commitment that have be make particularly in july but since then as well by qatar egypt turkey and a range of other state which have a real role to play in mediate the immediate pressure and in try to end up in as he say the more permanent ceasefire that we want to see 
 i thank the minister for outline the strong condemnation of the attack and the blatant disregard for qatar ’s sovereignty i refer the house to my registered interest as i visit qatar last year and speak to ministers there i see how diligently they be work day in and day out to secure the ceasefire and the hostage and to get that urgent aid in do the minister share my view that qatar ’s role in mediate this conflict will be blow into jeopardy by the recent attack and will he ensure that the prime minister continue to condemn this attack when he meet the israeli president later this week 
 my hon friend be quite right qatar have play a vital role in this conflict i work closely with my qatari counterpart and not just on the urgent issue of the middle east but across a whole range of difficult conflict they play a vital role and be commit as the emir of qatar tell the prime minister this morning to continue to play that mediation role i can not see how such strike help qataris perform that role but they be commit none the less to continue it and they have our full support 
 the event of yesterday come as no surprise to those of we in the chamber who have raise the issue of the israeli government ’s crime commit with an air of complete impunity it should now be crystal clear to the minister as it be to so many across the world that the israeli government be not interested in the slight in peace or indeed in the fate of their hostage in that light i have question what military and intelligence assistance will we provide to the qataris to allow they to defend themselves against further attack secondly will the uk add its voice to the grow call across the world for the formation of an international protection force to enter gaza and enforce a peace 
 on the right hon gentleman ’s point we be commit to qatar ’s security and defence we have a close relationship with the qataris on both and we be of course in constant discussion with they about the importance of that collaboration on his point about a protective force and here i will take advantage of the question ask by   the right hon member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell who be secretary of state for international development when i be post in south sudan with a chapter vii un peacekeeping force which at that time have the most far reach mandate to protect civilian we in this chamber can not pretend that un peacekeeping force be able to impose peace where there be none there must be a ceasefire negotiation in juba i see as do the world the horrifying ethnic cleansing that follow the inability of the un mission to protect people we must have a ceasefire it be easy to get distract with other alternative but the truth be that only a ceasefire will protect civilian in gaza 
 give that under article of the un charter any pre emptive strike be normally regard as justify only when a threat be imminent that article 2(4 state that 
 all member shall refrain in their international relation from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state 
 and that article state that 
 measure take by member in the exercise of this right of self defence shall be immediately report to the security council 
 do my hon friend agree that international law and the preservation and strengthening of the rule base system be vital to the people of the region the wide world our ally qatar and the uk will he make it clear to israel that we expect it to obey international law 
 we expect israel alongside all of our ally and indeed every state to abide by international law my hon friend set out the relevant test of   self defence and imminence as i have say the uk be support a motion for an urgent session of the security council this afternoon on this question 
 member have already outline how israel have violate international law by attack qatar will the uk government lie therefore down a motion at the un to condemn the action of israel 
 as i have say the uk be support a motion for a session of the un security council this afternoon if that motion be grant the session be expect to take place this evening our time 
 israel be a rogue state that blatantly disregard international law this bombing be a blatant attempt to scupper peace negotiation plead with israel will do no good so how many more war crime or violation of international law be necessary before the government impose the tough sanction on israel that be need to force it to stop this 
 i think i cover the point about sanction early 
 i be surprised and disappoint that there be no word from the secretary of state in relation to the terrorist attack in jerusalem on monday where terrorist open fire on a bus kill rabbi and woman the reality be that hamas ’s leadership not only condone the attack but praise it do the minister agree that it be essential that we get to the point of have a ceasefire that allow for the release of all the hostage without condition and for hamas to surrender their weapon and agree to demilitarise gaza 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise the attack in jerusalem which i condemn utterly and outright it be barbaric and as he say woman and rabbi be kill the uk have no truck with it and we condemn it outright just as we condemn all such activity by hamas include the taking of hostage the event of   october   and the long litany of terrorist attack that they be responsible for and glorify 
 benjamin netanyahu ’s extrajudicial killing against a sovereign western ally expose his rejection of peace and deliberate escalation of atrocity in a clear violation of international law and diplomacy he have destroy the peace talk and act with impunity the uk government have rightly condemn these action but when will they uphold international law call out the israeli prime minister as a warmonger and perpetrator of genocide end arm sale to israel and impose the severe sanction that his conduct demand 
 the prime minister set out some of what our government have do in relation to the suspension of arm sale and sanction on extremist figure in the israeli government so i will not belabour those point here on peace talk the emir of qatar be clear that the qataris will continue in their mediation role we should not count out peace talk while the qataris rightly continue to try to push they forwards 
 israel ’s bombing of doha be the action of a state that know it can act with complete impunity once again the netanyahu regime have show that international law simply do not apply to it and as long as this government ignore the overwhelming evidence of the genocide in gaza so that they can profit from the sale of weapon to israel that situation will continue will minister tell we unless this be just another example of the performative condemnation that we have see so often from this government what exactly the consequence will be for israel for this egregious attack on qatar 
 i have set out some of the step that we be take in relation to this strike include support an emergency session of the un security council and have discussion with our ally include the e3 which the foreign secretary will undertake shortly i would not wish to be draw far as we discuss this very important incident with our ally i take issue with the hon gentleman ’s characterisation the conflict in gaza be not a question that relate primarily to uk arm we be a tiny supplier of residual arm we have suspend the sale of all of those arm that could be use in gaza there be other state with much full arm relationships—[interruption 
 the figure be 
 the hon gentleman say when in fact he mean of component of the total f-35 supply the truth about the total supply to israel be that it be less than 
 the minister be absolutely right to call for a session at the united nations nobody can think that attack the people try to broker peace be go to lead to a ceasefire but ahead of that this country must have make some assessment of the case for the session and the motion will the minister tell we what assessment his official have make about the civilian casualty and whether this strike be proportionate under the boundary of the law of armed conflict as set out in international law if we go to the un what case will we be make 
 i would not want to be draw on a casualty tally from the uk as i set out in my response qatar have be clear about its own assessment and these thing tend to develop in the immediate aftermath of a strike so i will not be draw on casualty or the number of people strike qatar quite rightly will release that information when it be available my hon friend ask about the international law test against which this strike must be judge those test be self defence and imminence and in any session of the un security council those be the test that we would expect israel to be able to satisfy 
 it be not only on this issue but on many other issue that qatar saudi arabia and other middle east nation have develop a real niche and leadership in mediation and conflict resolution will the minister look at our own conflict resolution unit and its resource and spend and double down on how we be work with the qataris on all their mediation effort 
 the right hon gentleman raise an important question the strength of our relationship with qatar on conflict mediation and our own capability be an important area of work i understand deeply how important that be because i be a negotiator in the foreign office as be our national security adviser i have be due a further discussion with my qatari ministerial counterpart regrettably it have be continually delay by event in the region but we hope to have it soon 
 qatar be an ally and a key negotiator and mediator in gaza ceasefire talk through commit atrocity in gaza illegal settlement in the west bank march into syria and attack lebanon iran yemen and now qatar this israeli government have prove themselves to be a rogue ally to we and a dangerous neighbour at what point do the uk draw a line in the sand and call out this israeli government for what they be a danger to peace in the middle east 
 i thank my hon friend for his long commitment to these issue he have hear my condemnation as well as that of the previous foreign secretary the current foreign secretary and the prime minister of many of the israeli government ’s action in relation to gaza the west bank and elsewhere where we disagree with the israeli government we be clear and forceful in say so 
 give that israel continue to act with impunity what new lever will our government use to take action that be within its power such as restriction on travel and trade air and sea delivery of aid give that land delivery be so appalling and in relation to the f-35 we be breach international humanitarian law can we please stop do so 
 i do not like to get ahead of the court on the question of the f-35 there be extensive legal argumentation in the al haq case which do not find in the way the hon gentleman suggest 
 turn to the question of air and sea access to gaza both method have be try the uk support airdrop alongside our jordanian partner over the summer such be our desperation to get aid into the strip however we can not escape the fact that airdrop be a pinprick at well give the overall scale of need there be an aid operation that work and have a track record which be the united nations operation 
 and sea 
 sea be also try particularly during the late period of president biden but be not find to be an effective mechanism for get aid in where we can get aid in even in small amount we will do so but i can not pretend from this dispatch box that any method other than the land route and un support can reach the scale that be require to meet the need 
 i be pleased to see the minister back at the dispatch box although i be not sure whether he be equally pleased to come back to the chamber once again to answer question about the illegal action of the israeli government we   have a situation in which of our ally have unlawfully attack another of our ally give that we be rightly stand with the qataris be it not time we recognise that because of their action in doha and their continuous starvation and murder of innocent civilian in gaza this right wing israeli government and this extreme right wing israeli prime minister be no long ally of our 
 i thank my hon friend for his kind word about my reappointment i recognise the force of what he have say about israeli politic it be not appropriate for foreign minister to comment on the internal politic of another country but from the sanction i announce from this dispatch box in june the house can see the strength of this government ’s feeling about for example the rhetoric of mr smotrich and that of mr ben gvir it have be deeply dishearten to see that rhetoric repeat over the course of the summer but where we can we demonstrate in the strong possible way the strength of our feeling on these question 
 the event that take place early this week in jerusalem and yesterday prove that the extreme in this conflict have no interest in peace hamas benefit from the violence and the right wing of the israeli government also profit as it seek to expand israel ’s territory and subject the palestinian people i entirely agree with my right hon friend   the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse   and amplify the point that he make 
 follow yesterday ’s event trump and the american administration appear to be as annoyed with israel as the rest of the world be so be it now time to call israel ’s bluff through the united nations be it not time to seek the engagement of blue helmet or some similar force to enable we to say we as an international community have people on the ground do not you dare fire into that area let we now trigger peace talk without that catalyst those extreme will just continue along with the performative merry go round of here we go again condemnation and another statement or urgent question i fear that in or year time there will be rubble in gaza the israeli government will be even more of a rogue government and we will be no far forward 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right about the risk in gaza we have see that rubble grow the british government would support international force go into gaza with the agreement of the party in response to   the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse i speak about my own experience of the limitation on peacekeeping force where there be no peace to enforce we be depressingly clear eyed about the continue intent on both side to continue conduct violence exactly as the right hon gentleman have describe 
 in the past month alone israel have bomb palestine lebanon syria tunisia and yemen yesterday for the time it bomb qatar what be the government ’s legal assessment of the strike on qatar and do they consider they to be a violation of international law 
 we utterly condemn the violation of qatar ’s sovereignty as the house hear from the prime minister this morning as my hon friend   the member for rugby john slinger   set out the international legal test be to do with imminence and self defence there will be a session of the un security council and it will be for israel to demonstrate how its action be consistent with those test 
 today of all day after an illegal attack on peace broker qatar it be shocking to see the uk roll out the red carpet for president herzog who have dehumanise suffer palestinians and incite violence against civilian the minister ’s government be be see to pander to politician who flout international law he rightly call for a ceasefire when will he call what be happen in gaza a genocide 
 president herzog be in the uk on a private visit so i would not characterise the visit as for which the red carpet have be roll out i reiterate that so many colleague on the government benches and i be sure colleague on the opposition benches as well be rightly very conscious of the urgency of help people out of gaza ensure that aid get in and ensure that there be a ceasefire president herzog be the head of state he be not a functional part of the government he be an important conduit for raise those concern this morning among other thing the foreign secretary seek to ensure great support from the israeli government for get child with injury and student out of gaza these be difficult practical matter on which we be focused i understand that some opposition members would perhaps prefer that we do not conduct such talk but the government and i be focus on the practical problem of help people in gaza and the foreign secretary have already raise they with the president this morning 
 this morning on radio an israeli politician fleur hassan nahoum offer no apology for the israeli attack on qatar and could not explain what make israel exempt from international law and able to act with impunity how do the minister justify the genocidal comment of president herzog these individual must be hold accountable what we be see be not diplomacy it be shameful complicity do the minister agree that today ’s meeting with herzog should never have take place 
 i set out the position in relation to president herzog ’s visit just a minute ago i be not familiar with the israeli politician in question but i can say that the uk consider international law to be bind on all state 
 despite the atrocious terrorist attack in jerusalem i have to agree with   the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy   when she say that blow up the enemy ’s negotiator do not exactly suggest an interest in a negotiate solution however i would like clarification on the government ’s position on recognition of a palestinian state on   september the then foreign secretary say that he propose to recognise a palestinian state but that hamas would not benefit from it because they would have to be disarm do that mean that hamas   must be disarm before recognition or will recognition go ahead as seem to be the case whether hamas be disarm or not 
 the prime minister and the foreign secretary then and now have be clear that the prime minister will make a determination in advance of the un general assembly high level week in accordance with the language set out in the statement of july the right hon member make important point about what the previous foreign secretary say about hamas we must remember that hamas be not in favour of state they be in favour of state from the river to the sea and that be not the position of the british government and nor be it should we take the decision outline in july 
 we all want to see peace the hostage return and an end to the man make famine in gaza but this attack on a sovereign nation so closely tie to the peace talk undermine all that it be as awful as it be counterproductive so what can we do to ensure that the pursuit of peace be more than just lip service for the netanyahu government 
 my hon friend have be a persistent advocate on these question and i look forward to continue to answer his question from the dispatch box he should not though be more pessimistic about the prospect of continue mediation and the qataris themselves particularly give that they be very much on the close edge to this issue we will continue to support they in their effort they be vital and for all the reason we have discuss this afternoon the only way through 
 we keep talk about a ceasefire but how can be achieve if side be intent on kill the negotiator from the other attack peace negotiator be simply reprehensible and undermine any possibility of the only thing dialogue that have any chance of bring a resolution to the horror in gaza it be not the action of a state seek peace it be the action of a rogue state operate with impunity completely outside international law cross red line after red line i ask the minister again give that repeat crossing of new red line what action will he match his condemnation with will he stop all arm sale all military co operation all intelligence sharing and all defence deal current and future with israel will he sanction netanyahu and all official complicit in the war crime and genocide in gaza 
 i have set out already in this session our condemnation of the strike the sanction take against extremist figure in the israeli government and the other measure we have take in relation to action that follow from the strike on doha the foreign secretary will shortly be in touch with her e3 colleague and we hope that there will be a security council session this evening 
 i thank the minister for his statement i do pray that day he will come to the dispatch box with good news for we to   be frank in my surgery at oxgangs library on saturday a uk palestinian woman come to see i she bring date cooky which have be freshly make by her mother i have hop to save for you mr speaker but it prove not to be possible she speak passionately and she be really concerned about the visit of the israeli president to the uk i speak about what the government have be do and action that i have support that i believe have save life but with what we have see in qatar i think netanyahu have make a fool of we and i fear that he will continue to make a fool of we be it time to change direction to avoid this happen again to avoid we take a stand demand a ceasefire and netanyahu just laugh at we 
 i be disappointed that my hon friend ’s constituent do not reserve a cookie for i but i be grateful for the important question that she ask for the reason i set out before it be important that we continue to engage directly with the israeli government particularly on question such as the evacuation of vulnerable people from gaza on which israel ’s co operation be essential for any further progress 
 several of our partner in the region in north africa and the middle east have expend a great deal of political capital in try to achieve a rapprochement with israel in recent year the minister will be aware for example of morocco and its work and leadership in achieve the abraham accord what do he think this attack have do to they and what confidence can they have that israel be now truly embark on a quest for peace in the region 
 even in advance of the event yesterday nation in the region that have take the step of sign the abraham accord be signal disquiet most obviously and signally the united arab emirates which release an important statement on this question i will not seek to speak for our arab ally but i be sure that they will be look at the event yesterday with great concern and i be sure that the right hon gentleman will have see the number of statement that have issue from the region over the last hour 
 a man make famine in gaza increase settler violence in the west bank and now this attack on sovereign qatar i fear that these be not the action of an israeli government commit to peace with that in mind will my hon friend urge the foreign secretary to speak to our friend and ally and find out what more we can do to pile concrete pressure on the israeli government to get round the table and seek that ceasefire that we so badly need 
 i thank my hon friend for his commitment to these issue and i can confirm that the foreign secretary be practically as we speak in consultation with friend and ally about what further step we might take 
 i have say this before but so many constituent from yeovil some as young as have tell i that they be so frustrated that britain be not do more will the minister reassure my constituent that the government be do all they can   to make sure that these strike do not break down the peace process completely and that enough aid get into gaza now 
 the hon gentleman ’s young constituent be absolutely right and i can reassure they that we be do everything we can to try to ensure that the mediation continue that progress towards a ceasefire be make and of course that aid get into gaza 
 bless be the peacemaker or so we be tell so it seem particularly wicked that israel can deliberately target the country that be do more to promote peace than any other in the region be the tragedy of the middle east not that the palestinians in gaza and the israelis in israel be govern by deeply unpopular extremist who have no interest in peace on either side after this week ’s appalling murder at a bus stop in jerusalem the israeli government impose collective punishment on the village where those terrorist come from remove hundred of work permit and proceed to start demolish many home do netanyahu ’s decision to bomb qatar not prove beyond doubt that he do not care about the hostage that they be collateral damage as much as any palestinian child and that israel be now a rogue state must not the uk put in place severe sanction against this rogue state to prove our word 
 i be glad to be answer question from my hon friend again as he have be a persistent advocate on these matter there be deep concern about event the attack in jerusalem be horrific as i say to   the hon member for harrow east bob blackman the development in the west bank both over the summer and before be deeply concern and i be grateful to my hon friend for raise they we will continue to keep all measure under review as he would expect we have take far reach action with wave of sanction target in particular on violent settler we will continue to keep such option under review as development proceed 
 let we look at the fact behind israel ’s strike we have a bunch of terrorist who have be sit in the safety of qatar for year organising and financing act of terror include the mass murder of civilian in israel this week and boast about their involvement in it be it not an advance that those people be eliminate and it be make clear to they that they will face the consequence of the terror that they organise be show they that they will be pursue and punish and that they will not win not more likely to drive they to the peace table than to continue their act of terror 
 we have condemn the strike and i do so again it violate qatar ’s sovereignty obviously the question of the fact of the strike will now be contest and as i say early the qatari government be release those fact as they conduct a full investigation regardless of anybody else there be qatari official kill in the strike and it be a violation of qatar ’s sovereignty for that reason alone it be worth condemn 
 what security information be now share with israel be the information collect by the more than royal air force flight over gaza be use to guide the israeli bombardment   of building in gaza city and other place be we still continue security co operation with a country that have bomb almost every neighbouring state over the past year 
 for reason the house will understand i will not give a lengthy commentary on security and intelligence matter but i can confirm to the right hon gentleman that we do not provide any information to aid in target strike in gaza in the way that he describe 
 as a seasoned diplomat do the minister recognise that there be a danger that we be hold israel to a different standard when the americans reach out into pakistan to snuff out osama bin laden the architect of we be take they to the bar when israel reach out with a precision decapitation strike on the leadership of hamas we want to take it to the bar of the international court 
 the hon gentleman do make i feel rather seasoned as i be in pakistan at that time as i say early the test in international law be self defence and imminence not every state agree on the threshold for those test but it be the expectation of the british government with all our partner and ally indeed with every state that they demonstrate how they be comply with international law regardless of who they be 
 i be pleased to have the minister ’s confirmation that despite yesterday ’s egregious action by israel qatar will continue its commitment to pursue the peace that we all long for in the middle east to that end the government have say that they would commit to recognise a state of palestine before the united nations general assembly if israel fail to meet certain condition have israel fail to meet those condition and will the government recognise palestine as a matter of urgency
