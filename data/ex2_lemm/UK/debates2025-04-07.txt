the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to build new town 
 what recent progress she have make on the new town programme 
 our vision for the next generation of new town be set the stage for a house building revolution in the year to come these will be well connect attractive place with all the infrastructure and service need to sustain thriving community include public transport gp surgery and school 
 bracknell be designate a new town year ago in the aftermath of world war and it have be a huge success in part because of the way it be design with leisure facility access to nature and transport link build into the town ’s dna as the government look to build the next generation of new town will my right hon friend commit to learn from the new town that go before 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend there be a lot to admire from the past include in new town such as bracknell we be learn the lesson from the past for our next generation of new town to ensure that they be well connected well design sustainable and attractive place where people want to live and it be important that they have the infrastructure amenity and service that they need to thrive 
 the housing crisis be an issue in not just our city centre but our rural community a new town would be excellent for our area of south norfolk it would help tackle our local housing crisis and ensure that we could deliver affordable housing for local people where they need it 
 i agree with my hon friend that the housing crisis be a challenge across the whole of england the independent new town taskforce be review submission to the call for evidence as it continue its work on recommend location for new town the response to the call for evidence will support the taskforce ’s work of develop its recommendation and the response demonstrate significant enthusiasm across the country 
 our local paper the echo reveal last week that labour lead southend council and lib dem lead rochford council be plan to build a new town of up to house on the border between the i understand that if this be do under the new town fund those number would be in addition to rochford ’s housing target rather than make up part of the target we would be talk about build nearly property by which be totally unsustainable give that our infrastructure be creak as it be can the secretary of state confirm whether those new town house on the rochford side would go towards our meeting the target or be in addition to it 
 we have not select the position for the new town the new town taskforce be still work on those we have be clear that what the new town will deliver will be over and above the target for housing produce through the standard method but this be not of those new town because we have not choose they yet 
 in the new town of sherford which be already be build in my constituency there will be up to new home build over the come year however there be challenge around firstport the delay delivery of a supermarket and other vital local amenity and delay and escalate cost relate to the delivery of a new gp surgery also national grid pylon be be move to make way for further new home at enormous cost to the taxpayer what conversation be the secretary of state have with key provider of national infrastructure include the nhs and national grid to ensure that such obstacle be remove so that these home can be build 
 we be bring forward the planning and infrastructure bill as the hon member know and we have set mandatory target unlike the previous government we believe that infrastructure have to come through this process and we be work across government to ensure that we be already push far on section notice in our work with developer we be tell they that we want the house need the infrastructure and want they to do this properly 
 what step she be take to ensure that new home be sustainable 
 what plan she have to build more sustainable housing 
 the government be commit to ensure that the new home that we will build during this parliament will be high quality well design and sustainable   we intend to amend building regulation later this year as part of the introduction of future standard that will set more ambitious energy efficiency and carbon emission requirement for new home 
 i thank the minister for his response while visit the netherlands with the environmental audit committee i see the benefit of long term join up strategic planning in rotterdam city centre rooftop garden provide mental health benefit and allotment space while at ground level sink community space and underground car park mitigate flooding the tewkesbury garden town will bring new home to my constituency will the minister meet i and stakeholder who support the garden town so that we can set the standard for development across the country 
 the approach of the netherlands not least to spatial planning and design standard have much to commend it but we would need a stand alone debate to do that subject justice as for the tewkesbury garden community they be precisely the kind of sustainable and infrastructure lead development that the government want to see more of and that we be back through legislation and policy i would be more than happy to meet the hon member and local stakeholder to discuss what more might be do to deliver on the aspiration set out in the tewkesbury garden community charter which be publish last year 
 last week i visit howgate close housing development in eakre in my constituency and i be proud to say that the home be the most energy efficient in the country it would be easy to assume that house such as those cost a fortune but what be remarkable about that development be that they be affordable include for some of the most vulnerable in our society do the minister agree that it be vital that energy efficient home be affordable and accessible to everyone and will he come with i to visit eakre to see that incredible development 
 it may not surprise hon member to hear that i be indeed aware of the high thermal mass building that have be construct for rent at howgate close and i commend the site owner dr parsons for champion such high quality sustainable development on his land we need to ensure that all new home be future proof with low carbon heating and very high quality building fabric include those make available for local people at affordable rent i will ensure that my hon friend ’s request for a minister to visit howgate close be give due consideration 
 i genuinely thank the minister for the time he take to meet i and the chairman of a local resident association in an apartment block to discuss the problem of build new home on top of exist apartment block if the work be do badly have he draw any conclusion from that meeting about how to safeguard against unsuitable and unsustainable development of that sort 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question we have a very productive discussion about the issue that he highlight i think he acknowledge   some of the bad outcome that we have see from the previous government ’s expansion of permit development right since we be keep the matter under review and i be more than happy to have another conversation with he as we far consider policy in this area 
 as we build new home it be important that we make sure that exist home be as safe as they can be i recently meet representative of a lead fire safety business in my constituency who tell i of the unacceptably long delay that it face from the building safety regulator will the minister meet i and my local business to discuss those delay and how we can tackle they 
 my hon friend raise an important issue the newly establish building safety regulator be crucial to uphold building safety standard but i acknowledge that its operation be cause delay in handle application for some building project she will be aware that in february the government allocate £ to the bsr to accelerate the processing of application we be work closely with the regulator to support the plan for improved delivery and we will continue to keep its performance under review 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government ’s much laud policy of build new sustainable home have be doom from the start of this parliament and we now have that confirm with the chancellor say last week that only home will be deliver by the end of this parliament but it be bad than that office for budget responsibility figure show that only home will be build in england which be few than the government ’s target and around few than the last conservative government build in the past year will the minister confirm that the goalpost have move and that labour will not meet its target for housing in this country 
 i be very fond of the hon gentleman but i be afraid that characteristically he have get this completely wrong the 1.3—[interruption will   the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake   give i time to answer the obr estimate that our change to the national planning policy framework alone will increase house building to that do not take into account the planning and infrastructure bill and the other change come forward   the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes   be simply wrong we be on course for home in this parliament 
 what step she plan to take to support house building in london 
 what step her department be take to increase the supply of housing 
 our country be in the midst of a housing crisis decade in the making as our plan for change set out the government be commit to the big increase in social and affordable housing in a generation we have already take decisive action to increase the supply of new home with bold reform to the planning system and the launch of the new home accelerator programme which will unblock thousand of home stick in the planning system in the spring statement we announce a £ down payment to deliver up to new social and affordable home and we be invest £ in training for new construction job 
 demand for housing be great in london which be where the economy most need new home build in london mean less pressure on commute infrastructure and house price in place like rural kent but the housing target for london have be cut the government justify that by say that london have 
 the big propose percentage increase against delivery”.—[official report   december vol c. 
 why be the right hon lady reward the london mayor ’s failure to build britain ’s most needed house with low target 
 we be ask london to deliver record level of house building our revised standard method set the housing need for london at nearly home per year the previous government artificially boost target for london use an extra urban uplift that result in a target of nearly home a of the previous national target which could not be justify the london mayor have start build more new council home than at any time since the 1970 he be get on with building home while the tories have fail and be the blocker 
 with around people on housing register in england it be vital that we achieve a step change in the supply of housing particularly social housing over this parliament however in my constituency and across the north west housing association be manage many age low quality home that require ongoing investment and maintenance home for the north warn that many of these property will become uninhabitable and unsuitable for social housing over the next decade what consideration have my right hon friend give to target the renewal of social housing such as through pool funding with money for decarbonisation so that register social landlord can use the money flexibly to combine retrofit demolition and new build that would drive regeneration and reduce carbon emission 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the absolute mess that the previous government leave our housing stock in we will ensure the big increase in social house building in a generation and provide safe warm and decent home by introduce minimum energy efficiency standard and review the decent home standard recent funding include £ for the warm home social housing fund £ in top up to the current affordable home programme and a £ down payment on the future programme which will be use for regeneration project that will result in a net increase in the number of home 
 the housing number for london be cut by by the government but again and again we find in hansard the secretary of state assert that home will be build during this parliament in england why do the chancellor tell we a few day ago that only will be build across the whole of the uk and will the secretary of state please confirm that the target have go 
 the minister for housing and planning answer this question just a moment ago perhaps my mancunian accent will help the obr score the national planning policy framework change that we have already make that be where that figure come from our other plan include the new home accelerator programme the money that we have invest since then and the change in the planning and infrastructure bill mean that the number will increase and we will meet our home target i do not think that i can put it much clear than that 
 there be a real housing crisis in hackney where we spend £ a year on temporary accommodation i visit family most of they work family in tragically overcrowded accommodation we need this social housing as quickly as possible and i know my right hon friend be put her shoulder to the wheel will she visit hackney to see the work that the council have be do to build properly affordable social rent council housing the council could do so much more with more government support 
 we have over child in temporary accommodation as i have say at the dispatch box a couple of time and it be a scandal that we be in this situation that be why the government be make these change we make no apology for change the mandatory housing target to get britain build again because we need those home and those kid deserve well we also need to cut the number of child live in temporary accommodation include b&b we be determined to do that 
 what step her department be take to work with local council to prevent homelessness 
 what step her department be take to support people sleep rough in colder month 
 this government have increase funding for homelessness service by £ to a total of nearly £ for the government have also provide £ of additional emergency winter pressure fund to support people sleep rough during the colder month 
 accord to medium report conservative shadow ministers meet representative of the get living property group which manage thousand of property   in my constituency in the meeting they discuss how to stop the renters rights bill in their word dead in its track after year of promise to ban no fault eviction the tory government fail to deliver now they be collude with the property industry to keep no fault eviction in place will this labour government do the right thing and ban no fault eviction for good 
 the government remain committed to abolish section no fault eviction for both new and exist tenancy as soon as possible we will ensure that the sector have adequate notice of the system take effect and we will work closely with stakeholder to enable a smooth transition 
 i recently take part in an organise sleep out event at doncaster ’s eco power stadium the event be set up by the club doncaster foundation to raise money for project support homeless people such fundraiser and the work do by charity like shelter and doncaster ’s people focused group be vital but it be ultimately up to the government to solve the problem of homelessness can the minister update we on what the government be do to fulfil the need for social housing 
 since take office we have make £ of new funding available to deliver new social and affordable home from we be inject £ to build up to more home by the end of this parliament we will announce additional funding for next year and beyond at the spending review 
 cornwall face a homelessness crisis with family on the housing waiting list follow a meeting last week with the minister for housing and planning i propose an airbnb bill that will require home owner formally to seek planning permission for any change of use of their property there be an easy loophole that allow property owner to avoid pay council tax altogether by pass off a home as a short term holiday let will the minister please confirm that she will give this proposal due consideration and will she visit cornwall to discuss this far 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point our priority be to make sure that we tackle the root cause of the housing shortage and homelessness that be why we be build home and investing record amount in housing and tackle homelessness include £ for the next year 
 since the homelessness reduction act be pass local authority have prevent people from become homeless however there be still evidence of local authority refuse to plan to prevent people become homeless will the minister take up the private member ’s bill that i champion the other week and that be give an unopposed reading so that we put pressure on the people who should provide the housing and no in this country be force to sleep rough 
 the hon gentleman have do a great deal of cross party work in support of housing we have a consultation in place i be pleased to say that i have   meet he on a couple of occasion and he will be aware that we be work hard and at pace to tackle the underlying challenge there be child in temporary accommodation and rough sleeping have go up by since we be determined to take action to deal with the challenge but that will require concerted work the deputy prime minister be lead the interdepartmental taskforce on homelessness i look forward to continue to work with   the hon member for harrow east bob blackman 
 i call the shadow minister 
 quite rightly the government say in their manifesto that they want to reduce homelessness and rough sleeping but instead there have be a increase in rough sleeping at its high in london but rapidly climb in other part of england such as by in derbyshire homeless link state that the budget remove £ to £ from the sector due to national insurance increase and have call for a reset on homelessness funding where be the minister ’s long term plan for reduce homelessness will she commit to see a fall in homelessness in the next year 
 the shadow minister should be aware of the record of his government a record increase in rough sleeping since it go up by the previous labour government cut rough sleeping by third we have put in an additional £ take the total to £ we have provide additional funding of £ to tackle winter pressure the hon gentleman should look at the record of his government and face up to the fact that over year the conservative party preside over record increase we be determined to tackle that which be what we be do through our cross cutting work across government 
 what plan she have to improve security and standard in the social rent sector 
 the government be take concert step to drive a transformational and lasting change in the safety and quality of social housing include introduce awaab ’s law and consult on the new decent home and minimum energy efficiency standard the majority of social housing tenant already have security of tenure and our renters rights bill will abolish section eviction where those be use by housing association 
 i have be work with group of resident who live in building run by the same social housing provider in my constituency many resident have come to i have be leave live in horrendous condition with leak roof damp and mould and unfinished and unremediated work follow my intervention the housing provider have agree to a multimillion pound upgrade in of the building to hire extra staff and to communicate well with resident that be great news but it should not have have to get to this point what more can be do to ensure that resident such as my constituent be not leave wait year for repair and that social housing provider be meet their obligation 
 i very much agree with my hon friend that her intervention should not have be require to force the provider in question to take action in addition to the forthcoming reform that i refer to in my previous answer she will know that all register provider of social housing be require to deliver the outcome of the regulatory standard set by the independent regulator of social housing the regulator work intensively with provider that be not deliver those outcome and have a series of power at its disposal when it identify serious failing i be more than happy to discuss far with my hon friend how she might seek redress for her resident 
 my interest be in the register mr speaker in what precise way be the minister intend to improve the decent home standard 
 we have be very clear that we be go to consult on a new decent home standard that apply to both the social rented and private rented sector and i would welcome the right hon member ’s engagement when that consultation be publish 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 despite the announcement refer to early the building safety regulator be now advise applicant to plan for week to clear gateway that be hold up a disproportionate number of social home include in the constituency of my right hon friend   the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey and it be much long than be require for planning permission what step will the government take to reduce the wait back down to week as it be 
 like my hon friend   the member for bournemouth west jessica toale the hon gentleman raise an important issue the newly establish building safety regulator be crucial to uphold building safety standard but we acknowledge that it be cause delay in handle application particularly for high rise building project on gateway and there be gateway after that the funding we have announce will make a difference but as i have say we be work with the regulator to support its plan for improved delivery include increase caseworker capacity and guidance to the sector we will continue to keep its performance under close review 
 whether she plan to include more local people in discussion on development in their area 
 what her policy be on the future role of plan committee in the planning process 
 local plan be the good way for community to shape decision about how to deliver the housing and wide development that their area need we want more people to be involve in the development of those local plan and a key objective of our digital planning reform be   increase public engagement with they measure in the planning and infrastructure bill will ensure planning committee play their proper role in scrutinise development without obstruct it while maximise the use of experienced professional planner 
 across my constituency local people be hugely frustrated at labour run bradford council inundate our community with hundred of new house while not invest in local service and road despite protest and valid concern the council have steamroller through development at every stage yet when vast number of local people in silsden support the development of a new farm shop on the periphery of the town exactly the kind of new service that would promote local growth and deliver the new sustainable housing we need bradford council block the proposal how will the minister ensure that local council listen to local people and be not dictate development plan to they 
 i appreciate that the hon gentleman need to make a political point to get his clip but i be glad that we have labour council across the country that back development of course resident should have their say but it be the role and responsibility of local authority to make decision about material consideration in planning application and i have no reason to think that the local authority in question have do anything other than that 
 when i be leader of south gloucestershire council in partnership with labour we restore the right of local people to speak at planning committee site visit give people back their voice in the affected community however clause of the planning and infrastructure bill would enable the secretary of state to bypass planning committee altogether if the minister truly want to get britain building will he think again and give community a real stake in local planning decision 
 as i have make clear we want more people involve in the development of local plan there be nothing in the planning and infrastructure bill that will prevent they from object to individual application the measure simply ensure that the process of determine application at a local level be more streamlined and efficient as i make clear in close the bill ’s reading on   march the government intend formally to consult on proposal relate to the delegation of planning decision in england so the hon lady and other hon member will be able to engage with the detail alongside the bill ’s passage 
 the number of people need a social home in luton have go up from last year to this year so i welcome the government ’s plan for new home while we be cry out for house in luton just over the border with central bedfordshire development be take place right on our border but without people in luton get a look in what can the minister do to ensure that local authority co operate with each other to deliver the home that we need 
 we be take measure to address precisely the problem that my hon friend outline proposal in the planning and infrastructure bill will make spatial development strategy mandatory at sub regional level so neighbouring local authority have to co operate effectively on housing delivery and infrastructure provision across boundary in just the way she set out which will address the challenge she outline 
 dunfermline be scotland ’s new city and as such a large number of home be be build all the time however too often those large scale housing development be do without reference to local service such as gps and without proper consultation with local people partly due to failure in the scottish snp government ’s planning policy what advice do the minister have about how those issue might be overcome will he engage with the scottish government to ensure they be learn any lesson from the excellent change be make in that part of the uk 
 housing be a devolved matter but i be always keen to convey to colleague in the scottish government precisely the benefit of the proposal we be take forward when it come to plan reform and renew drive for house building 
 what step her department be take to provide safe accommodation for victim of domestic abuse 
 local authority in england must ensure that support be available in safe accommodation for domestic abuse victim who need it my department have allocate £ for a £ uplift from the previous year that funding be for local authority to commission lifesave support for victim in safe accommodation 
 of my constituent be a victim of domestic abuse and on a priority list she be serve a section notice by her landlord and deny band a housing by the council because in order to keep custody of her child she have sign a police protection order state that she be not at risk of domestic violence she be force to choose between her child and a safe home what be my hon friend do to ensure that council properly prioritise domestic abuse victim so that no face such an impossible choice 
 i be so sorry to hear about the difficulty that my hon friend ’s constituent have face that be horrific he will be aware that the government be focus on tackle violence against woman work across departments and be lead by the home secretary and the deputy prime minister local authority be strongly encourage through statutory guidance to give priority for social housing to victim of domestic abuse and their family particularly if they be homeless and require urgent rehousing we be also take action to exempt victim of domestic abuse from local connection test where they apply to ensure that there be no barrier to victim access social housing 
 over the weekend i deal with a case in which a homeless pregnant woman who be a victim of domestic abuse be kick out of her temporary accommodation by kirklees council for no real reason and leave on the street will the minister explain or share with this house what step will be take to prevent council from turf out pregnant woman who be victim of domestic abuse on to the street 
 i would be grateful if the hon member could write to i about that specific case i will follow up with he 
 i recently visit the glass door night shelter in my constituency to hear more about the work it be do to alleviate homelessness of the thing it tell i be that many of the woman who visit the shelter be flee domestic abuse we all know the challenge if somebody be homeless it be almost impossible to get a job let alone to find somewhere safe and decent to live the minister have highlight the investment can she set out a little more about the money be invest in service not only to support but to protect woman flee domestic abuse 
 my hon friend will be aware that the deputy prime minister be chair an interdepartmental taskforce on homelessness and rough sleeping a key part of our work be ensure that we support victim of domestic abuse and violence as i state we have already allocate funding to local authority and we will continue to work across government to tackle the root cause of homelessness as well as violence against woman 
 victim of domestic violence urgently need safe and stable accommodation however council have no obligation to offer like for like housing too often the duty be discharge by suggest private rental which be frequently unaffordable or unsuitable for those on low income that create a significant barrier for many victim it even place they in a situation where they choose not to leave because they can not have the housing that they need will the minister far explain how she be take step to ensure that victim be offer genuinely safe appropriate and affordable housing will she consider strengthen the statutory duty on council to well support those flee domestic abuse 
 the hon member will be aware that there be a massive housing shortage and that there be challenge around support housing we need to ensure as we be do that victim of domestic violence get the support they need which be why we provide the additional uplift of £ to a total of £ we be work across government to tackle the root cause of violence against woman within which work economic and housing support be crucial i look forward to work with she and other on this very important agenda 
 what step she be take to ensure that town centre can support grow community 
 we all want to see our town centre thrive through our plan for neighbourhood the government be invest £ in the future of town and community the government have also commit to strengthen the developer contribution system to ensure that new development provide the necessary infrastructure to address vacancy in town centre we have give council the power to force the auction of empty shop 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests burgess hill be fast grow and the lib dem run council be work hard with homes england to deliver new home hundred of which will be affordable however after year of conservative failure my constituent be worried that housing growth will go hand in hand with the hollowing out of the town centre my lib dem colleague want to deliver a buoyant town centre through a public private partnership so will the minister visit burgess hill to see the innovative approach we be take to make it thrive again 
 i be grateful for that question and for the spirit in which burgess hill be take on the need to build housing in its community we believe that sustainable housing with complementary infrastructure will drive the local economy it will drive footfall to town centre and help bring private investment to high street clearly something interesting be happen in burgess hill and i would very much like to visit 
 in sandwell we have almost people on the housing waiting list we desperately need more affordable and social home we also have a town centre in west brom that be busy during the day but very quiet at night with no night economy whatsoever both of those challenge could be address through development of residential property in the town centre we have a few place earmark for development but that have completely stall so can the minister say what more he can do to help west brom to get build and build the home that people need 
 my hon friend be exactly right those challenge can be take on together create opportunity for people to live in local community bring footfall and reduce crime which be both excellent thing she have hear what my hon friend the minister for housing and planning have say about our support for house building we stand ready to support her community to make sure they can build house in their town centre 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the opposition broadly support the government ’s proposal in the plan for neighbourhood which carry on the excellent work start under the previous government however how will the proposal to diversify the base of consultee to prioritise the voice of trade union which by definition be find mainly in large   public sector and corporate organisation not drown out the voice of the small business on which our town centre depend 
 i be grateful for the opportunity to remind the house and the hon gentleman and his front bench colleague that they of course want the predecessor programme to the plan for neighbourhood but do not provide any money for it that be a slight oversight which we have be able to address in order to keep the promise that they make but would have have to break on the point about trade union board i can understand why opposition colleague do not want the voice of million of ordinary people in the room when decision be make they never do and they never will however trade union be not in competition with small business far from it there be room for both in the discussion and both will add lot to those discussion 
 what recent progress her department have make on support growth in local area 
 we be give local leader the tool they need to deliver growth for their area by devolve power and money from central government to local community we be invest in programme that drive growth and we will set out our refresh vision for local growth funding at the multi year spending review 
 local high street such as those in hertford and stortford be the beat heart of our community and they power economic growth i welcome the fact that the government be already work with local authority to implement high street rental auction power to breathe life back into high street and ensure that vacant shop be occupy will the minister set out in further detail how this will help to drive up occupancy rate on our high street and drive growth in hertford and stortford 
 high street rental auction be a great tool for enable hertford and stortford and the rest of the country to take on persistent vacancy we already have trailblazer that be move forward at great pace to implement those auction but the power and the extra resource we have provide be available for all council and we ask they to come forward to designate those town centre and high street and to start those auction 
 i be delighted to see recently that lancashire county council and fylde borough council have commit more fund to the st annes pier link project and be also look at the island site which be critical for drive growth in the town centre to get that development off the ground what fund or grant be now available from the government for that kind of project for which fylde council can apply so that it can really catalyse growth on the island site in st annes 
 we be change the way in which local growth be do in this country exactly for that reason the previous government want to subject community to beauty parade for short term funding accord to criterion decide by they our funding plan which will come forward at the spending review will be long term allocative and base on what the hon gentleman ’s community want rather than what ministers want 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i agree with the minister that the government have change how growth be happen in local government because apart from the massive growth in the number of people rough sleeping and the massive growth in pile of rubbish uncollecte in birmingham there be little evidence of economic growth at the local level do the minister acknowledge that when we compare band d equivalent conservative council consistently charge much low council tax than labour or lib dem one the good way for our constituent to ensure local growth be to vote conservative at the council election 
 i have be there it be horrible in opposition it get to the point where a couple of hour before oral someone tell you that have to ask the clip question on council tax all i will say to the hon gentleman be that i know that the people of our country be smart enough to decide which of we they would rather 
 what step she be take to ensure that property management company be adequately regulate 
 what step her department plan to take to limit excessive service charge impose on leasehold property 
 the government recognise the considerable financial strain that rise service charge be place on leaseholder that be why we intend to consult on the leasehold and freehold reform act ’s provision on service charge and bring they into force as quickly as possible thereafter this year we will also consult on strengthen the regulation of manage agent include as a minimum introduce mandatory professional qualification to set a new basic standard that manage agent will be require to meet 
 on friday i meet with jacqui gary and simon in fairwater drive in my spelthorne constituency jacqui ’s service charge be go up from £ a year to £ i sit down and have a look at the bill and they be without any itemisation so it be impossible to know where to start with the property manager the minister write in response to a recent write question 
 we will set out our full position on regulation of estate let and manage agent in due course 
 can he give some reassurance to jacqui gary and simon that their interest will not be put on to the back burner and suggest when in due course might be 
 i be sorry to hear about the experience of jacqui gary and simon as i say the government be fully commit to protect leaseholder from abuse and poor service at the hand of unscrupulous manage agent despite commit to regulate the property agent sector in the hon gentleman will know that the previous government fail to do so this government will act we be look again at the recommendation of the report commission from lord best which be not act upon by the previous government over many year as i have make clear we intend to consult on the regulation of manage agent this year 
 many leaseholder in southampton itchen who be still wait for fire remediation work to be do be now be clobber by extortionate service charge in case a constituent go from pay £ a year to £ a year with next to no clarity that that money be be spend well despite my recent meeting with developer and management company i be yet to be convince that there be any end in sight for my constituent what conversation be the government have with management company that be let service charge spiral out of control 
 i recognise as i say the challenge experience by leaseholder when it come to insurance the minister for building safety recently meet the industry to discuss how we can bring premium down when it come to service charge i assure my hon friend the member for southampton itchen that we understand not least because i have significant number of such case in my constituency the considerable and in some case intolerable financial strain be place on leaseholder as a result of opaque and unaffordable service charge we be commit to empower leaseholder to challenge unreasonable service charge increase and my hon friend will not have to wait long for we to take action to that end 
 what discussion she have have with the chancellor of the exchequer and the secretary of state for education on the potential implication for her policy of council become insolvent due to inadequate funding for send education 
 the government recognise the impact that spend on special educational need and disability be have on council finance a £ increase to send and alternative provision be announce for in the autumn statement the government intend to set out plan for reform the send system in further detail this year that will include detail on how the government will support local authority to deal with their historical and accrue dedicated school grant deficit 
 next march when local authority can no long exclude the high need element from their balance sheet half of they will go bankrupt as it now stand for the east riding it be estimate that this year ’s education budget be £ in deficit that be largely because of increase high need spend on   pupil with special education need can the minister give i an undertaking that we will not next year find ourselves either crush the need of special need child or those of other need in society 
 we need to repair the system of send provision and deal with its impact on local authority the system be not sustainable in its current form and we must reform it from the ground upwards secondly deficit have be accruing and be still accrue and that be a big issue we certainly do not intend council to be the victim of a system over which they have have no control and we will work with they in our endeavour to prevent that 
 as a send parent my view of my child ’s need be holistic i do not believe that they simply stop where the responsibility of a local authority lie what step be the minister take to ensure that our send policy reflect such need and the responsibility of for instance the department of health and social care the treasury and the department for education as well as local authority 
 as my hon friend say this issue require a whole of government approach when government work in silo it be those who need support the most who fall through the gap in the end this government do work across department include our own and the department for education to ensure that we have a single plan ultimately of course we have to deal with the financial impact on council but it be the young people go through the system who really matter 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests which state that i be a trade union member 
 let i update the house on the waste dispute in birmingham our priority be tackle the misery and disruption cause to resident the government have consistently urge the council and unite to sit down and resolve the dispute it be welcome that they meet yesterday and that further talk be take place today but we continue to press all party to negotiate that urgently need resolution 
 it be essential to protect public health by tackle the backlog of waste and my department be in close contact with the council this weekend i meet the council leader and the manage director and we be provide ongoing support to address the public health emergency collection take place over the weekend and will continue this week to clear the backlog and protect public health the government continue to support birmingham ’s recovery

 in my constituency the finnish company metsä tissue want to invest hundred of million to build a state of the art tissue manufacturing plant the investment will provide direct job thousand of other job and £ a year for the local economy but although the site be a freeport the investment be hamper by monumental cost of £ to make it ready although the same process on an equivalent site in sweden will cost £ what be the government do to correct this problem 
 we have be do a lot to try to ensure that under this government taxpayer get value for money from the fair and reasonable amount that we can invest to make land ready for development as the right hon member say we have the freeport some of they a legacy from the previous government but we want to see infrastructure build which be why we be bring forward the planning and infrastructure bill we have commit ourselves to new major infrastructure project so hopefully we will kick start the economy in a way that his government be unable to 
 i be delighted recently to see civic and business leader in southampton join the labour council in launch their renaissance vision set out an ambitious agenda for regeneration and house building in the city what step will the government take in the upcoming spending review to support and enable house building vision such as this 
 i do not begrudge my hon friend his attempt but he will have to wait for the spending review outcome to receive an answer to his question 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the effect of the birmingham bin strike have be declare a major incident they be a national embarrassment and with ° temperature forecast for later this week they will become a public health emergency while labour members in birmingham be busy campaign for an airport in pakistan the secretary of state be unwilling to visit the city or take on unite be that because of the ten of million of pound that her party receive from unite or indeed because of the £ that she receive for her own election campaign 
 i think the shadow secretary of state be well than that but heigh ho 
 this be a local dispute and it be right that the negotiation be lead locally we have make it clear that both party should get round the table and i be pleased that that happen on sunday and talk continue today birmingham city council do declare a major incident last week we expect the rubbish to be clear we expect the party to get round the negotiate table and we expect this to be sort out 
 the right hon lady still have not explain why she have not visit the city to look at this issue at hand 
 the right hon lady ’s manifesto set out the issue of preserve the green belt in this very house she say that she would transform grey belt land such as wasteland or old car park but also that she would protect the green belt in its report accompany the spring statement last week the office for budget responsibility state that most of the additional home deliver up to accord to she will be build on the green belt be it not the case that she have con the public with her grey belt policy and that she have unintentionally mislead this house 
 i think the hon member be go to do well but he do not the minister for local government be in birmingham on thursday and i be always happy to visit birmingham it be a great city and have always be a fantastic place and i have probably be there more time than the hon member have under the tories the number of home approve on green belt land increase nearly tenfold since so i will not take any lecture we have say that we will develop on brownfield site and we be take action to make sure that we deliver the home and infrastructure that people need he could learn a lot from i 
 at the end of january people be still on northumberland county council ’s social housing waiting list yet hundred of property right across the county include in rural allendale remain empty give the number of people on the housing list and in desperate need of accommodation it be a disgrace that the conservative administration have leave they empty for so long do the minister agree that a labour council back by a labour government will do much more to get people off the housing list and into home 
 local authority already have a range of power to bring empty home back into use but i be more than happy to meet my hon friend to discuss this specific issue in more detail 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 last month i be in a field near the east carr estate in hull with the river humber in the distance the field lie submerge under water and sit clearly below sea level resident tell i that the field act as a barrier between their home and the water and they be really worried that the plan development which be in the hull local plan will leave they with flooded home can the minister reassure i and resident in hull and other low lie community that the government will ensure that the land use framework for determine area for development will consider flood risk management and the delivery of sustainable drainage system 
 we take action on suds in the national policy planning framework and we have make very welcome improvement in that area the department for environment food and rural affairs have launch a consultation on the land use framework i take it that the hon lady have submit her view and we will publish the response to that consultation in due course

 all of we understand how difficult thing be in birmingham and it be the government ’s job to support birmingham to recover and get service back to normal there be strand regularise the negotiation with the trade union to find a long term solution deal with routine collection and get more truck out of the depot and deal with the clean up of waste that have accumulate on the street we be support the council in do that on the question of mutual aid any mutual aid that be provide by local authority will be reimburse 
 with the recent announcement that goodman have buy luton ’s vauxhall van plant site for redevelopment do the minister agree that local government have a key role to play in local business and regeneration plan to help drive economic growth 
 yes economic growth be this government ’s no mission as i have say multiple time at the dispatch box that be an inside job and it take great local leadership that be why we have make a commitment to the devolution of power and resource from this place to such community by create new devolved institution and back our exist one 
 devolution go alongside revolution in local government in essex where we be expect numerous unitary authority to be create however local people be concerned that they will not get a say in the structure of those local authority so can the minister tell i whether they will there be also concern about local election be delay by multiple year can the minister also tell i whether year after year basildon council will not be hold accountable for the decision it take 
 i pay tribute to local leader in essex and other place for the leadership they have show to make sure that there be sustainable and accountable local government at the end of the devolution and reorganisation process the right hon member have our absolute commitment that we will work through those issue with local leader as for the election question election have be postpone for a year and it be our intention that routine election will take place as plan

 i thank my hon friend for all he do to support private renter in his constituency i be sadden but in all honesty not shock by the case he raise such experience be still far too common in both the social sector and the private rented sector in particular we know the health risk pose by damp   and mould that be reason we have choose to sequence the implementation of awaab ’s law in the way we have as it will allow we to apply the protection to damp and mould early than would otherwise have be the case 
 in my constituency of exmouth and exeter east the lib dem local council be propose to build ten of thousand of new home with little thought for correspond infrastructure i have speak to local councillor and they believe they have no agency in this process and central government be tell they what to do what more can be do to ensure that local authority be hold accountable for their decision 
 local elector can hold local authority accountable for all of the decision they make on infrastructure i refer the hon member to my previous answer however local authority should as part of the local plan development process have infrastructure strategy in place that set out the requirement for infrastructure and how they should be fund 
 next month mark year since victory in europe and i look forward to attend many ve day event in my constituency to thank our service personnel of yesteryear homelessness be an issue that affect many veteran so while i welcome the prime minister ’s pledge to guarantee a roof over the head of every veteran can the minister confirm what extra support there be with homelessness for the veteran community in banbury 
 homeless veteran in banbury will be able to benefit from extra support thank to a £ increase in funding for homelessness service in cherwell and west oxfordshire in veteran in banbury can also access housing support through op fortitude this nationwide system provide housing guidance and assistance to veteran who be experience homelessness or at risk of homelessness 
 in the london borough of richmond we desperately need more social home but we be really short of site we can build on i have long run a campaign for the disused teddington police station to be turn into a gp surgery and social home but understandably the met want top dollar to fund its service will the secretary of state look at way to incentivise public body to sell asset below market value for community benefit 
 the hon member will forgive i but i be not go to comment on the specific of the case she raise we be give serious consideration to how we well utilise public land in general particularly in area with constrain land allocation such as her own 
 more than half my constituency casework consist of substandard repair poor quality communication from social landlord and damp and mould that be why this week i be launch a new safe and healthy home campaign in kensington and bayswater will the minister outline how the government will work with council and housing   association ahead of change in the law and policy framework such as awaab ’s law to improve standard for social tenant include in my constituency 
 we be work closely with the sector and talk through how we can well implement reform such as awaab ’s law and our intend overhaul of the decent home standard as i say in a previous question all resident provider of social housing be require to deliver the outcome of regulatory standard that be set by the independent regulator the independent regulator have power at its disposal to identify when serious failing be take place 
 this morning firefighter in birmingham make it plain that they will stand in solidarity with the bin striker in birmingham and not collect the rubbish we know that there be only worker which mean this be a drop in the ocean financially give that the government have say they will do all they can to bring the strike to an end will the deputy prime minister confirm that they will force the council to make the payment and that they will deploy the army to assist the local charity and organisation that be help to clear up and need extra support 
 the hon gentleman do very well to go from to pretty quickly on the issue but let we step back from the immediacy of it clearly   we want all party to be in the room negotiate the underlying pay term and condition dispute that be at play to be absolutely clear there have to be a red line this can not stray into potentially compromise the equal pay settlement that have be agree so that that all begin to unravel bear in mind that that have already cost the local authority £ we support they and we want people in the room the deal have to be a sustainable that will hold 
 for the final question i call alice macdonald 
 as the minister will be aware nutrient neutrality have have a big impact on norfolk hold up many home and planning application the launch of the norfolk nutrient mitigation fund have help to make a difference but we need more environmental solution will the minister update we on what else we will be do to address nutrient neutrality so that good home and growth can be unlocked in our local area 
 we be support a range of target intervention to deal with constraint such as nutrient neutrality in the long term the measure in the planning and infrastructure bill that introduce the nature restoration fund will allow we to provide a win win for both development and nature deal with constraint such as nutrient neutrality and unlock the development of new home 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade what action the government be take to prevent the closure of scunthorpe ’s steelwork 
 i appear before this house on   march just moment after british steel ’s devastating announcement of early asset closure at scunthorpe and its commercial decision to consult on large scale redundancy the course of action choose by british steel ’s owner be deeply disappointing and our thought remain with british steel worker and their family at this very concern time government ’s contingency plan have kick in and team from the departments for work and pensions and for education be there to provide support and advice to affected worker we will ensure that support be in place for as long as possible 
 look ahead i can assure this house that early blast furnace closure at scunthorpe be far from a do deal we have be clear that the good way forward be for british steel to continue as a commercially run business with private investment and government act in support which be why we make the company a generous offer of public funding on   march as member be aware british steel ’s owner do not accept our offer or the necessary condition attach which be design to protect worker safeguard taxpayer money and deliver a sustainable company at the core of the future of british steelmaking 
 however that be not the end of the matter the business and trade secretary and i meet jingye the owner of british steel on friday and there be plan to meet again this week the government remain resolute in our desire to secure a long term future for the scunthorpe steelwork retain steel production and put an end to the year of uncertainty and i can assure the house that no option be off the table to achieve that we will continue to work tirelessly across government and with british steel ’s owner to find a well outcome 
 i can not go into further detail at this stage it would be damaging to british steel ’s worker and their family the company and its supply chain for i to speculate on how event might unfold in the come day and week while a live negotiation be under way and policy be be develop at pace however member should be in no doubt that there be a bright future for steelmaking in the uk under this government and we believe that british steel and its superb workforce at scunthorpe have an integral role to play in it 
 i thank the minister for her comment while it be welcome that work be be do through dwp and so on to support potential redundant worker the reality be that jingye be not involve in meaningful negotiation the government have be critical of it in previous response to my question it be very obvious that jingye have cancel the raw material order that be essential to keep the furnace go those order be due in mid may when i be at the steelwork on friday i be tell that unless another order for iron ore pellet could be place this week it would be too late 
 the minister be somewhat reluctant to go down the nationalisation route when i raise the matter a couple of week ago however the majority opinion in the area and among lead politician be that nationalisation on a temporary basis be the only solution to keep the furnace burn come the middle of next month can the minister therefore confirm that it be something the government be actively consider it would provide an opportunity to rebuild the industry hopefully secure new private sector involvement and convince the customer most notably network rail which get of its rail track from the scunthorpe work that supply will continue 
 i have come round to the view that nationalisation on a temporary basis be in this instance the only way it will secure the job and secure a future for steel production in scunthorpe i urge the minister not to rule it out and indeed to commit to it 
 i thank the hon gentleman for secure this urgent question and for his comment i know we will continue to talk and have honest conversation 
 jingye be very much talk to we as i say i meet jingye with the secretary of state and other on friday and we hope to do so again this week 
 our priority be respect the worker safeguard job and retain steelmaking we have be clear in our belief that the good way forward be for scunthorpe and british steel to continue as a commercially run business with private investment and with the government act in support but i can tell the hon gentleman that no option be off the table 
 i be concerned to read about the cancellation of shipment of essential coking coal and so on for scunthorpe the business and trade committee hear from british steel and tata about some of their need the minister will be aware that an area where we have fail as a country over the last year or so be not have an industrial strategy so i make clear to she once more the absolute urgency for we to establish a steel plan to set out the uk ’s need and ensure that we have resilience across our industry and for our economy 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and we talk about exactly that at the business and trade committee this country have see a significant decline in steel manufacturing over the last decade and we want to turn that around long before we get into government we commit to a plan for steel which represent a £ investment in uk steelmaking as we speak there be a roundtable at jcb in stafford on the plan for steel on this occasion discuss trade barrier i be due to be chair but come back to be in the chamber we have be have a series of roundtable to gather evidence and pull the fact and figure together so that we can put the right investment in place 
 i call the shadow secretary of state for housing communities and local government 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers   and rob waltham our excellent candidate for mayor of greater lincolnshire for their engagement and work on this issue 
 despite repeatedly promise to protect and support virgin steelmaking capacity when in opposition the labour party be potentially preside over its total demise in the process thousand of blue collar job in this once proud industry have either go forever or be at risk include directly employ role at port talbot and scunthorpe alone and many more in the supply chain 
 give that the region with the high number of steelworker be wales and yorkshire and the humber the situation be deal a hammer blow to effort to address regional inequality steel be obviously a key strategic industry even more so give our need to increase defence spending and infrastructure investment and even more so again give president trump ’s game change imposition of tariff 
 the prime minister keep say that the world have change and that we be witness the end of globalisation i can not say that i totally agree but if that be the government ’s position surely they have no choice but to intervene to support domestic production the alternative could see we lock out of reliable consistently price source of steel the government have step in to help car manufacturing in recent day so will the minister now redouble her effort to reach a deal with british steel 
 steel production be just of the industry close due to our high energy price which be high than our competitor in france and germany and high than in the usa other manufacturer such as cf fertilisers on teesside and ineos at grangemouth have close their door or be in the process of do so will the minister press with the chancellor the case for permanently low industrial energy price 
 the minister mention support for steelworker how many steelworker have the government engage with what support have be give to account for the knock on effect to community what assessment have the minister make of the effect this situation will have on national security she mention a bright future for steelmaking in this country will she confirm that that mean primary steelmaking capability 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his contribution and for welcome the prime minister ’s announcement today on the emission vehicle mandate and the change we have make to support the automotive industry which be incredibly important 
 the hon gentleman talk about the number of good steel job that have go forever or be at risk but that happen because the previous government fail to intervene to support our steel industry that be why we lose so many job over the last decade not have an industrial strategy or a plan for steel mean that we allow offshoring of our job in the steel sector which have damage we he rightly say that in many key part of our country we need good job i should say that steel produce really good job which be well pay than the average in the area and be do by really good qualified people we want to retain in the uk 
 the hon gentleman talk about energy again the reason why we be here be that we have year of the previous government not intervene in this space we be well aware of energy price in this country and be do all we can to bring those down interruption 
 i be ask by the hon gentleman to redouble my effort in the negotiation we be have with british steel i will do everything that i possibly can as we be do i hope he understand that i can not go into detail about the state of those negotiation because that would be bad for the worker bad for our supply chain and bad for the outcome 
 the hon gentleman talk about national security and primary steel we be conduct a review of primary steel as part of our plan for steel and we will have the result of that soon we will look at those result and see what we need to do i should stress that there be defence equipment make in the uk from electric arc furnace there be not much defence work either in british steel or at tata in port talbot at the moment people such as sheffield forgemasters produce steel from electric arc furnace however the hon gentleman be right to talk about the importance of national security and to say that the world have change and thing have move on so we need to ensure that we be protect our country as we need to 
 as i say in the chamber in response to the last urgent question on this issue there be a reason why putin bomb the blast furnace in ukraine pretty much it be because a country want to have that steelmaking capacity we be alive to those issue and that be why nothing be off the table we be do everything that we can 
 you ’re not 
 it be a shame that the conservative members who be heckle the minister have forget their own government ’s failure to tackle the problem of high industrial energy price interruption they can heckle again now but they do nothing in government 
 week ago i be at the tata steelwork with the energy security and net committee we speak to people locally who have great concern that when the blast furnace there shut it be too late for this government to take action to prevent that when they come in it be some year before the new electric arc furnace technology be ready to be instal and to operate 
 will my hon friend do everything in her power to ensure that there be not that same gap here the problem that have cause in south wales have remind people of the damage do by previous era of deindustrialisation and they be concerned that we be now repeat the same mistake will she confirm that the government will do everything in their power to ensure that we do not make those same mistake of deindustrialisation this time 
 we be very much planning not to make the mistake that my hon friend talk about we do not want the blast furnace to shut that remain the government ’s view and we will do everything we can to reach a deal with british steel to protect worker and secure those job and the production of steel in the long term 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 speculation around british steel at the scunthorpe plant be deeply concern for the worker and business owner alike who be desperately wait for the government to deliver just piece of good news steel be vital to our green economy as it play a huge role in our ability to extend our railway and to build carbon home what incentive do british steel have to keep go it have have to contend with the chancellor ’s decision to hike national insurance contribution and with trump ’s terrify tariff 
 manufacturing business need the government to offer reassurance certainty and stability we need to move from a patchwork of last minute rescue to a long term plan that will see industry on a sustainable footing we need a robust industrial strategy with a proper plan for steel within it we have be tell to expect this industrial strategy shortly will the minister confirm exactly when we will have it can she reassure the small and medium sized manufacturing business in my constituency and across rural england that britain want they to grow will the strategy include a long term vision that will allow the uk to secure the investment that we need for virgin steel production 
 i can reassure the hon lady that we be develop a long- term plan in the industrial strategy we be develop the plan for steel as i have say and alongside that we have our trade strategy which have become very significant in recent time she be right to point to the tariff that have be place on steel and aluminium this be a deeply difficult situation and i have meet the steel sector on multiple occasion to talk about it that be what the conversation that be happen in stafford as we speak be about what extra measure need to be put in place the secretary of state meet the trade remedies authority this morning to push on some of the issue around trade protection 
 the hon lady talk about the sme manufacture supply chain of course that be very important and we will do what we can within the industrial strategy and the steel strategy to support those business i understand that the speculation about what may or may not happen at scunthorpe be deeply distressing not just to the worker and their family but to all those who be part of the supply chain that be why we will continue at pace to have the conversation we need to have with british steel to ensure that we do the right thing and as i say nothing be off the table 
 the whole of northern lincolnshire will feel the brunt of this british steel decision should the site close and i urge jingye to reconsider the government ’s generous £ offer support through the department for work and pensions be really welcome but the truth be that people have be leave british steel for year because of the cycle of its uncertain future i welcome the government ’s comment that no option be off the table in the interim be the government consider order the raw material to keep the blast furnace burn 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and for point out that the uncertainty that have exist for many year be difficult for people and that if they can secure job elsewhere they will do that i have   be to scunthorpe and talk to people who work there and to the trade union a lot as she would expect to make sure that we understand all the issue at play 
 i understand my hon friend ’s question about what we may or may not do in the immediate term but i hope she will respect the fact that we can not at this point talk about what we might end up do because those conversation be commercially sensitive i want to reassure she and the whole house that we be do what we can to ensure we get the right solution and that we do not want the blast furnace to close 
 about day ago i urge the minister and the government to use this decision by the chinese to close british steel as an opportunity to take british steel into public ownership the situation be urgent it have stop order the raw material for the blast furnace and unless those raw material be order within about day those blast furnace will go cold in mid may the minister say that no option be off the table will she confirm that the government will make those decision and come to a conclusion about the option within this very short timeframe to ensure that the blast furnace stay open and that the right long term solution be to take british steel into public ownership and invest in it for british industry for british steel and for the worker in lincolnshire 
 as i say about day ago economic and job not ideology will drive the decision that we make the hon member be right to point to lot of speculation about the need to buy raw material i assure he that we be have those conversation with british steel and we will continue to do so as i say our preference be for a commercial solution with government provide support but all option remain on the table and i can assure he that we be work at pace 
 wolverhampton north east have the uk ’s large steel processing and distribution centre will the minister outline how the government intend to protect job across this vital industry by back a robust industrial strategy and the £ plan for steel 
 i would be happy to come to my hon friend ’s constituency to have a look at and to talk to some of the people who work in the steel business huge number of organisation and business across the country rely on use and produce thing from steel and we need to ensure that we factor they into the conversation we be have we be look at the supply chain and how we boost industry more widely through our industrial strategy we be look at all the thing whether it be skill r&d or access to finance that business of all sector have tell we they need whether it be through the industrial strategy or the plan for steel we be try to ensure that we have a robust industry in this country so that job be not offshore and we have the security of know that we be produce the thing that we need here in the uk 
 between and about job be lose in steelmaking or about half the workforce that be under labour of course i be concerned to hear talk today about   nationalisation and i say that with due deference to my hon friend   the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers the old joke be that if we want to stop crime pay we should nationalise it give that this government could not run a bath never mind the steel industry would a well idea not be to support the industry with as i have mention before a golden share to give we some say over what happen again be the truth not that the dogmatic pursuit of net be drive up energy bill in this country to a level that be simply not sustainable for industry 
 i will repeat what i have say we be look at all the option on the table we be talk to british steel about the right outcome and we will do what be right for our country and our industry on energy price the hon member be right to raise the high cost of energy the supercharger come into effect this month and british steel will get support from that as will other high end energy intensive industry but he be right to point to that issue and we be look at it 
 i thank the minister for her answer as she will know there have be intense medium speculation that the blast furnace will close before the consultation be complete will she reassure i and worker that everything be be do to ensure that do not happen and that jingye conduct its affair with respect to uk law 
 my hon friend be right and we will do that the offer that be put to british steel and which be refuse include condition to do exactly that as well as include a number of other thing around job as we would expect it be very important that any deal use british taxpayer money be do in a way that we know be within the law and be a good use of taxpayer money i be very mindful of that and i be constantly mindful of the insecurity that people who work at british steel will feel as well as the need for all of we to try to work as hard as we can to ensure that we get a good outcome for those people 
 i thank the hon lady for keep an open mind about what to do to save the remnant of our steel industry do she not agree that it be vital that we maintain a strategic capability to make steel be it not unconscionable that we be build british warship with import steel i recognise that the situation represent the cumulative failing of government over many decade but it be now time utterly to change our policy that include the energy policy which have prioritise thing other than price in relation to our energy intensive industry i be glad to hear that the government have some answer to that but to build up a strategic capability for wartime which be what we now need to tool up for in this country we need a wholesale change in energy policy i hope that she will look for common cause between the front bench team because this should be do on a consensus basis we do not need to tear chunk out of another for the mistake we have all make in the past 
 i agree with the hon member ’s premise that we need to ensure that we have steel production in the uk although there be some nuance around some of this high quality steel be be make as we speak for   defence purpose by electric arc furnace that be perfectly possible we melt scrap and add about of primary steel for some thing depend on what we be make i know too much about the steel industry now we do not need any primary steel we be conduct a review of primary steel which will be finish shortly again neither tata nor british steel be a critical supplier to defence programme at the moment but we need that steel production as i say before so that we can build whatever we might need in the future of course we will work cross party if that be his offer it be very gladly take 
 the minister should not waste the opportunity of a lifetime in the party of the right urge a party of the left to nationalise a british industry organisation that have be utterly consistent in all this be the gmb union it write to the previous government ’s defence secretary say that a business minister have fail to answer clearly whether virgin steel be essential for defence today ’s minister seem to suggest that it might not be but we must have a quantity of virgin steel even if we add other thing to it to embark on the process of make essential defence product seize the opportunity keep the blast furnace and if necessary nationalise they for good 
 if we get into conversation about different type of steel it be like the facebook update it ’ complicated right it be complicated for some thing we absolutely need primary steel and for some thing we do not that be why we be carry out a fundamental review of steelmaking and the need for it here in the uk those result will come out soon the right hon member be right that the gmb have be an advocate for this as have community and unite we talk to they regularly about british steel i have not fail to notice the slightly odd position that we find ourselves in today i repeat that we be look at all option the house will understand that we be talk about large amount of taxpayer money which we have to spend in the right way in a sensible way and in a way that will get we what we need that be what we be look at and it be what we will do 
 these steelworker do not want visit from the dwp they do not even want visit from out of touch labour back bench mp what they want be their job they want to make steel it be interesting to hear from the minister that all option be on the table do they include reform uk ’s policy of scrap net and renationalise british steel 
 it be good to hear that the worker in british steel do not want visit from politician i assume the hon member and his party will take his own advice i hope that he will understand that we can not talk about the conversation that we be have with british steel it would be very disruptive to the process the workforce there the supply chain and commercial confidentiality i can only repeat that our preference be that we come to an agreement with british steel base on commercial term with government support but we be look at all option and nothing be off the table 
 do the minister agree that we appear to have hammer out a cross party consensus on the need to ensure that this country be able to continue to produce virgin steel   just like every other g7 country for a whole raft of reason do she agree that the case be underscored and reinforce by the trump slump by her party ’s welcome albeit belate pragmatism on net and hope an attendant fall in energy cost and by the prime minister ’s intriguing announcement of the end of globalisation do she agree that those thing have underscore and reinforce the case for continue to produce virgin steel in this country 
 i agree with the right hon member that the world have change we know that we be in a different position than that which we find ourselves in a few year ago we need to ensure that we be secure as a country and i believe steel be part of that answer 
 we also need to ensure that we be stop the decline of the steel industry which be always the labour party ’s wish in opposition we be committed to the plan for steel the £ on top of the £ that we be give to tata steel in port talbot this be a real commitment to change how we operate the steel industry in this country so that we stop this constant decline and start to grow the industry and ensure that we be produce the thing we need 
 the minister seem to be on the verge of acknowledge that as the last virgin steel production in the uk scunthorpe be critical national infrastructure and that the government will nationalise it if necessary can she commit to the house that virgin steel production in the uk be critical national infrastructure and that if necessary she will indeed nationalise it to maintain this critical resource for uk defence 
 i be afraid i have to disappoint the right hon member as i be not on the verge of anything i repeat what i say because it be the right thing to do we will continue to negotiate with british steel mindful of the worker and the insecurity of the consultation they be currently undergo we will ensure that we do the right thing through our plan for steel and our response to british steel and i can not say any more than that at this point 
 i thank the minister for her comment give the vital importance of this industry on which i believe the whole house agree do she recognise that it would be a siren to those who on a national scale would be less than trustworthy if we be unable to produce virgin steel ourselves give the undoubted national security risk do she agree that despite no option be off the table outcome that be absolutely off the table be closure if so why not just commit to protect and save these job 
 british steel be a private company own by jingye and it be for jingye to make its own decision i have say multiple time that we will continue to talk to see if we can come to an agreement on the very generous offer that be make we be look at all option because we know that be the right thing to do to be clear we do not want the blast furnace to close and we want to come to an agreement 
 i wish the minister would stop say that some of these issue be complicated and therefore that we should not debate they we be send here to debate complicated issue and she be suppose to be here to answer our question 
 we be witness the absurd spectacle of the government beg a chinese company to take taxpayer money to keep british steel alive while china suppress its own cost and dump its steel on other country we may soon be the only g7 country incapable of produce primary steel the minister brush off the reality of crippling british energy cost which will only get bad in the year ahead as a matter of deliberate government policy why will she not guarantee the supply of the raw material need to keep the blast furnace open and why will she not admit that steel have no future in this country so long as this government ’s trade and climate policy continue 
 if only the hon member have do something when he have some influence as an adviser to a previous prime minister that would have be good would n’t it 
 i be not send here to divulge commercially confidential conversation with a private company that affect thousand of people ’s job and if the hon member think that i be he be wrong we be not go to do that nor be we beg anywhere for anything 
 you be 
 no absolutely not and i be disappointed that the hon member would speak in that way as he know we be have a conversation about a potential deal that we believe be there to be do with british steel 
 on the wide issue it be a fact that china produce of the world ’s steel and we have huge issue with that as the hon member know the tariff have over complicate the situation which be why the secretary of state be meet the trade remedies authority today why we be look at our trade strategy and why we be talk to the americans to make sure we can do a deal with they we will continue to ensure that we have all the protection we need in term of stop the onshoring of steel as much as we can those conversation will continue the tra be now look at steel and we expect those result quite soon
