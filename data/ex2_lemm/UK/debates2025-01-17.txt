i refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests my former colleague at the mcs foundation have provide research in support of the bill 
 i want to pick up on the hon gentleman ’s point about timescale because in my experience this issue be the that be raise most commonly by resident want to see action why on earth they say be new home be put up without solar panel on they time be of the essence but be it not the case that we have already lose many opportunity to progress regulation be due to come into force in that would have require all new home to have carbon standard those regulation be scrap by the coalition government hon member no they be n’t the briefing i have have say that they be scrap in interruption either way i be pleased to see cross party support today to press ahead with this proposal at speed do the hon gentleman agree that speed be of the essence here to ensure that home be not be put up without solar panel 
 i thank the minister for his generous word although i accept that i will not be crack open a beer this evening to celebrate the bill ’s passing perhaps a bottle of corona this have be an important debate and it have demonstrate consensus across the house save for the local difficulty of the shadow minister   the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes which we should not go into again 
 a range of view be express about the energy mix my view be that we need a mix of energy generation that include all the thing discuss today i be pleased to hear that the matter will be up for future discussion and i look forward to work on it with the government particularly on the important point of apply pressure to developer in a way that get the pragmatic outcome that we all deserve i thank all member for their contribution to the discussion 
 the debate stand adjourn standing order no 11(2 
 order that the debate be resume on   friday july 
 i wholeheartedly agree there be some incredibly cool alternative to loud firework and the general public really like they a yougov survey recently say that drone be more popular than firework in the uk and we have see some fantastic drone display there be also low noise firework but the general public still do not know quite what they be buy at the moment 
 i would hazard a guess that not many people would know until they become as nerdy as i about firework the difference between an f2 and an f3 firework we need to enable encourage and educate responsible member of the public on what they be buy and on the alternative there be a challenge there for the firework lobby which need to diversify there be a hunger among the public and consumer for quieter firework and increase use of technology such as drone we need to see change now because the public be behind we 
 the deputy speaker interrupt the business standing order no 11(2 order that the debate be resume on   friday april 
 the deputy chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no and negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 i move the bill with sunshine in my heart i be an environmentalist i have fight for year to improve the housing market in my town of cheltenham and i strongly believe that we all deserve a fair deal on the cost of living i be elect in july after campaign on those issue and i move reading of the bill with those issue in mind i thank hon member who have take the time to attend today ’s debate and i urge they to retain a sunny disposition for the next few hour i be happy to take intervention from member from across the house but i hope hon member will not use they to throw too much shade i promise a warm response regardless and i hope the minister will provide the same 
 today we can all make a commitment to a bright future by back the sunshine bill it will be a future in which people have low household bill we be less reliant on dirty and expensive fossil fuel often import from abroad and the country ’s energy supply be more secure this future be a vision support by voter across political divide as well as by industry 
 before i get to the core of my speech i ask hon member to think back a few short year to the start of the energy bill crisis householder endure a rise in the energy price cap in april and bill remain high than they be before the crisis that cause widespread fuel poverty we witness another shocking increase in food bank use business go bust job be lose and family holiday plan be cancel the crisis also lay bare how short sighted past ideological decision be to slow down the roll out of renewable technology 
 imagine an alternative imagine that more home include solar power generation during that crisis and in the ongoing crisis bill could and should have be hundred of pound low for everyone householder would have be insulate against high bill and our nation would have be safe and strong food bank would have be less busy and the government would not have be force to give such large subsidy to ensure that people could get by 
 at the heart of the discussion be a press need to tackle twin crisis the cost of living and climate change as hon member will know the climate change discussion often lead we to debate difficult trade off the government be grapple with those and they have my good wish in do so but solar energy generation on new build home be very much not in that category the bill help we to tackle the cost of living and climate change a clear win win 
 mcs foundation research have show that the payback period for a solar array on a bedroom semi detached house be just year when that array be combine with other technology that will be widely available in the next few year over a year mortgage the saving stand at a whopping £ solar technology also offer homeowner the chance to profit directly the energy saving trust estimate that a typical household could make between £ and £ a year 
 on the environmental side research by solar energy uk show that building account for of all uk emission in the government have place build new home at the heart of their agenda which i support 
 i genuinely welcome today ’s reading of the bill have bring private member bills through parliament from the back benches i wish the hon gentleman every success it can be a long journey will he say more about the impact of solar panel on the environment and the green belt in the shift towards use more solar panel i fear many of the panel will be instal on prime agricultural land i be disappointed that in walsall the planning inspector have just give permission for a battery storage facility on the edge of my constituency right by a conservation area i feel strongly that we need to look at alternative place for solar panel in order to protect community and our green belt 
 the right hon lady be entirely right she and member across the house will have note that the campaign to protect rural england have take a strong interest in this issue and in the bill for precisely the reason she describe with which i have a lot of sympathy efficient use of land and space in this country be extremely important 
 if we be to achieve the new home building target that the government have set out we must ensure that new build home be equip for the challenge of the future which include climate change and look after our environment if we do not change the standard for new housing stock we not only miss an economic opportunity but put the environment at risk the government ’s own advisory body the climate change committee have advise that the uk will not meet   its emission target without the near complete decarbonisation of housing stock that be why it be so important that the new government specifically the secretary of state for energy and climate change have move the conversation along not least as show by the answer to a question that i ask the right hon gentleman before christmas in which he say he be very sympathetic to the case for mandatory solar panel on new build home he be right 
 the case for update the regulation be irrefutable the regulation that govern building work be set out in the building act which be the year i be bear and   the building regulations which be so long ago that member will be disturb to learn that i still have a large brylcreem bill in those day the previous government consult on the future home standard but we be not able to respond before the general election it be hearten that the current government have promise a response and to pick up that work there will of course be strong pushback from some developer who will default to think about profit only i understand that profit motive but i urge developer to think about the planet and what their customer be demand 
 i be pleased to see the bill in the house today but be not quite so entrance by the hon member ’s pun or by his make i feel completely and utterly ancient set aside that niggle on a serious point do he agree that it be important for we to have a secure supply chain for solar panel and that we eliminate the use of solar panel build by uyghur people subject to force labour in china 
 the hon member make a very reasonable point we need to be clear that our supply chain in this country be free from slave labour that be a matter for government procurement rule and i understand that measure on that will come to the house in due course 
 as i be say i understand the developer motif and why some will push back but developer know what we all know which be that the technology already exist and that implement the measure in the sunshine bill will be relatively straightforward for they solar panel technology have be available for many year and the construction industry be accustom to work with it mandate installation at the construction stage be logical it remove the burden from homeowner and place the responsibility with the developer 
 i thank my hon friend for bring the bill to the house it be so important that it almost feel like a no brainer many of my resident share with i their frustration about try to navigate the process of instal solar panel there be question about which provider to go with how it work and all the technical detail do he agree that not only do the bill have an environmental benefit but it will as he have start to explain take that burden from resident and empower they they will benefit from low bill without all the faff 
 my hon friend be entirely right as she know the bill include a recommendation to set an industry standard so that consumer can have confidence in what they be buy not only be the burden remove from homeowner and responsibility place with developer but the bill create an efficiency save in human resource and material it be an entirely logical step to take instal solar panel on roof while the house be be build be at least cheap than retrofit 
 there will be issue around cost which member might raise in intervention or in speech but government estimate put the cost of mandatory solar panel on all new home at around £ per home that sound   like a lot of money in isolation but the average cost of a new build in the final quarter of be far in excess of £ so we be talk about little more than of the price of a new build home that be next to nothing in the context of a monthly mortgage repayment if we take the figure in raw form and it would be offset by low bill 
 this bill would mandate that all new home be build with solar generation technology cover the roof space a minimum of of the equivalent of the building ’s ground floor area 
 i too be interested in solar panel be mandate on public building in my area rednock school have have solar panel retrofit solar panel in educational facility have effect they not only save money for the school but teach young people about the issue also in my area the nhs be look to put solar panel on all south face roof of hospital i wonder if we could extend the bill to public building in general 
 i take the hon member ’s point on board entirely and agree with he this bill be limit to residential new build i be very conscious that in the public sector the cost of initial installation would be bear by the taxpayer he be right to reference school in my constituency bournside school be instal a huge ground source heat pump that be a national leading case study he be right that it be important that young people understand what be go on with regard to industry standard we need to make sure that there be an industry wide regulator and a certification scheme the industry need proper regulation to give consumer confidence in the product 
 supply chain be mention to give supply chain the construction industry and developer time to adjust the bill propose that the regulation apply from   october minister may have comment on whether that be a realistic timescale they might want to make it long i be sure that there will be a discussion 
 reasonable exemption need to apply include for very tall building for building on which it would not be economical to install solar panel due to roof size or other factor and for building that have other form of renewable energy generation instal that be more appropriate for that setting where building can not physically accommodate solar panel that cover at least of the building ’s ground floor area the bill require that solar panel be instal to the maximum extent possible 
 it be important to take part in some myth bust to dispel big myth about solar panel they do not always need a clear sunny day to work they will continue to work in overcast cloudy condition i think we can all agree that that be good news for this country to dispel another myth solar panel can be instal to good effect on north face roof although efficiency will be a little low 
 the overwhelming strength of the case for the measure mean that the sunshine bill have gather support from industry over christmas several business and industry organisation sign an open letter to the government in which they declare their support for the bill i be grateful for the support of the mcs foundation solar energy uk eco2solar e.on next and ecotricity   i be particularly grateful to the mcs foundation for its assistance and advice on technical matter in these last few month 
 i thank the hon member for let i interrupt his excellent speech which be load with fantastic pun that i would be very proud of what discussion have he have with industry on make sure that we have the correct skill pipeline so that we have enough installer and other people require to ensure that solar panel be instal efficiently and effectively and to maximise the economic benefit to this country 
 the hon member be absolutely right he will recall that if we go back more than a decade there be a thriving solar energy industry in this country sadly we have take step back over the last few year when it come to the skill pipeline i know that issue be on this government ’s agenda and i welcome that on the date on which we might look at this we hope that further education college will put on course to train people up and that there would be more industry work too 
 will the hon member explain why his bill exclude the use of solar thermal panel 
 the bill focus on solar photovoltaic solar thermal panel be a different type of technology and be not cover by the bill 
 i would also like to thank cpre   the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton   speak early about the preservation of land and field in green area and the cpre be specifically interested from that perspective 
 this be become increasingly worrying because we be now start to see policy on grey belt i fear that if we do not thoroughly grasp the issue of where solar panel battery storage and all the other renewable infrastructure should go we risk green belt be all of a sudden redefine as grey belt in a few year time and be build on 
 the right hon lady speak powerfully for her constituency which i know have a specific issue 
 we mention housing developer and housing developer have put its head above the parapet to support the bill i be grateful for the support of thakeham and it be to be applaud for support the measure developer should support the bill for sound business reason there be a clear market preference for home with solar panel and a relatively small proportion of the price will be reward with a decent payback and customer want they 
 politically there be demonstrable cross party support in the last parliament of members be find to be supportive and i suspect the percentage be high in this new parliament the climate barometer track support for mandatory solar panel on new build and find a clear majority of support among all party voter so do this would place we at the centre of political gravity some of conservative voter of labour voter of liberal democrat voter and of reform supporter respond to the survey in favour of   mandatory solar panel for new build home those same constituent rightly look to we to make the right and logical decision on these matter they back the measure because all the evidence point to clear benefit at every level include the government ’s positive agenda on energy and climate 
 mcs foundation research have find that mandatory solar panel on home would be the equivalent of additional sizewell c nuclear power station which should give we all pause for thought for a country that struggle to build infrastructure we must not look past these easy small scale win 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman on introduce the bill he talk about the nuclear power that may not be need if we have solar panel on house do he have a view on how much pressure we could take off demand on green land for solar farm because many people have concern about that use of green land if we have solar panel on new build 
 my strong suspicion be that the market will help to decide the answer to that question but it be inevitable that if we produce more energy from some source it will lower demand in other area the hon gentleman make a good point 
 i visit hinkley point on a school trip as an year old and be tell very excitedly that a new hinkley c be on the way i regret to tell the house that i be now and on current projection hinkley c be not expect to generate any power until i be at least on the point of time the new home build today will outlast we all if we can make they work well for the planet they will be a lasting testament to this house ’s effort to tackle climate change and they will offer protection against the energy shock we have all endure too that be what we have the chance to do today if ministers be willing to support the principle of the sunshine bill we can not and should not let this opportunity pass we by and it be our duty to build a political consensus here to match the consensus among member of the public 
 so to paraphrase the great morecambe and wise in the song that share the informal name we have give to this bill let our arm be as warm as the sun up above and let we think about how much joy we can give to each brand new bright tomorrow if only we can lower people ’s energy bill and help to tackle climate change too 
 i thank   the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   for introduce the bill i will try not to cloud the chamber too much with pun i will leave it to other hon member to shower the room with they laughter it ’ so painful 
 i be glad that the bill have be bring forward there be so many good thing in it and i want to ensure that the country as a whole can embrace the future of solar power generation where people live right in the heart of community and on their home i have move in the past year or so to ground level as many people in my constituency know and frequently comment about on facebook i have live most of my adult life in tower block and of the great thing   about 1960 council tower block be that there be fantastic view over everybody ’s roof in all the decade i live in those tower block it be apparent that we be miss out in this country so much acreage on rooftop be empty and devoid of power generation while other country have leap ahead and take advantage 
 at the same time i have see where this have not quite work i watch a new council housing block be build right next to the previous place i live in over its rooftop i see the solar panel go in and then see what the problem be where the management company and the local council be not quite able to make it work and to generate power for people there the solar panel be for a long time unused and not function that be the sign of a technology that be not quite mature and it be only in the past year that that   have happen 
 when like i member go around their constituency they will see lot of solar panel on house and have lot of conversation with people in pub who have instal they on their house some people will have have a great experience and will talk at length about how it have reduce their bill and unfortunately other tell of the problem and challenge of get connect to the grid and make it work that be not a reason not to do it but it be a reason to have a clear eye as we go forward on this change hopefully the minister will talk about how we can ensure that this policy be successful in future 
 there be load of opportunity but we should not lose sight of other opportunity as well of the most impressive thing i have see in my constituency from an industrial side be the cluster of factory around kemsley paper mill from ds smith a of the cardboard produce in the uk be recycle in that location it be part of a set of factory that use their waste product and heat to generate power themselves in a circular carbon economy a key part be more traditional form of power production for instance all the cardboard that be not use in those factory and that can not be recycle be turn into electricity and carbon capture be use the carbon capture process be then use to support work in other factory such as the production of plasterboard and the waste heat be use 
 the factory be already do great work and they want to expand far with solar power particularly on an old landfill site which be perfectly place that be a great opportunity but there be also the factory roof not all the building be suitable but as we build on that cluster and can generate power locally and as we build more home around they and in that area to provide power solar power have an important part to play i very much want to see that we be able to change our building regulation and to ensure they meet the need and opportunity from factory but at the same time we must not close our eye to the fact that there be many other way of ensure that we reach a carbon future 
 fix the housing crisis be absolutely not mutually exclusive with fix the climate crisis the hon member rightly identify the cost of live crisis and the climate crisis i would add in the housing crisis as a part of that and i can see he do not disagree 
 this point have be make a few time but it be almost as if there be a tension between protect our natural environment and make progress on renewable energy source it be not a choice between the be central to the other as a former councillor i know that it be vital that community voice be hear in this if there be thing that upset local community it be when they be not involve in conversation on matter that directly impact they and the area they live in do my hon friend agree 
 i wholeheartedly agree i give the example of a power generator on a roof not work and that come down to the fact that the local community be not involve the resident on the block see no benefit from it but it be cause they problem include leak in the roof and all sort of other stuff it be vital that we have not just a circular energy economy but a circular economic and monetary economy so that people see the benefit in their pocket as well as in the light and heating in their home 
 i be keen to hear from the minister what the government plan to do to change the building regulation meet the aspiration in the bill and ensure that we have a comprehensive strategy to progress towards a carbon net future while ensure that that do not get in the way of tackle local environmental problem biodiversity and so on or the housing and cost of living crisis those thing be all join up that be how developer will work and deliver and how we can ensure that that happen 
 we all know that implementation be the tricky part   of policy the intention be very straightforward and this bill be full of great intention but get the implementation right will be the challenge we have have year of hot and cold climate policy sometimes the previous government go hell for leather on tackle climate change at other point they do not seem so certain as well as developer business and household have struggle with that because they have not be sure of the direction of travel i be hopeful that our new government will now focus on stability as a key plank of our growth agenda give developer community and household the certainty they need to plan together everyone be look for that framework 
 some area and town face great challenge on housing and housing need in sheerness in my constituency for example the housing stock be of deteriorate quality much of it be post war council housing which unsurprisingly in a coastal area be not last and have high maintenance cost we need a comprehensive renewal that bring in not just well housing but the opportunity to leapfrog several stage in environmental learning and energy production and ensure that energy production be bring into the heart of town in my constituency and those of other hon member 
 my hon friend be speak with great passion about his constituent that be always great to hear when it come to new home we must consider their efficiency from top to bottom the bill will add solar panel to new home we all welcome that and i be happy to support it but we must go far by ensure that our home be as efficient warm and cheap to heat as   possible in scotland the private member ’s bill introduce by alex rowley msp could mean that all home in scotland be build to the passivhaus standard which i think be the gold standard right now do my hon friend think that we should aspire to that 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for come in on that point and i very much agree although my constituency be generally not quite as cold and damp as part of scotland it be pretty cold and damp and when the wind come along the swale it can get quite cold as people who live in north kent will know the quality of housing stock include insulation need attention that be what i mean by a comprehensive picture it be about not just power generation but ensure that we do not waste power and that the effect be ultimately feel in people ’s pocket 
 i know that other member will talk with great expertise and in great depth about thing happen in their constituency and the opportunity that they see and i look forward to listen to they as we move forward we must learn from past mistake and from current great practice and ensure that these policy actually work unlike in the false start of the past 
 i congratulate   the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   on his good fortune in secure a place in the ballot in order to introduce what be without doubt a very important bill i be however concern about the scope of the bill and i will come to that in a moment if i may i do not propose to take very long for many year i have consistently oppose the installation of solar farm of course they be not farm at all on agricultural land 
 in east kent we be lose grade agricultural land far too frequently both to development and to be use for solar power generation it be completely unnecessary as i have say many time both in this house and outside it we have acre and acre of rooftop in public ownership on public building school hospital and prison in addition to acre of car park space which the french would be cover in solar panel if we use all of that i can see no need whatsoever to use for these purpose fine agricultural land that should be use for grow crop for feed people that be why i think that the scope of the bill good though it may be do not go far enough we must look not just at new build but at what exist and what can and should be do 
 by the bye i would go a stage far and say that we should not only be look at solar panel but at grey water system we waste gallon and gallon of water off the rooftop of this country which of course can not then soak into the land because we have cover it in tarmac so it be not replenish the aquifer that water ought to be use for flush lavatory and matter that do not require potable water again i think there be a trick that may have be miss 
 quite clearly what be go to happen be that the developer and the builder will scream like stuck pig for why let we take a development in herne bay in my constituency i will not name the developer because i would hate to upset taylor wimpey but it have avoid instal electric vehicle charging point because there be a bit of wriggle room the amount that it would add   to the cost of the property that allow it to get off the hook i do not doubt that instal solar panel initially would add to the purchase price of the property which of course might eat into profit and we would hate to see that but this be essential we have to do this and it be long past time i notice that the bill give as the start date i can see no reason whatsoever why we should not start immediately and say that from now on every new build should be fit with photovoltaic panel 
 there be another issue which be the design of the technology we all know that retrofit solar panel be pretty unattractive hideous to be blunt about it it surprise i that in this day and age those develop this technology have not go far enough and fast enough to develop attractive panel that be simply roof like any other roof it have get to be possible to develop a photovoltaic tile that could be use on list building but that have not happen 
 i just want to advise the right hon member that several product of the type he be reference be available on the market at the moment 
 if the hon gentleman can tell i of a photovoltaic tile that be acceptable to the people who be enforce regulation relate to list building i would be delighted to hear it that be what i be try to come on to before i be interrupt 
 kent a wonderful county have very many grade ii list building and at present it be not permit to use solar panel or solar tile as i would like to see they on those list building it be not even permit on other building outbuilding cottage or whatever within the curtilage of a list building that rule out a considerable quantity of property that can and should accommodate solar panel 
 king ’s college in cambridge of the old and most prestigious heritage building now have a fine array of solar panel that it manage to get through planning permission do the right hon member agree that what we need in plan term be for material weight to be give to climate change as well as conservation status that be where the crux of the matter be it would allow all those who be responsible for list home or who have home in conservation area to do energy efficiency in the right way 
 up to a point i agree with the hon lady but only up to a point i do not want to see the fine building of kent smother in hideous installation so we have to find a way technically of make the panel acceptable i accept entirely that retrofitting be much hard than new build it be possible to inset photovoltaic panel into a new roof on a new build but it be much hard to retrofit it attractively i would like to see we make much more effort to go down that road so that we come up with product that be acceptable across the board not just for new build but for exist building 
 it be essential that this bill have a reading and i will be support it today there be flaw in it but that be what the committee stage be about and we   should allow the bill to go into committee if i may say to the hon member for cheltenham there be rather too much wriggle room i can see canny developer find way of exploit some of the exemption if we be not careful that he have write into the bill 
 do my right hon friend agree that an unintended consequence of this bill could be that it be no long possible to build a new thatched house in dorset and hampshire we welcome people who be develop new thatched house how will that work with this bill 
 the bill do accommodate exemption and my hon friend make a case in point in the village i live in we have thatch building and i would like to see more of they there may be case where an exemption should be permit but look at the bill as it stand it seem that these loophole be wide open to exploitation and they will have to be tighten up that however be the purpose of the committee let we give the bill its reading get it into committee amend it and bring it back on report and reading and then let we see it become law 
 of my previous employer use to run a competition for schoolchildren they ask they to draw a picture of a well future where we tackle our climate and ecological crisis the entry be display on a wall close to my office and many time a day i pass they and look at they 
 many young people have choose to show a contrast on side of the page be often a burn world now painfully familiar from our news feed as our dear friend in california find their world set alight and i be also remind to remember our neighbour here in the uk still reel from our recent flood the child ’s picture be sadly a good predictor of the threat but on the other side of the page where they show their hope for tomorrow child often draw home surround by tree with happy people play outside in the sunshine without fail on the rooftop of the house in those picture be solar panel our child understand that a bright and sustainable future depend on clean and sustainable energy 
 our government ’s mission to make the uk a clean energy superpower be a direct response to the climate crisis and a clear mission to make energy secure and affordable photovoltaic fit the bill perfectly simple reliable and effective they be the pure form of renewable energy convert photon directly into electrical power and we can place that power directly in the hand of homeowner 
 the need for we to embrace solar power as part of a suite of energy technology for a sustainable future   be clear alongside offshore wind and underpin by storage use green hydrogen solar photovoltaic be a key technology for the uk to decarbonise its electricity and all the sector and use case that we electrify while the use of land for solar generation be rightly contend we have a vast and perfectly design yet barely tap resource on our rooftop 
 resident in my constituency be aghast that a mega mw solar farm be be propose by the blenheim estate which people believe have not allow solar panel to be place on the house it have develop in the area do the hon member agree that place solar panel on the roof of house be a much well way to diversify solar panel and build the community consent for the renewable transition that be part of the government ’s mission 
 i fully agree many people have tell i that intuitively they would like solar to be put on roof i think there be strong consensus that that should be our direction 
 my hon friend   the member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna   talk about some of the challenge of retrofitting we need to listen to the social science harness new initiative such as gb energy and activate local authority to empower ordinary people to retrofit solar we must develop way for people to easily access trust partner to help they decarbonise their home and save money as a result 
 the average price to install solar panel post build be somewhere between £ and £ the majority of people do not have that kind of cash stick down the back of the sofa do the hon member agree that support the bill be an investment both in our environment and in reduce energy bill for all new homeowner not just those who have the cash to do so 
 i agree as we face a transition in a range of technology my professional background be in heat it be important that we put consumer at the heart of that and ensure that it work for they and that we find way to make it accessible easy affordable and beneficial to embrace new technology there be new business model available that can help we do that heat as a service for example and we need to embrace those but whatever we do as we navigate the transition it be vital that we put people at the heart of what we build 
 have work in the energy sector for year there be comment that i have hear and utter myself very many time more than i can possibly count we should be put solar on every new home there be very few no brainer in politic but if any exist surely that be of they we have the opportunity to make a crucial change to stop grow the problem and start solve it put solar power on every new home will save people money it will boost our national renewable capacity it will be a crucial step in our mission for clean energy and it will mean that for our child who hope for a well future for people and our planet we can begin to deliver the home that they have always dream of 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for cheltenham max wilkinson   for introduce the bill i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 just after the general election ministers make the shock decision that the sunnica solar farm in ely and east cambridgeshire would go ahead despite the planning   inspector ’s recommendation that it should not the farm will cover a vast area of our green space use up prime farming land land that could be set aside for the benefit of nature and land that we might have use to build much need new home no soon have that solar farm get permission than the lovely glossy leaflet for the next come through the door about the next consultation on an even big solar farm across my constituency and other yet as we have hear we have acre and acre of roof space that we could put solar panel on why be we not do that 
 a couple of year ago i be on a planning committee visit to a new housing estate that be be build and i notice that there be just or sometimes solar panel on each roof i say to the developer why just or that ’ hardly make a dent in thing his answer be that be all we be require to do 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests because i be a councillor on mid sussex district council some year ago i be sit in training on a cross party basis with conservatives greens independents and liberal democrats and we ask our planning officer why can not we mandate that all new build have solar panel on the roof we be tell that we be not allow to because it be not in the nppf as it stand at that time do my hon friend agree that in order to make the case for house building and tackle the housing emergency we need to be able to convince the public that we be build high quality house that be fit for a climate crisis and that be energy efficient to reduce bill 
 i entirely agree we have a similar frustration when look at revise our local plan because we want to put thing in about energy efficiency 
 south oxfordshire and vale of white horse district council brilliant new joint local plan propose that new home should be net with solar be the obvious way of deliver that but that ambitious plan be now sit with the government inspector and we be in his hand do my hon friend agree that local authority should be empower to deliver on their net ambition 
 i agree because we be advise that we could not do what we want with our local plan as it would have go beyond the national planning policy framework the local community want to do it so we should be empower to do it 
 i entirely support the bill because it would make so much sense to everybody if we be to make sure that all new build have adequate solar panel on they or where appropriate an alternative form of green energy production so that people end up with house that be not destroy the climate and where they can actually afford their fuel bill 
 it be quite a long time ago now but i remember when i buy my house i have carefully plan out all the cost to determine whether i could afford the mortgage and everything else and then the winter come i start get my fuel bill and i think oops this be a bit difficult i do not want that to happen to people i want they to move into their new house and have low energy bill 
 it be not in this bill but the government have the power to do this we must make retrofit solar panel a good deal easy it must be make easy for people to get the connection certificate they need because that be a problem and i be already get casework about it i commend cambridgeshire county council because it have a scheme whereby local people can register to join in with a group purchase on which the county council do the due diligence that mean that people know that the supplier and the contractor be good responsible reliable people and they also get the discount of bulk buying i commend the council on that scheme 
 the bill be a brilliant start to make sure that this country can get to net and that people have warm home that they can afford to heat 
 i begin by make a declaration of interest my former employer cpre the countryside charity be a supporter of the bill many of my constituent be also passionate supporter of the proposal for mandatory rooftop solar on new building it be of the issue on which i have have the most correspondence in recent month 
 in north east hertfordshire the town of royston and buntingford have see rapid development in recent year as have small village such as barkway puckeridge and standon in the near future a new estate will be build on the edge of letchworth garden city and the town of baldock be due to roughly double in size at the same time we face many challenging decision locally to balance the need for renewable energy with the protection of our high quality farmland while also preserve and enhance space for nature it be therefore unsurprise that resident in north east hertfordshire can see the common sense in make the good possible use of our finite land by put the solar panel we need on rooftop 
 our approach to deliver the renewable energy we undoubtedly and desperately need have be far too laissez faire 
 my constituency have also see significant population growth it have grow by in the past year new estate in didcot great western park wantage kingsgrove highcroft in wallingford and wellington gate in grove have not all seek the opportunity to have solar panel on the new house do the hon gentleman agree that if we do not create the home of the future now there be a risk that we will have to retrofit they in future at great expense to reach our net target and help resident with their bill 
 i wholeheartedly agree 
 as i be say we could suffer from the potentially profound impact of compete demand for space for the home we require our commitment to protect of our land for nature by and our fragile food security government figure show that with an industry average of acre per megawatt the propose ground mount solar scheme put forward to date would if they all go ahead require a total land area roughly equivalent to birmingham bristol manchester liverpool nottingham newcastle and leeds combine yet at the   same time academic analysis indicate that between suitable exist building and new construction there be potential space for gw of rooftop solar in england by 
 do the hon gentleman agree that it be a shocking dereliction of duty when the previous government cancel the carbon home programme which would have allow for the generation of around mw if every house build since have have solar panel on it do he agree with my resident in taunton and wellington who be aghast and want to see solar panel on the new house be build in comeytrowe staplegrove and monkton heathfield 
 i find myself once again in wholehearte agreement 
 ensure that solar panel be instal on the rooftop of new building specifically could deliver a generating capacity over time great than that of sizewell c. clearly if we start apply a strategic approach begin with the provision in the bill we can host the vast majority of the solar panel we need on our rooftop other nation be already prove that this can be do with similar regulatory measure currently in place in germany china and japan well yet enact this legislation would not only accelerate our progress toward meet our climate target reduce the industrialisation of our countryside and protect rural community it also offer the most effective way to ensure that the net transition lower electricity bill for consumer 
 i refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests my former colleague at the mcs foundation have provide research in support of the bill 
 i want to pick up on the hon gentleman ’s point about timescale because in my experience this issue be the that be raise most commonly by resident want to see action why on earth they say be new home be put up without solar panel on they time be of the essence but be it not the case that we have already lose many opportunity to progress regulation be due to come into force in that would have require all new home to have carbon standard those regulation be scrap by the coalition government.[official report   january vol c. correction hon member no they be n’t the briefing i have have say that they be scrap in interruption either way i be pleased to see cross party support today to press ahead with this proposal at speed do the hon gentleman agree that speed be of the essence here to ensure that home be not be put up without solar panel 
 i agree that speed be of the essence in multiple way and i encourage the government to move as quickly as possible 
 empower household to generate the electricity that they use will help family to lower their bill far more rapidly than commercial scheme that feed into wholesale energy market influence by international commodity price this strike i as a well draft bill and i congratulate   the hon member for cheltenham    max wilkinson   on its clarity and flexibility the only thing that i might suggest be a widening of the provision to cover commercial building as well give the vast opportunity provide by warehouse space it be estimate that we currently use only about of warehouse rooftop for solar generation claim that the regulation would hinder innovation be clearly spurious especially in view of the provision for exemption where other form of renewable energy generation be instal 
 it be high time that our country have common sense standard for rooftop solar on new build and i hope that the whole house will support the bill 
 i congratulate   the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   on his bill i do have some reservation about it which i will go into shortly but i be minded to support it today because this be a much well policy than the current government line about have large scale solar farm on all our farmland throughout the united kingdom i would much rather solar panel be put on new build and council already have some power enable they to do that broxbourne council which i use to lead have engage in extensive negotiation with developer particularly at high leigh where we have manage to get solar panel on some of the house a large data centre be also be build and we have manage to put some solar panel on that 
 as i have say i do have some concern i be all for take on developer and ensure that they pay for their section negotiation and do their community work and stand up for the resident we all represent however during many of the negotiation when i lead the council developer tell i that they want to put solar panel on more house but the distribution network operator have tell they that there be not enough capacity i say that no would be able to see the top of the data centre so why not cover the whole thing in solar panel why would anyone not want to do that why would anyone not support it that be my negotiating position the developer go away and have discussion with the dno which say that they could have only because there be not enough capacity for more and the system would not be able to cope we need to have a discussion about the capacity of the grid if we be go to do this i know that the bill focus specifically on new build property but surely it be a good thing to be able to use the rooftop of all the large data centre and warehouse that be already available 
 the hon gentleman be speak passionately about his constituency but do not cheap battery technology mean that people do not have to sell their electricity back to the grid any more they can keep it within their boundary and use it themselves 
 i be about to mention battery technology so i ask the hon gentleman to wait just a few second 
 the bill do go quite far in that its ambition relate to all house but i think we should go far if we be put solar panel on house we should require those house to have battery storage as well which might solve some of the problem involve grid connection and there be sufficient capacity battery technology   be a bit behind solar panel technology in term of efficiency and it be not quite there yet on cost effectiveness but we be definitely get there for example it be more cost effective to use the electricity in an electric car than to send it back to the grid i urge the hon member for cheltenham to consider that because if we be take this step in instal solar panel perhaps we should take further step and require people to have battery storage as well 
 i be concern about the red tape we be go to create for new development as i say i be all for take on developer i see some councillor and former councillor in the chamber who have probably all have vociferous discussion like the one i have have with developer about they do their bit but i be concern about the pushback we might get in discussion on section agreement there be issue around viability which i will not go into now but i would not want to see developer tell their local council and community we can not give you money for the new school or the doctor ’s surgery because we ’ve get to put solar panel on housing we need to give some thought to how that will work because we all want the most community money possible for the road school and gp surgery that must come with new development 
 there will be some home for which solar panel be not suitable i be fully supportive of panel be instal on building that have an east west facing roof or on a block of flat where it be practical to do that of course we should do it as other member have say it be increasingly frustrating when we drive past a development to see a roof with only solar panel on it after the developer have go through the whole cost of put up the scaffolding and build the house i suspect that be because of the issue around capacity which we definitely need to look into but come on if they be already put solar panel on half the roof they should fill the whole roof with they because that do not just help they if they can sell the green electricity back to the grid it help everybody 
 i have some reservation about where the money will come from i would not want it to come from the resource that would have go on school education and road through section agreement so we need to look at that we also need to look at distribution network operator and capacity to make sure we can really harness the energy but as this proposal be much well than have large scale solar farm plaster all over our green belt and the countryside i be minded to support the bill ’s reading 
 i pay tribute to   the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   for bring forward this bill on a subject of great importance i know from personal experience the time and effort it must have take to get to this stage 
 i be sure member on both side of the house will agree that solar be a key tool in the renewable energy arsenal which if use properly can have a significant positive impact on tackle climate change and ensure that we live in a more sustainable society i be proud to represent a constituency that be take the power of solar seriously constituent in amber valley regularly write to i want to know what be be do at both local and national level to tackle climate change even those   constituent who be not what any of we would call eco warrior be invariably unopposed to solar on rooftop and that be not it seem unique to amber valley as i walk through westminster underground station this morning a billboard catch my eye the msc foundation be advertise the fact that a recent yougov survey find that in voter believe that solar panel should be mandatory on new home 
 when labour take control of amber valley borough council in the council have no council home whatsoever as the previous conservative run council have sell all the housing stock year early at below market rate to right that wrong the council have start a new council house building programme and while we start small we be work towards a target of new council home each fit with solar panel indeed the secretary of state for energy security and net last year witness new build result from that programme on his visit to the borough alongside the mayor of the east midlands it be fair to say that we be commit in amber valley incorporate rooftop solar as part of our house building programme have be an important part of deliver clean energy and low bill and ensure sustainability for our constituent 
 when i become a borough councillor in amber valley i ask whether we could have a planning condition that solar panel must be instal on roof and i too be tell that that be just not possible that be totally perplexing to i so i be sure that hon member can imagine that i be proud to be part of a government who be spearhead the most ambitious house building programme in a generation with a clear commitment to environmental sustainability 
 the hon lady speak of the government ’s ambition and there be simple thing they could do in december after lobby from developer the previous conservative government shamefully issue a write ministerial statement to prohibit a councillor in west oxfordshire district council in my constituency from insist on high environmental standard for a net development do the hon lady agree that if the government simply revoke that write ministerial statement local council across the country would have more freedom to set high environmental standard will she encourage the minister to respond to that point 
 i would encourage the minister to respond because i do not think that it be for i to do so however i do think we should be do everything we can to move towards a well more sustainable future 
 not only be we build new home over this parliament but we be commit to an ambitious decarbonising agenda and harness renewable resource across the uk the secretary of state for energy security and net of course understand the importance of solar as part of our wide clean power mission and the contribution that the energy efficiency of home can make to our net emission target there be no doubt in my mind that rooftop solar play a crucial role in that 
 i support the notion behind the bill the government be already work on future standard particularly on the technical detail of solar to ensure that they be   appropriate that will ensure that new home and building embrace energy efficiency and be fit for a net future and i look forward to the government introduce those standard this year i thank the hon member for cheltenham for raise this important issue in the house today 
 people in my constituency be passionate about protect our environment and they know that if we be to do that we need to produce more renewable energy however in north east hampshire as in many other area of the uk we be also protective of our arable farming land which be so essential for our food security 
 pass the sunshine bill which have be bring to the house by my hon friend   the member for cheltenham max wilkinson would challenge the presumption that the principal way to increase our solar capacity be through solar farm and large scale industrial solar power generation prioritise solar panelling on new home will allow we to create the right energy mix and to produce energy in a sustainable way not only that but it will help we to address some of the challenge with economic growth reduce energy bill especially for those in social housing or on low income be an essential part of tackle the recent cost of living crisis and develop the industry through innovation be of course good for job 
 there have be a lot of conversation this morning about the benefit to homeowner of instal solar panel on new build if solar panel be include on new social housing we would also be help those who face the great challenge in pay energy bill which have go up since the energy price cap rise that be an add benefit in the cost of living crisis 
 my hon friend be of course correct this should not be just about cost saving for those who can afford installation in the place 
 in north east hampshire we have some fantastic example of community investment in renewable hart district council have instal photovoltaic panel on the roof of its office generate as much as kwh of electricity per year which be enough to power around average home every year hart leisure centre have see £ of investment in solar panelling on its sport hall which reduce the demand put on the energy grid as a result of heat the swimming pool 
 if you will permit i a sliding door moment madam deputy speaker my house be build in when this technology be not around have solar panel of today ’s quality be instal then not only would our energy bill have be significantly low but we could have save in the region of tonne of carbon roughly equivalent to london to sydney return flight give the government ’s ambitious house building target and as retrofitting be more expensive than instal at the build stage it make sense to ensure that we do all we can right now to protect our environment to reduce energy bill and to secure this industry for the future 
 each house build without renewable energy be a miss opportunity to save carbon and money and to grow our economy furthermore each house build without solar panel increase the pressure to put panel elsewhere include in our field sustainable energy development be critical but in north east hampshire as elsewhere we do not want it to come at the cost of our countryside and our agricultural land that be why i support this bill which prioritise put solar panel on the roof of new home 
 this be an important debate not only be it about solar but it be about our climate and our environment it matter to i to my generation and to my constituent my constituency mailbag be full of idea about how we get clean energy and message advocate for solar panel so i know my constituent be interested in this debate 
 there be many expert in my constituency just yesterday i sit with a nuclear scientist from wirral west and there be many people who be passionate about the environment in quite brilliant architect colin usher we combine the expertise and the passion he have bring intelligent design to bear in order to build super low energy use home along with triple glazing insulation and intelligent design solar panel play an important part in those home the panel sit on the roof and heat the home and excess energy be sell back to the national grid so brilliant be the design that in the winter month of the people live in these home pay just £ for their energy i hope we can expect future home to meet that high standard 
 i welcome the fact that the government have already make a commitment to develop the next generation of home with high energy standard and efficiency it be well for our pocket and for the planet labour be clear that the crisis in our climate and in nature need serious action that be why in the election we commit to triple solar power by solar energy have an important role and it be a part of gb energy which support our mission to make our country a clean energy superpower we be meet our pledge with action we be approve solar project that will power the equivalent of almost home i note that this government in just week have consent to more solar than the last government instal in an entire year that show the marked difference this government be already make in an area that the whole house be clearly passionate about 
 i be pleased that the minister be develop strong new standard which will combine labour ’s ambition to build high quality home in the right place and the ambition to protect our environment our commitment to action will bring low bill to my constituent that be sorely need after a difficult cost of living crisis last for year which have put pressure on household bill in this way we can really support our constituent through our meaningful action on more sustainable renewable source of energy we be make a difference to our climate 
 it be pretty clear that the climate crisis do not respect rhetoric weapon or border it do not care how many like you get on social medium or how viral your clip go it respond only to action and the action   the government be take give i hope for the future across my constituency people be take action and do their bit to shift we toward clean energy we must meet their ambition for a greener sunnier and more secure future 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for cheltenham max wilkinson   for bring the bill before the house as an environmental campaigner for the past year i very much support any bill include my own climate and nature bill a shameless plug that encourage the shift away from fossil fuel however i do not support every measure that increase the use of renewable which be why the sunshine bill be so important 
 there be good way and less good way to meet our international commitment on carbon emission and climate change a less good way as have already be mention by many hon member be to cover large tract of our countryside in solar panel without the agreement or co operation of local community 
 i welcome the bill but the choice between solar farm and rooftop solar installation be not a sum game they both have a distinct role to play in our most ambitious plan solar farm would account for less than of land cover do the hon lady agree with tom bradshaw president of the national farmers union that solar farm represent a diversification opportunity for farmer that will also be good for the british public 
 i thank the hon member for the good point she raise but i would like to see more solar panel installation that be motivate not by profit but by concern for people and planet that be my concern about some of the very large solar installation we be see propose across the country include in my constituency of south cotswolds we be rightly proud of our beautiful countryside so a proposal for a acre solar farm have provoke outrage and objection from nearby community some of respondent to an early consultation be against the plan some might say that their sacrifice be necessary for the great good but when i put myself in the shoe of nearby resident i can not agree 
 i love my morning walk which help to keep i sane well relatively we need to be encourage people to spend more time enjoy the outdoors with all its benefit for mental and physical health as well as strengthen the relationship between human and the rest of nature when i consider how i would feel if my cherished morning walk through green field be instead go to be a walk through field of black shiny solar panel past hum battery storage facility i would not be happy let we keep our countryside beautiful it add insult to injury for the people of hullavington luckington and sherston to see massive new warehouse and new home spring up with not a solar panel in sight 
 we need to meet our environmental goal in collaboration with people not in opposition to they my climate and nature bill which i will introduce next week emphasise the need for public engagement on our journey to net that journey will not be easy and will only be make   more difficult if people feel that net be something that be be impose on they by corporate interest or government without respect for the wish of nearby resident where ground mount solar may be necessary let we make it small scale and community lead 
 the government ’s housing target mean that my area need new home over the next year which thousand of my constituent be very worried about many of they would be far happy if they know that the property be build would meet the need of local people by be affordable to buy and cheap to run do my hon friend agree that the new homes solar generation bill be not only a no brainer but an essential part of gain public support for house building 
 i wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend 
 we also need to increase our national food security decrease our reliance on vulnerable international food supply chain and depend more on home grow food grow to trusted standard most farmer want to grow food not solar panel the need for a national land use framework be become ever more pressing 
 we need a sensible long term strategy for how we use our finite resource of land space in this country i would like to see a much great emphasis on multipurpose our land area we need to get away from divide up food production housing and electricity generation we can make much well use of our land when we take a multilayered approach to that end it make sense to prioritise rooftop solar ahead of greenfield site some of uk solar target could be deliver on rooftop by generate energy at the source reduce the strain on the national grid improve overall energy resilience and reduce the need for long wasteful grid connection 
 generate energy at the source reduce the strain on the national grid improve overall energy resilience and reduce the need for long wasteful grid connection or rank of electricity pylon march across our countryside retrofit solar panel to house be costly and disruptive it be so much more efficient and effective to install solar at the time of building in europe they get this the eu solar standard require solar panel on new and exist public commercial and residential building the eu ’s goal be to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce dependence on russian fossil fuel and it be work 
 to i the sunshine bill be a win win win it be a win for the uk reduce our need for import energy source and improve our resilience and self reliance it be a win for householder who can reduce their energy bill by generate their own electricity and it be a win for the planet support our transition away from fossil fuel i will wholeheartedly support the sunshine bill 
 i thank   the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   for bring forward this bill which deal with an issue that matter deeply to my constituent and to i this winter we have see the devastating impact that climate change   can have on community and colleague and i have watch in horror as wildfire have spread through california and flooding have impact my constituency and many area across the uk now more than ever we must find way to weave the pursuit of clean home grow energy into everything we do and solar power will make a vital contribution 
 i have have the pleasure of visit many local school in kettering since be elect on every visit child have tell i that they be worried about our local environment and the future of our world and i feel those worry too i be proud to stand on a manifesto that promise to make britain a clean energy superpower and which pledge to double onshore wind triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by i be even prouder to see the progress that this labour government have already make in deliver on those pledge 
 only week after the election when most of we include i still do not know the way from the chamber to portcullis house the secretary of state lift the ban on onshore wind establish the mission control centre and consent to solar project that will generate more than gw enough to power almost home this be clearly a government of delivery who be work to drive forward and increase rooftop solar which where appropriate will help accommodate the government ’s clean power mission 
 the potential for rooftop solar be huge especially in constituency such as mine which be of the fast grow area in the uk and of course where the sun always shin i have be contact by many constituent about this issue and they support the government ’s aim to achieve clean energy by i understand their desire for solar and the need for it on new build warehouse and the ground so i be glad that this government have commit to ensure that local community continue to have a voice in planning matter and that community host clean energy infrastructure will benefit from it 
 the speed of house building in kettering mean that we be no stranger to irresponsible and difficult developer so our commitment to the environment must go hand in hand with planning i know that the government will introduce standard on house building this year to ensure that our new home and building be fit for a net future but we also need to ensure that developer can not shirk their responsibility to the environment and to local resident our house building need to be sustainable so that local people can trust that their need and the need of the environment be be meet 
 the government ’s national planning policy framework be a lesson in how we can deliver the big boost to social and affordable housing in a generation while unlock green energy and recognise the benefit of our good agricultural land and all while make vital commitment to use planning to enhance the natural and local environment protect value landscape and recognise the character and beauty of the countryside 
 i be grateful to have have this opportunity to put on the record my support for rooftop solar and for this government ’s commitment to our environment in kettering and beyond 
 the ° global temperature limit be pass for the time ever in this politically significant milestone be a stark reminder that we must leave no stone unturned as we make the systemic change require to every part of our economy for a safe future rooftop solar be of the easy of the change that we can make as   the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage   say it be a win win win policy that help cut people ’s bill and climate emission and help strengthen our energy security 
 research and development of rooftop solar be already a british success story we be world leader so it be time to take the next step and maximise deployment of on site solar generation in new build that be the aim of the sunshine bill and i be pleased to have co sponsor this proposal to create new job to drive innovation yet far and to generate abundant amount of energy both while the sun shin and as   the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   point out when it do not 
 make solar panel mandatory on suitable new home be almost universally popular other than with some major house builder that be what i want to focus on during the short time available to i solar energy uk estimate that of the gw of solar power capacity currently in place around third be on the ground and the remainder be on residential and commercial roof if we be to meet the government ’s target to ramp up solar capacity which i hope we do we should be look up 
 some of the building that we will have in have already be build so we must work hard to retrofit they with renewable but the remain have still to be build for goodness sake let ’s build they right the time that be where private housing developer come into the mix the british designer and grand designs presenter kevin mccloud write last year that in year time the average profit on each new build home have rocket from £ to £ i call on ministers to stand up to the major house builder and ensure that they pay the cost of put solar on every suitable new roof the organisation renewable uk have calculate that mandatory solar panel and heat pump in new home would add around £ to the cost of a new home an amount that decrease as installation gather speed 
 clearly housing developer can afford that cost and neither they nor anyone else can afford the consequence of not meet our solar or other climate target the los angeles wildfire be on track to be among the costly in us history as well as the most heartbreaking with loss already expect to exceed £ fail to decarbonise at speed in line with the climate science will dwarf the cost of future proof our home the moral case for act be unequivocal and so too be the economic 
 if minister be worried about the risk of solar cost be pass on to homebuyer the government could simply stop that happen they could also offer interest free loan for this technology and make it easy for retail lender to drive rooftop deployment property link finance or green mortgage can help consumer with the capital cost of installation as could regulation to   incentivise low interest rate for green mortgage these be all political choice that the government could make 
 the sunshine bill be not just about solar panel but about forgive i shin some sunlight on who have the power make every home a mini power station would help rebalance that power towards community i therefore very much hope that the government will today choose to back both a solar rooftop revolution and mandatory solar be include in the future home standard rather than choose to protect the vested interest that be behind the vast and ultimately unsustainable house builder profit 
 i thank   the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   for introduce the bill i think it be laudable and its heart be very much in the right place we should think of the climate crisis in all matter of policy and in how we might contribute to the government ’s goal of make britain a clean energy superpower 
 the government guide by the excellent work of the secretary of state for energy security and net be already make great stride in combat the climate crisis put green energy at the heart of the country ’s future and support green industrial growth wherever we can the government have establish great british energy which mean that we will need new green infrastructure soon rather than later when it come specifically to solar energy i be very pleased that within just day of take office the government approve major long stall large solar farm in lincolnshire and east anglia capable of generate gw or enough to power home that be a clear statement of intent and that we can all be very proud of 
 at the same time the secretary of state pledge a rooftop revolution make it easy for newly build home to come with solar panel from the off and to install solar panel on exist home a of our solar generation capacity already come from rooftop solar it be an important part of the energy generation mix and i know that the government fully believe in rooftop solar as i do 
 the hon member talk a lot about the measure that be be put forward in the move towards net but we need to go far cpre hertfordshire say that of our target could be achieve through rooftop solar panel alone and support the bill will help to make sure that that revolution help towards net for our planet and our people 
 i thank the hon member for her intervention and i will cover some of those point shortly i broadly agree with the sentiment of what she say 
 the bill ’s aim in promote the installation of solar panel on all new home feed into the government ’s overall intent and i be pleased about that i note however that it be undeniable that solar farm especially the large one be much more efficient than rooftop solar for a whole spectrum of reason rooftop solar panel be constrain by the size orientation and   structural limitation of individual building while solar farm be optimise for maximum energy generation the difference in output can be as high as economy of scale mean that the cost to install maintain and centralise the supportive infrastructure notably reduce the ratio of cost per unit of energy generate by solar farm that be not to say that i do not support rooftop solar because i very much do but solar farm be a highly scalable cost effective mean through which to achieve the green energy transition 
 be that not exactly the point we need to do both because that create a subsidy for more opportunity to have rooftop solar panel 
 i completely agree it be not about solution versus another but a diverse broad array of solution all feed into a grand greener future 
 the hon gentleman talk about a balance my view be that solar be well on rooftop but if he be so pro solar installation how many acre in his constituency be he actively campaign to see turn into ground mount solar 
 i must say that i declare my support for those project wherever they come up indeed i will touch on some of they in a moment i be recently ask by the medium whether i would be happy to have pylon outside my house to which i respond with a photograph of a pylon take from a window in my house 
 i have long feel that despite the great benefit solar farm bring they have often be too difficult to bring forward the uk have around gw of solar energy generation capacity in germany meanwhile solar capacity grow by gw in alone it be clear that the uk ’s current planning regime and approach to build infrastructure constrain growth and see we lag behind similar nation if we want britain to be a clean energy superpower as i do and lead the green energy revolution rather than just follow it we must tear down the barrier to growth and unlock our potential 
 in my constituency my labour colleague on erewash borough council have in their own small local way help to be part of the change that we need since take control of the council in they have approve several solar farm while the previous conservative administration always block they and i be very proud of my colleague for do so i be also very proud to tell the now energy secretary that information when he visit erewash this time last year the progression of these vital infrastructure project which be pivotal to the future of our country must be drive by a national strategy and not hold up by bureaucracy 
 as i have say the bill ’s proposal be laudable the drive to green energy generation along with this government ’s ambition to make britain a clean energy superpower could be to this decade and to those to come what the race for space be in the 1950 and 1960 country engage in a great contest of scientific innovation and progress there be nothing that i as a former research scientist could welcome more than the government pursue science innovation and technology as a matter of not only core policy but national pride 
 this government be commit to greatly expand our provision of solar energy generation and have acknowledge many time the significant part that rooftop solar have to play in that expansion i hope that supporter of this bill be assure by the government ’s genuine commitment on this front the climate crisis and the housing crisis be both profound issue worthy of the descriptor crisis and in need of immediate action i know that many right hon and hon member share the government ’s commitment to act here as i most certainly do 
 i pay tribute to my neighbour and hon friend   the member for cheltenham max wilkinson   for so boldly take up this cause his so name sunshine bill which to my mind reflect his own disposition so brightly as though it be his own glow cranium—[laughter 
 i may only speculate what it be that attract my hon friend to discuss a bill regard the promotion of shiny surface atop well build structure we can only guess do he agree that as this bill move forward it be absolutely essential that the government work across party to build a consensus include all those expert and those passionate in this subject and to work together to ensure that it be successfully deliver for the betterment of all our resident 
 my hon friend have so eloquently put across the pragmatism that we can enjoy from liberal democrats in work across party for the benefit of our constituent and i thank he for that 
 this undertaking by my hon friend the member for cheltenham have be bring up consistently on doorstep across the tewkesbury constituency in recent year widely consider to be a blindingly obvious antidote to rise energy bill and the phasing out of fossil fuel people have tend to ask with an exasperate tone why on earth new home be not build with solar panel by mandate as my hon friend have describe the public roundly support such measure with poll register support whether or not the new homes solar generation bill go to a vote today i hope that the government will recognise the alignment with their environmental pledge and that they will take the ball and run with it 
 i thank   the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   for introduce this bill rooftop solar panel be a huge area of huge potential on such a grey day i also thank he for bring all the sunshine 
 i be pleased that the government be already explore rooftop solar panel on new build house in the clean power action plan which aim to have at least of great britain ’s electricity produce by clean energy by the government relaunche the solar taskforce quickly after the general election bring together expert from the government and industry   the taskforce ’s road map be due to be publish in the spring and it will set out recommendation for how we can triple the uk ’s solar capacity by i look forward to that 
 the pylon issue have be bring up i grow up and live in a home under a pylon for nearly year and i do not think it have do i any harm i know that the government be due to introduce further standard later this year they will set our new home and building on a path away from reliance on volatile fossil fuel and they will ensure that those home and building be fit for a net future i be sure the minister will expand on that 
 as well as new build it be important that people know that assistance package be out there to help they with instal solar panel on exist home that include the energy company obligation the warm home local grant and the warm home social housing fund owner of solar panel can also be pay for the surplus electricity their solar panel generate through the smart export guarantee and there be a rate of vat on residential solar panel 
 much of what have be cover in this debate be devolve although member may not have know that i be welsh to my constituent in gower and across wales i point to the welsh government ’s nest programme which can provide free energy efficiency improvement include solar panel to those eligible 
 the bill state that it 
 extend to england and wales 
 of course the hon member for cheltenham will be aware that building regulation be devolve what conversation have he have with the welsh government or members of the senedd about this i be sure that the welsh labour government would be delighted to work alongside the uk labour government they probably be already do so to ensure that home be more energy efficient and that our constituent have the opportunity to save money on their bill 
 the important thing about the path forward be that the government should work with house builder to get the good outcome for both our environmental target and our housing target we must also build high quality sustainable and affordable home as have be mention by many the scope of the bill do not cover roof other than those on new build so i highlight the need for solar panel on all roof as   the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale   say we must take the agricultural land that we need for food to feed our country into consideration and we must strike a fair and right balance i know that   the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage   have also raise that issue i feel very passionately that we must not do down or the other 
 we must be aware that there be problem particularly with tenant farmer and how they be be treat by company where there be bad actor i know that our government my government will seek to find they i hope that the government will work in collaboration with farmer who may need to have a blend and have solar farm on their land as well as with tenant farmer i know that the government be commit to find a workable way forward on this issue i thank the hon member for cheltenham for the chance to highlight it in this debate and for the sunshine he have bring 
 as the liberal democrat spokesperson for energy security and net i be delighted to support the private member ’s bill of my hon friend   the member for cheltenham max wilkinson the sunshine bill madam deputy speaker i be beam 
 south cambridgeshire be of the fast grow constituency in the country in term of house building and lab space people constantly say to i why be all of these new home without solar panel on their roof or why do these new home only have or solar panel or only on part of the roof sadly in developer be still require only to meet not exceed the merton rule ’s inadequate energy improvement standard that be why liberal democrat councillor in my constituency have be push hard to change this at the local level in fact in the year since they take control of the council south cambridgeshire have rapidly become the district with the high number of solar panel fit and with the fast increase in planning application that include solar panel 
 it be the lack of ambition and political will at the national level that have hold back the revolution in solar rooftop that be why we be still build home that be cold and damp and that have skyrocket energy bill the former conservative government disgracefully scrap the carbon home policy and dither and delay on the future home standard 
 early   the hon member for waveney valley adrian ramsay   lament in good faith the drawdown of environmental pledge in of course that be not the coalition government what we see and what we get be what happen when the liberal democrats be no long there to hold people to account 
 it will not surprise anyone to hear that i agree wholeheartedly the record have be correct it be vital that the bill help to repair that damage and we look forward to the minister ’s commitment to bring about these change 
 as have be mention the lack of ambition on the solar rooftop revolution have contribute to the barrier to public acceptance of large scale solar farm we be hear people say why not put panel on the rooftop of home industrial site and commercial warehouse we need a join up plan we need the government urgently to bring forward the much promise land use framework and the national energy system operator ’s strategic spatial energy plan which will show how much solar farm energy be still need and where it would be well place in that way we can meet all our need 
 the bill be our chance to get this right it be our chance for a clean green and more secure future that address the triple cost of living housing and climate crisis and take people with we i congratulate my hon friend the member for cheltenham 
 i thank   the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson   for bring this sunshine to the chamber today 
 the horrific wildfire rag in california and the recent flooding that we see provide yet more reminder that urgent action be need to tackle the climate and   nature emergency i be proud that under this labour government the uk be once again show climate leadership we know that we can not tackle the housing crisis without tackle the climate crisis nor can we achieve our core growth mission or increase living standard without acknowledge the huge impact of climate change 
 the build environment be responsible for of emission and decarbonise our housing stock be essential as a member of the all party parliamentary group on climatetech which be chair by my hon friend   the member for exeter steve race i be pleased to attend a recent event in parliament where we meet start up work on innovative solution to decarbonise the build environment the government ’s steadfast commitment to this agenda and to policy such as great british energy and the warm home plan be warmly welcome by the business i meet
