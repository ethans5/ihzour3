it be indeed a special occasion to be there today for his majesty ’s king ’s speech and particularly to see he continue the remarkable tradition of service and duty of his late mother our dearly miss queen   elizabeth i declare my interest in relation to the armed force in ukraine and my role as co chair of the lgbt+ parliamentary labour party and the relevant appg 
 the speech today as an occasion be very special the content i be afraid be far from that it be short it be inadequate and it simply do not rise to the challenge we face as a country this be fundamentally a government who be out of idea stuck in a high tax low growth economy they have abandon their promise in many area and fail to invest in our public service and instead engage in cheap divisive politic what a contrast with the clear mission lead agenda set out by the leader of the opposition which would be at the heart of a future uk labour government 
 it be always there in the talk point for ministers at the dispatch box and we hear some barracking today from conservative back benchers but i be feed up with the cheap shot and the talk down of wales that we regularly hear from the government benches there be a stark contrast between what we have see from this tory government at the uk level and what we have see from a labour lead government in wales and indeed from my labour lead council in cardiff and the vale of glamorgan i have see the reality on the doorstep and in my community i have see new school be build such as eastern high and penarth learning community i have see a new further education college i have see new hospital facility be build at llandough i have see new station be build right at this moment on a metro line into cardiff bay 
 i have see new economic investment in our city centre and bay indeed as the topic of homelessness have be so shamefully speak about by the home secretary i have also see labour council in cardiff and the vale of glamorgan build new sustainable housing to deal with the challenge face those who tragically find themselves on the street that be what we need to see action on housing and action on homelessness not divisive and shameful comment from the home secretary the leader of the opposition be absolutely right to highlight that 
 i be conscious that there be always more to do i have be out and about in my constituency in cardiff south and penarth in the last few week engage with lot of different community and lot of different concern we continue our campaign to see a new station build in st mellons the st mellons parkway station i have be raise concern about poor performance on the great western main line i have be argue for reform to and the protection of local bus service i have be listen to the concern of those on low income struggle to make end meet include local taxi driver and those struggle with their energy bill and the rent and mortgage hike as a result of the conservative government i have also be meet those concerned about local gp service we need adequate and fit for the future service across cardiff and penarth but of course that can only come with adequate investment across the united kingdom and a co operative relationship between a uk government hopefully a uk labour government and a welsh labour government along with welsh labour council in wales 
 of the stark contrast in approach between wales and those of we on the labour benches and the current government be on climate change and the green transition the government have abandon target   and be go backwards when we need to be move forward with green transition green job green investment sustainable housing and adaptation community in my local area in place such as sully and dinas powys be already experience the consequence of severe flooding and rainfall event but i also see the opportunity for example in green steel the recycled steel already in produce in my constituency and in green industry and green technology of the future many be pilot at our fantastic university in cardiff and south wales 
 let i turn to some of the other issue in the king ’s speech on leaseholder reform i be interested to see the detail of the proposal there have be a lot of cross party work on the issue and concern raise on behalf of many constituent i have many leaseholder ten of thousand in my constituency who have be struggle with defective building fire and building safety issue extortionate and often inexplicable service charge and be catch in mortgage prison there be a whole industry around conveyancing survey and so on which have fail many of my resident who find themselves catch up in untenable situation in particular i have meet some of they in recent week who have be tell i about shocking service charge which i be try to follow up with management company company be still fail to move forward quickly enough or indeed at all on remediation and to take responsibility for their failing in the construction of building particularly in cardiff bay 
 i raise concern with the welsh government on those issue but we need co operative action across the united kingdom a lot of the problem predate devolution the leasehold system be decade and decade old i think hundred of year old i want bills on this issue to come forward in this place with co operation between official at the department for levelling up housing and communities and the welsh government not the silly political gameplaying we have see unfortunately from some conservative there be a willingness the welsh government be take a constructive approach let we see that meet from the other side to benefit my resident and the resident of member from across the house 
 we also need to look at what be miss from the king ’s speech i could talk about that for hour but i want to highlight issue in particular be of course the ban on conversion therapy that we be promise again and again and again by the government conversion therapy be a despicable abusive practice frankly the fact that it be not include in the speech be a betrayal not only of the victim of conversion therapy across the country but of all the campaign group and all the cross party cross religious and cross community group who have argue for it to be ban conversion therapy be a dangerous life threaten practice that lead to decade of consequence for those who go through it i contrast that again with labour ’s commitment to a fully inclusive ban on conversion therapy 
 i be sorry to say this follow on from a debate we have in westminster hall in the previous session just a few week ago that this do not come as any surprise despite some very passionate speech from conservative members i acknowledge that there be member in that debate from i think all party in the house and from all part of the united kingdom the government have abandon their lgbt+ action plan and disband their lgbt+ advisory board i be tell by a home   office minister that we be hysterical for raise concern about the significant rise in hate crime face by the lgbt+ community the government be fail lgbt+ people and be instead use this issue as part of their divisive culture war it be simply unacceptable and i know that many conservative members indeed many minister i be tell feel exactly the same way 
 another area miss from the king ’s speech a deep shame give the motion that be pass unanimously by the house be an issue i raise a few week ago legislation on the seizure of russian state asset to repurpose they for reconstruction in ukraine the motion we pass be for legislation to be pass in   day the king ’s speech would have be an apt opportunity albeit a little bit late but it be absent again what be happen i hope the government will have some answer soon 
 i have to say and it be good to see my right hon friend   the member for wentworth and dearne john healey   the shadow defence secretary on the labour front bench that it be deeply disappointing to hear the prime minister ’s divisive comment about the armed force and security they be a disservice to those on the labour benches who have serve as well as to family and community the reality be that labour fully support nato and fully support our independent nuclear deterrent we want security co operation with nato as our bedrock across europe our atlantic partner and other ally this government have slash the army waste billion and leave those who serve we bravely in afghanistan languish in hotel for month and month on end at great cost to the public purse it would be nice to see a bit more of a consistent approach and more truth about labour ’s position we will defend this country we will defend our armed force and we will work to support our veteran as we rightly should particularly as we be come up to remembrance sunday this weekend 
 i normally talk from the opposition front bench on international issue but i want to reflect as a constituency mp on some of the challenge face the world at the moment that be important in a constituency such as mine because of its nature as a port and have have people come from all over the world for over year what happen elsewhere in the world in israel and palestine afghanistan sudan libya the sahel south asia yemen nigeria syria and many many other region and country matter deeply to my constituent in the past week i have hear from constituent about their anguish at the death loss of civilian life and destruction in gaza and their horror at the terrorism hostage taking and kill that israel and its citizen have have to endure i have hear about the need to ensure we protect civilian aid worker hospital and school to secure humanitarian pause and get humanitarian aid in particularly into gaza and to move back to a pathway to peace and a state solution and to an adherence to international law and international humanitarian law i have also with other hon member and neighbour in cardiff and the vale of glamorgan hear face to face from those who have family who be directly affect in both gaza and israel a genuine fear about what division can mean for we in our community 
 i be also proud of the resilience and response from community in cardiff south and penarth whether in raise fund for aid and relief effort in many different   situation around the world include in the middle east at the moment or in work to promote inter faith and inter cultural dialogue here in the uk that be absolutely critical when we be face with a shocking rise in antisemitism and islamophobia and a wide rise in race and religious hate crime 
 i want to conclude by say that this weekend i see community in my area at their very good i join indian hindu sikh and other community celebrate diwali together i join a very diverse group of christian and other faith community who be celebrate with the greek orthodox church year of the greek and greek cypriot community in cardiff south and penarth i also meet young muslims and other with citizens wales to discuss their hope and aspiration for the future we need more dialogue in this country and less division i would hope that that would be the heart of any government ’s programme i know it would be the heart of a labour government ’s programme

 message to attend his majesty deliver by the lady usher of the black rod 
 the speaker with the house go up to attend his majesty on their return the speaker suspend the sitting 
 the house have direct the speaker to make a statement at the beginning of each session about the duty and responsibility of hon member i begin by remind hon member of their duty to observe the code of conduct agree by the house and to behave with civility and fairness in all their dealing the behaviour code apply to member as it apply to other who visit or work within parliament and it provide very clear guidance unacceptable behaviour will be deal with seriously independently and with effective sanction

 i now come to the accuracy of member contribution which be more tricky the speaker do not have the power to police the accuracy of members—[hon member shame it may be a shame but these be the fact the speaker do not have the power to police the accuracy of member contribution include those of ministers it be therefore incumbent on member to be accurate in what they say in this house but if a member be inaccurate by mistake they should correct that mistake as soon as possible 
 let we now turn to courtesy and temperate language member must also be mindful of the impact of what we say not only on other member but on those who follow our proceeding and member should be hear courteously whatever their view i draw the house ’s attention to the guidance on rule of behaviour and courtesy in the house of commons a new version for this session be now available clarify those area 
 turn to criticism of members in this place we be honourable member and the language we use about each other should reflect that if a member fall short of the standard expect of we all there be way of deal with that but not by accusation make as sideswipe during question or debate if we fail to treat each other with respect in debate that diminish our work but it also risk raise the temperature of discussion outside this place particularly on social medium which already too often descend into online abuse against hon member 
 it be so important that hon member be able to raise matter with i freely for that reason i keep such correspondence confidential include application for urgent question i remind member that it be equally important that my response particularly on matter of privilege be treat with the same respect i hope that certain member be listen 
 i also wish to give some advice about seek to speak within the chamber the deputy speakers and i take into account a number of factor when determine whom we call during business that be not ballot and factor we consider carefully be how often a member speak in other word if you have speak much more   than a colleague then other thing be equal that colleague be more likely to be call or certainly more likely to be call early especially in the next debate for which you both apply hon member poor jim do not worry i be come to he laughter 
 i know that it can be frustrating not to be call in a debate or to be call very late that frustration may continue but put it on twitter be not a good way of try to be call early my response will be that i can not call you early because you have already tell the world so think carefully before use twitter to try to intimidate the speaker prioritise debate question time urgent question and statement in which you seek to participate be way of try to avoid that happen 
 now that we have start a new session the reset button start everybody ’s score at that even include jim shannon—[laughter i should make it clear that when count score different principle apply to front benchers from the large party who be nominate to speak on behalf of their party staff in my office be happy to offer further advice and help

 scarborough and whitby have to be the good constituency in the country of course mr speaker it have a head start by be in yorkshire they say you should never ask someone if they be from yorkshire because if they be they be bind to mention it in the minute and if they be not why humiliate they unnecessarily i be pleased to see our colleague in the scottish national party sport the white rise of yorkshire today although i must point out that yorkshire day be   august so not for the time they have get thing wrong 
 the arrival of the railway create scarborough as our seaside destination and we be still britain ’s premier coastal resort and only to london for the number of visitor in fact there could be more if some of the £ recoup from hs2 could be redeploy on dualle the a64 culturally we be the home of sir alan ayckbourn and also the birthplace of the mccain oven chip as well as plaxton ’s coach and   the electric bus that we be increasingly see on the street in place such as blackpool that be if the labour council there do not order chinese one whitby be famous for bram stoker ’s dracula the goth weekend and of course fish and chip from the famous magpie restaurant although i hasten to add that that be not the only place you can get good fish and chip in whitby

 i do not know if you have notice mr speaker but we seem to be have a lot of by election at the moment—[hon member more not so fast it be a by election in ryedale in that whet my appetite for frontline politic the seat be hold with a thump conservative majority but it fall to the liberals with a swing give elizabeth shields a vote margin while the rest of the liberal party be go back to their constituency to prepare for government i be not go to put up with the situation so rather naively i put my name forward along with other to be the candidate at the subsequent general election i be not select but do come to john greenway who for member who do not remember or who be not even bear i be look at   the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather win the seat back only month later with a majority the moral be do not count your chicken on the basis of by election result 
 not put off my next move be to try to find a safe labour seat to fly the flag for margaret thatcher live in the north east there be no shortage of rock solid labour citadel place like sedgefield hartlepool bishop auckland north west durham and redcar and it be in redcar that i be select to challenge the wonderful mo mowlam by then john major have take over from mrs thatcher when that happen i remember my child ask i daddy be it really possible that a man can be prime minister we have now have woman conservative premier assume the most recent count of course and we now have the prime minister who represent a yorkshire seat be that a big deal it certainly be i must say that my right hon friend   the member for richmond yorks   rishi sunak could not be a well neighbour or well friend to i 
 labour be well ahead in the poll in the run up to the election and mo have a car at the count with the engine run ready to take she down to sit in neil kinnock ’s cabinet as northern ireland secretary but once again the poll be wrong 
 i stand in north west leicestershire in the blair landslide election which i will quickly pass over suffice it to say that both seat in which i stand redcar and north west leicestershire eventually return conservative members i like to think that the goodwill effect be a slow burn 
 after what i will call a year sabbatical in the european parliament i be select to stand for scarborough and whitby a seat that have be consistently blue since but have be red in both and even though the exit poll say i would lose we manage to prevail on   may   and i enter the house at last i put our victory down to decide factor on the eve of poll of all the place that tony blair could have choose for his big election rally he choose scarborough maybe the leader of the opposition could indulge i next time round and come to scarborough on the eve of the poll to see if he can replicate the blair effect or well still he could have a rally in sheffield and go the full kinnock 
 at the following election i be the victim of a fly poster campaign all over town there be a4 photocopy ask what be the difference between robert goodwill and a supermarket trolley the local newspaper pick up on this and conclude that a supermarket trolley have a mind of its own i must admit that i have never vote against the tory whip so that might explain it however have be here a while i can now reveal the real answer to the question the difference between an mp and a supermarket trolley be that there be a physical limit to the amount of food and drink that you can get into a supermarket trolley 
 i certainly welcome the bills that have be announce in particular i would like to see convict criminal attend their sentencing life for some of the most severe crime must mean life fairness be part of what it mean to be british and we must ensure that the dynamic between freeholder and leaseholder be intrinsically fair in the same way as we should show equal respect for landlord and tenant when they be do the right thing i be pleased to see that the ban on live animal export for slaughter will happen now we be outside the european union and have the freedom to do that those who be successful in the ballot for private member bills will not be short of other suggestion both from the department for environment food and rural affairs and from animal welfare organisation to carry forward some important measure in that area which i know be important to the government the bill to tackle unlicensed and uninsured pedicab which can rip off unsuspecting tourist be not before time 
 today ’s focus be on the legislative agenda but we can not ignore what be go on outside our border the butchery we see from hamas on   october   be evil beyond anything most of we could even imagine and yes bbc these thug be terrorist if those atrocity have be on our soil and against our people we would have be expect to launch a robust response israel have that right too indeed what else do hamas expect would happen the conflict in ukraine may be off the front page but we must not waver in our support for the courageous ukrainian people 
 good government be not so much about how many law we have and how many new law we announce but about how we respond to change and unexpected event such as the pandemic hindsight be a wonderful thing but the prime minister ’s furlough scheme and help for business be the right thing to do the universal credit system be also robust in the face of unprecedented demand 
 with small boat crossing of the channel down by more than a year on year we be make progress in curb the organise criminal gang engage in this dangerous exploitative trade furthermore if we can stand up the rwanda scheme it will be a game changer our help should be for those most in need not those most able to pay 
 finally i come to a true story from the winter general election i hear your stricture about be truthful to the house mr speaker and this absolutely happen of the strong labour area in my patch be a former council estate call eastfield we usually go there early in the campaign to get it out of the way but this time it be different people be cross the street to shake my hand they have vote for brexit and want to get it do and they be sick of be ignore when my wife maureen knock on door the lady who answer be effusive in her admiration for prime minister johnson when i arrive i ask she why she be so enthusiastic she say boris be of we when i politely point out that he have be to eton and oxford she reply you do not understand he have a row with his wife and the police come round that ’s what happen on this street all the time laughter 
 i commend the gracious speech to the house 
 it be an honour to the loyal address and i be proud that the stroud constituency be play its part in history give that this be the state opening by his majesty the king the late queen be an inspiration for everyone across this great nation for member of this house she remind we that despite the melodrama of politic we be all here to serve the public the king be already follow in his mother ’s footstep and make we all proud although when i tell my non political family that i be go to be talk about the king ’s speech the response i get be oh great that ’ a really good film laughter 
 talk about hard act to follow my right hon friend   the member for scarborough and whitby sir robert goodwill   have i do a fair few lol i know exactly the area he be talk about he have definitely land that promotion with that speech in his final furlong we have many connection which i will touch on today but scarborough athletic fc will play stroud ’s forest green rovers in the fa cup next week so we have another rumble to come i know my right hon friend will be miss when he get his pipe and slipper out to retire next year but his lovely new grandchild will keep he very busy 
 i go to school in my right hon friend ’s constituency if i could tell the young i in scarborough a young fashionista wear spice girl platform adidas trackie bottom and a hand umbro jumper it be a very strong look although i be grateful that there be no camera phone then that i would have the privilege of represent the beautiful constituency of stroud speak ahead of the prime minister after be in the same room as the king and the queen i think young i would have think i have lose the plot what do the conservative party do for a free school meal kid who leave home at and do not go to university it give she   a seat at the most famous palace in the world lead by the son of a pharmacist who be also lead the most diverse cabinet we have ever know 
 the public service bit of this job motivate i but that be not what hit the headline i be often ask how do you survive with everybody backstabbe do their own thing and out to get each other i just smile and say i do not hang around with the labour party interruption i love you all really to be honest the parliamentary labour party have absolutely nothing on the stroud labour party whose member have all resign or fall out with each other what i actually say be that to survive in this place you have to find some friend and then fully expect they to push you into the thames in the run up to a reshuffle 
 we also get new friend for very short period of time come select committee election i sort of miss the daily message from   the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne his text message be less famous than his scary handwritten note about the economy but they be still persistent 
 back to navigate a workplace that be mad as a box of frog early on i come up with operation green benches whereby i shun history book and hansard and research parliamentary sketch instead because i love they quentin letts once write that the area of the government benches where i be now sit be the naughty corner so that sort out where i would sit it sound fun and he be right 
 i then realise that identify the loud colleague to sit with and effectively hide behind could be crucial to avoid the wrath of the speaker my right hon friend   the member for elmet and rothwell alec shelbrooke   seem to fit that bill he be describe as be expansively waistcoate and have lung like bagpipe perfect he be not in his place he be watch at home on the tellybox but no doubt he be wear a waistcoat 
 my hon friend   the member for north dorset simon hoare   and my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland   be often depict as noisy and boisterous those appear to come free with bagpipe lung in a creative bogof style deal that probably should be ban but this strategy have serve i well and give i a slightly dysfunctional but always hilarious and caring chamber family whom i love dearly the other gloucestershire mp be also guide light not least my right hon friend   the member for forest of dean mr harper who teach i that consistent rebelling do not hinder ’s career it ’ okay chief whip i ’m not go to follow that lead 
 my kid come to work with i so they support i in their own chaotic way gigi age dress as a witch on hallowe’en she merrily skip up the step of house turn to i and say loudly mummy this be just like canvass then the door open and she go trick or treat and i say i blame those cchq canvass scripts”—an absolute disaster 
 a myriad of female colleague naturally support each other on both side of the house i especially congratulate my hon friend   the member for brecon and radnorshire fay jones   on her wedding at the weekend she look absolutely radiant and i wish she and her husband a long happy life together 
 i be chuff to be the mp from stroud to be ask to the loyal address stroud with its valley and vale be gorgeous so please visit we have the quirky bit of the cotswolds with a creative innovative and industrial spirit throughout people rightly expect a lot of their public servant in our neck of the wood so i mainly sit in the house of commons library as other know deal with endless amount of casework and correspondence i be have some success i be steadily chip away at year old problem such as tricorn house and accessibility at stroud station and at new challenge include rush skatepark and stroud maternity ’s postnatal bed 
 people take the mick out of i sit in the library but i really like it it be never dull my hon friend   the member for totnes anthony mangnall another denizen of the library excitedly texte i day say come see my tortoise i have hear about these public schoolboy and how they like to give nickname to thing so it be not without fear and trepidation that i come into his bit of the library to see his tortoise happily mr speaker it be actually your tortoise that i get to see he be eat merrily on the terrace may i also say that your decision to add giant cat and other creature to this already odd place be very welcome 
 i listen carefully to what his majesty the king have to say early it be customary to be jolly in second a speech but we all know that these be difficult time to hear that the government ’s focus be on security challenge both domestic and international be extremely important thereafter i can get behind all action to increase economic growth and help our constituent with day to day pressure or injustice by way of an example stroud constituent should not be rip off by rogue property management company i commend the campaign work of local people and my hon friend the members for north east bedfordshire richard fuller and for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken to get leasehold reform and protection for homeowner on the agenda 
 the king ’s comment about put people in control of their future and the focus on town regeneration give i hope for high street business and fantastic area such as berkeley and stroud town with the prime minister grip artificial intelligence and new technology we be poised and ready to fly with innovation in renewable hydrogen internal combustion engine nuclear and many other science technology engineering and math field 
 the government ’s nhs long term workforce plan must get lift off if we be to help stroud maternity midwive i have long campaign for more apprentice as well so let we get rid of all barrier in further education my excellent friend and constituency neighbour my right hon and learn friend   the member for cheltenham alex chalk will clearly have a lot to do as secretary of state for justice but i still hope that he will look closely at family law reform to keep case involve child out of the court system although i be not expect new childcare announcement i urge the whole government to get behind the chancellor ’s investment in family by urgently boost the early year workforce 
 his majesty the king say that the government will lead on action to tackle biodiversity loss with cop28 approach the prime minister should get familiar   with wwt slimbridge ’s flamingo on our patch i will take all the help that i can get to have a dedicated domestic wetland team and strategy in the department for environment food and rural affairs if he be not persuade flamingo be absolutely marvellous for that wonderful instagram account of his the king be the wwt president and wetland can genuinely help we to reach our net target 
 i say early that public service be a privilege and i genuinely mean it it give we the chance to change thing for everyday family and champion those who deserve and need our support it also allow the hard work prime minister that i have know and i have know quite a few recently even my baby have meet prime ministers by the time she be month old to show the country week in week out how we can bring long term change against global headwind and i this loyal address 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 before i turn to the humble address i be sure the whole house will join i in pay tribute to his majesty the king on the occasion of his gracious speech as our sovereign of course he give the speech last year and have for some time enjoy the good view in the house on how it should be do none the less this be a new chapter for he and our country so we pay tribute to he 
 i also congratulate both the mover and seconder of the humble address for their fantastic speech   the right hon member for scarborough and whitby sir robert goodwill   once again show we his deep love for his constituency and deliver a truly great speech he have be a good servant and be well respect across the house but he be now want again on his farm i can inform the house that he be also of this country ’s lead steam engine enthusiast and the proud owner of a fowler k5 plough engine which be not a tractor but be none the less a beautiful machine that on a good day when he really step on it can still give the transpennine express a run for its money however i warn he to be careful there be some weird and wonderful detail in all those network north announcement and the prime minister might commandeer his fowler for illustrative purpose only of course 
 it be great to hear   the hon member for stroud siobhan baillie   make a powerful speech to this house it be only right that the prime minister select someone with good sense to the humble address and so of course he have to turn to a working class lawyer with a connection to camden i can say from personal knowledge and from many people in camden that as a camden councillor she be respect across party as she be here a year ago she rightly point out that 
 there be many way to boost domestic energy security use nuclear solar marine energy and onshore wind 
 an argument that show exactly why she have a bright future within her party it be a shame that instead of choose she to the humble address the prime minister do not ask she to write the energy section of the king ’s speech 
 we be lucky enough not to have lose any member of this house since the last address but as we approach the end of this cycle it be only right that we once again remember those whom we all still miss so much who leave we early in this parliament on the opposition benches we lose our beloved friend jack dromey a champion of work people for the age on the government benches we lose dame cheryl gillan james brokenshire and of course sir david amess who be take from we in the vilest and cruell of circumstance we on the opposition benches still mourn the loss of jo cox of our bright light year ago now in similar fashion so we reach out across the aisle and say of sir david as do the plaque put up in the chamber in recent week his light remain 
 mr speaker it be also customary to welcome new member to the house although give that you be a stickler for parliamentary time limit that could be difficult i welcome all new member to the of these debate for the conservative party for the liberal democrats and for labour those be victory that show without question that britain be ready for change victory that have reduce the conservative party now nearly year in power to the desperate spectacle of claim that it offer change away from itself 
 today ’s speech show just how ridiculous that posturing be because what we have before we be a plan for more of the same more sticking plaster more division more party country gimmick and no repudiation of the utterly discredit idea that economic growth be something that the few hand down to the many in fact today we reach something of a new low because the conservatives be not even pretend to govern any more they have give up on any sense of service they see our country ’s problem as something to be exploit not solve in do that they underestimate the british people because what britain want be for they to stop mess around and get on with the job people want action not inaction solution to real problem not the imaginary one that haunt the conservative party ’s imagination a government who be commit to the national interest not desperately try to save their own skin 
 our school be crumble waiting list be rise river and stream be die infrastructure be be cancel violent criminal be be release early the conservatives mortgage bombshell be blow up the finance of million growth be set to be the low in the g7 next year and taxis be high than at any time since the war the prime minister raise they himself time the tory recipe for british decline low growth high tax crumble public service with the prime minister serve up more of the same 
 of course there be step we can welcome jade ’s law martyn ’s law and an independent regulator in football we have say that on smoking and public health the prime minister can count on our vote we will always serve the national interest that be why this house have stand unite in our support for ukraine since the start of putin ’s aggression and we must never lose our resolve or focus 
 the speech mention the terrible event in israel and palestine it be now month exactly since the senseless murder of jews by the terrorist of hamas and the taking of hostage on   october every new day in   gaza bring with it more pain more suffer more agony hostage be still hold thousand of civilian be dead include so many innocent woman and child million be struggle for the basic of life food water sanitation medicine and fuel we can not and we will not close our eye to their suffering we need a humanitarian pause now and for the hostage to be release now israel have the right and duty to defend herself but that be not a blank cheque it must comply with international law this house must commit to do whatever it can to keep alive the light of peace so we welcome the clear commitment in the speech to support the state solution 
 to return once more to the conservatives plan for britain the big question be how they think that this be anywhere near good enough after all the chaos they have unleash after level up no rule be break we ’re all in it together and all the other broken promise of the last year this be the plan that they put to the work people of this country and say trust we we ’ve change it ’ laughable they can not see britain that be the only possible conclusion the wall of this place be too high but let i assure the house that britain see they and britain see today that they offer no change on public service no change on the cost of living crisis and no change to the economic model that have fail to give work people the security and opportunity that they deserve that be the change that britain need and today be a missed opportunity 
 we need a king ’s speech that would draw a line under year of tory decline a king ’s speech for national renewal and a serious plan for growth but instead we have a party so devoid of leadership that it be happy to follow a home secretary who describe homelessness as a lifestyle choice and believe that the job of protect we all from extremist the most basic job of government be legitimate terrain for her divisive brand of politic as director of public prosecutions i work closely with the police and counter terrorism force their job be hard enough already without the home secretary use it as a platform for her own ambition i say to the prime minister think very carefully about what she be commit your government to do and think very carefully about the consequence of put great demand on public servant at the coalface of keep we safe because without a serious home secretary there can be no serious government and he can not be a serious prime minister 
 homelessness be a choice it be a political choice constant u turn on no fault eviction be political choice not face up to the blocker of aspiration on the government benches be a political choice and it be not that there be n’t well choice on the opposition benches we have a plan to build home across the country with a reform planning regime that will unlock our potential because you can not fix homelessness without increase the supply of housing you can not boost growth unless worker have the home they need and you can not escape the cost of live crisis unless there be more affordable housing 
 we all know why the prime minister find himself in this position but if he be prepared to stand up to the blocker and if he show he can radically improve the   supply of housing by bring back national housing target then yes he can count on labour vote because that be what this country need most a credible plan for growth a britain where growth come from the grassroot and growth serve the grassroot with high living standard in every community an ambition that can only be deliver if we roll up our sleeve and get build at the moment just to get a tunnel build in this country can require a planning application time long than the complete work of shakespeare that be why today we need a planning bill to strip out the red tape and get britain building 
 we also need a bold commitment to train the next generation with new technical college apprenticeship levy reform and expert teacher in every classroom give british business the skill they need we need a modern industrial strategy on a statutory footing with a bill to match a signal of intent to the world that we be serious about fight for the job of the future we need an employment bill time and again this bill have be promise time and again it fail to materialise when we could be scrap fire and rehire end hour contract make work pay with a real living wage and say unambiguously that strong worker right be good for growth what we get instead be an exercise in economic miserabilism an admission that his government have no faith in britain ’s ability to avert decline 
 take the oil and gas bill announce today a bill that everyone in the energy sector know be a political gimmick and even the energy secretary admit will not take a single penny off anyone ’s bill i do not know which of his bin the prime minister chuck her meat tax in but this will follow soon none the less it be a gimmick that tell a story a king ’s speech with no concern for the national interest wallow in a pessimism that say the hard road to a well future be n’t for britain 
 it have be this way for year now a failure to seize the opportunity perhaps even to see the opportunity work people hit because the conservatives do not build the gas storage they do not invest in clean british energy and they scrap home insulation and they be do it all again move the target back and pass it on to the next generation even as cost rise and rise this be stick plaster politic an approach as riven through the foundation of our security as the crumble concrete in our school the never end cycle of tory britain party country drift stagnate decline 
 we have to turn the page the government be wrong about clean energy it be cheap it be british and it can give we real security against tyrant like putin more importantly they be wrong about britain we can win the race for job of tomorrow we can work hand in glove with the private sector and invest in critical infrastructure the gigafactorie the new port and the clean british steel that can once again light the fire of renewal in british industrial community 
 today be the day we could have strike the match for that light embrace a new sense of mission and tackle the cost of live crisis with a new plan for growth there be a chance to get britain build again take back our street get the nhs back on its foot deliver cheap bill with real energy security and tear down    the barrier to opportunity but for the year in a row the government pass it up sever their relationship with britain ’s future and give up on the national interest 
 the speech show with ever great clarity that the only fight leave in the government be the fight for their own skin a government who have give up drag britain down with they ever more steadily towards decline a day on which it become crystal clear that the change britain need be from tory decline to labour renewal 
 i call the prime minister 
 this be the king ’s speech in year and the of his majesty ’s reign which be already define by the same wisdom grace and compassion that mark a long record of service may i take this opportunity on behalf of the whole house to express our admiration and gratitude to his majesty the king 
 before we get into the traditional debate let i address the situation in israel and gaza all of we in the house care deeply about the suffering of innocent people and the scene we have witness we abhor the way in which hamas have use innocent palestinians as human shield it be right that the united kingdom be double our aid funding for palestinian civilian we have be consistent throughout in our call for a humanitarian pause as soon as possible to get aid in and hostage and foreign national out but a unilateral and unconditional ceasefire would simply allow hamas to entrench their position and continue their attack against israel only last week hamas reiterate their intention state clearly 
 we will repeat the october attack time and again until israel be annihilate 
 face with such a threat no country could reasonably be expect not to act 
 last week i speak with prime minister netanyahu to reiterate the united kingdom ’s backing for israel ’s right to defend itself it be the duty of any government i also stress the need to allow more aid into gaza to take all possible measure to minimise civilian casualty and to avoid inflame tension in the west bank where settler violence must stop i can update the house that now well over british national have be able to leave gaza thank to our diplomatic effort to reopen the rafah crossing the development minister will make a full statement to the house tomorrow 
 let i also reiterate this we will not stand for the hatred and antisemitism we have see on our street it sicken i to think that british jews be look over their shoulder in this country and that child be go to school cover up their school badge for fear of attack this government will do whatever it take to keep the jewish community safe just as we will do whatever it take to keep every community safe we will fight hatred and extremism in all its form wherever it be find today tomorrow and always we be the world ’s most successful multi ethnic multi faith democracy and we will protect our democracy from all threat to it 
 this king ’s speech be about what this government be about take long term decision to build a bright future for our country it build on foundation that   be far strong than they be just a year ago inflation fall and on track to be halve an economy now grow fast than france and germany national debt on track to fall more support for the nhs this winter and we be stop the boat with crossing this year down by over a as we ensure that it be this government not criminal gang who decide who come to our country 
 now that we have strengthen the foundation this king ’s speech turn to the future take long term decision with a single objective to change our country for the well change in our economy with new legislation to improve our energy security join a huge trade pact with the fast grow region in the world and prepare to seize the opportunity of a new technological age change in our society with new protection for leaseholder and renter a bill to safeguard the future of football club and fan and the historic legislation that will finally create the smoke free generation and change to keep our nation secure and our community safe with tough sentence for criminal more power for the police and security service and tough new action to clamp down on antisocial behaviour 
 what will all this mean for the british people more job more investment and high growth more police on the street with strong power to keep we safe place people be proud to call home and a country strong at home confident abroad and with a well future ahead for all our people that be the change that this king ’s speech and this government will deliver 
 the loyal address be brilliantly propose by my right hon friend   the member for scarborough and whitby sir robert goodwill i will always be grateful to he because when i be select as the conservative candidate for richmond yorks my right hon friend take a call from a prominent farmer in my local community who have express some consternation about the revelation that i do not eat beef quick as a flash my right hon friend reply do not worry he ’ the perfect candidate there’ll be more for i and thee 
 as a proud yorkshireman my right hon friend have a reputation for be very careful with money just the other day he go shop for a new pair of shoe and when the shop assistant try to throw away the old pair he say hang on a i want to keep those lace there ’ still life in they yet i have often regard myself as a trainee yorkshireman and it turn that out that with he i be also a trainee fiscal conservative that be why i ask my right hon friend to apply his same zeal for saving to efficiency that we could make across whitehall he come back with a great list yorkshire teabag be perfectly fine for another or go the defra thermostat be set far too high at ° and bin be simply far too many 
 my right hon friend be probably the only member of this house who be the proud owner of his own graveyard apparently he even do some of the dig himself no wonder he be such a staunch supporter of the government ’s plan to protect renter he fully support the right of his tenant to be leave undisturbed over the very long long term in his maiden speech my right hon friend proudly boast that whitby in his constituency be 
 vote no weekend holiday destination by the reader of saga magazine”.—[official report   june vol c. 
 i be delighted as my right hon friend retire and lift his gaze from his own copy of saga that he already find himself in the home of blue sky blue water and blue rinse whitby be as he remind we where dracula make landfall that shadowy pale haunt figure age beyond his year and that be what decade in this house can do for you 
 as a government whip a minister in department and a dedicated constituency mp my right hon friend have have an extraordinary career among his many achievement i would particularly highlight his introduction of the ever roadside drug test before that we have no way of clamp down on dangerous drug driving and that landmark policy have save untold number of life it be a legacy he should be proud of and a reminder of the good that politic can do my right hon friend be a great parliamentarian and i be proud to call he a friend his speech be in the fine tradition of this house and his wit integrity and sound good sense will be much miss on all side 
 continue the north yorkshire theme the loyal address be brilliantly second by someone who be also bear and breed in god ’s own county my hon friend   the member for stroud siobhan baillie i be sure the whole house will join i in pay tribute to our fantastic nhs and send our very good wish to her daughter tilly some may think of my hon friend as a shy retire and studious type after all as she say today she often prefer to be in the library but we be discover another side to my hon friend we have hear about her time in the naughty corner and about the spice girl platform i can also reveal today that back in the 1990 she win the prestigious fiercely contest crown of yorkshire rock n roll dancing queen 
 in a rich and varied career my hon friend be also a highly regarded yoga teacher so when she read in the times that the shadow cabinet be be encourage to take up yoga in the office she be wait for the phone call it turn out that no conservative not even as supremely talented as my hon friend can teach the labour party anything when it come to constantly change from contorted position to another 
 my hon friend also mention take advice and inspiration from a certain parliamentary sketch writer if she be hop that day he might make she the target of his acerbic wit i would just say this be careful what you wish for i have be call many thing in my time but i be not sure that i will ever forget be brand 
 the titch in vacuum pack underpant 
 on a serious note my hon friend have already make a huge impact in her short time in this place and nowhere more than in her fantastic campaign to improve childcare provision inspire my right hon friend the chancellor to announce hour of free childcare a week for under four in england in the march budget that landmark policy will make an enormous difference to million of family up and down the country and my hon friend should be incredibly proud of her part in make that happen 
 my hon friend overcome great odd to reach her place today grow up on free school meal she leave home as a teenager and work her way up as a family   lawyer without attend university before become the female mp of stroud in sometimes people ask i what be a conservative be all about and i can think of no great example than that my hon friend be a remarkable person a dedicated mp and someone with a huge future ahead her speech be in the fine tradition of this house 
 let i also thank the leader of the opposition for his contribution to this debate and indeed his u turn of it as a former republican he use to think that this country should not even have a king ’s speech but at least that be u turn the whole country will welcome the right hon and learn gentleman be prone to change his position but in fairness his speech do strike a few consistent note high inflation more strike more immigration and high borrowing the labour party ’s plan to unnecessarily borrow £ more every year and give in to inflation bust pay demand from its union paymaster be dangerous inflationary and the british people would pay the price in high interest rate and high taxis in truth labour will borrow anything people ’s money or people ’s idea and it now turn out that his copy and paste shadow chancellor be happy to borrow other people ’s work too but she be not the only member on the opposition benches to get unstuck by a book early this year the leader of the opposition have to abandon write his own book and return the deposit it be suppose to be his vision for britain but his publisher discover what the british people already know he simply do not have while he stand for the same old idea we be focus on the long term decision that will provide a well and bright future for everyone that be what this king ’s speech will deliver 
 that change start with change our economy we have already deliver the large fall in inflation since the 1980s a fast recovery from the pandemic than germany france and japan and ten of billion of pound of new investment from around the world we believe that the role of government be to create the condition for the private sector to thrive that be where new growth and new job come from it be why we have give business a £ tax cut on investment launch freeport around the uk to create job and investment and introduce legislation in this king ’s speech so that we can confirm our membership of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership a huge trading pact with the fast grow region in the world interruption i hear from those on the opposition benches that it will make no difference we can only do that because of our new freedom outside the european union freedom that the leader of the opposition want to abandon instead lock the united kingdom into a new european deal that would tie we into eu rule and regulation that we would have no say over and open our border to additional eu migrant every single year 
 as well as fail to secure our border the opposition would also fail to secure our energy supply we know that economic growth require energy security we have already invest record amount in renewable such as offshore wind we back sizewell c the new nuclear in decade the king ’s speech introduce new legislation for north sea oil and gas support hundred of thousand of british job we can compare and contrast that with the opposition ’s energy policy 
 will the prime minister give way interruption 
 order member have the right to intervene if the prime minister wish to give way that be up to the prime minister if he wish not to do so that be also fine 
 we can compare and contrast 
 will the prime minister give way interruption 
 order the prime minister be not give way 
 we can compare and contrast the propose new legislation with the opposition ’s energy policy and there be word for it naive that be not my word but that of their own union paymaster i will happily give way 
 i be very grateful to the prime minister bear in mind that a significant proportion of people who sleep rough be army veteran and people with acquire brain injury do the prime minister agree with the home secretary when she say that homelessness sleep rough be a lifestyle choice if he do not will he sack she 
 i be not sure about the link between that and energy security but i can tell the hon gentleman that thank to the effort of my right hon friend   the member for plymouth moor view johnny mercer veteran homelessness be at record low level in this country rough sleeping overall be down by around a since the peak thank to the action of this government and in particular the landmark homelessness reduction act pass by this government which have help relieve or prevent more than people from become homelessness.[official report   november vol c. 6mc 
 return to energy security the opposition want to ban all new oil and gas licence risk our become even more dependent on putin ’s russia for our crucial supply of energy what be even more absurd about their policy be this the leader of the opposition be not against all oil and gas he be just against british oil and gas unlike the opposition who want to pursue net with an ideological zeal go even fast and far no matter what the cost or the disruption we on the conservative benches be cut the cost of net for work people save british family £ £ or £ and that be the choice 
 i be grateful to the prime minister for give way i want to ask he when he will start be straight with the british public he pretend that new oil and gas licence will somehow guarantee our energy security when he know that that oil and gas be sell on international market to the high bidder he pretend that it will get people ’s bill down yet his own secretary of state for energy have say that it will not when will he stop govern by gimmick and when will he start actually roll out the home insulation programme that will get people ’s bill down 
 the hon lady talk about be straight it be the conservative party and i who be straight with the british people about the cost of get to net something that she and the labour party would do well to follow because we have be honest and transparent and have cut those cost we will save british family £ £ or £ 
 indicate dissent 
 order the prime minister give way to the hon lady she should at least do he the courtesy of hear the answer 
 that be the simple choice a government on the side of hard work people or an opposition and the hon lady on the side of the eco zealot 
 if we want truly to change our country we need a strong society that be why this king ’s speech introduce a landmark bill to create the smoke free generation it will prevent death improve people ’s life and free the nhs to support other it be the most significant public health intervention by any government for generation historic change from a historic king ’s speech 
 but that be not all that the government be do for the nhs we have invest record sum create more primary private care appointment and bring more bed and more ambulance through the nhs ’s ever long term workforce plan we will recruit more doctor nurse and dentist than ever before that be what the nhs need not the damaging strike action that labour refuse to condemn even though it be add ten of thousand of people to waiting list every single day the opposition also oppose our plan to provide a minimum safety level during the strike do they and the leader of the opposition think that vulnerable patient do not deserve life save healthcare or be they just too weak to stand up to the union either way the conclusion be clear you simply can not trust labour with the nhs 
 let i turn to the most important part of a strong society education of all that we have achieve since this be what i be most proud of under the labour party only third of school be rat good or outstanding now it be about they take we down the international league table we be now soar up they they devalue apprenticeship we be invest in they they back rip off degree and we be end they we be also introduce the new advanced british standard so that everyone will study math and english to learn a broad range of subject with more hour in the classroom and we will finally break down the barrier between academic and technical education more teacher high standard and more apprenticeship on the government side of the house a strong society be an opportunity society and this conservative government be deliver 
 we can only build that strong society with strong community and that be what this king ’s speech do we be reform the housing market to empower leaseholder and to give renter more security establish a new independent football regulator to give fan a great voice in their club and deliver our promise to level up with record investment in local area we be   build a more home all the while protect the green belt unlike the charter for sprawl that we see from the labour party 
 that bring i to transport every single penny that would have be spend on high speed a repeatedly delay expensive project that fail to meet people ’s real need be now be invest in the north in the midland and right across the country with £ of investment in project that people really need and actually want network north be without question the most ambitious scheme for northern transport that any government have develop ever yet the leader of the opposition be against it then he be for it and now he be not really sure thing be for sure you simply can not trust a word he say 
 none of those important change will mean anything if people do not feel safe in their community the fact be clear it be this government that be on the side of law and order this king ’s speech introduce legislation to well support victim as well as new measure to combat the scourge of antisocial behaviour all build on a proud record of tackle crime—20,000 more police officer on the street more police on the street than ever before interruption we have hear a lot about year but since crime halve violent crime halve burglary also halve antisocial behaviour down by tough sentence for rapist and sex offender which be something the labour party vote against and for the bad offender life finally mean life all while the leader of the opposition and those on the opposition front bench campaign to stop the deportation of dangerous foreign criminal 
 we be just day away from remembrance sunday so let i close by pay tribute to our armed force at this moment over serviceman and woman be deploy overseas from the frozen waste of the high north to the street of kosovo they be the good of we we owe to all our veteran a lifelong debt of gratitude i be proud of our work lead in cabinet by my right hon friend the member for plymouth moor view to make this the good country in the world to be a veteran that be what you get with this government we be on the side of britain ’s armed force we be invest record amount in defence we be an unwavering ally to the ukrainian people and we be proud to be of the large contributor to nato but in contrast mr speaker what do you get with the opposition they try to install—[interruption they never like be remind about it but labour members try to install as prime minister a man who want to abolish the armed force withdraw from nato and back the uk ’s enemy over its ally labour can not be trust with our nation ’s security 
 this king ’s speech build on the strong foundation of an economy well on its way to recovery it reject big government and instead back people and business to thrive it strengthen society with historic measure to support the nation ’s health and education it secure our street and border with tough sentence for criminal and power for police above all this king ’s speech deliver change change in our economy change in our society change in our community it take long term decision for a bright future and i commend it to the house 
 i call the leader of the snp interruption member should please leave quietly 
 thank you mr speaker be it something i say like snaw aff a dyke 
 i wish to begin as be customary by pass on my thank to king charles and the queen for their most gracious speech today i be sure it be a momentous occasion for they both i have be goad a wee bit about my flower but notwithstanding that i intend to start by offer some consensus across the chamber because i believe that be incredibly important in these time in relation to ukraine it be fast approach the year anniversary of vladimir putin ’s decision to enter ukraine in an extremely forceful manner to start a war to kill civilian and to attack ukraine ’s democracy build upon the step that he have take in by invade and annex crimea it have be say in the public domain that the resolve of the west be perhaps shake in the face of the fact that the conflict continue but i think we be all unite across this chamber right across party in our steadfast commitment to the ukrainian people in their fight to protect their democracy against that most abhorrent of tyrant 
 we say that because these be our value it be what we believe in we believe in peace we believe in protect civilian and we believe in democracy of course that view extend beyond just ukraine it extend to the situation in israel and gaza too i know i be at risk of repeat myself here as indeed many of we do in this chamber from time to time but it be important to reiterate that all of we in this chamber be unite in our unequivocal condemnation of what hamas do exactly a month ago there can never be a justification for the senseless killing of man woman and child in the way that that terrorist organisation do what we have see off the back of that on our street be equally not perhaps equally concern we all have grave concern about the rise of antisemitism and the fear so many people have walk the street of these isle i want to send my heartfelt support to all those in the jewish community and to make it very clear if indeed it ever need to be clear that we all oppose antisemitism no ifs and no but 
 finally on that point i think what we all so urgently want to see be diplomacy in action to release the hostage who be still under hamas ’s control there can be as i say in relation to other matter no justification for that and we all want to see those people return to their family as quickly as possible as i have say previously i wish the prime minister well in that diplomatic pursuit 
 the conflict in israel and gaza can not be forget without mention what we be see in gaza itself thousand upon thousand of people have be kill people do not have access to food they do not have access to clean water they do not have access to fuel they can not turn on the light they do not have access to medicine in many instance the hospital they go to no long exist the school they once go to no long exist the university they once go to no long exist what we be see this be perhaps where the agreement across the floor go away be collective punishment what we so badly need to see be a humanitarian ceasefire   no not a humanitarian pause which fill people ’s belly only for they to be blow up in the day to follow what we believe in unequivocally be a humanitarian ceasefire i sincerely hope that member across the chamber will join we in come to that position in the not too distant future because those be our value we believe in peace and we believe in the protection of civilian
