i welcome the move the government have make on this bill it be important that they have do so but they could still go much far 
 i pay tribute to the work of   the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge   on the all party parliamentary group for whistleblowing and to the organisation in this sector that do so much to bring light to what can be a very complex and detailed issue 
 the minister talk about the uk have a reputation for allow legitimate business to thrive but we be here this evening to challenge the other reputation that have build up over the year the uk have now become a hub for dirty money which be funnel through the uk ’s financial system by an army of enabler this bill be an opportunity to dam that flow and to stop this dirty money but as the excellent catch i if you can gap in the register of overseas entities report publish by the london school of economics and cage warwick say 
 there be no point build a dam halfway across a river 
 without close the loophole and the gap that be what this government be do 
 the minister have promise consultation and further thing to come in the future it be fine to dangle these thing before we but we all know that we be head towards an election and the government can not promise to deliver on any of the consultation he hop to bring forward whatever happen there will be an election this house be almost out of time and we should take the opportunity tonight to do this bill right 
 i will run through the lords amendment give the time constraint you mention mr deputy speaker the lords amendment on nominee shareholder be   table by lord vaux and as other member have say there be an awful lot more we could do on that it be not enough for the government just to say as they do in their letter to member that such a measure would most likely be ignore by illegitimate actor and would be difficult to enforce that be not much of a reason not to legislate and not to try there be a real issue with how complex structure have be bring about and the government need to grab hold of it this bill be an opportunity to close a loophole before it be far exploit 
 enforcement be a big part of this and the government do not enforce the current rule say a measure would be difficult to enforce when they be not enforce the rule to begin with do not give we great confidence between and only fine be issue for false filing to companies house as of october only fine of £ have be issue for not file the person with significant control of a scottish limited partnership if the government do not enforce the rule they have bring forward they can not really ask for more rule they need to get real about enforcement they need to make sure the law we pass this evening be effective 
 update to the register of overseas entity be a significant gap in the system as other have say update can take almost an entire year in which time other thing could happen event drive update would hold company to account if we think about it there will be paperwork when company make any change so they might as well do the update at the same time that would be logical 
 lords amendment in the name of lord agnew on the transparency of trust datum on the register of overseas entity make a critical point we must deal with trust without further delay without further consultation and without kick the can further down the road here be the opportunity to do that as transparency international and the bbc show in february trust be be use to hide the ownership of thousand of overseas entity under the current regime they estimate that more than overseas entity on the register about a quarter of the total be hide the ownership of roughly property why would the minister not want to close that loophole why would he not want to improve this system right now 
 it be not as though the government be not warn on this they be talk about consult and do more on it but they be warn about this when we have the joint select committee on the draft registration of overseas entities bill in march professor jonathan fisher kc say 
 if i be ask to advise on the face of the draft legislation the thing i would say be have you think about set up a trust 
 he go on to say 
 i might say to someone if you really want to do this technicolor why do n’t you have an offshore company and have the share of the company put in trust and when you set that trust up why do n’t you think about set it up as a discretionary trust if it be a discretionary trust the beneficiary do not rank as a beneficiary in law all they have in law be the right to be consider by the trustee when capital income be distribute 
 so all kind of thing be already identify and very clear to the government have be highlight in evidence and they could have put these piece of evidence   into this bill to make sure that we be close the loophole now rather than allow this to spiral yet far 
 it be also very evident that this database need to be accessible to the wide possible group of people because the law enforcement particularly under this government do not have the money expertise or time to go into this in significant detail 
 let i highlight some of the scale of the issue we owe a great debt of gratitude to graham barrow as a researcher into these thing in his own time as a companies house geek he say that the use of brass plaque address for company incorporation have increase since lockdown he have do an analysis of main address be use in shelton street between and the number of incorporation at the brass plaque address grow by from to similarly the incorporation in wenlock road also grow significantly by those be just address and the number be increasingly significantly that be due to the loophole that the government have allow and the corporate structure that currently exist 
 we seek further amendment to tighten this and prevent these brass plaque address from be use for hundred and thousand of company there be certainly more the government could be do to ensure that trust do not fall down on this point allow people to register trust in a similar way will result in the same issue 
 we have put a caseworker in place so that each school can work with that caseworker as well as have access to the temporary accommodation and the company that can do the prop work which we have already secure or to additional surveying if require we be work closely with local authority but i urge the of local authority that have not respond to the questionnaire to respond that be more important than ever

 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment his department have make of the effectiveness of its policy on reduce regional inequality in employment 
 what assessment his department have make of the effectiveness of its policy on reduce regional inequality in employment 
 what assessment his department have make of the effectiveness of its policy on reduce regional inequality in employment 
 it be good to be back mr speaker i trust that you have at least some rest during the recess let i also extend my welcome to the new member who have just take their seat 
 the regional employment rate gap be percentage point which be percentage point less than the gap in and a low figure by historical standard 
 as the marmot review show there be a strong correlation between index of deprivation and addiction this issue affect all region but especially the poor region what policy be in place across the region to address the issue of addiction and to help more people remain in and enter employment particularly in the north west 
 the hon gentleman will be aware of universal support and the workwell pilot in exactly the area to which he have refer they be bring together healthcare and help with seek work which my party believe to be of the good way to remedy the issue he have mention include mental health issue 
 it be year since the jarrow march against unemployment and my constituent be still be let down we have a high percentage of people claim unemployment benefit than the national average and the reality be show to be bad when hide unemployment be factor in accord to the centre for cities in of the place with the high hidden unemployment rate be in the north instead of continue their false rhetoric on level up when will the government stop neglect and start invest in our northern community 
 i have no problem at all with defend the government ’s record on employment there be now nearly more people in employment than there be in include about more woman and unemployment across the country include in the north be at a near historic low 
 in his blog today on conservativehome lord ashcroft say 
 on the cost of living third of voter think the government could do more to help but be choose not to 
 give the regional disparity in earning do the secretary of state accept that the roll out of fair pay agreement provide sectoral minimum term as outline in labour ’s a new deal for working people would not only boost the economy but address the blight of in work poverty and insecure work that be have an impact on so many household in my constituency and throughout the country 
 the hon gentleman raise the issue of support during the cost of live squeeze that we be experience my department have be responsible for distribute million of payment to the most vulnerable people include £ in total to low income household £ to disabled people and the £ payment to pensioner on the question of work we put up the national living wage by over to £ this april 
 in part of my constituency the healthy life expectancy be now just to a true regional inequality if ever there be that mean that people even those in the minister ’s age group be drop out of work far too early which be not good for they or the economy what step be the department take as a consequence of the health and disability white paper to address this serious inequality 
 i have already mention the measure that we bring forward at the last budget include universal support and workwell the government be of course constantly look at how we can go far in that respect on the over-50 specifically the midlife mot that we be run the returnership and the change to the pension tax arrangement be all help to bear down on economic inactivity in that group 
 the good news from kettering be that at the overall unemployment rate be below the national average of the bad news from kettering be that there be to year old without work and the youth unemployment rate be versus the national average of what be the secretary of state do to address youth unemployment 
 my hon friend will be pleased to know that since youth unemployment have fall by over which be the mirror image of what happen under the last labour government when it rise by over on his specific question i point he towards the youth offer which we have recently announce we will be expand to even more young people 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i think the secretary of state understand that while unemployment be at a historic low economic activity be the big challenge before we particularly when it come to regional economic inactivity and the huge near point gap across the region the east midland london the north east the north west and the west midland all have high inactivity rate than the south east the tories have have year to close that gap so can i ask the secretary of state be his plan really to make level up a reality by leave it to labour 
 give that there have never be a labour government who have leave office with unemployment anything other than high than they find it in the place i do not think i would leave employment to labour on the hon lady ’s point economic inactivity be important and it be a major focus for my department it have of course reduce substantially since its peak during the pandemic have fall by around 
 what step his department be take to help claimant in receipt of means test benefit with increase in the cost of living 
 the government recognise the pressure people be face and we have act we be provide cost of live support worth over £ between and to help household and individual with those rise cost that include cost of living payment total up to £ in for over household on eligible mean test benefit we successfully deliver the payment of £ to household early this year and the payment of £ will be pay in the autumn 
 the government be indeed give generous cost of live support to household on certain mean test benefit this winter but if someone be on of those mean test benefit and they earn £ more they have the potential to lose the full payment i wonder if the minister have notice any change in people ’s behaviour as a result of that disincentive to take on extra work 
 it be vital that those on low income or indeed those who be keen to work more see the incentive in the spring budget we announce an ambitious package of measure to support people to take up work and importantly to progress by make sure that they be always well off we be also support they with a significant investment in childcare and of course the large ever cash increase to the national living wage take it up to £ i would say to those people that they should look at the benefit calculator on gov.uk because they will always be well off in work 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 rent have rise very sharply over the past couple of year but the support for people claim means test benefit to pay their rent determine by local housing allowance have not change at all since it have be completely frozen i write to the secretary of state about this over the summer be the minister able to give the house any assurance that the forthcoming benefit uprating statement will include a realistic increase in local housing allowance 
 i know that the right hon gentleman be very interested in this subject as be i. again there be help for household with the local housing allowance rate be set at the percentile in the government be project to spend around £ or around of gdp on support for renter in it be absolutely right that we support people to be well off the lha be not intend to cover all rent in all area but i take a close interest in this subject 
 what assessment his department have make of trend in the level of unemployment over the last month 
 what assessment his department have make of trend in the level of unemployment over the last month 
 i welcome our new colleague 
 the independent office for national statistics estimate that notwithstanding a recent uptick the unemployment rate be now almost half the rate we inherit in and be back to pre pandemic level 
 actually accord to the government ’s own figure and a half year after the pandemic begin employment be not back to pre pandemic level will the minister set out what the unanticipated rise in unemployment say about the underlie health of our economy it be not look good be it 
 with great respect i disagree employment be at record level vacancy have be down for the past quarter payroll employment be at a record high pay be up and inflation be down we be do an awful lot well than that lot would 
 we have see a summer of job cut in my bradford south constituency with both morrisons and solenis announce major redundancy do the minister agree that this show that the government ’s plan to grow the economy be fail 
 i should make the point that payroll employment be at a record high there be more people in work than in and the unemployment rate be down to across the uk that be a near record low our jobcentre be clearly do a fantastic job and i fully support all the work that be go on in bradford to try to address these issue 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of trend in the level of a inflation and b food price on pensioner income 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of trend in the level of a inflation and b food price on pensioner income 
 in april the state pension see its large ever rise of thank to the triple lock protecting pensioner 
 we know that pensioner be eligible for pension credit but be not receive it a few month ago i join my local citizen advice bureau to organise a pension credit action day as a result an additional £ be draw down to people across merthyr tydfil and rhymney the government have the datum and could take a much more targeted approach to get eligible people to apply so why have they not take that action when will we see more action from the government 
 i thank the hon gentleman for the work he be do in his constituency i assure he that that be exactly what the government be do we recently launch an invitation to claim trial which have be roll out in constituency and be use housing   benefit datum to target those who might also be eligible for pension credit we will report back on the result of that trial later this year 
 it might be hard to imagine on a sunny day like today but winter be just around the corner the reality for many worried pensioner in my constituency be that this winter there will be a choice between heating and eating we have a government who be tiptoe around the real issue while our constituent struggle to make end meet when will the government make a real plan to tackle the cost of live crisis and implement meaningful action to help thousand of pensioner in poverty 
 with respect to the hon lady that be exactly what we be do that be why we have put the cost of living payment in place which be worth £ to all those on pension credit and why a cost of live pensioner payment worth £ be come out in the winter all the while the labour mayor of london be charge pensioner £ when they want to drive to the hospital 
 clearly there be a stigma attach to claim pension credit because this be on poor pensioner who desperately need the money what action can my hon friend take to remove that stigma my constituency have recently be add to the pilot and i be look forward to its result because elderly people deserve to get the money they need to fulfil their life 
 my hon friend be absolutely right on that and i praise all the work he have do in his constituency on pension credit we be try to do exactly what he set out encourage as many people as possible to claim this important benefit at a time when they be go to need it most i note that across the house good work have be do in individual constituency 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as inflation rise be able to top up pension contribution be vital for many part time worker who would otherwise not be able to claim the full state pension however a daily mail investigation show that the government be fail to accurately record people ’s top up contribution pensioner be terrify that their money have simply disappear so when will the government get a grip of this terrible problem when will minister show that they understand the pressure on family and pensioner due to the cost of living crisis 
 with the comprehensive package of support i have talk about today we have show that we be take action during the cost of live crisis to help pensioner as much as we can we know that accuracy be the most important thing when it come to the state pension which be why we have take action very quickly to correct issue where they have occur for example with leap the legal entitlement and administrative practice exercise we will do the same in all such case 
 what step he be take to increase employment in essex 
 i know that my right hon friend be a champion for job creation in essex where our jobcentre be work with a range of employer and partner to address recruitment on an ongoing basis for example last wednesday essex jobcentre host a recruitment event at stansted airport to match constituent of her and of my right hon friend the members for saffron walden kemi badenoch and for braintree james cleverly and of my hon friend   the member for colchester will quince to dozen of catering hospitality and logistic base job 
 essex be a powerhouse on job and employment but there be always more to do and business be say that they be find barrier to create more job will the minister give an update on how he be work across government to create a labour market strategy to help enable business to recruit to lower taxis and burden for business and in particular to make it easy for small business in county such as essex to start employ more people and to recruit 
 i endorse pretty much everything that my right hon friend say clearly we be work with other departments to ensure that we be do everything possible to address recruitment for example on a recent visit i see the t level be pioneer at south essex college i have see the apprenticeship that be be drive forward locally and recently in witham the midlife mot take place in the middle of last month to address old worker however there be more to do and we be certainly try to do it across department 
 in essex as in many other part of the uk the number of people off work because of chronic illness be significantly high now than it be before the pandemic force sick people into work be not an appropriate way of deal with that so will the minister confirm that work capability assessment will be reasonable and will consider all aspect of the individual ’s life in assess whether they really be fit for work 
 the hon lady ’s constituency be a long way from essex mr speaker she will however be aware that over more disabled people be in work and that the wca will continue on an ongoing basis until there be reform 
 what step his department be take to increase the number of eligible people claim pension credit 
 the dwp have conduct an extensive campaign across tv radio and social medium and with partner organisation to boost pension credit take up with a number of push be make before   cost of live payment deadline i be pleased to tell the house that that be work application be up by in the year to may 
 of my chelmsford constituent send i a message that have be circulate recently it suggest that asylum seeker be entitle to receive more in benefit than pensioner i believe that be not accurate for the record will the minister confirm what support be available for pensioner compare with that for asylum seeker 
 let i reassure my right hon friend and her constituent that asylum seeker be give no recourse to public fund they be give payment for their food and shelter but they be unable to claim benefit pensioner in her constituency will receive a state pension if they qualify which for the time be worth on average more than £ per week or over £ a year pensioner who have not build up sufficient contribution may be eligible for pension credit worth on average £ per year to top up their income they be also eligible to receive the cost of live payment if they ever receive pension credit and the pensioner cost of live payment 
 over the summer i hold event in village across wyre in my constituency i be approach by many pensioner who be suffer because of the cost of living crisis pension credit be just not plug the gap at my chat with cat event in pilling a constituent ask i why more pensioner be live in poverty than when labour leave office will the minister answer that question 
 there be few pensioner in absolute poverty than when labour leave office 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the assessment process for personal independence payment 
 assessment play an important part in ensure people get the right entitlement it be the claimant ’s chance to give all the information need to help make the right decision the assessment which measure the impact of a health condition on a person ’s ability to live independently be keep under review i be sure the hon lady be familiar with the test and trial set out in the white paper 
 the minister will know that challenge with pip be how to accurately assess fluctuate condition more than half a people in the uk be live with crohn ’s disease or colitis but few than be in receipt of pip past applicant have say that while fatigue be the most disable symptom they feel that that be the least represent symptom in their assessment interruption would the minister consider introduce a fatigue rating   scale to pip assessment to more effectively capture what be for many the most debilitating component of their condition 
 minister the reason i be cough be that the question be rather long 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her interest in this issue through the white paper reform we have advocate for a number of test and trial include that focus specifically on well capture fluctuating condition i would be keen to have conversation with she about that the government be commit to work with charity and those that be interested include disabled people to ensure we get those reform right 
 i agree with the importance of have a timely assessment last week a constituent raise her case with i she fill in her renewal form month ago but have be give less than week notice for an assessment next week surely we need to have assessment when the form be fresh and accurate not month later 
 the wait time for pip decision have come down considerably in recent time but i be not complacent about that as we want to go far in see those wait reduce for example be able to apply online be an important part of that journey as well as improve interface and make sure people provide all the right information up front if we can provide well support for that it will help we make decision soon which can only be welcome 
 i urge the minister to look specifically at how pip be assess for those with brain injury it be well know that the effect of a brain injury may vary over time people go up and down and many who have have a brain injury want to give a very positive impression of how they be which give a false impression when it come to assess whether they need pip 
 i be very sympathetic to the hon gentleman ’s point he have be a passionate and tireless campaigner on the issue of brain injury for a long time these be exactly the sort of issue that we want to look at as we take this reform forward i mention our change around fluctuate condition but we also want to look at issue such as expert assessor and have specialist work with individual to carry out the assessment to ensure a proper understanding and hopefully build confidence around decision making 
 our excellent proactive minister be no doubt test out concept ahead of the forthcoming white paper do that include extend the severe condition criterion so that people with condition such as motor neurone disease can automatically access support without the need of an assessment 
 i be fortunate that my hon friend be of my predecessor as minister for disabled people as he be a tireless campaigner on these issue and have do much to take the agenda forward on the   severe disability group we remain committed to this work we have work with an expert group of specialist health professional to draw up a set of draft criterion we have start initial testing at small scale and we be look to scale that up as we move forward because we want to get this right and we think that this be a significant change 
 what step his department be take to help reduce waiting time for access to work assessment 
 whether his department plan to take step to reduce the time take by the decision make process for application to the access to work scheme 
 access to work have receive a significant increase in application over the past year and have recruit new staff to meet the increase demand and reduce the time it take to make decision we be also transform the access to work service through increase digitalisation that will make the service more efficient and the application process easy and improve the time take from application through to decision 
 i think the minister know that the wait time be too long for all applicant but may i draw his attention to an event in cambridge that i host early this year with the local jobcentre where we highlight job opportunity for the neurodivergent community will he tell we what impact these long wait have on people who be neurodivergent 
 i be sure the hon gentleman will be pleased to know that last week of claim be pay within day and that we be take step to drive further improvement the online application capacity that come on stream in june be a significant part of that but we be also put additional staff on to processing claim we be streamline various process to ensure that people get access to that support soon anecdotally official be say that that be begin to bear fruit what we be not do be speed up that process at the cost of get the right decision and the right outcome we will continue to move this forward and we be already make progress 
 a decade ago the government ’s sayce review recommend support disabled people through specialist employment programme but last year access to work help just and versus arthritis and other organisation that support people navigate this difficult system see a tripling in the delay when will the department meet the target and end the delay hit disabled people employer and the uk economy 
 like the hon gentleman i be passionate about the positive difference that access to work make in term of open up employment opportunity for people he will be aware of the passport that we have introduce to help well understand people ’s need and passporte that between job and between for   example education and employment i refer he back to the step that we have take to see improvement in the journey time but we will continue to work tirelessly to make sure that people get the access to work help as quickly as possible 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in january it be find that the access to work backlog have treble since february rise to more than in june the minister claim additional resource be be put into access to work will he inform the house exactly how many additional staff be work to clear the backlog and when he expect it to return to pre pandemic level his government say that they want to get more people into work yet disabled people be miss out on job because of unacceptable delay at the dwp 
 for the house ’s benefit let i provide the full time equivalent staffing level in the access to work team a full month ago and once the staff at bradford have move to access to work the figure stand at full time equivalent in march and at on   september that figure be expect to stand at full time equivalent by the end of october with the additional staff move to the access to work team in bradford i direct the hon lady ’s attention again to the figure from last week that of claim be pay within day this be a priority for i as the minister for disabled people and for the department as a whole 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the child limit on trend in the level of child poverty 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the child limit on trend in the level of child poverty 
 the government ’s firm belief be that the good route out of poverty be through work in the most recent statistic in there be few child live in absolute poverty after housing cost than in 
 a recent study by the university of york find that the child limit and the benefit cap have contribute to rise child poverty which ally to wide benefit cut have impact large family disproportionately give the grow weight of evidence that family be be push far into hardship will the government finally acknowledge the real harm that their cruel and callous welfare policy be cause and reverse they 
 family on benefit should face the same financial choice when decide to grow their family as those support themselves solely through work a benefit structure adjust automatically to family size be unsustainable 
 a report by the child poverty action group show that the child limit affect in child across the uk it find that abolish the policy would be the most cost effective action that the government could take to reduce child poverty why will the minister not take that action be child poverty so low on his priority list that he have not consider it or do he consider it and then decide that vulnerable child just be not worth it 
 the government be commit to a sustainable long term approach to tackle poverty and support people on low income we will spend around £ through the welfare system in include around £ on people of work age and child 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the minister seem to forget that the child limit impact people who be on in work benefit the only exemption to the child limit be if a woman can prove that her or a subsequent child have be bear as a result of rape how many people have the minister ’s department ask to prove that they have be rap in order to get an exemption to the child limit 
 we do not use the language use by the hon gentleman but i will of course write to he 
 i be disappointed that the minister do not know because his department have make woman prove and relive the ordeal of be rap simply to get that state support but give that the labour party and the conservatives support the child policy and rape clause do it give he comfort to know that when the ghost of george osborne future come into office his legacy in promote astronomical child poverty rate will be safe in the hand of the blairites on the labour benches 
 i can only repeat that compare with there be few child in absolute poverty after housing cost 
 what recent progress his department have make on tackle benefit fraud 
 we continue to bear down on fraud and error it decrease by in there be of course still more to be do which be why we be invest £ to reduce that figure still far by £ by 
 during the pandemic the government rightly get support out to people as quickly as possible but that inevitably mean that error be make and some people take advantage of the situation what be be do to clamp down on fraud and error in universal credit 
 a huge amount include the target case review which over the next year will review hundred of thousand of universal credit claim to look for fraud and error of course we use emerge new technology for that purpose as well 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer i absolutely support the principle that those who carry out benefit fraud must be make accountable but what i find in my office i think that other in the chamber will probably find this as well be that many people have fill in an application form document or review and inadvertently tick the wrong box by do so they have leave themselves in a very difficult position where they find that they have to make a repayment sometimes people need help at the initial stage to ensure that they get it right what can be do to help those people so that they do not get into debt that they do not expect to be in 
 there be help within jobcentre there be also citizens advice and a help to claim process available there when people make genuine error and when they have be overpay for various reason we be of course sympathetic to ensure that we do not put they in a position where it be incredibly difficult for they to repay those amount 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of its policy on reduce the level of inactivity in the labour market 
 we be do a great deal to bear down on economic inactivity as of august this year the figure show that over half the increase in economic activity that occur during the pandemic have since unwound that be more than people into work 
 the secretary of state ’s comment suggest that unemployed over-50 should consider become delivery rider clearly show that the government be fail to help old worker into stable employment rather than glorify precarious work in the gig economy will he commit to roll out a plan that give old worker the dignity respect and support they deserve to rejoin the workforce 
 i think it be very unfortunate when any member of this house look down on a certain category of job that be employ hundred of thousand of people perfectly satisfactorily in fact in that interview i say 
 i think as a department we should not be prescriptive 
 refer to the over-50 
 so we ’re not here to start pontificate about whether people should or should not go back into work 
 hopefully that have put the record straight we be do a huge amount to support those over who have retire prematurely include the midlife mot returnerships and the tax change we have make around pension   and we will continue to support people that be why we be see those inactivity rate above decline quite strongly 
 sickness and sick pay be an anchor when it come to get people back into work as well as help to grow the economy that be why the centre for progressive change produce an excellent report that have support from member across this house will my right hon friend therefore meet i and my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel who have also support it to look at the proposal make so that we can really help to improve sick pay something that have the backing of of british business 
 i would be very happy for either myself or the relevant minister to meet my hon friend or my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we all want to see both unemployment and economic inactivity as low as possible but the office for national statistics quote approvingly by the minister a few minute ago report that this spring ’s quarter show a large fall in the number of people move from economic inactivity into employment and that the net movement from employment to economic inactivity be the large since the covid autumn of give that this be the department ’s priority what assessment have he make of why this be go wrong 
 my assessment of economic inactivity be that it be fall it have fall by around or more since its peak during the pandemic that leave we below the average rate of economic inactivity across the g7 the european union and the oecd we be make real progress and will continue to do so 
 what estimate his department have make of the number and proportion of unsuccessful benefit decision that be overturn on appeal in the last month 
 our aim be to make the right decision as early as possible in a claim in there be social security and child support appeal tribunal hearing with overturn we recognise that the overturn rate at appeal be high however the number must be see in the context of overall decision the majority of appeal tribunal hearing relate to pip since pip be introduce of initial decision have be appeal and overturn at a hearing 
 the minister be be very selective in his use of statistic the most recent tribunal stat show that an increase number of case the vast majority be be overturn something that be certainly bear out by my constituent contact i why be we not get it right time surely it be a huge waste of resource to be take so many case to tribunal 
 there be no advantage to anybody in the right outcome not be achieve at the very early point the hon lady ask why we often see tribunal reach different decision there be a number of reason for example draw different conclusion on the same evidence cogent evidence be present orally within those tribunal or even perhaps write evidence be provide at the hearing that have not previously be share we be take step include have present officer feed back to the department to ensure that more decision be get right at the opportunity 
 what step his department be take to improve social mobility among young people 
 what step his department be take to improve social mobility among young people 
 every day our work coach help people of all age and all background to overcome barrier build their confidence and move into and progress in work for young people we have specialise support via the dwp youth offer we have extend our jobcentre support for people in work and on low income help they to increase their earning to move into well pay quality job and to improve their prospect through in work progression we be also provide additional work coach time and boost the skill support mean that we be truly open up opportunity for all 
 i welcome my hon friend ’s strong commitment to social mobility and i share her approach however what be the government do to ensure that young people in my constituency of bexleyheath and crayford have the job that they need and great opportunity to succeed 
 i agree and be determined to ensure that everyone regardless of their background or postcode can succeed in bexleyheath and crayford and beyond as part of the dwp youth offer we have a youth hub serve my right hon friend ’s constituency work in partnership with youthbuild ventures to help young people to build their confidence with tailor wraparound support and to move into local job 
 degree apprenticeship be a great way for those who be socially less well off to get into employment and avoid the cost associate with get a degree through other route so what step be the minister take to help more people achieve that ambition 
 i agree that it be key that young people get the right opportunity to progress thrive and move into long term sustainable work apprenticeship be crucial in drive growth and social mobility they boost business skill and improve people ’s earning and progression opportunity my hon friend will be pleased to see a new youth hub open in walsall shortly and that   our work coach have be work with walsall college on place base tailored employability support for his area 
 the big bar to young people find employment in the lake and the dale be the fact that there be nowhere affordable for they to live average house price be time average income and the long term rent sector have collapse into the airbnb sector will the minister make the lake district and the yorkshire dale special pilot area to ensure that the only home we build there be affordable one for people who will make their life there work and contribute to our economy so that we do not run out of workforce 
 i think we can agree on thing the hon gentleman ’s area be a very special in the meantime we have recruit at the dwp progression lead who will work locally with employer and jobcentre to sort that progression and retention challenge but i think some of his question be for a different department 
 what step his department be take to increase employment in north devon constituency 
 the jobcentre team in north devon be work day and night to fill the vacancy in my hon friend ’s constituency that include invite employer into the jobcentre plus each week and have upcoming event on sector base work academy programme include that be about to happen with the nhs trust in barnstaple 
 unemployment in north devon be well below the national average due to the high proportion of retired people and a lack of home those working can afford business and the public sector alike be report high vacancy level what step be my hon friend take to ensure that we do not see further business closure because of a lack of home that worker can afford 
 i visit north devon in april to meet my hon friend and discuss those issue she have my full support and that of the department in her work to ensure that we address those problem clearly those matter be be address on an ongoing basis by the department for levelling up housing and communities but i can assure she that she have my full support 
 what step his department be take with cabinet colleague to help reduce sickness absence in the workplace 
 sickness and support those who be sick in the workplace be an important focus for the department which be why we be consult on occupational health and ensure that more business take it up as something to offer their employee 
 working day be lose every year because of negative workplace culture and staff wellbee that be partly down to bullying which be prevalent across many workplace what step be the secretary of state take to consider workplace culture particularly bully at work and will he meet i to discuss my bullying and respect at work bill which would put a recourse into law 
 like the hon lady i and my ministerial colleague take bully in the workplace extremely seriously there be no place for that in our country i would be very happy for she to have a meeting with the relevant dwp minister 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the high income child benefit charge on the gender pension gap 
 in april we announce plan to address this issue by introduce a retrospective national insurance credit which will ensure that more people especially woman have the opportunity to obtain a full state pension 
 the high income child benefit charge be potentially a scandal wait to happen currently family have to apply for a benefit they know they be not entitle to so that the stay at home parent usually the mother get the national insurance credit that they need for her state pension it be good to hear that the government be do something but they need to reform the process far will they agree to at least put some comms in i certainly have not hear of the change in april 
 i be glad that the hon lady agree with those change i assure she that we will be bring they forward as soon as we can 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 may i begin by welcome my new opposite number   the hon member for leicester west liz kendall to her post i know she will agree that it be an honour and a privilege to be associate with this department whether on the opposition benches or the government benches and the very important mission of look after the most vulnerable which i know we both share i look forward to a constructive engagement with she in the week and month to come 
 my department continue to focus on support the most vulnerable through cost of living payment pension credit and the benefit system more generally bear down on fraud and error and promote work and in particular as we have be discuss reduce economic inactivity 
 will the secretary of state join i in welcome the recent decision on the national disability strategy which allow we to get on and improve the life of so many disabled people 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i very much welcome the court of appeal ’s decision in july mean that the national disability strategy be lawful the government be now able to continue with the important work of implement that long term strategy and i can confirm that my hon friend the minister for disabled people will shortly come forward with further detail of some of the individual commitment we will be make around that strategy 
 i welcome the shadow secretary of state to her position 
 thank you mr speaker and i thank the secretary of state for his kind word however whatever he say about economic inactivity it remain a serious problem in this country with the uk lag behind all other g7 country in term of workforce participation since the pandemic indeed last month the number of people off work due to long term sickness hit an all time high what be this government ’s response the chancellor tell the over-50s to get off the golf course and the dwp secretary tell they to literally get on their bike be not the truth that this government ’s failure to cut waiting list sort social care and have a proper plan for reform our jobcentre be harm individual and our economy as a whole 
 to the extent that the hon lady be suggest that economic inactivity be bad in our country than in all other economy or all similar economy i think that be what she say that simply be not the case it be true that economic inactivity spike during the pandemic none the less as i say early the average rate be low than the average across the oecd the eu and the g7 
 the hon lady mention those who be long term sick and disabled that be why we be bring forward pilot such as workwell and roll out universal support to make sure we bring the world of work together with the world of health to the betterment of those who we look after 
 this be not just about the over-50 be the secretary of state aware that the big relative jump in economic inactivity due to sickness be among young people with mental health be the big concern labour have a plan to transform mental health in this country pay for by close private equity loophole when will this government act and put a proper plan in place 
 there be a proper plan in place i invite the hon lady to spend some time look more closely at the announcement that have be make particularly at the time of the last fiscal statement and especially those about workwell universal support and the work we be do with the national health service and other agency to make sure as i say that we bring together the world of work and the world of health and provide support particularly for those with mental health condition 
 the health and safety executive website currently make no mention of the aerate concrete issue that we all hear about at the end of last week can we be assure that the executive have the resource and motivation to get that guidance out there so that employer and other building owner know what they should be do in this situation 
 the hse ’s focus have be on raise awareness of raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete through its engagement and stakeholder group via the public sector and this be actually raise in a bulletin back in april i will look into the point my hon friend have make but i be certain there have be clear guidance to those who need it 
 thousand of woman who have be underpaid their state pension due to departmental mistake will be force to wait until the end of to see this error address do the minister really think this be acceptable 
 the hon lady ask about this last time and i believe i inform she previously that all alive people will be receive the benefit they be entitle to by the end of this year 
 what action be the government take to deal with the difficulty that many disabled people face with access the support they need in particular have there be a move back to make face to face contact part of the assessment and decision in the benefit system 
 we have make available a diversity of assessment channel to people but the key point be that anybody who want to have a face to face appointment be able to have they can request and that will be facilitate and i think that be important jobcentres will be at the leading edge of deliver on our new support employment programme universal support and we have workwell come on stream as well we do not want to write anybody off where people want to work or to try to work we should be support that wherever we can and that be precisely what we be all about 
 a constituent of mine have cerebral palsy a lifelong condition for which there be no prospect of improvement and which affect her mobility and balance despite this she have face repeat unnecessary and inaccurate reassessment for the personal independence payment and she lose her pip mobility after the most recent assessment the dwp justify its decision by say that it be advise that her last fall be over month prior to the consultation what kind of system demand that people with lifelong condition regularly have to hurt themselves to receive the support they be entitle to 
 i would obviously want to see the detail of the case in question before comment on it so perhaps the hon member could kindly share those   detail with i of the thing we be focus on be get to a place where people with condition or disability that be unlikely to improve or be only likely to deteriorate be not have to go through repeat assessment that be the objective we be work towards through the white paper reform interruption i hear a lot of chuntering from the opposition i would be absolutely delighted if they would get on and support our reform so we can make those improvement 
 universal credit have be hugely effective in make sure it always pay to work but for jobseeker with no saving who use to be pay daily or weekly the week wait for their payment can plunge they into debt whether it be a dwp advance or other loan will minister consider the proposal in poverty trapped for initial payment to be make at the same daily or weekly frequency as a jobseeker be previously pay so they can focus on find a job rather than juggle their debt 
 i can tell my hon friend that there be no plan to change the assessment period and payment structure of universal credit but i be very happy for he to sit down with official and discuss his paper 
 a constituent battle multiple sclerosis recently come to of my surgery after his pip application be refuse without ever receive a face to face assessment and he do request the automated letter dismiss his appeal use incredibly insulting and derogatory language without ever meet he the minister ’s department declare my constituent fit and able despite this clearly not be the case i be do whatever i can to support my constituent but surely the minister will agree that pip applicant deserve face to face assessment rather than this dismissive humiliating letter language 
 if people wish to have a face to face assessment they ought to be able to have that be the position there be claimant for whom a different form of assessment a telephone assessment or a virtual assessment be more appropriate and be perhaps what they want but that choice should be available to people and provider should be facilitate that again if the hon member would kindly share the detail of that case with i i will look at it as a matter of urgency 
 i warmly welcome the considerable progress this conservative government have make in support pensioner the triple lock and target support with the cost of living be welcome in my part of devon will my hon friend outline how this conservative government will ensure that this great progress continue 
 the triple lock be a conservative invention it be a pledge in our manifesto and the secretary of state will be look at it again this year when he make his decision on benefit 
 in the united nations committee responsible for monitor the un convention on the   right of disabled people publish a damn report that find that the government have systematically discriminate against disabled people in breach of their right last week the un committee review evidence describe the further deterioration of disabled people ’s circumstance and right since but the government refuse to attend be n’t this just another kick in the face for disabled people 
 i do not accept the hon lady ’s characterisation of the situation we have follow all of the committee ’s procedure we be engage with this process in good faith and will present our progress at the session in march interruption it be rather frustrating that the hon lady often give the impression that this country be not a world leader on disability issue the equality act for example be the cornerstone of ensure equality legislation and we also have the british sign language act and the down syndrome act we have also take other step forward and we should be support that 
 i be fortunate to represent a part of the country that be bless with near full employment however business in bracknell and beyond struggle to recruit enough staff can the secretary of state reassure i that his department will leave no stone unturned in get as many people as possible back into the workplace 
 i welcome the good news but also accept the challenge i have visit bracknell to meet my hon friend and be happy to sit down with he and the local jobcentre to ensure we be address his constituency ’s vacancy issue 
 last week i meet the citizen advice bureau in cheshire west and chester which inform i that of those who appeal their pip assessment win why do the minister not get it right in the place and what be he do at pace to address that 
 i be very appreciative of citizen advice bureaux around the country for all the work they do in support constituent in each of our constituency in the interest of time i will just refer the hon gentleman back to the point i make early about the step we be take 
 the recent change to access to mean test benefit for those in receipt of vaccine damage payment be very welcome and i thank the minister for his engagement will he join i in pay tribute to those who campaign for that change in the law include my constituent sheila ward 
 i pay full credit to mrs ward and also to my hon friend i read with interest the stoke sentinel report on this particular issue there be a genuine change to be make there have be a long stand campaign and all party should be pleased with the outcome reach 
 in all honesty i probably ought to declare an interest but pensioner live in edinburgh and glasgow do not face the same sort of increase as pensioner   live in a remote and faraway constituency such as mine when it come to living cost such as run a car buy grocery and heat the house will the government look at way of target these particularly hard hit people 
 we of course look at particularly target hard hit pensioner through pension credit and the pensions minister my hon friend   the member for sevenoaks laura trott have do a huge amount to promote that but we be always open to receive further idea and have discussion and if the hon gentleman would like to come forward with further idea we will certainly look at they 
 i have be contact many time each month by parent leave seriously out of pocket by their ex spouse failure to pay child maintenance owe what step be the government take to ensure parent be able to receive their child maintenance on time so that many family be not leave subject to coercive control by their ex spouse or leave out of pocket 
 i thank the hon lady for make those point child maintenance payment keep about child out of poverty each year and be absolutely   vital they play a key role in ensure both parent play their part in support their child whether or not they live with they if the hon lady have particular case or interest i be happy to meet she 
 a constituent of mine have a small work pension render her ineligible for pension credit yet still struggle to get by another constituent who be and miss out on pension credit by just £ have contact i several time angry and hurt that he now have to pay for his tv licence will ministers review the rule on pension credit because ineligibility for so many of the passporte benefit leave many of my constituent out of pocket they want to be eligible for it but be not 
 obviously this be without look at the individual case but it be important to note that the threshold have go up significantly so it be worth question whether the hon lady ’s constituent be now eligible if not application to the household support fund can be helpful and local council may be able to offer housing benefit support if there be an individual case that she would like to write to i about i be happy to respond 
 that complete the question those who wish to leave should do so 
 before i call   the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey m. donaldson   to ask the urgent question i wish to make a short statement about the sub judice resolution the matter of the data breach be not sub judice but i have be advise that an individual have be charge with terrorism relate offence follow the data breach while i be content to waive the sub judice resolution in this and other proceeding to allow simple reference to the fact of the arrest any further discussion of the circumstance of that case would not be in order 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for northern ireland if he will make a statement on the breach of security and datum protection at the police service of northern ireland 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his urgent question as you know mr speaker i be keen to do a statement on the police service of northern ireland ’s datum breach on   august so i be pleased to have this opportunity i be also happy to provide an update to the house on this matter however since write this answer and as the right hon gentleman will know news of the psni ’s chief constable ’s resignation have break over the past few minute i thank simon byrne for his year of public service the right hon gentleman will know that the appointment of a new chief constable be a matter for the northern ireland policing board and i will continue to liaise with the senior management team of psni while the process of appoint a successor get under way the psni continue to have my and the government ’s full support in respond to the data breach and we be focus on provide appropriate and proportionate datum and expertise 
 the breach where the personal information of more than officer and staff be accidentally publish in what appear to be a human error involve a number of spreadsheet field happen on   august not realise that the relevant document contain a hide table the initial and surname of every rank and grade the location where an individual be base but not their home address and their duty type be publish online for approximately hour the data breach be deeply concern and significant recent event in northern ireland include the terrible attack on detective chief inspector john caldwell show that there be still a small minority in northern ireland who wish to cause harm to psni officer and staff in northern ireland i take this opportunity to thank all those individual who work to keep the people of northern ireland safe they have my many thank and we all owe they our gratitude 
 i recognise too that there be significant concern about the consequence of this data breach many psni officer and staff have raise concern about themselves and their family and they have my support and understanding as they go about their important work keep community safe in these worrying and most testing of circumstance to they i again say thank you 
 in response to these concern the psni and wide security partner be take appropriate action and be work around the clock to investigate the incident provide reassurance and mitigate any risk to the safety and security of officer and staff as of   august self referral have be make to the psni ’s emergency threat management group that be part of the welfare and support service that have be make available to psni officer 
 the house will understand that the psni be devolve and have operational independence that have be the case since april with the creation of the department of justice however as the house would expect the government have remain in close contact with the psni since this breach and other datum breach come to light my official and i have be receive regular update and the government ’s focus have be on provide specialist support and expertise to the psni in its handling of this issue official in the cabinet office have chaired—[interruption i will finish in a mr speaker official in the cabinet office have chair regular meeting and i will update the house far hopefully during this urgent question 
 thank you mr speaker for the opportunity to raise the plight of police officer and staff in northern ireland the industrial scale breach in datum last month be yet another self inflict blow to the morale of the police service as well as to confidence in police across northern ireland for the rank and file and for the staff work in our police station for their personal detail to be release into the public domain and to find their way into the hand of dissident republican be unforgivable 
 the current terrorist threat level in northern ireland be severe just a few month ago detective chief inspector john caldwell be barbarically attack by gunman in front of his young son after coach an under-15s football team near omagh now each of his colleague must come to term with the fact that they and their family have potentially be place in harm ’s way by the release of this datum 
 it go far than that last week ’s ruling by mr justice scoffield find that the psni ’s senior command unlawfully discipline of its own officer in order to appease sinn féin these action be hugely damaging to community relation to community confidence and to confidence in the rule of law in northern ireland fair and even handed policing be just as foundational to progress in northern ireland as be fully function political institution operate on a cross community consensus basis we therefore need to hear from the government that they will ensure that the necessary resource be available to the police notwithstanding budgetary constraint so that police officer their family and police staff be properly protect against terrorist attack 
 furthermore the democratic unionist party welcome the decision by the chief constable to announce his resignation we believe that be the right thing to do in all the circumstance now we want to see confidence rebuild in our police service and we will work with the psni it have our full support to achieve and deliver effective and efficient policing for everyone in northern ireland in a way that command cross community support 
 i thank the right hon gentleman again for the urgent question and for the various question he have pose official in the cabinet office have chair regular operational meeting initially daily bring together the psni government departments and our world class security service to ensure that all their collective skill include cyber expertise have be bring to bear in support the psni on the breach 
 you will appreciate mr speaker that give your ruling on sub judice and for security reason i can not comment on specific detail of the response but individual have be arrest by detective investigate the breach and the criminality connect to it have be release on bail to allow for further police inquiry and have be charge with possess document or record likely to be useful to terrorist and another item 
 the right hon gentleman mention money the response to such a significant breach will obviously come with a cost the uk government be clear that security be paramount and the focus remain on support and expertise at this point with northern ireland ’s policing be devolve it be for the department of justice to set its budget and ensure it can fulfil its duty and responsibility but it still remain a fundamental responsibility of the executive in their absence northern ireland departments to run a balanced and sustainable budget where additional funding be require the correct process which include a whole host of different thing must be follow however i completely understand the right hon gentleman ’s point 
 this whole episode be agonising i want to put on record my support and sympathy for all those brave man and woman of the psni who fear for their security and that of their family as a result i urge the secretary of state to do everything possible with the psni to ensure that document of this sensitivity be subject to sufficient protection so that a mistake of this sort can never ever be make again 
 i think that   the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey m. donaldson   refer to it in his question as a self inflict wound and it surely be to be frank check and balance should have be in place i completely agree with my right hon friend and we will do what we can to assist the psni and the department of justice as she would expect we keep abreast of these matter as i hope i detail in my answer but this be a really significant breach as police officer put it to i when i join the police service i use to think when i go to work that maybe people know what i do for a living but now that have completely flip i feel that they absolutely know what i do for a living that have change the psychology around the whole piece i know that a lot more assurance need to be give for we to get to the place that my right hon friend wish to get to 
 i welcome the new shadow secretary of state 
 may i say that i look forward to work with the secretary of state in the interest of peace prosperity and progress in northern ireland 
 the release of the name and workplace of thousand of psni officer and staff be doubtless inadvertent but its consequence could not be more serious that have now be recognise by the chief constable simon byrne who be resign i join the secretary of state in thank he for his service those who serve in the psni confront great risk every day in their job to keep the public safe and we thank they but they already know that dissident republican be target they and their family and now they know that those who would do they harm have this list the damage to morale and confidence should not be underestimate they be ask urgently what will be do to reassure and protect we 
 do the secretary of state agree that the inquiry need to be complete as quickly as possible can he confirm that he will approve the appointment of the new chief constable in the absence of a justice minister in northern ireland do he intend to review the operation of the northern ireland policing board and how it function do he recognise that there will be additional cost in protect staff as well as respond to potential civil claim there be already great pressure on the northern ireland policing budget and the cut it now face will in the word of the psni leave the service small less visible less accessible and less responsive 
 finally the whole house want to ensure that the staff get the support protection and reassurance they need but to succeed in do that we need leadership from the government and the political party in northern ireland to get the assembly and the executive up and run again as quickly as possible 
 i welcome the right hon gentleman to his place and look forward to work with he as i mention outside the chamber i will happily brief he on any aspect and will arrange technical briefing from my official so that he can be bring up to speed quickly i would like to put on record my thank to the former shadow secretary of state   the hon member for hove peter kyle who be present for the way he go about his business and for the very co operative way we deal with business i appreciate it and wish he well as we move forward 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the inquiry yes it need to be expedite a timetable have be set up by the policing board which be independent and i believe that it report in month time it be quite a fundamental inquiry and i hope in that time it will be able to bring all the answer require to the table he ask about the appointment of a future chief constable if the institution of the executive and the minister for justice be not present we will have to pass secondary legislation in this place to allow that to happen all that depend on the policing board go about its business and recruitment i believe that be very much a rubber stamp of its work 
 the right hon gentleman ask about the policing board and reform i speak to a number of board member before the resignation of the chief constable and they all know that the spotlight be on they and how they deal with this i would like to wait and see how they discharge their duty over the course of the next few week before i commit to reform because there be good people there who have the ability to do the job 
 finally on the budget which i mention in my answer the right hon gentleman forget to mention that the information commissioner will come out with a decent fine for the data breach we will have to take a whole host of thing into account as and when they materialise we will look at they 
 the secretary of state mention the independence of the psni and that funding issue lie with the department of justice and the northern ireland executive but may i press he on this issue will he use his considerable influence to ensure that the safety of all people be and foremost and not the cost it be important that the influence he have be exert to its full because these be good people who find themselves in a very very difficult position through no fault of their own 
 i like to feel that i have considerable influence in government but i be not sure that be completely correct however i will use the influence i have to do the right thing by all those who work for the psni all sort of issue have come up over the past year and since policing be devolve but police in northern ireland certainly seem to look and feel well and it be begin to get good outcome for those who be be police i can only praise the officer and say that i will do everything in their support 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i join the secretary of state in offer my thank to simon byrne for his service i believe his decision today however be the right this represent a shocking breach of confidentiality not just in relation to people ’s personal datum but a shocking breach in the confidence that psni officer and staff can have in the organisation i pay tribute to the dedicated psni officer and staff who daily protect and serve the people of northern ireland 
 the psni as have be allude to be already suffer a crisis of funding and therefore resource the officer complement be low than it have be in the police service serve northern ireland than at any point since the uk government pay £ a year in additional funding to meet the security challenge but that funding be inadequate even before the breach and be surely even more inadequate now will the secretary of state be a little clear on exactly how he will give funding guarantee to the psni go forward because i do not believe this be something where the buck can be pass entirely to those who be currently charge with administer devolve budget 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question he talk about the additional security funding that the government put in the uk government ’s contribution to the financial year be £ in this space the cost implication of the psni response be rightly be discuss with the department of justice any additional ask for funding would come through an establish process while it would not be right for i to pre empt that the government be clear that security be paramount our focus remain currently on the ask that have be make of we which be to provide specialist support and expertise in response to the late assessment 
 psni officer face significant physical risk but they also face significant reputational and relationship risk when they be reveal to be member of the psni the catholic police officers guild and the police federation for northern ireland have do brilliant work over the past few week will the secretary of state confirm that he be engage with those organisation as the government seek to support the impact of the breach 
 i have not yet speak to the catholic police officer guild personally but my official have do so on a number of occasion and i be very happy to do so initially we be receive high level briefing from the chief constable and his senior management team and as i mention the cabinet office committee that be set up be receive and impart information at an officer level we be at the beginning of the process so there be still a very long way to go the psni will have to reflect on today ’s news of the chief constable ’s resignation there be a lot more for the government and the secretary of state to do in this space and i fully recognise that 
 i think that simon byrne have make absolutely the right decision in resign today give everything that have happen in recent week however there be a much deep and more significant problem than just individual and it be about which we have be warn for year the real crisis in the recruitment and retention of catholic psni officer and staff do the secretary of state agree that the good way of deal with that crisis be to bring back 50:50 recruitment 
 during a conversation i have with the hon gentleman last week he talk about the patten reform and 50:50 recruitment and say it have be a backward step to depart from that point i be a great believer in the original principle of policing in peelism whereby a police force reflect the community that it police that be how it gain its confidence i may be mistake but i think i be brief recently that there have be good level of recruitment to the psni from catholic community but situation such as the we be discuss today damage the prospect of that continue and it be our job the job of all of we to ensure that that do not happen 
 if anyone be in any doubt about the particularly difficult and sensitive role play by police officer in northern ireland they should not be in any doubt now follow this appalling incident have my right hon friend be satisfied thus far that within the psni suitable measure have already be take to ensure that freedom of information and subject access request be deal with by people of sufficient seniority and that there be vet and double checking of information before it be disclose into the public domain 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for his wise question and i can give he that assurance the process behind the issuing of freedom of information answer have be very well check and will i be sure be check and check   and check again and i believe simplify with much more senior eye make sure that information go out correctly 
 i be in northern ireland during the week after the breach and the fact that officer continue to go out and go about their duty be a testament to they and their service however it be unacceptable that the job they do remain a secret from many people and that we somehow think this be normal in northern ireland year after the peace process it would not be normal in any other part of the united kingdom or in ireland what be the secretary of state do with the co guarantor of the peace process the irish government and those in the field more widely to deal with what be now clearly a crisis 
 i personally agree entirely with the part of what the hon lady have say policing should be much more normalise in northern ireland as indeed life should be however there be an interesting rich and troubled history in northern ireland that have lead we to where we be now what the chief constable do in introduce community policing mean that the hon lady will be able to walk around all sort of place and have the sense of a much more normal policing experience 
 i have have conversation with my irish counterpart although this be very much an issue that rest with the uk government but everyone be interested in how freedom of information request be now deal with 
 i too thank simon byrne for his service and join other in recognise that in the current circumstance he make the right decision in resign give that his position be no long tenable on the issue of the data breach can the secretary of state assure the house that money will be no obstacle in the short run when it come to the relocation of any officer there will be people particularly those from a catholic nationalist background who be operate in intelligence and highly sensitive security role who be particularly expose alongside everyone else who be at risk can the secretary of state assure we that there will be no barrier to ensure their safety which be paramount 
 i must be careful about how i answer that question because it relate very much to security matter but i think i can say that the hon gentleman be correct in assume what he assume 
 i be hearten by the secretary of state ’s commitment to money and support for his officer although money can not put this right minister come and go as do government so will he also commit himself to give regular and confidential update to perhaps the intelligence and security committee or the northern ireland affairs committee on the ongoing cost there be a danger that while there be a long term risk for officer short term government thinking can mean that support of this kind can wither on the vine 
 i will happily find out the appropriate way of reporting as the hon lady suggest as i have say i think this be go to have a very long tail so the ramification as it play out will ripple through the system for a very long time indeed 
 on behalf of my colleague i welcome the new shadow secretary of state to his place i look forward to work with he i also thank his predecessor for all his effort to engage with we 
 it be important to correct a number of inaccuracy in the secretary of state ’s response there be no hidden table but as be common with excel spreadsheet there be more than field there be human error but there be level of security to assess what be go out all of which fail that speak to systemic failure within the psni i welcome the resignation of the chief constable this afternoon and i think it be important that collectively politically and in society we all work together i hope the secretary of state will support we in this to instil confidence again in the police service of northern ireland 
 i do not know that the hon gentleman be such an expert in excel i be certainly not so i be happy to be correct by he on the detail of that but i think my statement be pretty thorough and i agree with what he say 
 as some member will know my wife come from county armagh we get marry at the height of the trouble the bombing and the shooting and it send a chill down my spine when i read of this leak   the hon member for foyle colum eastwood   have refer to the difficulty of recruit to the police service of northern ireland and this will only make it bad secondly it will not do much for our relationship with the police in the republic of ireland the danger be that we just say that this be a matter for the psni and take a view from across the irish sea but northern ireland be a constituent part of the united kingdom and i hope that a united kingdom solution will be seek involve police force on this side of the irish sea and if necessary the uk ’s intelligence service to find out what happen 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely correct that be why i detail the meeting of official in the cabinet office who have chair a large number of regular operational meeting bring together the psni government departments and world class cyber security expert to ensure that all our collective skill across the union be galvanise in this space 
 i welcome the resignation of the chief constable it be a pity it take so long i think he see that the writing be on the wall when he know a motion be go to the policing board call for his resignation and so he should he have lose the confidence of officer not just because of this data breach but because he be prepared to throw junior officer to the wolf in order to placate sinn féin and it be right that he should go 
 the secretary of state have be a bit confusing in his answer about money he say that he recognise there will be considerable expenditure involve the information commissioner mitigation measure the relocation of officer and so on on hand he say that this will have to come from the justice department budget but on the other hand he seem to indicate that the government recognise that there will be additional expenditure for the police give that the police be already officer under strength will he give a commitment that any additional cost as a result of this will not have to come from the exist overstretched budget 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question i hope he will forgive i for push back slightly but i think i have be particularly clear on this and all of this could be solve much more easily if there be an executive in place i very much hope that that happen 
 the last few week have be hugely damaging to hard win progress in our still fragile society ordinary officer be feel vulnerable and demoralised and we be think of they and also of the family of the victim of the sean graham murder who have be thrust into a political row that they do not seek due to a heavy handed response in the interest of officer morale and impartial policing it be important that we know follow that ormeau road incident who in the northern ireland office speak to the chief constable and when the issue come up of sinn féin withdraw from the policing board what the nio say to the chief constable 
 if the hon lady would kindly nod to indicate whether she mean in the last couple of weeks—[interruption i be afraid i will have to come back to she with that answer if i may because i do not have those detail 
 i thank the secretary of state for his response 
 ever mindful that this be a practical physical issue for my constituent will the secretary of state outline what additional support and help be to be make available to psni officer who be under threat and whose family feel unsafe in their home over my year as an elect representative as a councillor an assembly member and a member of parliament a number of ruc and psni officer have come to i in need of assistance after be threaten that assistance be available fairly urgently will the secretary of state confirm that a budget be available to rehouse as a priority those police officer and civilian staff who be under threat take into consideration those who have move from district to another for safety reason they feel open and vulnerable to attack and an apology be simply not enough to allow they to lie safely in their bed at night what be need be a practical physical solution that be what i be ask for 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and for the way he put it we be currently at a stage where officer and staff who have a concern be report it to their senior management and a triage process have be in place as of   august people have self refer to the emergency threat management group within psni 
 if the hon gentleman will forgive i i be very wary of mention security matter for those at high risk so i will not do so there be a continue process to make sure psni have both the budget and the process available to ensure that extra security measure can be take and to ensure there be extra training and conversation to reassure people it will be a little while before we see much upward pressure on budget and i will then happily update the house 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement on the inquiry into the circumstance surround the crime of lucy letby 
 on   august as the whole house be aware letby be convict of the murder of baby and the attempt murder of other she commit these crime while work as a neonatal nurse at the countess of chester hospital between june and june as mr justice goss say as he sentence she to whole life order this be a 
 cruel calculated and cynical campaign of child murder 
 and a 
 gross breach of the trust all citizen place in those who work in the medical and caring profession 
 i think the whole house will agree it be right that she spend the rest of her life behind bar 
 i can not begin to imagine the hurt and suffer that these family go through and i know from my conversation with they last week that the trial bring these emotion back to the surface concerningly that be exacerbate by the fact the family discover new information about event concern their child during the course of the trial
