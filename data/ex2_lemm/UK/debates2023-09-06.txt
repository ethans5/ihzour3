 on my support for sustainable aviation i be pleased to host and address a new industry alliance hydrogen in aviation just last night here in parliament the alliance be design to help the uk lead innovation in that field that would along with duty free on arrival well support our sector aviation and our port be   vital for uk trade and employment we can do this in a clean smart way and duty free arrival can play an important part for the sector 
 in closing it be clear that the introduction of arrival duty free store would support economic growth and provide a tiny boost to the recovery of aviation travel and tourism from the pandemic this plan would be fund by industry and would be at bad cost neutral for the exchequer it be a low risk policy that have already prove successful in some country around the world there would likely be no impact on domestic high street sale due to limited market overlap and differ customer behaviour in duty free store by introduce duty free store on arrival the government can reaffirm their commitment to support the aviation travel and tourism sector and the economic prosperity that they afford by provide employment to so many of my constituent and to community across the entire country the policy be also popular with the electorate so i hope that the government will act swiftly to achieve this additional brexit freedom

 policing in northern ireland be a devolved matter as be the funding for it and it be the responsibility of northern ireland departments to allocate resource as they see fit 
 i congratulate the secretary of state on his anniversary in july the former chief constable warn that the force be at risk of be leave unrecognisable due to budgetary pressure that could see the loss of more than officer by with the force already at low than ideal number and the recent datum leak likely to have an impact what discussion be the secretary of state have with the department of justice in northern ireland and with the psni about how those pressure can be ease during this difficult time for the force 
 i have a number of conversation with the former chief constable about this issue the budget for give the department of justice a total allocation of £ obviously recognise the unique security situation in northern ireland the uk government make additional contribution to the psni ’s counter terrorism work through the additional security funding the uk contribution for be £ i be fully aware of the obvious issue that we talk about in the recent urgent question and i be sure that we will get on to those a bit later in question 
 i call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee 
 i wish my right hon friend a happy anniversary i also thank as he do the outgoing shadow team and welcome the new he be right to reference the recent datum breach which will have very much change the backdrop of the morale of the police in northern ireland and not just officer but those in support service budget be under pressure as we know but the security and safety of serve officer and those who work for the psni be always important particularly post the data breach give the potential risk from dissident that that create can he assure i that he will do all he can to deliver safety equipment protection and security for those who be feel most vulnerable at this time 
 yes i absolutely can i look forward to continue to work closely with the psni ’s senior leadership team who have a wealth of experience and be dedicate to keep the people of northern ireland safe i know that they be continue to work closely to ensure the very good possible response to this breach just to give a tiny bit of detail very briefly the psni and security partner will continue to take proportionate action to protect their officer staff and family and they have full government support in respond to the data breach at the moment our focus remain on provide specialist support and expertise to the psni from across government 
 i congratulate the secretary of state on his anniversary and welcome   the right hon member for leeds central hilary benn   to his new role as shadow secretary of state we look forward to work with he 
 this secretary of state have rightly say that many aspect of police in northern ireland be devolve but the data breach be a matter of national security because it include officer who work with the security service in a very specialist role involve counter terrorism and intelligence in northern ireland will he assure the house that whatever resource be require by the psni not only to fulfil that function but to protect its own officer and staff will be make available 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for congratulate i on my anniversary i be hop that he might give i a different anniversary present by head back to stormont but perhaps we can have that conversation later 
 indicate dissent 
 i have to ask have n’t i 
 the right hon gentleman ask a very sensible and serious question for which i thank he i obviously can not answer some element of his question in public but any additional funding require by the psni would be submit through an establish process we be currently at the very beginning of that establish process so it would not be right to pre empt that the government be clear that security be paramount and our focus remain on the item i set out it will move on but it be currently specialist support and expertise in response to the late assessment 
 i thank the secretary of state for that response in his early answer he refer to the psni ’s senior leadership team for the record my party fully support the psni in its impartial implementation of police across all community in northern ireland but we be in a crisis situation not only with the data breach but with the loss of confidence internally within the psni although it be the responsibility of the policing board to make appointment do he agree that perhaps what we need now in the absence of a chief constable be for someone to be bring in who have the experience and leadership credential that be need in the interim period pende the appointment of a new chief constable to take control of this situation 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for that question the way he pose it and the point behind it the senior management team be a strong and effective unit and the policing board have a lot on its plate at this point in time i believe it have even launch a review into how the policing board itself operate i be quite sure that question be be ask about what can be do in this space but as of now i can update the house only on what i have do 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the increase cost of live on people in northern ireland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the increase cost of live on people in northern ireland 
 the uk government be acutely aware of the cost of living pressure experience in all part of the uk since the onset of war in ukraine we provide an estimate £ of financial support to northern ireland include more than £ in the form of the energy price guarantee and the additional £ payment to help household with the rise cost of energy tackle inflation continue to be a top priority for this government 
 every country in the world be have to deal with the impact of the war in ukraine and the impact of the pandemic but only country be have to deal with the impact of brexit which be what be drive up price and the cost of live for people in northern ireland and across the uk be n’t it 
 i be incline just to say no the reality be that this conversation will keep go to and fro we have leave the european union and we be stay out of the european union our task be to make sure that we flourish as a nation outside the eu and i wish the hon gentleman would just get behind it and move on 
 in june this year accord to research by the trussell trust in people across northern ireland face hunger with nearly half of those refer to trussell trust food bank be child under the age of in scotland primary school child get a £ uniform grant and secondary school pupil get a £ uniform grant but the amount in wales in northern ireland be almost a quarter of that give that parent be choose between spend money on back to school supply or on food what step be the minister take to ease the cost of living pressure on family in northern ireland 
 as i say we provide a large sum of money to ease cost of living pressure in northern ireland the hon gentleman mention food bank which be very much on my mind give the scale of the food bank in wycombe i be very well aware of the cost of living pressure in northern ireland we continue to put large sum of money into northern ireland but it would be much well to deal with all these issue in the presence of a restore executive 
 may i join in the congratulation to my right hon friend on his anniversary i also thank the new shadow secretary of state for the huge contribution he have make as vice chairman of the uk eu parliamentary partnership assembly in welcome the money that have be provide to northern ireland to help with the cost of living pressure do the minister agree that it would be even well and more efficiently spend if the executive be back up and run 
 yes i absolutely do my right hon and learn friend be right on that time and again we be ask to intervene and every time we be ask to intervene that be a call for direct rule we do not intend to get into direct rule it would be far well if local decision be take by a locally accountable executive 
 the government have show their commitment to support the people of northern ireland through the recent increase in the cost of living in the absence of an executive we all accept   that be absolutely necessary will my hon friend assure i that the government will continue to intervene where necessary for the people of northern ireland 
 we will continue to work for the people of northern ireland respect the devolution settlement for example in recognition of the cost of living pressure face by worker across the uk the government increase the national minimum wage rate by to £ per hour for worker age and over at the spring budget we will continue to be seize of the need to help those least well off 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the cost of living crisis be clearly continue to bite hard in northern ireland with footfall at store across northern ireland fall by throughout august what step be the department take to enable people to take full advantage of the highly privileged economic status and market access that northern ireland now have which this government have deprive to the rest of the uk 
 i disagree with the hon gentleman ’s use of the term deprive but i be happy to tell he that next week we have the northern ireland investment summit we be determined to attract private sector investment into northern ireland and to promote inclusion in that growth northern ireland have a fantastically vibrant economy and i very much hope that the least well off will have opportunity through our investment in skill to develop themselves and to secure more well pay job in northern ireland so that they can move on 
 what recent assessment he have make of trend in the northern ireland economy and if he will make a statement 
 we routinely monitor trend in the northern ireland economy it have the ingredient require for economic success exceptional talent creativity and innovation although challenge persist recent indicator suggest resilience and the potential for growth this government remain committed to foster a productive environment for economic development and prosperity in northern ireland i look forward to our investment summit between and   september next week which be a fantastic opportunity to showcase northern ireland ’s economic potential to the world 
 i thank the minister for that encourage response he will be aware that northern ireland ’s large trading partner by a very long way be great britain it be therefore important that there be frictionless trade between great britain and northern ireland so will he update the house on what discussion he have have on the future operation of the green channel 
 of our priority now be the successful implementation of the windsor framework and that green channel we will continue to have conversation with colleague in the cabinet office who lead the   windsor framework taskforce i assure my hon friend that we be determined to ensure that that system work as seamlessly for everyone 
 will the minister confirm that at next week ’s investment conference the government will proactively market northern ireland ’s dual market access under the windsor framework 
 yes i can confirm that i be absolutely determined that we shall do so indeed next week i shall chair a session on that issue this be not just about access as of right to the uk market and as a privilege to the eu market it be also about be under our service regulation which be an advantage in combination with access to our free trade agreement such as the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership this be a unique opportunity in all of the world include right across the eu and i be convinced that he and i and we all should make the most of it 
 what step his department be take to help restore power sharing in northern ireland 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and it be good to see he in his place our focus remain on deliver for the people of northern ireland who expect and deserve locally elect decision maker to address the issue that matter to they i continue to engage regularly with all party leader and speak to they very regularly indeed 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer but the lack of a functioning devolve government in northern ireland mean that there be direct consequence for its people as be evidence by the high waiting list in the uk which would not be tolerate elsewhere in the absence of a restoration of power sharing there need to be a plan b what be it 
 obviously all my energy be spend on try to resolve the issue in order to allow the dup to come back to stormont and get the executive up and run there be myriad option available if we be to go down different route but i be afraid none of they be as ideal as stormont function and the institution of the belfast good friday agreement all be stand up 
 there be a big opportunity over the come week to restore the northern ireland executive do the secretary of state agree with i that key to that be the uk dublin and the eu listen hard to the concern of the dup about implementation of the windsor agreement 
 i thank the former secretary of state for that question he be absolutely right we have be listen in great detail to   the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey m. donaldson the dup leader and his team of negotiator over the course of   the summer we have have very detailed negotiation and i believe we be home in on what be actually require that might well mean we need conversation elsewhere but let we see where we get to in the course of the next couple of day 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the windsor framework which be agree month ago be a great achievement but it be also intend to enable the restoration of power sharing in northern ireland that have not happen what be the government ’s plan the secretary of state refer to the conversation he be have but what be the plan to get stormont back up and run 
 i sincerely welcome the right hon gentleman to his place and thank he for his question currently there be issue with particular political party we be talk to that party on a very regular basis at this point in time those talk have move forward substantially but he would have to check in with the dup leadership to see if i be correct just because the right hon gentleman can not see that do not mean that it be not happen thing i have learn as i have say many time from this dispatch box be that just because talk be be hold in a confidential manner do not mean that they be not take place and move forward 
 the secretary of state know that there be concern in the unionist community about unfettered access for northern ireland business trade with great britain the government say last month in the border target operating model that they be commit to that access as we all be and that 
 these arrangement will be enshrine and far strengthen in domestic legislation 
 can he tell the house when that legislation will be introduce 
 hopefully in very short order dependent on make sure we have get it exactly right so it answer the question and allow stormont and the executive to re form 
 what step he be take to help ensure that postal communication between britain and northern ireland be deliver without custom declaration 
 under the windsor framework send parcel to friend and family in northern ireland will be as smooth and easy as it be today remove any burdensome paperwork cost or delay northern ireland consumer will be able to order from business in the rest of the uk and receive good in the post as they do now without customs process or burdensome cost this will maintain consumer choice for british good in northern ireland business send good to other business will use our new green lane 
 a number of constituent and consumer have contact i to highlight that many ebay or amazon provider will no long ship to northern ireland as they state that they can not afford the enhance fee demonstrate that northern ireland continue to be treat differently it be cost small business and individual the ability to shop around what step can the minister take to revisit the framework with our eu counterpart to ensure free and fair trade throughout the united kingdom that be clear and easy to follow for all business 
 under the protocol as it be all parcel would have need to complete full international custom process i believe that the supplier to whom the hon gentleman refer will be make their plan under the protocol as it be under the windsor framework parcel to consumer will not be subject to those burdensome process he remind we all that we need to redouble our effort to communicate to supplier the message that they will be able to take advantage of a new green lane and supply to consumer in northern ireland it be a subject close to my heart and i can see that it be extremely close to his too 
 what step his department be take to ensure the sustainability of northern ireland ’s public finance 
 the northern ireland budget no bill be progress through parliament and be due to be debate in the other house next week the secretary of state have use his power to request information and advice from the northern ireland civil service on measure that could generate revenue and improve the sustainability of public finance 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer i congratulate he and the secretary of state on their anniversary and pay tribute to they for all they have do in the past year 
 some have suggest that we could reform the barnett formula to address the sustainability of public finance in northern ireland but do my hon friend agree that that be not a silver bullet and that trade off will need to be make to fund public service 
 i be extremely grateful to my hon friend for his question this be a very important point although we will remain open to discuss proposal put to we by the northern ireland party it would not be a silver bullet to reform the barnett formula an executive will still need to make trade off when they decide to spend scarce resource negotiation between the welsh government and the treasury on a fiscal framework which include an adjustment to the barnett formula take place over year so with the good will in the world it be not an issue that can be solve overnight what we need be a function executive and we stand ready to work with that executive in the meantime we will continue to engage with the northern ireland civil service on a range of measure that could improve fiscal sustainability 
 let i welcome the shadow minister 
 early year service be vital for child to reach their potential but they be underfunde and at risk in northern ireland northern ireland be the only part of the uk without a childcare strategy accord to the department for education it be delay again because early year face potential significant budget reduction when can hard press family in northern ireland expect the childcare strategy will the minister commit to early year service receive the increase multi year funding that be need to invest in child 
 i be glad to welcome the hon lady to her place as she know education be devolve in northern ireland and it be a matter for the education department there to take these decision but her point be well make and i be confident that when she make her visit to northern ireland like i she will be engage with all party on just such issue 
 what recent discussion he have hold with the department for the economy official on electricity generation and supply after september 
 my official and the department for energy security and net be engage with the northern ireland department for the economy to understand the fact and to assess any extra requirement energy be a devolved matter 
 i thank the secretary of state for that response but can he indicate to people who be concerned about recent newspaper speculation on the future of generation and supply in october and beyond that it be secure and that there will be no hiccup or hiatus between now and christmas 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his supplementary question northern ireland benefit from be part of the united kingdom with access to electricity from great britain through the interconnector and it also benefit from be part of the single electricity market on the island of ireland i and the minister of state work hard to ensure that that be preserve during the uk ’s exit from the european union we be work very closely with all official across government here and in the northern ireland civil service to ensure that the right preparation be in place for the winter 
 what recent assessment he have make of the availability of a veterinary product and b horticultural stock in northern ireland 
 the cliff edge on veterinary medicine have be remove protect the supply of those medicine in northern ireland through to while we work through sustainable long term solution we be much more optimistic about reach those solution in the context of the windsor framework there will no long be any   need for costly phytosanitary certificate for each movement of plant stay in the uk we have pave the way for ban plant specie to move again by the time of the next planting season these be priority case identify by the industry itself and we have progress further case since announce the windsor framework we be work closely with a wide range of stakeholder to ensure that gardener farmer and grower can access plant and seed from a wide variety of source 
 with regard to veterinary medicine i fear the minister ’s sunny optimism may be somewhat misplaced after all his preferred stakeholder mr bernard van goethem the deputy director general for food sustainability have make it abundantly clear to defra and the uk government that the negotiation on this matter be over the deal be do there will be no change to veterinary medicine this mean that insulin will no long be available in northern ireland for animal veterinary medicine for botulism—144,000 be issue last year will no long be available what will the secretary of state and the minister do about this 
 the hon gentleman have present i with information about which i be not aware beforehand i be certainly happy to look at what have be say but what i would say to he be that my right hon friend the prime minister do the deal that no say could be do that have transform the relationship with the european union and i be therefore confident that we will be able to deliver a deal on veterinary medicine as we sometimes say i do not recognise the information that the hon gentleman have present it be new to i and i shall be glad to look at it but we will certainly have to deliver a deal 
 the ulster farmers union estimate that veterinary medicine could be withdraw from the market in northern ireland unless the windsor framework be fix i urge the minister to do that 
 certainly my right hon friend make her point with great clarity of course have make it on an occasion such as this it have be hear by a wide range of ministers and i be confident that we will be able to redouble our effort to deliver what we need on veterinary medicine 
 the prime minister be ask 
 i welcome everybody back to prime minister ’s question 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday september 
 i would like to start by congratulate sarina wiegman and the lionesses on their fantastic performance at the world cup we be all incredibly proud of they i also know that the whole house will join i in send condolence to the family friend and colleague of sergeant graham saville it be   testament to his bravery that he die in the line of duty and a terrible reminder of the work that the police do every day to keep we safe 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 the labour party use to claim that it represent working class people but labour ’s ultra low emission zone expansion to greater london will now hammer million of work people with bill of £ per day or £ per year do the prime minister agree that it be unacceptable that londoner and those in surround county face this regressive and unacceptable tax and will he do everything that he can to help work people 
 i agree with my hon friend it be disappointing that last week the labour leader allow the labour mayor to introduce ulez charge hard work people £ every time they start their car add to the burden of the cost of living all i can say be that while we focus on help hard work family all the labour leader do be punish they 
 we now come to the leader of the opposition 
 i join the prime minister in congratulate the lionesses and also in his comment about sergeant saville i think we speak for the whole house when we speak on that subject 
 i also extend the warm welcome to my hon friend   the new labour member for selby and ainsty keir mather he have already make history for the labour party by overturn the large tory majority ever in a by election i also welcome the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip steve tuckwell and for somerton and frome sarah dyke 
 the roof of singlewell primary school in gravesend collapse in may thankfully it happen at the weekend and no child be injure the concrete ceiling be deem dangerous and liable to collapse and everyone know that the problem exist in other school yet the prime minister decide to halve the budget for school maintenance just a couple of year later do he agree with his education secretary that he should be thank for do a good job 
 i know how concerned parent child and teacher be and i want to start by assure they that the government be do everything that we can to fix this quickly and minimise the disruption to child ’s education we make no apology for act decisively in the face of new information 
 let i provide the house with an update on where we be of the school in england the vast majority will not be affect in fact in third of inspection of suspect school raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete be not actually present to tackle the of school that have be affect so far we be assign each school a dedicated caseworker and provide extra funding to fix the problem in the majority of case child will attend school as normal and the mitigation take typically just day or week to   complete we will do everything we can to help parent support teacher and get child back to normal school life as quickly as possible 
 wood green academy in sandwell be on labour ’s building list in the conservatives scrap it and now child there be in a crumble school the head of the national audit office accuse the prime minister of take a stick plaster approach the nao report say he cut £ the person who run the department for education say the prime minister be personally responsible on monday he leapt to his own defence say it be utterly wrong to blame he so why do literally everyone else say it be his fault 
 the professional advice from the technical expert on raac have evolve over time indeed it be something that successive government have deal with date back to as new advice have come forward the government have rightly decisively and swiftly act in the face of that advice 
 the right hon and learn gentleman talk about school budget and what i have do but let i just walk he through the fact of what that spending review actually do because he bring it up—[interruption no he bring it up so presumably he would like to hear the fact funding for school maintenance and rebuilding will average £ a year over this parliament as a result of that spending review represent a increase on the year before indeed far from cut budget as he allege the amount spend last year be the high in a decade that spending review maintain the school rebuilding programme deliver school over a decade a pace completely consistent with what have happen previously it be worth point out that during the parliamentary debate on that spending review the labour party and he do not raise the issue of raac single time before he jump on the next political bandwagon he should get his fact straight 
 carmel college in darlington be on labour ’s building list in the conservatives scrap it and now child there be in a crumble school on the hand we have the prime minister say it be nothing to do with he and on the other hand we have the fact there be a simple way to clear this up why do he not commit to publish the request from the department for education for the school rebuilding programme and what risk he be warn of before he turn they down 
 the right hon and learn gentleman have now bring up twice the labour school rebuilding programme so let we just look at the fact surround it because we do know the truth about that programme the nao which he have call on review that programme later on and what do it find it find that labour ’s school rebuilding programme exclude of school next what do it find it find that it be more expensive than it need to be needlessly waste resource that have go to school the bad bit because now he be talk about the physical condition of school be that that programme allocate fund solely on the basis of ideology with no regard whatsoever to the physical condition of school that be why the independent james review describe the programme as time consume and expensive”—just like the labour party 
 more 
 order we do not want to start off with somebody leave early because that be what will happen 
 well mr speaker conservative members want more so let i continue ferryhill school in county durham be on labour ’s building list in the government scrap that and now child there be in a crumble school the truth be that this crisis be the inevitable result of year of cut corner botched job and stick plaster politic it be the sort of thing you expect from cowboy builder say that everyone else be wrong and everyone else be to blame and protest that they have do an eff good job even as the ceiling fall in the difference be that in this case the cowboy be run the country be the prime minister not ashame that after year of tory government child be cower under steel support stop their classroom roof from fall in interruption 
 order seriously calm down i understand that this be the session and people be excited to be back at school but we expect well behaviour 
 this be exactly the kind of political opportunism that we have come to expect from captain hindsight here before today he have never once raise this issue with i across the dispatch box it be not even worthy of a single—[interruption 
 order the same apply to those on the labour benches we will have a calm question time go forward because i want to hear the question and the answer just like your constituent 
 before today the right hon and learn gentleman never once raise this issue with i in parliament it be not even worthy of a single mention in his so call landmark speech on education this summer if we have listen to he our kid would have be off school and lock down for long it be as simple as that he talk about year well let we see what have happen when we come into office third of school be rat good and outstanding now it be we introduce the pupil premium to get more funding to the most disadvantaged pupil today they be more likely to go to university and as a result of our reform we now have the good reader in the western world that be what year of education reform get you all of which be oppose by the labour party 
 the prime minister claim to be a man of detail but there have be parliamentary question from the opposition on this issue and an opposition day motion let we continue holy family catholic school in bradford be on the labour building list in the government scrap that and now child there too be in a crumbling school—[interruption 
 order mr holden i have hear enough this be the last time make up your mind either you go now or you be quiet for the remainder 
 if you can believe it mr speaker in april this year the education secretary sign a contract for refurbishment of her office it have her personal stamp of approval on it it cost i can not quite believe   this—£34 can the prime minister explain to parent whose child be not at school this week why he think that a blank cheque for a tory minister ’s office be well use of taxpayer ’s money than stop school from collapse 
 what i say to parent be that on the receipt of new information we have act decisively to ensure the safety of child and minimise disruption to education as we have lay out and communicate extensively that be the right thing to do i also gently point out to the right hon and learn gentleman that while the department for education start this process month ago in spring of last year as far as i can tell labour run wales still do not know which school be affect 
 the right hon and learn gentleman bring up funding so again let we look back to what happen in that spending review in that spending review i increase the department for education ’s capital budget by to a record £ it triple the amount that we spend on child with special educational need and disability it improve the condition of the overlook further education estate and it set the course for per pupil funding to be the high ever crucially it also invest £ to help our pupil recover the lost learning from covid he might remember that because we want pupil learning he want long lockdown 
 i just do not think the prime minister get how it ’ all fine out there be at odd with the live experience of million of work people across this country 
 let we go on this be a long list in at least school in essex be on labour ’s building list the government scrap they and now child there be in crumble school the prime minister will not admit that the reason he cut budget and ignore the warning be quite simple just as he think his tax rise be for other family to pay he think his school cut be for other family to endure do that not tell we everything we need to know he be happy to spend million of taxpayer money spruce up tory office and billion to ensure that there be no vat on tory school fee but he will not lift a finger when it come to protect other people ’s school other people ’s safety and other people ’s child 
 i know that the right hon and learn gentleman come here with prepared script but he have not listen to a single fact over question about the record amount of funding go into school or the incredible reform to education impact the most disadvantaged child in our society a record that we be rightly proud of yes we can name the school that be because we be react to information and publish it so that we know where the issue be something that we be still wait for from the welsh government 
 of course the right hon and learn gentleman want to score political point from something that we be deal with in the right and responsible way but i note that he have not mention a single other thing that have happen since we last meet at the dispatch box he talk about hard work family across britain but what have happen to energy bill down   what have happen to inflation down what have happen to small boat crossing down and what have happen to economic growth it have go up the right hon and learn gentleman try time and again to talk down the british economy but thankfully people be not listen his entire economic narrative have be demolish and the conservatives be get on deliver for britain hon member more 
 there will be more i call nicola richards 
 against a backdrop of improve economic news inflation fall energy bill come down and growth up people in the west midland be disappointed to see that labour run birmingham city council have go bankrupt as a sandwell resident and a west bromwich mp i be no strange to labour incompetence do the prime minister agree that labour have demonstrate yet again that they always run out of other people ’s money 
 my hon friend be exactly right we start by hear how labour in london be charge hard work people with ulez and now we be hear about how labour in birmingham be fail hard work people lose control of taxpayer money and drive their finance into the ground they have bankrupt birmingham we can not let they bankrupt britain 
 we come to the snp leader 
 the public need no reminding that today mark a year since the prime minister ’s predecessor   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss take office upon her speedy departure they will have think that thing be go to get well but unemployment figure be high food price be high mortgage rate be high and economic growth be stagnant when be the prime minister go to get off his backside and do something about it 
 what the hon gentleman fail to point out be the amount of time i have sit across the dispatch box from he and his colleague and hear how somehow we be a laggard when it come to growth he do not take the opportunity to correct the record now that figure have be publish which demonstrate that in fact we have the fast recovery of any european economy after covid 
 mr speaker you would be forgive for think that the prime minister think everything be all right but let we look at his proposal for a winter cost of live package on energy bill his plan be to do nothing on mortgage bill his plan be to do nothing and on food bill his plan be to do nothing when the secretary of state for education say early this week that everyone be do nothing she be refer to the prime minister be n’t she 
 i think the hon gentleman be a little out of practice because we have pay around half a typical family ’s energy bill over the past year that be support worth £ benefit family in scotland    on mortgage the chancellor ’s mortgage charter cover of the mortgage market and ensure that a typical mortgage holder can save hundred of pound a month on mortgage refinancing on energy thank to the action of this government we be support the hundred of thousand of job in the scottish oil and gas industry secure this country ’s energy supply which he oppose i will always do what be right for the people of scotland and it be time the snp do the same 
 i be delighted when the prime minister say last year that on his watch we would not lose swathe of farmland to solar application instead rightly argue for solar to be instal on rooftop yet my constituency see a constant flow of planning application for solar farm and battery storage plant on food produce land can i ask my right hon friend when will his pledge become a reality 
 my hon friend make an excellent point solar be of the cheap form of electricity generation so it be right that we try and see more of it across the country but we do need to protect our most valuable agricultural land so that it can produce food for the nation and increase our food security that be why thank to our change the planning system now set this out explicitly with a clear preference for brownfield site of course we want to do more to encourage barn top solar and the department for environment food and rural affairs will be update the house with further information on that policy in due course 
 last week the prime minister state that he be proud of his furlough scheme i wonder if he be equally proud of the £ he put on the national debt and the inflation it have cause be he proud of the job lose business close and life crush due to the lockdown be he proud of the increase nhs waiting list premature death and the young people now need mental health support finally be he proud of the excess death affect every of our constituency that nobody want to talk about and will he give   an undertaking to the british public a solemn under taking that they will never be inflict upon they again 
 as the hon gentleman know there be a formal inquiry regard covid which will examine all the decision that be make include lockdown and the impact of they but with regard to the furlough scheme i be proud that at a time of extreme anxiety in the country face an unprecedented situation this government put their arm around the british public to ensure that we protect job as the report from the office for national statistics show last week those action combine with all the other thing we do to support the economy ensure that we have the fast recovery through the pandemic of any european nation 
 as we be a nation of animal lover the conservative government ’s record on animal welfare be a source of great pride but sadly too many abuse remain from pet theft the smuggling of puppy and heavily pregnant   dog and dog with their ear horrifically crop to the illegal export of horse to europe for slaughter these issue be personal to i as a veterinary surgeon and to my constituent especially animal theft and livestock worry can the prime minister reassure the house that animal welfare be a key government priority and that he will bring forward the necessary legislation to tackle these issue as soon as possible 
 may i thank my hon friend for both raise this issue and also his work and expertise in the area i be proud that thank to the action that previous government have take on thing like cat microchipping the ivory ban and raise the maximum sentence for animal cruelty to year we be now the high rank g7 nation on world animal protection ’s animal protection index but we be determined to go even far and deliver on our manifesto commitment individually during the remainder of this parliament 
 the prime minister have say he will lead a government of honesty accountability and integrity so can he explain how he be find to have breach the code of conduct this time for fail to declare his wife ’s share in a childcare agency that receive a monetary boost from measure in his budget 
 if the hon lady read the full transcript and the full finding she will see a detailed explanation of what happen which the commissioner describe as a minor and inadvertent breach give that at the time i be not aware of the policy that be be discuss with i and correct it later on and could have correct it with slightly different language she will also know that i be not the only person across these dispatch boxes that have have the same thing happen to they 
 may i interest the prime minister in proposal from the commission for carbon competitiveness which i chair that would deliver net cheaply and without deindustrialise our economy it would help british manufacturer face import from country with low energy cost make our export more competitive everywhere and cut fuel duty at home we have strong backing from britain ’s heavy industry and cross party support from the excellent hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock whose name be also on the order paper would the prime minister consider add his name to our list of supporter as well 
 i be grateful to my hon friend and the commission for carbon competitiveness for the report that he have work on and highlight and the government be absolutely committed to put in place the necessary policy for uk industry to decarbonise successfully as he will be aware the government recently consult on address carbon leakage in particular with a range of potential option we be in the process of consider those response and will issue a formal response in due course 
 every year billion of wet wipe go out into our river and ocean and clog up our sewer i have be campaign for year to ban plastic in wet wipe the government have   finally promise to ban plastic in wet wipe but that be month ago and there have be nothing since then will the prime minister today finally give a date for when that ban will come into force and make a difference to our environment or be this another broken promise from his zombie government 
 in the comprehensive plan for water that be publish by the environment secretary in april we confirm our intention to ban wet wipe contain plastic subject as be legally proper to a public consultation that consultation will be launch in the come month in autumn this year and i know ministers will keep the house update on progress 
 i would like to offer some assistance on the small boat issue have my right hon friend consider the incongruity of the fact that a uk dinghy manufacturer try to sell into the eu market would have to apply the ce marking custom code and could be stop and check and a similar situation apply perversely with a simple thing like great britain to northern ireland trade but none of that apply seemingly when huge supersize dangerous cut and shut dinghy be take from turkey across the eu border into bulgaria and greece be my right hon friend as confuse as i be by the eu ’s double standard on that matter 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that we must do all we can to stop the boat and tackle illegal migration we know that the export of small boat across part of the european continent be a vital element of the smuggling gang tactic that be why specifically we be step up joint operation with turkey i raise this with the president when we speak so that we can tackle organise immigration crime and specifically disrupt the supply chain of boat part that be use for these dangerous crossing i will continue to keep he update on our progress 
 year ago in plymouth we lose people in the bad mass shoot the country have see for a decade the government have finally consult on firearm reform but after pressure from shoot group even those sensible measure look like they could be water down will the prime minister bow down to lobbyist from the shooting industry or will he stand with the grieve family and with those in plymouth who want to see no tragedy like this ever happen again with strong gun law 
 i know how important this issue be to the hon gentleman follow the horrific shooting in his constituency and my thought be with the family of all those who be kill he will know that firearm be subject to stringent control and rightly so but those control be keep under constant review for example we have take action to improve information sharing between gps and the police to ensure that people be not give access to firearm without their medical condition be check there be statutory guidance that the chief officer of police have be improve so that how people apply for firearm be assess properly include check on social medium on    the matter that the hon gentleman specifically raise the home office be in the process of consider response to that consultation and will respond in due course 
 later today i be bring forward a minute rule bill to include the provision of automate external defibrillator in all new housing development of dwelling or more will my right hon friend support that provision and ask his relevant cabinet colleague to engage with i to ensure that these life save piece of equipment can become commonplace where they can have the most impact close to people ’s home 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of these lifesave device that be why the national planning policy framework already expect planning policy and decision to promote public safety but it be also why recently the government launch a pound fund that will place around new defibrillator in community across england to help improve equality of access to these lifesave device 
 in the outwood academy riverside free school application in middlesbrough be approve with its year intake arrive the following year there have be far intake every year since but there be still no new building i have have no response to my request for a meeting with the secretary of state but that original intake be destine to spend their entire secondary education in various temporary adapt premise with pupil be shunt around old building talk of level up and address the gcse attainment gap ring hollow will the prime minister and his education secretary get off their derrière and sort this out 
 i be happy to ensure that the hon gentleman get an answer to his specific question on that school but more generally i be proud of   what the government be do in teesside and tees valley to support education not only with the recent announcement of new form but also it be an education investment area receive extra funding and resource that be why we have see standard in reading and math increase considerably and we be determined to keep go 
 the prime minister be aware of how the raac issue have affect school in essex we have a high number of school that have be impact he have rightly say today that the government be do everything they can to get child back to school i know there be a debate on this later today but will he commit to fully fund both the capital and revenue cost associate with get child back into school 
 i hope he will commit to meet the leader of essex county council because it be pioneer some great reform right now where it be look to support maintain school as well as academy trust i think the government could get some good insight into how we can get child back to school fast and look at the funding model 
 i thank my right hon friend for her constructive engagement with the department i pay tribute to her school leader and local authority for everything they be do i be happy to give she the reassurance as the chancellor have already say that new funding will be provide to school to deal with this issue to ensure that we can get through this as quickly as possible for my right hon friend ’s constituent and parent and indeed everyone else’s the department for education be in the process of increase the number of dedicated caseworker from to we have project director regionally on the ground to support and we have more than double the number of survey firm so that we can rapidly over the next few week fully assess all the relevant school and have a mitigation plan in place 
 steel- worker in my constituency have watch in frustration as other government have pump investment into decarbonisation while successive tory government have sit on their hand when will the prime minister finally conclude the talk with tata steel can he guarantee that level of investment will match what other european government be do on decarbonisation and will he guarantee that the conclusion will be base on serious engagement comprehensively with the steel union 
 steel be absolutely vital to the uk this matter be of course of interest to the hon gentleman but i have also discuss it extensively with my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft and that be because the industry support local job and economic growth conversation with specific company such as tata be ongoing but they be understandably commercially sensitive we share the ambition of secure a decarbonise sustainable and competitive future for the industry in this country in the meantime we be support the sector with our energy intensive industry exemption which provide discount energy bill we also have the industrial energy transformation fund which support steel company with their energy bill and the transition through capital to a green future 
 week ago the government announce that the bolsover school ’s bid for a form in my constituency have be successful across the country some of school leaver at year old go on to a form but in bolsover it   be in clowne it be and in shirebrook it   be will the prime minister join i in thank the redhill academy trust matthew hall the headteacher of bolsover school and all those who have help to bring a form to bolsover 
 i congratulate redhill and everyone involve with the successful bid for the new form in bolsover i be delighted that the bid be successful i know that my hon friend share my desire to ensure a world class education for every single of our young people across the country because that be the good way to provide they with the opportunity for a well life the new programme of form will deliver that in his constituency and many other across the nation 
 the north- east have be underfunde in term of transport investment for decade hs2 which be mean to be an economic development and connectivity lifeline be now not come anywhere near the a1 northumberland dualle decision have be delay yet again and our regional rail service be still run on outdated infrastructure and roll stock 
 with all that in mind will the prime minister commit the funding to reopen the leamside line from gateshead to county durham to take pressure off the east coast main line and aid economic wellbeing and the movement of passenger and freight service in the north east of england or be level up just rhetoric 
 obviously it would not be right for i to comment on specific project but to give the hon gentleman a sense of our commitment what i can tell he be that in real term since we have spend over a more in central capital investment in northern transport every single year compare with labour ’s last year in government that be what we be do for northern transportation specifically when it come to reopen and restore railway line where be the that we do from ashington to blyth 
 i have a cheerful question that i know my right hon friend the prime minister will find impossible to resist he will be aware of the work that i have be do with no ’s uk ambassador for mental health dr alex george to establish early intervention mental health hub across the country we have get the pilot which seem to be lose somewhere between the treasury and the department of health i know he will sort that problem out but will he meet dr alex george and i to discuss it far these hub will make a massive difference in constituency across the country we all know the problem with child and adolescent mental health service and the perverse situation where child and young people have to get progressively bad before they get the treatment they need i know that the prime minister will be very supportive of this mr speaker 
 i know that my hon friend be rightly a passionate advocate for improve mental health support for young people which be something i know we be do and i be proud of our record particularly in increase the number of mental health support team who work with school and expand community service i know that the department of health and social care be look at the role that early support hub might play in this plan but i be happy to meet my hon friend personally to discuss how we can push this through 
 we have hear far too much lately about ministerial posterior and little about prosperity for the country even in these die day of a lame duck government will the prime minister stop prevaricate and subscribe to the horizon programme for the sake of vital british science innovation and cancer research 
 this government be invest record sum in british science and research and development because we believe that be critical to a bright economic future and spread opportunity   our priority and preference be to associate to horizon but we want to make sure that that be on term that be right both for the british taxpayer and for british science and research i can commit to the hon lady that we have be extensively involve in discussion i hope to be able to conclude those successfully and when we do i hope she will be the to stand up and congratulate the government 
 september be childhood cancer awareness month but it also mark year since the death of my constituent sophie fairall she be only year old every day in the uk young people will be diagnose with cancer and of those will not survive those who do face a lifetime of side effect from treatment that be just not design for small body when will the prime minister publish a childhood cancer action plan 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue i extend my sympathy to her constituent ’s family as she raise she be right to continue campaign in this important area i hope she will understand that i can not pre empt the specific content of the strategy but i can tell she that it will draw on previous work include submission from childhood cancer charity and stakeholder to our recent call for evidence of course we want to hear from they to highlight and get a sense of the issue that she specifically raise but i will ensure that we write to she to give she a sense of the timing 
 every year the snp scottish government mitigate against the cruell of westminster policy by spend £ on support hard work family against the brutal bedroom tax and over £ on cover the child benefit cap astonishingly we have learn over the summer that the leader of the opposition be an enthusiastic supporter of these tory cruel welfare policy with u turn after u turn from the labour party give that the tories and labour be cheek of the same arse oh!]—offere no change no vision and no hope do the prime minister agree that the only way scottish voter can rid themselves 
 order i be not go to have we both stand up of we be go to give way and it will not be i let we think about language let we be more temperate and make sure that the pride of this parliament shin through that certainly will not be by use such language 
 i be happy to change the offend word to bottom give that the tories and labour be cheek of the same bottom offer no change no vision and no hope do the prime minister agree that the only way for scottish voter to rid themselves of these heinous policy be to vote for the snp to leave westminster forever 
 obviously not i think the thrust of that question be direct at the leader of the opposition rather than i and i would not want to get in the middle of that what i can say be that we want to ensure a welfare system that be compassionate and look after the most vulnerable in our society while support    into work those who can do so because that be also fair for everyone else and british taxpayer i believe that be a system that we be achieve right now we be   provide people in scotland with thousand of pound of support to help with energy bill and everything else and we will continue to do so 
 on a point of order mr speaker in prime minister ’s question the prime minister say that my right hon and learn friend the leader of the opposition have never raise the issue of school building safety before and he specifically mention his education speech early this summer that be categorically untrue i wonder if the prime minister want to correct the record my right hon and learn friend mention it as part of that speech in fact it have also be raise by the opposition more than time in this house and be the subject of an opposition day debate in the name of the leader of the opposition in may i be sure that the prime minister would not want to give the house the wrong impression 
 the hon lady have raise the point of order quite correctly and have correct the record herself i be sure that the prime minister will be notify of the point she have raise we will leave it for now and see what happen 
 on a point of order mr speaker may i seek your guidance on how hon member may hold energy company to account for their shortcoming with their business customer i have be in contact with edf energy for a number of month over its multiple failure that have severely impact the circle a wonderful community interest company in easterhouse edf ’s multiple failure to correct the mistake be incredibly worrying i seek your guidance on how a member of this house might be able to use its procedure to hold energy company to account 
 it be disappointing to hear about edf and the way that it be not respond as an experienced member i be sure the hon gentleman know that the table office can advise he on the various way that he can pursue edf on this matter 
 on a point of order mr speaker during prime minister ’s question the leader of the opposition accuse the prime minister of spend taxpayer money to refurbish tory office i believe   the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer   be refer to the department for education a whitehall government non partisan civil service office will you mr speaker ask the leader of the opposition to come back to correct the record 
 i do not think i need to be tell by the hon gentleman what i have to do he have certainly put it on the record and it will have be hear by the opposition you be right to raise a point of order mr stafford but do not start instruct i on what i need to do we will leave that there at this stage 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require the provision of automate external defibrillator in all new housing development of dwelling or more to require developer to provide funding for the maintenance of such defibrillator for a period of year after installation and for connected purpose 
 my bill aim to increase the number of automate external defibrillator by ensure that in future they be an essential feature of every new housing development that be a vital step in our endeavour to increase cardiac arrest survival rate crucially my bill also require funding for the continue maintenance of defibrillator i will outline the scope of my bill and its link to important debate that the commons have have on defibrillator secondly i will highlight the scientific evidence from around the world that overwhelmingly support the introduction of my bill and i will present the important argument for a maintenance provision in the bill 
 i be grateful to dave bowling a community responder in my constituency for provide the inspiration for the bill which as this speech will demonstrate have the potential to save many life the powerful benefit of defibrillator have already be highlight in parliament my bill follow the defibrillators availability bill bring forward by my hon friend   the member for lewes maria caulfield and the automated external defibrillators public access bill bring forward by   the hon member for strangford jim shannon additionally   the hon member for erith and thamesmead abena oppong asare   recently lead an important debate on public access to defibrillator and a sponsor of my bill my hon friend   the member for stoke on trent north jonathan gullis have be advocate for great uptake of aed through his leadership of the all party parliamentary group on defibrillator i also note with appreciation that the leader of the house of commons my right hon friend   the member for portsmouth north penny mordaunt be the mp to call for all mps to complete defibrillator training such discussion and endorsement in parliament be of great value in increase public awareness of defibrillator 
 i acknowledge the very positive step that have be take to provide defibrillator in every school and on our high street and the funding that the prime minister mention early but the bill target an area that be yet to be address private residential home it be crucial to note that in the uk most out of hospital cardiac arrests—70 accord to the resuscitation council uk occur in the home however when i look at my constituency and other on the defib finder website it be apparent that defibrillator be predominantly instal in non residential area that be a problem in sweden researcher have find that a person be time more likely to survive a cardiac arrest in public than at home that statistic could be mirror in the uk which be why i be call for a legal requirement to ensure that all new housing development have a defibrillator an essential piece of life save equipment 
 when cardiac arrest happen it be crucial that a defibrillator be nearby accord to a study by sarkisian et al the survival rate for cardiac arrest decrease by for every additional metre between the patient and the defib it be therefore concern that accord to a recent study by burgoine et al.—many member will have read about it in the paper last week the median distance of a publicly accessible defibrillator from any give postcode in great britain be metre 
 when someone have a cardiac arrest their heart stop and it be a race against time to ensure that oxygen continue to travel to their brain cardiopulmonary resuscitation chest compression with rescue breath be essential for maintain the flow of blood and oxygen during this time however the use of a defibrillator be the only method that can seriously improve survival rate by shock the heart and cause it to resume its normal rhythm that restore the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain if a defibrillator be use before an ambulance arrive survival rate from cardiac arrest increase from less than to more than 
 give that there be cardiac arrest in the uk every year it be crystal clear that my bill be necessary to increase the number of defibrillator in private residential area and i hope that this will not be a controversial issue for the house some may suggest that the bill will impose an additional financial burden on housing developer but the cost of a defibrillator be small in relation to the entire budget of a housing project just over £ the bill will also empower resident to learn about defibrillator and to know where they be and how to use they everyone should know what a defibrillator be and hopefully where to find 
 the part of my bill require developer to provide funding for these new defibrillator for year after their installation if defibrillator be to work and    to save life they must be maintain so what maintenance be require there must be an electricity supply to maintain the temperature of the defibrillator this protect the battery life of the device secondly battery need to be replace after to year replacement battery typically cost just £ thirdly electrode pad need to be replace after year replacement pad cost only £ as for who would carry out the maintenance i believe that a number of organisation would be well place to visit each defibrillator in an area once every year for that purpose for example the fire service the responder network include the local ambulance service or even perhaps the local authority funding for the maintenance could well be achieve through a section agreement between housing developer and local authority 
 my bill have important aspect the provision of a defibrillator in every new housing development consist of more than dwelling and the provision of year maintenance funding all for an additional cost of about £ or £ per property that be a small price to pay for immediate access to a lifesaving defibrillator the scientific evidence overwhelmingly emphasise the impact that the bill could have and i hope that the house recognise that and decide to take action to improve cardiac arrest survival rate 
 let i end with dave bowling ’s call to action defibrillation for the nation 
 question put and agree to 
 order 
 that stephen metcalfe anna firth mr mark francois jackie doyle price carol monaghan jonathan gullis sir chris bryant and giles watle present the bill 
 stephen metcalfe accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday november and to be print bill 
 consideration of lords message 
 i beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment 44d 44e 44f g 44h and 44j. 
 let i begin by remind the house that the government have seek to make a realistic assessment of what we can well deliver for family more than a quarter of a century after the belfast good friday agreement nearly year since the ceasefire and well over year since the trouble begin the backdrop be that current mechanism for address legacy matter work for only a very small number of people rather than the overwhelming majority and establish criminal justice process be increasingly unlikely to deliver outcome that people desire especially in respect of prosecution 
 we have only issue leave to debate today conditional immunity the purpose of this legislation be to give people more information in a short timeframe than be possible with the current mechanism we do that by create an effective information recovery process that rely on a conditional immunity model i attend a decent chunk of the debate in the house of lords yesterday and although i be sympathetic to the intent behind lords amendment 44e which be to give family member a role in decide whether immunity should or should not be grant immunity risk undermine the effectiveness of these provision and the principal aim of information recovery for example the public interest consideration element in condition d would lead to uncertainty about the circumstance in which immunity will be grant undermine the clear and transparent approach that we have develop over time if we be to ensure that the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery can obtain as much information for family as possible we need to ensure that the right incentive be in place for individual to come forward to provide that information 
 i appreciate that the secretary of state whom by the way i greatly respect have come here to try to deliver the bill as it be but may i make this point to he a great many people out there have lose love one over the year we all know who they be and on every occasion they seek justice as i say to my hon friend   the member for east londonderry mr campbell even if there be only a candle of light of a possibility that someday those who have murder someone ’s love would be hold accountable for it that be what we need let i say with respect that today the government be extinguish that light for all those who have lose love one there be many people in the chamber today and in the public gallery who have lose love one on behalf of all those family i implore the secretary of state and the government to think very carefully about the direction   that they be take because the family right to justice be be extinguish and that can not bode well for the future 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his point for the way he have raise it and indeed for the numerous conversation we have have on these matter outside this place and within it he know the answer that i be go to give he i will never and can never put myself in the shoe of the people who have lose someone i just can not however i can see a process that have work for only a very few people consider the quantum of people who be affect by the trouble and who lose people indeed the chance of get justice for they be dwindle all the time 
 the government have come to the conclusion that this be the right way forward because we hope that we can in good time at least get some information recover for those family that ask for it and also through other element of the bill that be not the subject of this package of amendment if someone mislead the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery there be criminal process involve perjury and a whole host of criminal investigation that can take place a whole host of thing have change that i hope will allow lot of information to be recover in quick time for family 
 the secretary of state say he can not put himself in the shoe of the victim but he could listen to they can he tell we how many or what percentage of the victim he have meet have show support for this piece of legislation 
 very few have show support for this legislation but i have meet many as have my lords minister lord caine in fact part of the process of change the bill have come from those conversation i understand that lot of family do not want this bill but the question then be if not this bill then what interruption   the hon member for foyle colum eastwood   say stormont house but he know that stormont house do not have cross party agreement at the time and that the ulster unionist party do not agree to it 
 rise 
 i happily give way please correct i 
 would the minister acknowledge that it do have cross party support the ulster unionists defer on small matter and that it be recommit to by his government and the irish government as recently as january 
 and it do not move forward because of the different political issue that come about 
 the minister make this very point at an event that i be at at the weekend but it be chatham house rule so i be not allow to talk about it he put forward the argument that the party just could not agree but i be involve in many of those discussion and i can tell he that the british government drag their foot month after month around the issue of onward disclosure that be what happen and it be important to put that on the record the vast majority   of political party and victim group in northern ireland support stormont house but the british government just do not want to do it that be why it do not get deliver 
 i be afraid i do not quite believe that that be the case however the british government have commit to full disclosure to the icrir which allow for a huge amount of information to be put forward in those circumstance and the possibility of ensure that the commissioner can obtain as much information as possible from family 
 the minister say that if family be to have a say on whether immunity should be grant it would undermine the whole thrust of the bill but the point of the bill be to ensure that people and family who have be hurt traumatise and damage by what happen as a result of terrorist activity in northern ireland over year have their say surely the good way of give they justice after they have hear what the circumstance of the case be what the attitude of the individual be and what can be disclose be to at least let they have the final say on whether they feel that the individual concern should be grant immunity 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his point the many amendment to this bill throughout the last year have include measure on how family should be engage with and how their view should be hear throughout the process to ensure that the commission can obtain as much information for family as possible we need to ensure that the right incentive be in place for individual to come forward and provide that information the possibility that eligible individual who co operate fully with the commission could then be prevent from obtain immunity from prosecution be highly likely to act as a significant disincentive for individual to disclose that information 
 this be never go to be an easy issue or an easy bill if it be easy it would have be do many year ago what the government be propose may be right or it may be part right and part wrong i certainly think that give those survivor and their family a right to veto would be the wrong step to take so the government be right on that however i think the house will find comfort in the fact that the secretary of state will keep the progress of the enactment under review and if there be abuse or thing that be wrong we can revisit it tidy it up and make it work well this can not be see as a closed chapter job do rather it be the start of a new process quite experimental in some way of learn from other people ’s experience if we have that comfort that this be amendable and reviewable it might help to assuage some if not all the concern 
 i thank the chairman of the select committee for his point he will know that other amendment i have table have try to make this body as independent as it can possibly be i be sure he will have take great heart from the appointment of the chief commissioner designate sir declan morgan and from the comment he have be make about how he   intend to go about his business he be engage widely even at this point and will do so even far when the bill get royal assent and become an act just in the practice of sir declan in put the flesh on the framework that we be build here for the commission i think my hon friend will see that there be lot of opportunity for it to do exactly what he wish it to do 
 this be understandably an emotional and difficult topic and it be that mean a lot to i have serve as a parliamentary private secretary to the former secretary of state for northern ireland my right hon friend   the member for great yarmouth sir brandon lewis and also have love one who live through the trouble on either side of the border the discussion be difficult and i want to give my support to the secretary of state on this if there be a threat of prosecution down the line it will be the family of british soldier and the family particularly in unionist community who will not get the answer they rightly deserve it will disincentivise people from come forward and present evidence 
 even though justice might not be serve in a court there will at least be answer to the question that family member have be ask for a long time it will offer some small hope of reconciliation for those family if they can finally get the truth about what happen and who be involve in order to allow northern ireland to heal and move on i have engage regularly with member of the northern irish community and they want to talk about education and about create more high skilled high wage job they be desperate to see prosperity for their great country and those be the thing that that nation want to move on to look forward to rather than continuously look backwards 
 i thank my hon friend for his point and for his committed work in my department i be not there at the time but i know of it i understand the point that he make over the past year we have endeavour through amendment to make the bill very much focus on all victim of the trouble so that all victim can if they choose to do so contact the commission and start a process that will hopefully get they some information in relatively quick time 
 we have recently have an example of a roman catholic priest who be involve in ira activity when talk about his role he say that his only regret be that his effort be not more effective in kill people if that kind of evidence be elicit if people come forward and show no remorse and no regret and offer no comfort to victim do the secretary of state really think victim will feel any well would not give they the opportunity to say in the light of that man ’s attitude i do not believe he should be grant immunity be a well way of ensure that justice be at least see to be do for those people 
 unbelievably evil thing be do in the course of the trouble unbelievably hideous act be commit and none of we can change that as i say at the beginning of my contribution it have not be possible to give justice to a huge number of those family even today even after the passage of all that time and even after numerous investigation in some case this bill try to get some information to family   who contact the commission to request it so they can well understand the situation it will not change anything that happen in the past it simply can not 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for give way again the premise of his argument and some of the argument we have hear from member on those benches which be sometimes extremely condescend to victim who have be go through this for many decade be that people will come forward with the truth if we grant immunity well there be glare example that prove that be totally wrong during the bloody sunday inquiry the soldier be grant immunity within the context of the inquiry after another they lie through their tooth and that have be prove by an international public inquiry with the disappear again ira people be provide immunity within the context of the organisation that be look to find those body and we still have body out there that have not be find because those people do not come forward and tell the truth even when they be grant immunity 
 the lie that be be use to sell this bill be just that a lie it be patently untrue and it will not do anything to give people the truth and justice they desire 
 the hon gentleman characterise it completely incorrectly there be no guarantee that the bill will bring information forward but as i try to outline very little new information have come to light that have lead to new case very few people have be able to receive justice he mention the point that in the past some people might have mislead a judge lead inquiry well that be perjury and perjury be now part of this bill the bill have change a huge amount over the past year and it be worthy of support 
 this may well be our last chance to discuss the bill in this chamber may i ask the secretary of state to reflect on the fact that virtually every independent human right expert include most notably the northern ireland human rights commission which have statutory function do not believe that the bill be human right compliant even sir declan morgan who have be appoint to head up the icrir could not give a categorical answer to that question in a recent newspaper interview indeed it be anticipate that a whole series of case will need to be bring forward to clear up the issue around human right compliance 
 i understand that point and again that be the purpose of all the amendment we have make the hon gentleman will know that i be not comfortable with the bill that i inherit because as there would be a gap in investigation i do not believe it could be article compliant amendment have be introduce that completely change that and i believe that the bill be now compliant but that will undoubtedly be test only when it be test and the result come forward can anybody actually say that the bill be article compliant as government lawyer truly believe it be 
 the secretary of state be unhappy with the bill he inherit which be the context of the amendment and change that have be make to this bill have he consult with the chief commissioner designate   on the lords amendment he be reject today if the chief commissioner designate be consult do he agree to reject the amendment 
 i determine not to speak to the chief commissioner designate so that i could maintain his independence when the bill be enact 
 in several of the secretary of state ’s answer to question from opposition members he have say if there be extra evidence have he or the british government have the opportunity to speak to the irish republic government about their role i believe the irish republic government through the garda síochána have an evidence base on the murder that be carry out by the ira along the border i be very conscious of chief superintendent harry breen and bob buchanan in lexie cummings in and ian sproule in the people who do that escape across the border and the garda síochána have indicate 
 order i be very conscious of time you be down to speak and you have make your speech already other people need to get in this be a very important issue and i want to make sure that people can make their speech 
 forgive i mr speaker i be try to take as many intervention as possible 
 i know we all know that mr shannon be very good but it be the amount of time intervention have to be short and punchy not speech he be go to make a speech later 
 i can assure   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   that i have be speak to the irish government about element of what he mention 
 the commission will grant immunity from prosecution only if an individual provide an account that be true to the good of their knowledge and belief we have develop a robust test for immunity in which their account must be test against any information that the commission hold if an individual do not provide a truthful account of their action that could be pass to family or if they do not participate in the immunity process at all immunity will not be grant and they would remain liable to prosecution should evidence exist where a prosecution take place and should a conviction be secure an individual will not be eligible for the early release scheme under the northern ireland sentences act again that be a result of amendment make in this house 
 similarly although i acknowledge the sentiment   behind introduce licence condition under lords amendment 44e i respectfully suggest that the government have seek to address these issue through amendment that be adopt on report in the other place these amendment send a clear message that once immunity be grant individual who be convict of offence that could impede reconciliation will lose that immunity in the government ’s view this approach strike the right balance between provide sufficient certainty   as to the effect of a grant of immunity necessary to   encourage participation and ensure that there be appropriate consequence for those whose behaviour after be grant immunity be not compatible with the fundamental aim of the bill 
 the alternative propose by the opposition would not support an effective information recovery process and i therefore ask that the house join i in disagree to amendment 44d 44e 44f g 44h and 44j. 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i take this opportunity to welcome my hon friend   the member for putney fleur anderson   to the front bench team and to express my thank to my hon friend   the member for gower tonia antoniazzi   for all the service she give during her time as part of the shadow northern ireland team 
 as the house will be aware we do not support this bill but i do not understand why the secretary of state be seek to overturn the amendment table by lord murphy and pass in the other place yesterday i listen very carefully to the argument advance by the secretary of state but i do not think they stand up because the lords amendment would not take away the commission ’s ability to issue immunity to an individual who come forward and give truthful evidence about what happen lord amendment 44e be not a veto but it would allow the family of those who be kill or seriously injure in the trouble to have some voice in the process i understand that relative of those who be murder be with we in the gallery and they be still seek justice
