 before we begin today ’s proceeding i know that the house will wish to join i in acknowledge that today mark the anniversary of the beginning of russia ’s attack on ukraine this house have always stand with the people of ukraine in the face of russian aggression as they stand up for their ideal which underpin a peaceful stable and democratic world our thought today be with the people of ukraine as well as with our colleague in the ukrainian parliament 
 i have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that his majesty have signify his royal assent to the follow act

 water special measures act 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to help protect consumer against fraud 
 fraud devastate live and this government be determined to meet that challenge head on include through the new expand fraud strategy that we promise in our manifesto we be work with law enforcement and industry to well protect the public and we be demand that the tech company go far and fast to protect consumer at risk of fraud on their platform 
 online scam be a cause of particular concern in hendon a number of my constituent have be target and lose £ to an online scam many of the scam originate overseas what discussion have the minister have with the department for science innovation and technology about tackle online scam and work with other country to crack down on scam originate abroad 
 my hon friend raise an important issue not least that the vast majority of scam be perpetrate by criminal gang base overseas we need the support of overseas government and agency and the co operation   of tech firm to prevent fraud from take place on their platform my noble friend lord hanson will be meet tech firm next month to confirm what action be be take work across government include with partner in dsit and other we will not hesitate to take further action where necessary 
 it be disappointing to see in the january figure that fraud have rise again after it have be come down but i commend the government for proceed with the payment services amendment regulations to slow down payment where there be a reasonable suspicion of fraudulent activity what effect do the minister believe that change will make 
 the right hon gentleman make an important point he be right that the late statistic show that there be incident in the year end september that be in people become a victim which demonstrate the urgent need for action the government be take action the home secretary the chancellor and the secretary of state for science innovation and technology recently write to tech and telecom company urge they to go fast and far on fraud and we expect they to do so 
 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of extend the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain 
 settlement in the uk be a privilege not an automatic entitlement there be already a range of period of time that people be require to spend in the uk before they qualify for settlement the number of people grant settlement each year will reflect the number of migrant come to the uk in early year this government be determined to bring control to the immigration system and to bring net migration down and we keep all our policy under review 
 there be clearly a cost to do nothing about the current indefinite leave to remain policy and a recent centre for policy studies report estimate the net lifetime cost as £ for those expect to be grant ilr over the next year what be the minister ’s assessment of that cost 
 i gently say to the hon member that the number of settlement grant grow by almost a in the final year that his party be in government compare with we will take absolutely no lesson from the tory party and a shadow home secretary who completely lose control of our border allow net migration to quadruple to a record high of nearly while the number of dangerous boat crossing soar 
 only refugee whose case prove that they would be at harm if they return home be give indefinite leave to remain in this country—30,000 people last year they will not leave the united kingdom to return to the bomb and the dictator but without a route to citizenship they will   find it hard to get a job to support their family get a mortgage or have a say in their local community will the minister meet i and other mp who be concerned about the new guidance on naturalisation to talk about how we can properly support integration in the uk 
 my hon friend will know that for many generation refugee who have arrive for resettlement in the uk have be able to apply for british citizenship if they meet the condition and that continue to be the case the uk must always do its bit to support those who be flee persecution but we be also clear that we must do all we can to prevent people from make dangerous boat crossing and risk their life in the arm of criminal gang 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as we have hear accord to the centre for policy studies over migrant from the past year could soon claim indefinite leave to remain in nhs care benefit social housing and more that will cost £ nearly year of defence spending or almost all income tax receipt for a year will the minister commit to extend the qualifying period for ilr or will she accept that the consequence of her policy be a liability for the public of hundred of billion of pound 
 i be still quite flabbergast by the question that the conservatives ask in the house their party see net migration more than quadruple to record level the shadow minister will know that the prime minister have also pledge a white paper on reduce net migration that be at the end of last year and work be under way to consider a range of proposal include how well to support the integration and employability of refugee 
 what recent progress her department have make on tackle antisocial behaviour 
 what recent progress her department have make on tackle antisocial behaviour 
 may i support you mr speaker in your word about the people of ukraine on the anniversary of the invasion include those who be here in the uk through the homes for ukraine scheme 
 too many community be blight by antisocial behaviour which have increase over the past year while neighbourhood policing be heavily cut that be why this government ’s plan for change mean put neighbourhood police back on the beat in our town centre and community and strong power in our crime and police bill to be introduce tomorrow to tackle off road bike repeat offender and shop theft 
 mark porter be a community leader who run kidsgrove ladsanddads around young people play football at birchenwood field every weekend yet the football pitch be constantly damage by   off road bike the same happen at burslem golf club and across estate such as mill hill in tunstall what step will be take to tackle the impact of off road park on community in stoke on trent north and kidsgrove 
 my hon friend make an important point some off road bike be a total nightmare and can drive community up the wall with harassment and intimidation that be why we be strengthen power at the moment the police must provide repeat warning before they can take action to seize such bike we think that they should be able to seize those antisocial bike straightaway 
 antisocial behaviour come in a variety of form norfolk police have recently make it a priority to address safety concern about e bike and e scooter in just day they reportedly seize illegally modify bike in norwich i welcome that crackdown but speed e bike and e scooter be a real menace in our city centre will the home secretary expand on the measure that we will take to tackle speeding and illegally modify e bike and e scooter 
 my hon friend be right to raise this issue which cause havoc and can be really threaten for people in the local community that be why we will strengthen the law by support the police to take strong action on off road bike and by introduce respect order so that we can ban repeat offender from town centre and tackle the antisocial behaviour that have blight community for far too long 
 antisocial behaviour be a problem not just in our town centre but in our park that be why my constituent be extremely concerned about plan to axe the specialist royal park police unit and subsume it into community support team give the £ shortfall face the met police this mean that bushy park in my constituency will undoubtedly get less police coverage what assurance can the home secretary give my constituent that they will not see few police officer in our community and our park 
 this government be clear we need to get more police back on the beat the number of police community support officer have halve over the past to year and there have be a big drop in the number of neighbourhood police officer on the beat that be why next year we be increase neighbourhood policing with an additional £ of investment that be part of up to £ of additional funding next year for our police force across the country 
 the home secretary will be aware that council up and down the country have real problem with nuisance tenant create mayhem commit crime and make resident live a misery so do she agree that there should be a strike and out policy for these tenant and that if they keep create problem they should be out and the local authority should have no duty to rehouse they 
 we need strong action against antisocial behaviour whether that involve havoc in town centre off road bike or nuisance neighbour make the community ’s live a misery that be why the government   be increase neighbourhood police and give the police and local community much strong power to crack down on antisocial behaviour so that we can take back our community from the vandal the thief and those who make other live a misery 
 like my hon friend   the member for norwich north alice macdonald i find that constituent consistently mention the antisocial use of e scooter and e bike and i certainly welcome on my constituent behalf the measure in the crime and police bill about seize such vehicle will ministers talk to the department for transport about update legislation particularly in relation to e scooter their usage have explode but legislation have not keep pace 
 we be work with the department for transport we need to keep community safe ensure that proper safety standard be meet and tackle antisocial behaviour i have also see the work of staffordshire police who be use drone to follow rider of dangerous off road bike and take action 
 do the home secretary agree that it would be easy for the police to tackle antisocial behaviour if they have more support for special constable the number of special constable have fall in recent year particularly since the pandemic will she agree to consider amend the employment rights act to bring special constable within section 
 i agree that special constable can play an important role their number have drop by around third over the past year i think that be damaging and we want to increase their number we be work with police force on how good to achieve that so that they can play their part both on the street in neighbourhood team and in support other specialist aspect of the police ’s work 
 greater manchester have of the high crime rate in the country with many suffering as a result of antisocial behaviour but this weekend we see police officer knock on the door of a grandmother because she dare to criticise a labour councillor for his role in the pensioner hat whatsapp scandal do the home secretary agree that be a waste of police time 
 the government have be clear that the focus of policing must be on the neighbourhood crime that blight our community that be why we be increase neighbourhood policing because the conservative party slash the number of neighbourhood police on the beat and we lose thousand of neighbourhood police in our community that be why we be also focus the police on serious violence the legislation to be introduce tomorrow will focus on tackle serious violence and deal with the most serious crime in our community something that the conservative party which preside over a increase in shoplifting alone during its last year in power fail time and again to do 
 what step her department be take to help tackle domestic abuse in gloucester 
 the government be determined to tackle the scourge of domestic abuse wherever it be find that be why we have already announce bold measure to transform the police response to these devastating crime last week i be proud to say we embed the domestic abuse specialist in control room in police force under raneem ’s law and we plan to equip force everywhere with the tool they need to crack down on perpetrator and keep victim safe include in gloucester 
 i thank my hon friend for her answer and for all the work she have do over many year to champion victim and survivor of domestic abuse as she will know of the big challenge face survivor and victim in gloucester be the financial implication of flee that abuse will she agree to meet i to discuss my minute rule bill the domestic abuse safe leave bill which would introduce safe leave for victim of domestic abuse and violence 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his kind word and for his commitment to support victim he will be aware that his private member ’s bill be the responsibility of the department for business and trade but i would of course be willing to meet he and the department to discuss it 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 the recent national audit office report on the government ’s response to violence against woman and girl which include domestic abuse make a number of recommendation my committee will be consider that issue but will the minister comment on what the government ’s response will be to those recommendation and say how she will ensure that domestic abuse be tackle across the country include in gloucester 
 i be wait for that reference to gloucester as the right hon lady will know the nao report be largely base on the previous government ’s period in office and although it make clear recommendation it would be premature of i to comment however the strategy to combat violence against woman and girl that will be publish by this government in early summer will undoubtedly be look to the nao recommendation 
 what step her department be take to help reduce demand for sex trafficking and sexual exploitation 
 the trafficking of woman and girl for sexual exploitation be a horrific crime and the government work closely with law enforcement to tackle the driver of that offending and target prolific perpetrator that include through operational intensification initiative aim at tackle modern slavery threat the online safety act set   out priority offence include sexual exploitation and human trafficking offence and start from   march in scope company must adopt system and process to address those offence 
 i thank the minister for her response in the then home affairs committee recommend that pimp website be outlaw but the previous government take no action allow sex trafficker to continue legally to exploit their victim online i have since be make aware of further online exploitation with website allow man to rate and review the woman for whom they be pay for sex include admission of trafficking under age sex and rape will the minister share what action this government will take to protect victim of online sexual exploitation 
 like my hon friend i be horrified that such practice should be allow to continue online platform have a duty to assess the risk of illegal harm on their service with a deadline of   march subject to the code of practice complete the parliamentary process on   march online platform will need to take safety measure set out in the code of practice and to use other effective measure to protect user from illegal content such as that of which my hon friend speak if they fail to do so they will face significant penalty as she might imagine i will be keep a close eye on that 
 what measure be the minister take to address the record backlog of court case in the uk which as the chief inspector of the crown prosecution service and serious fraud office have warn be on target to hit in particular can she comment on the call for change to be make to the way that court case be prioritise which at present be result in victim of serious crime include sexual trafficking exploitation and rape face year long wait for trial while less serious crime be prioritise ahead in the queue 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and i recognise the parlous state of the criminal justice system that we inherit which have lead to some victim of rape and sexual violence wait for year on end i note that the shadow justice secretary have only just notice that fail now that he have the word shadow in front of his job title and even though his government preside over that fail for a decade part of the strategy to tackle violence against woman and girl which i work on in concert with the ministry of justice be about ensure that that issue be sort 
 i call the shadow minister i have to get through the question 
 fiona from bradford be fail numerous time by social service and local police after suffer horrific sexual abuse at the hand of gang of man while in a care home bradford ’s local authority have shamefully seek to block a local inquiry into the issue in fiona ’s own word 
 the government can not just leave it down to the local council to decide if they ’re go to be investigate they ’re go to have to enforce it 
 will the home secretary reconsider a statutory inquiry into groom gang if not how will she guarantee that case like that can never be allow to happen again 
 i be work with victim across the country to ensure as have already be announce that cold case like the refer to by the shadow minister can be reopen the government have invest an extra £ in the taskforce to ensure that can happen we will be work with local authority across the country to ensure that the failure of the past be not repeat 
 what step she be take to help tackle drug deal in rural community 
 through the county line programme we continue to target exploitative drug dealing gang wherever they operate include in rural area as part of our effort to dismantle the organise crime group behind that trade since the government take office the county line programme have close over drug line run across community in england and wales in our manifesto we commit to go after the gang that lure young people into violence and crime at the weekend we announce that we will create a new offence of child criminal exploitation in the forthcoming crime and police bill 
 it be well know that rural and seaside area be target by drug gang escapeline have assess that up to young people some as young as be be traffic in my constituency i have recently deal with young girl who have be provide with drug by trusted adult in dance school where no action be take because those adult be not see as require a disclosure and barring service check and with vulnerable adult who be be control in their home where there have be no response at all from local police because my small town be simply not see to be a priority and resource be direct elsewhere how can i offer reassurance to my community that their small town be not be forget 
 the hon lady make an important point specific resource be available to police force to be surge into tackle county line i know the police force in dorset in her area have apply for that funding in the past so i encourage she to have a conversation with the police and crime commissioner and chief constable about what more can be do to get that resource into the town she talk about 
 if she will increase funding for gloucestershire constabulary 
 the final police funding settlement provide funding of up to £ for   the police system in england and wales which be an increase of £ when compare to of that gloucestershire will receive up to £ an increase of over £ include £ to kickstart the recruitment of additional neighbourhood police officer and police community support officer in gloucestershire 
 my constituency straddle large county gloucestershire and wiltshire which both languish near the bottom of the league table of funding for constabulary despite the modest rise in funding those constabulary will have to cut policing number so can the minister assure my constituent that crime will be address on a timely basis 
 more money be go into policing particularly around the neighbourhood policing guarantee that this government promise in their manifesto we be provide £ to kickstart the recruitment of police officer pcso and special in all our community i take the hon lady ’s point about the funding formula and how that affect the force that straddle her constituency we be go into a spending review and i know official have meet representative from gloucestershire constabulary to talk about the financial situation we will keep that under review as we work towards the spending review 
 like gloucestershire police essex police be receive additional funding this year in fact we be get increase funding of £ despite that the front desk at harlow police station be under threat do the minister agree that give the additional funding police service in harlow in essex should be increase not decrease and that any proposal not to do so be down to historical underfunding by the previous government 
 i be very pleased that essex have get that increase in funding i gently point out that the decision around how those resource be use be for the police and crime commissioner and the chief constable but overall more than £ be go into policing over and above what the previous government put in in 
 what step her department be take with international partner to counter the threat of terrorism 
 this weekend ’s horrific attack in mulhouse in france have again remind we of the threat from terrorist and from islamist extremism which can strike at any time i have speak to the french interior minister this morning to offer our support and any assistance need we will continue to work with our european colleague and the eyes partnership to tackle these threat both internationally and here in the uk 
 sadly the misappropriation of religious belief to justify act of terror and intimidation have become familiar across the world we have see the mind of   too many of our young people corrupt by online pedlar of hate so what action be this government take to tackle radicalisation at a time when xenophobia and intolerance be be promote for political purpose 
 my hon friend be right that terrorist do not speak for any faith interfaith relationship be an important part of develop strong community but we be clear that in the government and across society we have to do more to prevent radicalisation and particularly the grow number of young people from be draw into terrorism both islamist extremism and extreme right wing threat that be why tomorrow we will introduce new youth diversion order through our crime and police bill to give the police new power to divert young people away from terrorism 
 although i welcome what the home secretary be say about the need to divert and prevent home grow terrorism do she accept that a pattern of terrorism be emerge in continental europe of undocumented migrant go into country and commit terrorist act do she agree that it be very difficult for the authority to prevent anything of that sort if undocumented illegal migrant be release into society when they arrive on these shore 
 we be clear that we need to tackle extremist and terror threat wheresoever they be find which include make sure that we have strengthen border security that be why we have put forward new counter terror style power around people smuggle and traffic to strengthen our border security and it be also why we need to tackle particularly the radicalisation we see online that be where we also see young people be draw into extremist and terror threat wheresoever that be find we need strong action in place to keep our country safe 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in fight terrorism the security minister have rightly say that islamism be the foremost threat we face its danger lie not just in physical violence but in the intolerance it embody and the intimidation it rely on will the home secretary give a clear answer to this question should it be a criminal offence to desecrate a koran or any holy text yes or no 
 we be clear that the primary domestic terrorist threat come from islamist terrorism which comprise quarter of the mi5 caseload and of those in custody for terrorism connect offence that be follow by extreme right wing terrorism which comprise around a quarter of the mi5 caseload we already have a framework of legislation in place to ensure that we can deal with the dangerous threat to our cohesion and our community that we face 
 what step she be take to help reduce shop theft 
 what assessment she have make of trend in the level of retail crime 
 in the last year of the previous government shop theft reach a record high and violence and abuse towards retail worker increase to an unacceptable level this government will not tolerate these crime as a central part of our safe street mission we be committed to introduce a new stand alone offence of assault a retail worker and end the effective immunity for shop theft of good under £ because there be no such thing as low level crime 
 i be recently contact by a constituent who work in a small high street supermarket he and his colleague have frequently be violently attack by shoplifter so what else can the minister say about what the government can do to protect shop worker 
 it be appal to hear about case such as the one in my hon friend ’s constituency i be very strike like everyone else across the house i think by how commonplace violence and abuse against shop worker have sadly become the government have make it absolutely clear that everybody who go to work have the right to feel safe on the job and we will not tolerate the criminality that we have see in recent time that be why follow year of campaign from the union of shop distributive and allied workers and the co op this labour government will finally deliver a stand alone criminal offence of assault a retail worker 
 shop worker in doncaster have tell i time and again that they be feed up with the amount of shoplifting go on and the antisocial behaviour that go with it which include threat and sometimes physical violence this kind of crime need to be crush i be pleased to hear that a stand alone offence of assault a retail worker be to be include in the legislation be introduce this week but will the minister confirm that the police will have the clout to enforce the law and make sure we eliminate this kind of activity 
 my hon friend make an important point our commitment to neighbourhood police and put the police officer police community support officer and special constable back into our neighbourhood into our community high street and town centre will enable the police to take the action we all want to see against the antisocial behaviour that my hon friend talk about 
 of the good way of tackle retail crime and associate antisocial behaviour among young people be through targeted preventive work with at risk pupil in school an example be the guidance and welfare unit at cavendish school in eastbourne that unit be set up by my former headteacher mr fitzpatrick who be in the public gallery today along with my former head of year mrs fitzpatrick who be also in the gallery will the minister join i in congratulate inspirational teacher such as they on their critical safeguarding and prevention work with young people across eastbourne and beyond 
 i do not want to get into trouble i would like to congratulate mr and mrs fitzpatrick on the work they have do we know how important that early preventive work be that be why this government be also committed to our prevention partnership identify young people who be on the cusp of get involve in criminality and divert they and put the resource in to make sure they make much well choice in their life 
 harrogate have a wealth of independent store that attract people to the town from across the region include shoplifter unfortunately i have be speak with harrogate business improvement district about what it can do to help tackle shoplift it have an increasingly good relationship with north yorkshire police what step be the minister take to encourage north yorkshire police and other police organisation to work with local community and business organisation to crack down on shoplift 
 the hon gentleman make an important point i visit north yorkshire last week and of the issue there be how well the police be work with community and the retail sector to start to tackle some of the issue around retail crime over the next year £ will be allocate to support the police to tackle retail crime through the specialist team opal which be the national police intelligence unit that unit be look at the serious organise criminal gang that be now involve in retail theft 
 what step she be take to reduce rural crime 
 the government be commit to tackle rural crime we recognise the devastating consequence it can have on community and the agricultural sector under our reform rural area will be safeguard through tough measure to clamp down on antisocial behaviour to strengthen neighbourhood policing and to take action to prevent fly tipping 
 antisocial behaviour in tyrley a small village in my constituency have have a significant impact on the community small rural community like these often feel overlooked and struggle to have their voice hear when it come to police and public safety will the government ensure that rural community such as tyrley receive the name police officer guarantee so that they have a dedicated point of contact for police and for support 
 yes and my hon friend raise an important point about those small part of large rural community and how they can feel that our neighbourhood policing guarantee will provide they with reassurance there be the name officer guarantee and it be worth recognise the use of thing such as whatsapp group in big rural area where intelligence can be feed into the police that can also be helpful for those community to feel safe 
 police in rural area be increasingly complex but rural constabulary receive much less funding than inner city one i know the minister will jump on this opportunity to complain about the last government but will she at least take a moment to commit to publish the methodology behind the funding formula and open a conversation about fair funding for rural police force 
 the hon gentleman be right i be go to say that the funding formula be introduce by the previous government i think in they have go at try to update it and they do not do anything about it we have be in government for month now and this be what we have inherit in a lot of area we have inherit thing that we would not necessarily have want to have inherit as i have say before to the house we will be look at police reform go forward and part of that conversation will be around financial issue 
 what step she be take to reduce the use of hotel to house asylum seeker 
 what step she be take to reduce the number of people live in asylum hotel 
 we be continue to reduce the use of asylum hotel from the peak which be reach under the previous government when more than hotel be in use across the country at a cost of £ every day we be determined to end the use of hotel over time as part of our wide objective to cut the cost of asylum accommodation and restore order to our immigration system 
 asylum seeker be force to live in limbo bournemouth hotel cost the taxpayer eye watering sum as we just hear and everyone be stick in a situation that nobody want i have write to bournemouth christchurch and poole council to express opposition to additional asylum hotel in my constituency will the minister outline how the home office have reallocate resource follow the election to speed up the closure of hotel and the processing of asylum application to turn a page on year of conservative failure 
 we be determined to end hotel usage as part of our objective to cut the cost of asylum accommodation a key element of that be clear the asylum backlog and increase return so that the system operate swiftly firmly and fairly 
 i be afraid that determination will not quite cut it will it pensioner in north dorset who have be deprive of their winter fuel allowance and farmer who have be hit by and be now face a massive tax burden will want to know how the minister will reduce the cost of asylum hotel which be as she say eye wateringly high the action and her word be not apparently match 
 we have to deal with the chaotic system that we inherit from the conservatives we be do that in various way of the big thing that we be try to do be speed up the system and end the backlog so that we can get people out of hotel 
 what step she be take to tackle phone theft 
 the government be determined to act to ensure that people feel safe on our street on   february   the home secretary bring together law enforcement agency and representative of the mobile phone industry to discuss what more could be do to break the business model of mobile phone theft and to bring about strong collaboration across those agency to crack down on the criminal network that be operate in this trade 
 in early time mobile phone theft be see as an urban issue but as have be evidence by my postbag over the last couple of week it be increase in our rural town and village what discussion be the minister have with her colleague in the ministry of justice to ensure that repeat perpetrator of this crime face custodial sentence 
 while there be a concentration of phone theft in the metropolitan police area in particular it be important to note that they be happen around the country and it be be suggest that the good practice use by those who be start to tackle the problem notably the west midlands police force should be spread to all force the taskforce that i mention early in connection with a summit will meet again in month and i will certainly speak to my colleague at the ministry of justice about the issue that the hon gentleman have raise 
 what step her department be take to counter hostile state threat 
 the home office work closely with other departments and operational agency to strengthen the uk ’s defence against state threat that include continue to implement measure in the national security act which will make the uk a hard target for state that seek to commit hostile act 
 hostile state be use unknowe security official here in the uk to undermine our national security and conceal their activity and the director general of mi5 have say that russia and iran be increasingly use this tactic i welcome the home office guidance that allow security organisation to carry out effective due diligence but what else be the department do with the security industry to ensure that our country be protect from these hostile state threat 
 i thank my hon friend not just for his question but for mention the recent home office guidance which be a crucial step in upskille security official on the risk that they might encounter from state actor we be follow that up with target engagement event across the sector include upcoming industry conference which we will be attend to ensure that the key message be well understand and we can have an ongoing dialogue with the sector about the handling of such threat 
 when consider hostile state threat we can not ignore terrorist group from both the right and the left in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland who work with some of those state what be be do to ensure that paramilitary group across the united kingdom be take on and that the hostile state they represent on the basis of their own motivation can be address directly 
 the hon gentleman have make an important point as he always do i can say to he that a threat be a threat regardless of the direction from which it come we take all those threat extremely seriously and we work around the clock with the police and the operational agency to keep the public safe wherever the threat may originate 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 strong encryption be vital for everyone ’s security but last week apple pull its advanced data protection service in the uk after the home office have reportedly demand back door access to its uk customer encrypt datum liberal democrats have long argue that investigatory power must be proportionate as any way in for security service can be exploit by criminal gang or indeed hostile state to target innocent people give that right and security go hand in hand what step be the minister take to ensure that our national security and civil liberty be properly protect why do the government believe that apple ’s uk customer do not deserve the same privacy right as every other customer in the rest of the world 
 i hope the hon lady will understand that i can not comment on operational matter and it would not be appropriate for i either to confirm or to deny the existence of any notice under the investigatory powers act this be a long stand position hold by successive government for obvious reason of national security what i can say be that the suggestion that privacy and security be at odd be not correct we can and must have both the investigatory powers act contain robust safeguard and independent oversight to protect privacy and ensure that datum be obtain only on an exceptional basis and only when it be necessary and proportionate to do so 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i call the home secretary 
 thank you mr speaker 
 my son do not stand a chance 
 those be the heartbreaking word of pooja kanda whose teenage son ronan be fatally stab in his teenage killer be able to buy multiple dangerous weapon online without any proper check follow pooja ’s campaigning we be introduce ronan ’s law which include tighten the rule for online retailer increase the maximum penalty for sell weapon to under-18s and introduce much more stringent id check at the point of purchase and delivery i thank commander stephen clayman for his crucial review in this area which underpin the reform and pay tribute to the kanda family we need to do everything in our power to prevent other family from suffer from terrible knife crime 
 thames valley police be £ down this year because of the flawed formula for distribute fund to police force after a pay award be give when will this historical anomaly be fix 
 i will just point out to the hon gentleman that his party have year to address all the thing he be so concerned about now this government have increase funding for police by up to £ next year include £ to start redress the huge cut in neighbourhood police that we have see on our street in thames valley and right across the country because we need to get police back on the street 
 i thank the minister for her previous answer and for her commitment to reduce the number of asylum claimant in the uk as she will know the uk be spend of its official development assistance on housing asylum claimant almost double the oecd average our overseas spend be cut by the previous government do she agree that in order to reduce the number of claimant come to the uk the government should increase the spend on build peace and security abroad 
 my hon friend be right to say that asylum cost make up the bulk of home office spend classify as oda spending and that we be committed to reduce they include by end the use of hotel which will mean that we can return that oda resource so that it can be use upstream to prevent migratory flow from happen in the place 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 border security be fundamental but between the july election and yesterday people illegally and dangerously cross the english channel a increase on the same period month early do the home secretary now regret ignore the national crime agency ’s advice that law enforcement alone be not enough and that a removal deterrent be need 
 i will just point out to the shadow home secretary that when the conservatives be in government we see that many people arrive in the space of just over day because they completely lose control of our   border and let criminal gang take hold along the channel some people arrive in small boat while the rwanda policy that he somehow want to reintroduce manage to send just volunteer we have increase return by over to which be important i hope he will explain why he vote against counter terrorism power to go after smuggler gang 
 the home secretary talk about the rwanda scheme of course it never even start as she well know the flight be due to take off after the election but she cancel it 
 she mention that return have go up what she fail to mention be that the vast majority of those people do not enter the country by small boat the number of small boat return go down after this government come into office and it represent only of people cross the english channel do she really think that let of illegal immigrant stay here be go to deter anybody 
 i just say to the shadow home secretary that the rwanda scheme run for year it be run for year 
 it never start 
 exactly all they manage to do 
 order please let we show a little bit more restraint and when you ask a question at least wait for the answer 
 the scheme run for year and the conservatives spend £ of taxpayer money to return just people in the period during which the shadow home secretary be in the government people arrive on small boat and only a tiny percentage of they be ever return even though that number include albanians this government be have to sort out this chaos but his party be again fail to support counter terrorism power against smuggler and traffic gang side with the criminal smuggler gang instead of the people of britain 
 it be illegal to post a prostitution advert in a phone box yet the very same advert can be freely post online by a pimp website such website be make it as easy to order a woman to exploit as it be to order a takeaway do the minister agree that we must urgently update our anti pimping law to make it a criminal offence to enable or to profit from the prostitution of another person online or offline 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important point the government be clear that online platform be a significant enabler of sexual exploitation and must be responsible and hold accountable for the content of their site include take proactive step to prevent their site be use by criminal we be implement the online safety act which set out priority offence include sexual exploitation and human trafficking 
 i call the liberal democrats spokesperson 
 on a recent visit to marple form college i be remind that the last conservative government abandon young people and our economy by trash our relationship with europe so i be delighted to see recent report in the times that the prime minister will offer a youth mobility scheme in negotiation with the eu this be a common sense approach that will give our young people opportunity and help grow our economy will the secretary of state support deliver the good possible deal for young people here in the uk by extend a youth mobility scheme to the eu 
 as the front bench spokesperson for the liberal democrats know that be not our plan and we be clear that net migration need to come down it quadruple under the previous conservative government in the space of just year and that number need to come down we believe we should support young people across this country include through youth prevention partnership 
 exactly week ago today dariusz serafin tragically die from a knife wound on the street of west ealing on a road long blight by antisocial behaviour about which i have write to the police just the week before how will the government ’s new respect order and the crackdown on knife help bring reassurance to my constituent in west ealing 
 i be very sorry to hear about the incident to which my hon friend refer she will know that we have a commitment to halve knife crime over the next decade we have already introduce the ban on zombie knife and machete and we be move forward with the ban on ninja sword last week the home secretary announce the new measure under ronan ’s law to tighten the lethal loophole in the online sale of knife and we be develop the young futures programme with prevention partnership at their heart to stop young people get involve in knife crime 
 my constituent kia mcnicoll be a mother of child and her year old patryk be recently diagnose with cancer kia ’s mother in law recently apply for a visa extension so that she can help the family with childcare through these most horrific of circumstance but her application be reject forgive i mr speaker but i can not tell the difference between this labour government and the tories who come before they will the minister commit to look at this application again so that my constituent can focus on what matter most the health of her son 
 i thank the hon member for his question and if he want to write to i about that case i will be very happy to look at it 
 eenie and meenie white cat from stanbridge be recently shoot and kill could the minister outline what discussion she have have with local police to that ensure that these crime be properly investigate and that the law be uphold 
 the abuse of animal use weapon of any type be an incredibly serious matter and there be such provision in the wildlife and countryside act the wild mammals protection act and the animal welfare act there be a range of offence and i encourage anyone who witness this kind of event to report it to the police i will certainly discuss what more we can do with my colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs 
 many of my constituent have raise concern about e bike and e scooter be a safety hazard when modify or misuse what be the minister do to tackle rider travel at high speed on pavement and other pedestrian area and help my constituent to feel safe on their street again 
 i can reassure the hon member that dangerous and antisocial behaviour involve e bike will be cover by the legislation we be introduce tomorrow to tackle vehicle and off road bike use in antisocial behaviour so that we can keep street and community safe 
 antisocial behaviour be too common on the wirral and it ruin life this morning i speak to my constituent henry who tell i that have group of youth hang outside intimidate and damaging property make he feel like a prisoner in his own home what more can be do to tackle such abuse and to support victim 
 my hon friend be right to raise this issue too often antisocial behaviour be dismiss as a low level crime yet it can make people ’s live a complete misery that be why we need more neighbourhood police back on our street work in community to prevent and tackle the kind of problem that community face 
 the prime minister recently say he be 
 hardwire growth into all the decision of the cabinet 
 how do he react when the home secretary tell he that her policy on electronic travel authorisation would cost the economy nearly £ over year 
 we be introduce electronic travel authorisation in line with the approach of our international partner such as australia and the usa who have also be look at how to enhance their ability to pre screen traveller upstream to stop those who pose a threat from travel to the uk as the former immigration minister and now shadow secretary of state of justice   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick say at the time 
 etas will enhance our border security by increase our knowledge about those seek to come to the uk and prevent the arrival of those who pose a threat 
 if the hon gentleman disagree with he i suggest they have a catch up perhaps the conservative party will have work out by then where it stand on the policy 
 in recent year the uk have slide down the international league table on tackle corruption give the threat of corruption to our democracy economy   and national security will the minister say whether the government intend to publish a new comprehensive anti corruption strategy 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for the work he do on the all party parliamentary group on anti corruption and responsible tax i can confirm that the government take the threat of corruption illicit finance and kleptocracy extremely seriously which be why we announce that we will publish a new uk anti corruption strategy this year the new strategy will include measure that make it hard for corrupt actor to operate strengthen global resilience to corruption and address the uk ’s vulnerability to corruption include through way to ensure that all those in public service be hold to the high standard 
 the home secretary know that raise the minimum income threshold have reduce net migration which be why i introduce it while i be home secretary if the home secretary want to continue bring net migration down will she now confirm that she will introduce the further increase to the threshold as i propose 
 net migration quadruple during the period when the former home secretary be in government in the space of just year the most shocking loss of control of our border we see visa and overseas recruitment shoot up at exactly the same time as training here in the uk fall that be why this government will publish a white paper that set out measure to reduce net migration include by ensure that employer recruit and train here in the uk 
 on friday night i join bedfordshire police officer on a ride a long to see hand the great work they do to help vulnerable people however the policing minister know that bedfordshire police rely heavily on specific grant to tackle serious violent and organised crime will she confirm that those grant will continue and when we might we hear about that 
 i visit bedfordshire police before christmas and i agree that it be an excellent force decision around funding will be make in due course 
 refugee here from ukraine under the homes for ukraine scheme be not eligible to indefinite leave they have a year visa which in many case obviously be about to expire they have a very short window to apply for what be only an month extension do the home secretary agree that that be not long enough for ukrainian family here to be able to plan their future and will she reconsider 
 i can say to the hon gentleman that we continue to support the homes for ukraine scheme which remain extremely important i have a family from ukraine still live with i in yorkshire we will continue to support those family and will ensure that people be not disadvantage by the deadline that have be set 
 challenging violence against woman and girl be an absolutely critical mission of this government what work be the minister do with the department for education to promote positive role model in our school and further education college 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i be literally about to go into a cross government ministerial meeting with the department for education about exactly that our violence against woman and girl strategy will not succeed without prevention through education 
 the home secretary quite conspicuously fail to answer the question that my hon friend   the member for weald of kent katie lam   ask early so i be go to have another go should it ever be a criminal offence for anybody to desecrate a religious text yes or no 
 the hon gentleman will know that we do not have a blasphemy law in this country nor will we have 
 week ago i meet a year old boy in blackpool ’s asylum hotel he can not walk have frequent seizure and be non verbal since may last year his family have be request a wheelchair as they have to carry he everywhere they go no child especially with these need should have to go without the equipment that give they the dignity to live do the minister agree that such hotel be unsuitable for vulnerable child and will she personally intervene to help i to get this young lad a wheelchair 
 i thank my hon friend for bring this matter to my attention my official have investigate and serco have refer the case to healthcare partner who be currently in the process of provide a suitable wheelchair follow a thorough assessment of the child ’s need official be monitor the situation closely to ensure the family receive the support they require 
 domestic abuse service in my area be tell i there be a specific shortage of place in shelter for man which be a particular problem for woman flee domestic abuse with their teenage son what be be do to address this problem specifically 
 refuge accommodation actually sit within the ministry of housing communities and local government however we have invest £ extra for council to look at the need they have in their   area which will include create dispersal accommodation as woman with old boy be often not allow into group accommodation 
 last week i hold a summit with local business in the top of town in basingstoke to discuss how we can breathe new life into our town centre of the key message be that persistent antisocial behaviour be make resident feel unsafe and create a barrier to business thrive what reassurance can the home secretary give business and constituent in basingstoke that this government be make progress in restore town centre patrol 
 my hon friend be right to raise this matter for both basingstoke and town right across the country town centre be blight by a increase in shop theft in the year before the election as well antisocial behaviour that be why tackle town centre crime will be at the heart of the crime and police bill introduce tomorrow 
 do the home secretary agree that it would be a well use of greater manchester police officer time if they actually police the street and prevent crime rather than visit grandmother home to discuss a facebook post 
 perhaps the hon gentleman miss the discussion on this early we have be clear that the central priority for police set by this government be neighbourhood policing to tackle town centre crime challenge across the country and serious violence include violence against woman and girl and the knife crime devastate young life we have make those priority clear to police force right across the country as part of our police reform and our new legislation 
 for the final question jonathan brash 
 dispersal accommodation for asylum be unevenly distribute across the country in hartlepool we support asylum seeker per in the population yet a few mile up the road the neighbouring local authority support per with local authority elsewhere in the country host none do the minister agree that this be unfair and that as we bring the number down we must evenly distribute support for asylum seeker across the area 
 we do inherit a very uneven distribution if i could put it that way of dispersed accommodation often in poor area where its presence put more pressure on local community it be not a situation that we would have want and we want to remedy it over time 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if we will make a statement on the plant oxford site 
 this government be determined to see a strong thrive uk automotive industry we recognise the vital role that the british motor industry play within our manufacturing landscape employ more than people with ten of thousand more work in the wide supply chain that be why we be plough £ into the sector ’s green transition and £ to encourage the uptake of new clean green electric vehicle a big incentive for the global automotive sector to invest in the uk building on this momentum our modern industrial strategy will back automotive company that want to invest in britain and drive long term sustainable uk growth 
 bmw have take a commercial decision to delay the production of new electric mini model at its oxford plant undoubtedly that news will be unsettling for the company ’s many hard work employee not least those work directly on the production line but i must stress that bmw remain committed to its investment in the uk it be by no mean unusual for a manufacturer to adjust its product line up or production start date for commercial reason 
 we be proud that bmw consider oxford to be at the heart of mini production as a government we be throw our weight behind its investment we want big automotive brand from britain and around the world to lie at the heart of our growth mission and plan for change create well pay job and put more money into people ’s pocket as part of that effort this government be work closely with bmw as it review its investment timeline ensure that more car be build right here in the united kingdom 
 i draw attention to my entry in the register of interest i expect the secretary of state to hide from talk of cv but it seem that also apply to ev this weekend we see the disastrous consequence of labour ’s rigid approach to net bmw hit the brake on a £ investment in plant oxford that deal from would have secure high quality job and be a strong vote of confidence in the uk like other deal it be possible only because the previous government be willing to be pragmatic the conservatives make the sensible decision to delay the ban on internal combustion engine car bring the uk into line with major global economy such as france germany sweden and canada but labour say it know well restore the phase out date in its manifesto 
 when the negative impact of that approach become clear the government launch a fast track consultation on the emission vehicle mandate pitifully attempt to buy themselves time surely no consultation be necessary the effect of their puritanical zev obsession be already clear jaguar land rover say that the zev mandate be cause disruption to the market vauxhall have confirm that it will shut down its luton factory cite the zev   mandate as make the plant less economically viable and now the future of plant oxford the home of the mini since be uncertain 
 labour ’s reckless policy have shatter industry confidence with consumer demand for evs drop off a cliff and number only just about sustain by subsidise fleet sale will the minister do the right thing stop hide behind consultation and acknowledge that the government ’s ideological approach to net will lead only to economic disaster for our automotive sector and consumer alike 
 it be hard to know where to start the puritanical zev obsession be as the hon gentleman know a conservative policy from the last government the only change make to that policy under the last prime minister dampen demand by change the deadline and hamper manufacturer by not ensure flexibility or pragmatism in how the policy operate it be the bad of both world 
 by contrast labour and the government be act with pragmatism we be listen to industry and work at pace to get this right we be also create the condition in which the automotive industry can thrive that mean deliver not just the economic and political stability so lack under the previous government but an industrial strategy that will deliver growth include in the automotive industry invest £ in automotive transition through the budget invest in research and development support and talk to our industry and understand the global climate 
 it be really clear in bmw ’s statement that there be macroeconomic global and commercial reason why the decision to delay be make but bmw be clear that it be still committed to this investment in the uk i have talk to my right hon friend   the member for oxford east anneliese dodds who be liaise closely with worker and union as would be expect we will continue to work to ensure the right economic and political climate so that these industry can grow 
 will the minister update the house on progress on the industrial strategy for the automotive industry how will that support supply chain in place like dudley and across the west midland 
 we be work at pace on deliver the industrial strategy in the spring there be good job in the automotive industry and we want to see those job grow we have identify growth sector that the industrial strategy will turbocharge advanced manufacturing be of they and that of course include the auto industry we have £ of investment commit at the budget to underpin that we be also work in the industrial strategy on identify any barrier to growth so that we can ensure that the sector grow in the year to come 
 the industrial strategy will give the stability that we need over the long term over and year it will look at the policy lever that we can control to ensure that business continue to want to invest in the uk pwc have just rank the uk the good place in the world to invest so i think the future be positive 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 this be yet another failure in the government ’s main aim of get britain grow again emission vehicle be too expensive and it appear too hard to manufacture in the uk that force we into an unfortunate reality in which we be reliant on elon musk for our supply of ev and be funnel money into his already very deep pocket rather than promote a productive domestic market with good job we need to show ambition and make it easy for ordinary family to buy ev what measure will the government take to support and encourage consumer demand for electric vehicle 
 the hon gentleman talk about the government ’s policy for grow the economy a few month ago we hold an international investment summit at which £ of investment be announce as i have mention there be £ announce in the budget for the automotive industry interest rate have be cut time wage be up and more than job have be secure in the uk since the government come to power the international monetary fund and the oecd predict that the uk will be europe ’s fast grow economy over the next few year the industrial strategy be scrap under the last government our industrial strategy will be the backbone of ensure that we deliver growth.[official report   march vol c. 1wc correction 
 the hon gentleman ask what we be do i have already set out the stability investment and reform that we be bring to the sector to make sure that it can thrive hundred of thousand of people rely on the automotive industry through their work in it or in its supply chain those be good well pay job and we be absolutely determined to ensure that the sector grow 
 the minister have set out how we deliver £ worth of support for the automotive sector in the budget that support be both for manufacturing and for the crucial supply chain in place such as my black country constituency and oxford be she able to set out any further detail about how that money will be use to support our brilliant manufacturing 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and for her support for the industry which be so important through the £ funding the automotive transformation fund the exceptional regional growth fund and the advanced propulsion centre research and development fund we have find innovative way of support the industry in january i be pleased to hear jatco a company that make transmission for nissan announce that it would put its manufacture plant in europe here in the uk it be convert an old hospital building with a £ investment that plant will be at the international advanced manufacturing park in sunderland that be the kind of opportunity that we want to create and deliver 
 jaguar land rover which have its engine manufacturing centre base in staffordshire be a vital employer for people not just in staffordshire but right across the west midland that plant be pioneer the development of electric vehicle for jlr what additional support and flexibility will there be from the government to ensure that great british brand continue to prosper in the west midland 
 the right hon gentleman be right to talk about great british brand we have some incredible small car manufacturer as well as large one in the uk and there be great diversity of provision we be support the development of gigafactorie in the uk so that we can make the battery that we need we be help with r&d and innovation to make our car more sophisticated and efficient and support the large manufacturer to ensure that the condition be right for they to develop in the uk we be do all those thing through our industrial strategy and our automotive strategy i work with the automotive council we meet just a couple of week ago to talk about the vibrant future that we see for automotive in the uk i be always happy to talk to jlr about its plan and have do so several time 
 i know that the shadow minister struggle with the dynamic of the automotive industry but for the last year of new vehicle sale have be fleet and business sale do the minister agree that the decision take today be a commercial decision base around the structure of bmw ’s dealer network as oppose to an obsession with petrol and diesel vehicle 
 my hon friend as absolutely right to say that this be a commercial decision as he would expect we be talk to representative of bmw my official be with they in munich a couple of week ago and i have meet the uk managing director several time we be talk to they to support the commercial decision that they need to make they have make it clear that there be macroeconomic global and commercial reason for the delay that have be announce such delay be not uncommon i know that bmw remain committed to this investment in the uk 
 more than employee at the bmw plant in oxford live in my constituency and this morning i meet plant convenor from the unite union to discuss the impact that the uncertainty at the plant be have on those worker and their family can the minister outline exactly how the new industrial strategy will help the plant to become more competitive in the face of severe competition from other bmw plant in the eu the us and china 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight the concern that i suspect those employee feel they have know about this change since last year there be people who work in the oxford plant and many more who work at rolls royce which be own by bmw and in other part of the uk through the industrial strategy we be look at a number of issue that we will use the £ for and we will use the power that we have skill energy cost and access to finance be all issue that we be have lot of conversation about as well as the transition to electric vehicle we be make sure that the flight path for investment in the uk be as good as possible and that those who be already invest in the uk continue to do so bmw have announce a £ investment in rolls royce which it own it remain committed to this investment in the uk but i appreciate that there will be concern among the worker to whom the hon gentleman have be talk and i be always happy to meet people to discuss these matter in more detail 
 tata ’s llanwern steelwork in my constituency produce world class automotive steel the minister have acknowledge the importance of the automotive sector will she also acknowledge the importance of have a strong steel industry and of plant like llanwern make steel for ev and put that at the heart of the forthcoming industrial strategy a strategy that the conservatives never have 
 i be glad that my hon friend have manage as ever to bring steel into the debate it be incredibly important and that be why we will have a separate steel strategy on top of the work that we be do in the industrial strategy to ensure a thriving sector in the future that will look at all the issue that we be grapple with and that she know about include the transition energy price access to finance access to grid connection and scrap we will continue to ensure that the uk ’s steel producer can thrive and bring in new business 
 in answer to the shadow secretary of state   the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith the minister state that the strategy be result in people want to invest in the united kingdom the sad fact be that as a result of the mad net policy that this government be follow we be lose investment every week this be yet another example do the minister not follow the logic if we punish people for not want the car that we produce the company will cut back production and job consumer will not get what they want and economic growth will be affect when will this government come to the conclusion that this policy of net and punish people be wrong 
 i do not know if the right hon gentleman see that the cbi bring out figure over the weekend show that the net economy grow by last year which be significantly more than the economy as a whole we be absolutely right to transition to electric vehicle so that we can stick to our commitment on climate change we be be pragmatic in how we do that we be not follow the same policy as the previous government because we be talk to industry and consulting we will publish the result of the   consultation on how the flexibility within the transition be work and whether we need to change they in any way 
 the british car industry be thrive until the conservative party introduce net stupid and now we have another car plant at risk another business struggle and lose hundred of million of pound and hundred more british job at risk do the minister agree that the automotive industry in the uk will continue to decline until we scrap net 
 here we go with the same old line the hon gentleman tell we that net be a massive con yet he own a company that be invest in electric car charge port i rest my case 
 on that well know bmw plant in strangford i call jim shannon 
 the minister have a real interest in the matter for which she have ministerial responsibility i want to put on the record my thank to she when we have have meeting on other issue relate to northern ireland she have be anxious to help and support i and i appreciate that 
 the decision not to go ahead with the ev production be disappointing to say the least but it perhaps indicate a wide issue that we face in the manufacturing industry due to rise cost what can the minister do to help company attract more investment through low energy cost and what can the government do to ensure that british job be not send to china and to ensure that firm that choose to relocate job understand that no future help will be forthcoming 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his kind word i should be clear for the house that the decision have not be make to not go ahead this be a delay and a change in timing bmw be committed to go ahead with the investment at the moment its e mini be be produce in china this investment will bring it here to the uk.[official report   march vol c. 2wc correction lot must be do in term of energy price as he say build a gigafactory mean significant reduction in energy price but the wide manufacturing sector be talk to we virtually every day about these kind of issue through the industrial strategy and the reform that we want to bring in and by spend the £ that we be allocate in the budget we hope to deliver a thriving automotive industry well into the future 
 with permission mr speaker i will make a statement on ukraine 
 in january i visit the wall of remembrance of the fallen in kyiv with my right hon friend the defence secretary see the face of all those who have lose their life since bring home the human cost of kremlin imperialism and of the ukrainian determination to stand up to it indeed some week later just as british and american intelligence service have warn we awake to news of putin ’s full scale invasion launch to shatter the sovereign state of ukraine 
 today we mark year of ukrainian courage in resist that brutal illegal and unprovoked invasion i have witness their fortitude at hand in visit to kyiv over the past year their defiant blitz spirit as russian missile and drone rain down night after night after night on this grim anniversary amid all the talk about talk we must not forget that russia ’s barbaric war go on that the ukrainian people be suffer and that beyond europe the conflict be pile pressure on the world ’s poor too 
 this debate take place against the backdrop of intense diplomatic effort respond of course to president trump ’s call to bring this war to a swift end at the g20 in south africa last week i listen to sergey lavrov once again he shamelessly play the victim rehash the same old lie i will say to the house what i say in response if russia be serious about a last peace that respect ukraine ’s sovereignty ukraine ’s independence and the united nations charter guarantee ukraine ’s security against future aggression and reject imperialism then britain will listen no want that more than ukraine 
 at the munich security conference i underline that ukraine must be at the heart of any talk about ukraine ’s future and i say that the west must learn from our history vladimir putin and his war be no historical aberration he draw on a tsarist tradition the imperialism and authoritarianism of peter the great or nicholas i and a soviet tradition he be after all a kgb agent who operate by deception it be an american diplomat george kennan whose long telegram in warn of a deep continuity in kremlin thinking he argue that the kremlin would respond only to strength that be the basis for the policy of containment as part of which britain contribute ten of thousand of troop to the british army of the rhine it be that strength not paper promise that deter moscow from further advance west 
 today let we look at the kremlin ’s recent record the helsinki final act of betray the budapest memorandum of betray the nato russia founding act of betray the minsk agreement of and betray this be foreign policy by lie we must respond by be true to ourselves and provide the support ukraine need to stay strong because that be what be need to secure a last peace and shape our collective security so that putin never invade again 
 the uk have a unique role in help to make that happen my right hon and learn friend the prime minister be in paris last week talk to our european ally about how we step up support for ukraine accelerate work on security guarantee and take more responsibility for the security of our continent in munich i speak to vice president vance and secretary of state rubio in brussels my right hon friend the defence secretary chair the ukraine defence contact group where us defence secretary pete hegseth confirm that like we the us want to see a sovereign prosperous ukraine 
 europe must shoulder its share of the burden with the united states and its unique capability we can deter putin from attack ukraine again and from escalate hybrid russian attack in europe into some form of direct confrontation so this week the prime minister and i will be travel to washington dc to meet president trump ukraine need friend and ally on both side of the atlantic work together to achieve peace through strength both president trump and president zelensky have speak of their desire to achieve that and the prime minister will reaffirm to zelensky in a call today that it be britain ’s goal as well 
 that must include european country invest more in our own defence and capability already the uk have step up and speed up military assistance we have commit £ in military aid a year every year for as long it take over the next year we will provide an additional £ earmark for military spending via our share of the $ g7 loan back by frozen russian asset 
 in addition as the prime minister have make clear we know our kremlin history and that be why we be ready to contribute to future security guarantee for ukraine in the context of a us backstop include by put our own troop on the ground if necessary that would not be an easy decision anyone in this house who have take responsibility for the life of british serviceman and woman can attest to that but i know the whole house recognise that ukraine ’s security be our security 
 the uk also continue to set the pace on ratchet up the economic pressure on the kremlin together with our international partner we have already deny russia access to $ its war economy be increasingly unsustainable inflation be and rise and that be just the official figure interest rate be run at this year russia will spend almost of its budget on defence and security 
 today we be announce our big package of sanction since the early day of the war over target include oil tanker our large set of ship specification in a single sanction package yet as well as country enabler that be pour money into putin ’s war chest new legislation impose additional trade sanction on russia too that will deny russia access to the world lead expertise need to maintain its war 
 today the uk be also solidify our historic year partnership with ukraine which be sign by the prime minister and president zelensky in kyiv in january in february i see for myself how much that partnership mean to ukraine and how much potential there be for our collective growth and security together we lay that agreement in parliament for scrutiny and i look forward to it enter into force when the process be complete a clear sign of our confidence in ukraine ’s future 
 mr speaker this be a critical moment i want to acknowledge how colleague have stand unite over these past year include hon member from all party as well as noble lords in the other place the shadow foreign secretary and several predecessor as foreign secretary i be proud of that unity which be a tribute to our country proud of this country ’s unwavere support for our ukrainian friend and proud that the united kingdom be rightly take on the responsibility of bring our ally together that be how we confront a foreign policy base on lie and how we secure ukraine ’s future secure europe ’s future and face down a kremlin dictator once again slava ukraini i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 i begin by thank the foreign secretary for his statement and for advance sight of it the house stand unite with ukraine on this grim milestone year on from putin ’s full scale invasion of ukraine we all think of the innocent life catch up in this terrible conflict the civilian mercilessly kill in town such as bucha and irpin and in the east the young ukrainian child forcibly deport to russia the family of brave troop who have not return alive from the frontline all those with life change injury and those who have lose their home and possession 
 when the war start the uk lead global effort to back ukraine and rightly to punish putin from train ten of thousand of ukrainian recruit on british soil and donate challenger battle tank and storm shadow missile to be part of an unprecedented international sanction response that have deprive putin ’s regime of $ and of the country to provide ukraine with that multibillion pound multi year funding pledge in military aid the uk have lead the way for ukraine our support have make a material difference to ukraine ’s ability to hold the line 
 we must never forget that the cost of this war to putin have be catastrophic russia ’s black sea fleet have be pummel and it be likely that by summer russia will have incur casualty with putin desperately turn to north korea for troop and to iran for weapon meanwhile as we have hear russia ’s economy be in dire strait there have be uprising against putin ’s regime and the central pitch of his leadership that he be the great restorer of russia ’s stability lie in ruin 
 the british public continue rightly to stand resolutely with ukraine and they expect we as politician across the house to do so i thank again the many thousand who have so generously open up their home to ukrainians flee the war include through the homes for ukraine scheme they have genuinely show the good of our country the good of britain 
 although there have be much debate about the course of the conflict in recent day the war continue to rage i urge the government to continue give ukraine everything it need all the hardware it need and the diplomatic support to strengthen its hand i be sure that the foreign secretary with the prime minister will do that in washington this week there must be no let up whatsoever 
 we welcome today ’s announcement on new sanction will the foreign secretary confirm that there be no plan to lift sanction in the future if he discuss the use of sanction when he go to washington this week and the role of the united states in that policy will he assure we that he will update member on whether we should expect to see any new resource and support in either military aid or humanitarian support in the come week 
 as the foreign secretary have say now be the time for britain to lead as we do from day and ensure that ukraine be in the good possible position to decide its own future we should be very clear that it remain ultimately for ukraine as a proud and sovereign nation that have sacrifice so much to defend itself to decide its own future and that be peace through strength 
 we want this terrible war to be bring to an end and like president zelensky we want a last reliable and just peace however the euro atlantic community must continue to be intensely robust in the face of putin ’s aggression because the lesson of the past year be clear he only come back for more we must ensure that an illegal invasion like this can never happen again we need a strong deterrent we recognise that the prime minister have comment on the option and the security guarantee in recent day and i can assure the house that his majesty ’s opposition stand ready to engage with the government at every single level 
 we must lead our nato ally in europe in the long term collective defence and planning must be co ordinated to back ukraine in its fight for freedom as the government know there be already a fully fund plan to spend of gdp on defence by as set out by the previous government i strongly urge the government to at least look at a minimum plan to match that commitment we will work with they on how that be deliver to set a new benchmark for other nato country to follow and to fire up everything we can on defence production 
 the us know that the uk have an influential role in nato and i be sure the foreign secretary will be discuss that this week the target to spend of gdp be not a goal in itself but an important step on the journey to increase the strength of our defence spending give the threat that our nation face i urge the government and the foreign secretary because the issue be within his purview and department to review and repurpose some of the currently spend on official development assistance to further our national defence safety and security 
 finally the moral and economic case for mobilise sovereign asset of russia to support ukraine be very clear the foreign secretary have speak about that already but i urge the government to do more mr speaker we stand unite as house slava ukraini

 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 in my role as chair of the defence committee i get the opportunity to meet many ambassador defence ministers attachés and other stakeholder both here in london and at event and gathering such as the munich security conference there be considerable consternation and anxiety among they about whether long establish and hard earn alliance rather than a short term transactional approach can still be rely on 
 give the reduce american presence and as we mark the anniversary of putin ’s full scale illegal invasion of ukraine people be look for leadership i feel that this be our time as a nation to take that lead on defence and security matter in our continent do my right hon friend agree that it can be our prime minister who take that lead in our continent while pull together our transatlantic nato and other ally in the process 
 the uk have be ironclad in its support for ukraine we have be forward lean as ukraine ’s primary friend in europe and across the world under successive government it be also the case that we have a special relationship with the united states underpin by a lot of military and defence capability and support over many many year and of course a very close intelligence relationship we bring all of that to bear in ensure that we get a resolution to this terrible conflict but a resolution that mean we have an endure peace in which ukraine be at the centre of discussion my hon friend should be absolutely sure that the uk intend to play its part which be why we will meet with donald trump this week the prime minister have also be at the centre of much shuttle diplomacy over this last period
