 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the autumn budget on farming community 
 the labour government have commit £ to the agricultural budget over the next year the big budget for sustainable food production and nature recovery in our history it be good for british farming it be good for the country and it should be welcome by the opposition 
 this week the president of the national farmers union of scotland martin kennedy say 
 the new uk government ’s budget hammer hard work family farm and croft with crippling tax bill 
 the minister have accuse the conservatives of scare- monger about labour ’s family farm tax be the national farmers union of scotland also scaremongere 
 i talk regularly to the national farmers union of scotland i respect it fully but i genuinely say as i have say on many occasion that we need to look closely at the figure and look at the detail we will find that the vast majority of farmer in this country will be fine 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the minister ’s response to my hon friend ’s question highlight his arrogance on this issue he constantly keep say that we need to look at the detail yet his department and the treasury disagree on how many farm will be impact by as much as in fact as he know the figure be repeatedly regurgitate by the government consider only past claim for agricultural property relief not those combine with business property relief which be just as important why because the treasury do not have the datum we need comprehensive detail on this policy to properly understand the impact of his family farm tax i ask this for a time in this house will he release a full impact assessment yes or no 
 we seem to be discuss this endlessly the figure on agricultural property relief be absolutely clear i have keep ask people to look at the detail because what they will find listen to the tax expert and the people who have actually look at the policy in detail be that few than farm will be affect that be the reassuring message that the conservatives should be convey to british farmer 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 britain ’s farmer who feed we and care for our environment deserve well than the betrayal they receive under the last conservative government and well than the attack in this government ’s recent budget in cumbria alone some family farmer many of whom live on less than the minimum wage will be hit by this tax but the more immediate threat to farming be the government ’s rash decision to cut the basic payment by next year that will hit livestock farmer upland farmer and dairy farmer and destabilise the whole industry will the minister think again 
 the change we have make this year be the big boost to sustainable farming that this country have see that be the agricultural transition the liberal democrats have always be flaky on this issue and they have never be able to make up their mind what they think about it we be determined to tackle the extreme climate crisis globally they seem to think it be not happen 
 what step he plan to take to help tackle fly tipping 
 what step he plan to take to help tackle fly tipping 
 what step his department be take to help tackle fly tipping in rural area 
 what step his department be take to help tackle fly tipping

 fly tipping have increase after year of conservative failure leave a plague of dump rubbish across our street park and city and impose huge cost on taxpayer and business this new labour government will end our throwaway society and stop the avalanche of rubbish fill up our street by increase recycling rate reduce waste and crack down on waste crime

 i can tell my hon friend and constituency neighbour that local authority have the power to issue fix penalty notice on the spot fine of up to £ but fix penalty notice be completely inadequate give the scale of the problem she outline the low rate of fix penalty notice and prosecution mean that this be a consequence free crime we be on a mission to improve that and i hope her council will work with we to improve its record 
 sandwell litter watch do a great job of keep our street clean but it and the council can not overcome the selfish behaviour of fly tipper who dump rubbish all over the borough from yew tree to oldbury incident of fly tipping in sandwell be now double the national average will the minister set out far how the government be work with council to catch and punish these dreadful fly tipper 
 i pay tribute to sandwell litter watch and to destination barr hill in my constituency who get out and about every weekend to clean up other people ’s mess we will crack down on fly tipping establish clean up squad and force those who dump rubbish or vandalise our field to join in the clean up the national fly tipping prevention group have produce a guide on how local authority can present robust prosecution to support tough sentence the government will also explore further option with the ministry of justice ’s sentencing review 
 i be afraid that i have to add to the litany of terrible statistic about fly tipping in rural area there be over incident of rural fly tipping in my constituency of redditch with only fix penalty notice give to an offender can the minister tell we more about how she hop to work with local authority like mine to ensure that the people commit these crime be bring to justice 
 i understand that my hon friend ’s council have just change political colour so i hope that the new labour administration will take the problem a lot more seriously i be aware that waste permit exemption allow low risk waste activity to be carry out under a registration scheme and that that can be abuse by criminal let we not be under any illusion there be serious organise crime in this area i be consider proposal to tighten the regime and i be happy to speak to my hon friend ’s council about how we tackle this together 
 fly tipping be a grow concern among resident of stafford eccleshall and the village many constituent be increasingly frustrated with the persistent illegal dumping of waste will the minister meet i to discuss how her department be clean up the mess leave by the last government and how the propose measure will directly address fly tipping and improve the situation for my constituent 
 i be aware of some serious incident in my hon friend ’s constituency include where a significant amount of rubbish be fly tip on a driveway   near a school and pupil suffer bad health impact i be concerned that the carrier broker and dealer regime that the last government leave be far too weak and not fit for purpose i be actively consider how the regime can be review and i will be happy to meet my hon friend to hear her input 
 it be nice to see the hon lady back in the house and elevate to a government position well do the northern ireland environment agency have reveal that it have clean up some illegal waste site in the last year with taxpayer foot the bill of half a pound equivalent to nurse wage what discussion have the minister have with the minister in the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs back home in northern ireland about the cost associate with fly tipping 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his kind remark i meet his colleague from daera at an inter ministerial group in september i be aware of the concern in rural area about fly tipping which blight swathe of our countryside i be work with the national farmers union and other through the national fly tipping prevention group to promote good practice include on private land we know from the national waste crime survey that of landowner and farmer have be affect by this terrible crime 
 what step he be take to improve food security 
 the hon lady will know that there be many facet to food security but the £ budget settlement for the next year send an important message to food producer about the stability and continuity they can look forward to our work on supply chain fairness will add to that and we will be make more announcement in the come week and month 
 today the chancellor be hail the benefit of free trade in a plea to donald trump however any future trade deal with the united states will enable cheap food such as hormone treat beef to flood our market which would be devastating for farmer and food security will the secretary of state take this opportunity to rule out any trade deal that undermine our british farmer 
 we have always be very clear that we will do nothing in trade deal that would undermine this country ’s important standard 
 i call the shadow minister 
 food security be national security and underpin it be farmer and farmland labour ’s ill judge and heartless family farm tax will put all of that in jeopardy family farm lose tenant farmer unable to continue farm community hollow out rural mental health damage and precious food produce land lose to developer or investor no farm no food no farmer no food will the government please now admit that they have get   this catastrophically wrong will they do the right thing by reverse this farm tax to protect our country ’s food security 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his place let i say once again that it be important to treat this subject carefully we must look at the fact and listen to people who know about it i be ask early by someone else whether this measure be wrong but we should look at what paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies and other tax expert have say there be many way in which this can be manage and i encourage the hon gentleman to join i in reassure british farmer about their future

 will the minister join i in congratulate the work of my internal drainage board and outline how she will work with it in future 
 i be delighted to speak at the association of drainage authorities conference yesterday to champion its work and to announce that after listen to it very carefully we will provide £ over years—[interruption in answer to the chuntering the part have already be spend 
 many of my constituent who live south of salisbury be concerned about the interaction between flood risk assessment and new house building will the minister assure the house that her work be fully integrate with the government ’s house building plan so that people can be reassure that when land be designate for build new home flood risk be properly take into account so that house building be restrict if there be no mitigation in place 
 the right hon gentleman be right about the importance of ensure adequate flood protection when we build new home yesterday we announce a review of the flood funding formula we will be look at nature base solution and sustainable urban drainage system so i hope that offer he some reassurance 
 i associate myself with the minister ’s remark about the flood victim in spain

 what step he be take to help tackle unlawful discharge of sewage into waterway by water company 
 what step his department be take to help prevent water pollution by utility   company 
 i welcome the new shadow ministers to their place as well of course the return under the previous government water company get away with discharge record level of sewage into our river lake and sea leave they in an appalling   polluted state   that be why we be take immediate action to place the water company under special measure with legislation go through parliament right now that will ban the payment of unfair bonus to water company executive we have also launch a commission that will lead a root and branch review of the entire sector so that we can clean up our waterway for good 
 in my constituency of stratford on avon the river avon and its tributary have be heavily pollute by untreated sewage discharge we know this because of a citizen science project which see resident test for pollutant regularly along the river and brook their effort be support by community initiative such as safeavon and group like stratford climate action will the government commit to and resource a national environmental monitoring strategy to well understand the overall health of water body and will they commit to require water company to monitor volume as well as duration of storm overflow 
 the hon lady be quite right to be concern about the state of the river avon we want to move towards a catchment base approach to water so we can look at all the input and be clear about how we can clean they up her point about monitoring will be consider by the commission lead by sir jon cunliffe i hope that she and other colleague will make their submission to sir jon for his review which be due to conclude in 
 i wholeheartedly welcome the water special measures bill as a package of reform to end the systemic dumping of sewage into our river lake and sea by water company while huge sum be be pay out by the same firm to shareholder however law be only ever as good as their enforcement and effective enforcement require adequate resourcing will the secretary of state consider how the enforcement agency might be self funding to a degree with money raise from fine levy on pollute water firm reinveste into the like of the environment agency 
 my hon friend make an important point he will be reassure to know that precisely the point he raise will be bring into law in the water special measures bill which will soon be arrive in the chamber so that polluter will pay for further enforcement action that way we have a virtuous circle to help clean up our waterway 
 what recent discussion he have have with the national farmers union on the adequacy of government support for farmer 
 as the hon gentleman would expect i have regular meeting with all the key stakeholder and i speak to the national farmers union on a regular basis 
 my local nfu representative gillian van der meer make clear her concern and those of many other local farmer about the impact of labour ’s family   farm tax i find it extraordinary that the minister seem to think that even if we accept his figure it be okay that hundred of farm will be affect i appreciate that a u turn can be difficult in the westminster bubble but i find the public be much more understanding and would welcome the government realise that they have get this wrong do he agree that they have get this policy wrong and that it be time for a rethink 
 what i would say be that i have have more meeting with tom bradshaw over the past few week than i have have for a long long time for reason that be entirely obvious i be grateful to he for congratulate the government on get a very good financial settlement for farmer when he address the egg and poultry industry conference on monday in newport wales i be grateful that he recognise that 
 what step he plan to take to support nature friendly farming 
 i point the hon lady to the extraordinary transformation that be under way with the huge amount of extra money go into the sustainable farm incentive and our environmental land management scheme this year it be the big transformation on record 
 i recognise the very welcome shift towards nature friendly farming which offer environmental social and economic benefit not just nature protection but good healthy food and good job yet the farmer lead nature friendly farming network argue that the agriculture budget need to be more than double to £ a year will the minister press his treasury colleague to put more money into nature friendly farming to secure a sustainable future for uk farming 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her support for the transition that we be undertake in fact i be speak to martin lines from the nature friendly farming network only yesterday evening he and many of his colleague be delighted with the transition that we be make but as ever the greens grasp of economic be limited 
 what recent progress his department have make on investigate crustacean die off along the north east coast in 
 an independent expert panel review the crustacean die off event and publish its finding last year it could not identify a clear single cause for the crustacean mortality the government be keep the situation under review and a coastal health programme be recently establish to improve coastal monitoring 
 the die off on the north east coast have devastate an industry that have serve hartlepool for generation fisherman such as my constituent stan rennie   and their family want thing support in the face of their livelihood be decimate a plan to repopulate and rebuild their industry and finally answer to how this happen in the place will the minister meet i and fisherman from hartlepool to discuss a way forward on this issue 
 my hon friend be a passionate defender of his community i extend my sympathy to all those who find themselves under pressure when these kind of event happen and i would be very happy to meet he to discuss the matter far 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to ensure that future international trade agreement support the farming sector 
 support farmer be a priority of this government we have be clear that we will protect farmer from be undercut by low welfare and low standard in trade deal we be also work to reset our relationship with our european friend to strengthen tie and tackle barrier and help boost trade to the eu through a uk eu sanitary and phytosanitary veterinary agreement 
 some farmer benefit from international trade agreement under the previous government unfortunately it be mostly australian and new zealand farmer not british farmer who benefit will my hon friend confirm that this government will prioritise british farmer who want to export not least those   who want to export to the european union through a veterinary agreement with the eu 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that what happen to the british farming industry be of the great betrayal of the previous government those trade deal do no credit to our country but we will take a different approach and develop a much more constructive relationship with our near neighbour therefore the answer to my hon friend ’s question be yes 
 there will be small point in protect farmer in international trade agreement if government policy be undermine those same farmer domestically how many thousand of farmer will it take to clog up parliament square next tuesday before the government realise that their inheritance tax policy be very deeply flawed 
 once again i direct right the hon gentleman back to the figure from the treasury which show that the number affect be under that be the answer to his question 
 what step his department be take to help ensure that the independent commission on the water sector regulatory system strengthen regulation 
 the independent commission on the water sector be launch on   october   and will be chair by sir jon cunliffe it be the big review of the industry since privatisation and will report next summer it will focus on boost investability speed up the delivery of water infrastructure and clean up our waterway 
 southern water be responsible for blight beach with raw sewage along ramsgate margate and broadstairs yet it plan on increase household bill by over the next year and the chief executive officer of southern water have receive £ over the last year in bonus and salary will the new independent commission do something about this egregious situation 
 i congratulate my hon friend on campaign for her local water consumer she be right to point to the wide failing across the system we have charge sir jon cunliffe with lead a commission that will look at how we can completely reset the sector regulation governance and how the sector operate so that the level of pollution and failure under the previous government can never be repeat 
 in the previous government introduce a rebate of £ per household on the water bill of customer in the far south west with of the country ’s population pay to keep a of our bathing beach clean on low than average salary will the secretary of state please reconsider the decision to scrap that rebate for constituent such as mine which be quietly announce just before the recess 
 it be important that support be target at the most vulnerable so we will look at what more can be do through social tariff to support family who be at risk of be unable to pay future water bill it be right that we prioritise the poor 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 as we have hear this morning the public be rightly furious about the filthy polluted state in which the previous administration leave our river lake and sea that be why there be such strong support for the water special measures bill which be work its way through parliament i urge all member to make submission to sir jon cunliffe ’s review and to encourage their constituent to feed in to it this be our chance to conduct a root and branch review of the entire sector to ensure that it be fit for the future and will properly serve both consumer and the environment for decade to come 
 research estimate that as many as dolphin and other mammal be catch and kill every year off the sussex coast yet no bycatch datum be record will the secretary of state please outline how   he be ensure that supertrawler operate in uk water be fulfil their legal duty to report marine mammal bycatch to the marine management organisation 
 vessel be of course already require to report marine mammal bycatch we be look at implement remote electronic monitoring on large vessel to gather well datum about fishing activity we be also work to improve our marine environment by ratify the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction agreement enforce fishing restriction in marine protect area and ensure that all catch limit be set sustainably 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i wish his majesty the king a very happy birthday 
 the chancellor the secretary of state and the food minister claim that their family farm tax will affect only a quarter of farm yet after inform question by the national farmers union the country land and business association the tenant farmers association and conservative members the minister have now admit that the government need to check their figure should the cost of the family farm tax to farming family not have be check before the budget 
 the datum from his majesty ’s revenue and customs be crystal clear quarter of farmer will pay nothing as a result of the change family farming will continue into future generation as it should 
 the secretary of state perhaps need to ask his food minister why he say at the agricultural industries confederation conference that the government be check the figure let i help the secretary of state out he can explain the veracity and accuracy of his figure next week when thousand of farmer come to westminster to rally against the family farm tax the delinking of payment the hike in national insurance and other tax hike on work farm in the budget will he come 
 it be very important that the government listen to farmer and of course we will do so but i know that farmer be reasonable people they will want to look at the fact and like everybody else if they drill into the hmrc datum they will see that quarter of they will end up pay no more under the new system than they do today 
 sewage spill be a scourge for my resident and not just in the sea but in the street too raw sewage and use toilet roll flood a street in southwick recently what be the government ’s plan to force the water company to upgrade their infrastructure and bring an end to those foul smelly spill that be blight the life of local resident 
 my hon friend raise an important point he be a strong campaigner in his constituency against the failing of the water company and the high level of pollution result from the failure of the previous government so i know that he be back the water special measures bill that be work its way through parliament and that he will support sir jon   cunliffe ’s commission as we seek to reset the sector by change its regulation and governance so that it work well for consumer and the environment 
 the puffin and other native seabird in my constituency on the isle of may be very grateful for the ban on sand eel fishing and trawling but that ban be now subject to legal challenge will the secretary of state commit to fight that legal challenge 
 the hon lady raise an important question that be a delicate issue because it have be raise by the european union but we be absolutely determined to maintain our position 
 i welcome the record allocation for agriculture in the budget however the simple fact be that that agriculture budget be no good if it stay in the whitehall coffer last year there be a £ underspend in the agriculture budget worth more than £ on average for every single farm holding in the country what step be the secretary of state take to guarantee that every single penny of that budget get to community such as lichfield burntwood and the village 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be extraordinary give all the sound and fury from the opposition that they do not even spend the money that be available this government will ensure that every penny we have get to farmer because we be on the side of british farmer rather than whip they up in the kind of irresponsible way that the conservative party have be do 
 family farm across west dorset fear closure as a result of the government ’s plan change to agricultural property relief and business property relief and i urge minister to rethink the policy the budget also include the announcement of a uk carbon border adjustment mechanism to be introduce on january that will place a carbon price on good import to the uk include fertiliser a carbon tax on fertiliser will only increase the cost of production for farmer struggle to compete with cheap import and drive up cost for consumer what assessment have be make of that 
 the proposal for a carbon border adjustment mechanism be support by the previous government and we have confirm it it be complicated in the way it will work and it will not affect people before the liberal democrats have show once again that when it come to environmental issue they can not be trust 
 resident in woodborough village have face the devastation of flood far too many time in recent year will my right hon friend the secretary of state therefore work with i woodborough flood action group and woodborough parish council to bring forward a much need flood alleviation scheme for that village 
 protect community from flooding be a top priority that be why we have launch the flood resilience taskforce and be invest £ over this year and the next to improve flood resilience we have also announce another £ investment into the internal drainage board i commend my hon friend for his work with local flood action group and i be keen to hear how the matter progress throughout this parliament 
 last year the river lambourn suffer sewage spill from storm overflow cause irreversible harm to a rare chalk stream will the relevant minister meet i urgently to discuss plan to address that in newbury 
 i can certainly ensure that the relevant minister meet the hon gentleman i hope that he will also feed his view into sir jon cunliffe ’s review as sir jon will be consider catchment wide approach that will well protect chalk stream 
 will my right hon friend the secretary of state update the house on progress in create new national forest and as it be my birthday may i extend to he an invitation to visit macclesfield forest in my constituency 
 i wish my hon friend a very happy birthday and i join he in celebrate the year anniversary of the national parks and access to the countryside act that pioneer labour government create groundbreake law so that every citizen could have access to nature ’s beauty we will protect that access and we will set up new national forest and who know where they will be 
 in our increasingly volatile world i be sure the secretary of state will agree that food security be of grow importance to our national resilience i hope he will commit the new government to continue to publish the annual food security index with the next update come at next year ’s farm to fork summit 
 it be a pleasure to take a question from the distinguished former prime minister we be review the datum that we can publish and we want to be as open and transparent as possible i think that be good for the sector and good for scrutiny but we will announce in due course precisely how it will operate 
 i thank the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy for come back to i about the river hipper scheme which be of huge importance in my constituency may i invite she to come to chesterfield to meet people affect by the flood and see the holymoorside scheme which could make a real difference 
 it be always a pleasure to work with   my hon friend and i know how passionately and well he campaign for his community during the last    flood and how deeply the situation move he of course i would be more than happy to continue to work with he 
 i call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee 
 i congratulate the secretary of state and indeed the chancellor of the exchequer on the achievement of the budget in year in this house i have never see such a degree of unity among farming organisation in their response to it point on which there seem to be no disagreement be that the removal of the ringfence around agricultural payment to scotland wales and northern ireland be a bad move nobody ask for it why do the government do it and what do they expect to achieve with it 
 the right hon gentleman will be aware that we have announce the big budget for sustainable farming—£5 over the next year in the history of our country and that be to be welcome by everybody in the sector and everybody who care about it this be a government who believe in devolution we believe that devolve administration should have the right to take decision about their own country the consequential mean that the appropriate level of funding will continue to go to those devolved administration and our support for devolution mean that the devolve administration will take their own decision about the good way to spend it 
 chester zoo in the constituency of my hon friend   the member for chester north and neston samantha dixon do important and nationally lead conservation work zoos nationwide have face regulatory uncertainty for nearly year because of the previous government ’s delay in publish new zoo standard will my right hon friend the secretary of state set out when the department plan to publish the update version of the standard of modern zoo practice to drive improvement in animal welfare and provide certainty to those institution 
 i have visit chester zoo and see the wonderful work that it do in specie conservation i will endeavour to write to my hon friend to update he on the regulation 
 the government have justify their inheritance tax change for farmer on the basis that they be concerned about people gain short term tax advantage by buy agricultural land may i therefore ask whether instead of the sweeping change that they make the government consider an approach that would limit the iht exemption to those who could demonstrate that the family farm have be in family ownership for a certain number of year if that approach be explore why be it not pursue if it be not explore why not 
 we have have a lot of debate about this issue and i be perfectly happy to have discussion with hon member about the tax regime in general of the beneficial aspect of this policy may be to get the generational shift that farm in this country   need so much there be many part to this policy it be a complicated policy and in future we will have further discussion 
 on and   november a massive burst water main in my constituency leave home without water for more than hour the response of the water company south staffs water be slow ineffective and secretive will the minister remind south staffs water and all water company of their responsibility to help resident and work with local stakeholder follow an incident 
 what a tireless champion my hon friend have be in campaign on this issue she be quite right to feel offend by the poor level of communication she have have from the water company and i hope that it hear the message loud and clear that water company need to work with and communicate more effectively with members of parliament in the area that they represent 
 this week john mcternan an adviser to tony blair publicly state that farming should be treat in the same way that margaret thatcher treat the miner and that it be an industry the country could do without as a farmer i find this incorrect offensive and delude do the minister agree 
 yes 
 the solicitor general be ask 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for case in relation to violence against woman and girl 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for case in relation to violence against woman and girl 
 this government be commit to halve violence against woman and girl in the next decade we be not only fix the foundation of our economy but rebuild trust in our criminal justice system with an additional £ in the budget for the crown prosecution service this will mean additional specialist in rape and serious sexual offence boost investigator to tackle those awful offence 
 last year over woman in sandwell be victim of domestic abuse get case through the justice system quick be vital to break the cycle of abuse and protect victim so can the minister set out far what the government be do to make sure the police and prosecutor work together to tackle domestic abuse 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that very important point and for the work she be do in this area for too long victim of domestic   abuse across the country have be let down but this week we have welcome a new domestic abuse joint justice plan between police and prosecutor that plan will see they work more closely together to support victim in order to deliver swifter investigation and justice for all 
 prosecution and conviction for domestic abuse plummet over the last year under the previous government additionally the time take to charge domestic abuse case have increase dramatically give the alarming rise in delay what measure be the solicitor general implement to expedite those process and ensure timely justice for victim 
 my hon friend raise a powerful point he be right that between and the number of domestic abuse flagged case receive from the police by the cps drop by nearly we be begin to see a rebound in those figure but much more need to be do we need a whole system approach to fix the system and our domestic abuse joint justice plan will ensure that the cps and police work more closely together to address those delay from the very outset of a case 
 i have be contact by a constituent who have concern about how they be treat in a rape case and about the communication that come from the police and the cps what step be the solicitor general take to ensure victim be properly inform all the way through 
 i thank the hon member for his question and i be sorry to hear about that specific case i be of course happy to make contact directly with any local chief crown prosecutor to address that case more generally victim transformation work be take place across both police and cps such as investment in victim liaison officer to make sure that there be a single point of contact so that victim be support right the way through the criminal justice process 
 i welcome the shadow solicitor general to the front bench 
 thank you very much indeed mr speaker it be an honour to stand at the dispatch box again albeit on the other side of this great chamber i hope to work constructively with the hon and learn lady on this challenging and very intricate part of government 
 violence against woman and child be abhorrent and inexcusable it crush self confidence and self esteem in victim wreck family and ruin life as someone who be a family lawyer for year before come to this place i welcome the government ’s mission to halve violence against woman and girl within the next decade to achieve that important goal what action be the government take on prevention and early intervention and when will the specialist rape court be introduce 
 i welcome the shadow solicitor general to her place she bring enormous experience not only in legal matter but specifically in relation to violence against woman and girl and i look forward to work constructively with she in this area i also take   the opportunity to welcome the appointment of the new shadow attorney general and send my good wish to   the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright   as he depart his role 
 in answer to the hon lady ’s question she be right that the commitment to halve violence against woman and girl in the next decade be a cross government initiative prevention and early intervention be a core part of that that be why when the vawg mission board meet early there be a real focus on education how we educate about consent and early intervention so that we can prevent these case from enter the criminal justice process 
 the government have announce an extra £ in funding to support victim of crime and say that the funding will enable additional staff recruitment at the specialist rape and serious sexual offence unit of the crown prosecution service can the solicitor general confirm to the house the number of additional staff to be take on when will they be in place 
 the hon lady be right to welcome the additional £ which will be invest in those specialist rape and serious sexual violence unit in every cps area but it be important that the cps have discretion over how that money be spend and make sure that resource be direct and target at area where they be most need so that we can deliver for the victim of these most serious crime 
 what step she be take to help ensure the effective prosecution of rural crime 
 the government be deeply committed to address the important issue of rural crime that be why we be strengthen neighbourhood police in rural area and implement strong law to prevent farm theft and fly tipping in addition we be recommit to their be a specialist crown prosecutor in each cps area who support the police in charge and prosecute rural crime 
 i thank the solicitor general for her answer the equipment theft prevention act have support from across the house in the previous parliament the statutory instrument to bring in its measure be with the home office but have yet to be bring forward property seize by the thames valley police rural crime taskforce across south oxfordshire and the vale of white horse since the start of be value at more than £ with an incalculable impact on farmer mental health wellbeing and anxiety to improve the rate of prosecution for rural crime will the solicitor general urge her colleague at the home office to bring that statutory instrument before the house 
 i thank the hon member for raise an important point i can confirm that we be commit to implement the equipment theft prevention act and with that bring about real benefit and impact for farmer suffer from the theft and resale of high value equipment with all the stress and distress that that cause 
 i be pleased to see the solicitor general a good friend of mine in her place 
 a key part of rural crime particularly in newcastle under lyme be waste waste crime have blight the life of my constituent for far too long may i urge the solicitor general to do all she can work with colleague across government to hold the rogue operator of landfill site to account and make sure that they face the full force of the law 
 in a previous life i be an environmental lawyer so i know just what a scourge those waste offence can be that be precisely why the work of specialist crown prosecutor who work closely with the police in charge and prosecute such rural crime will be so important 
 what discussion she have have with the crown prosecution service on ensure the effective prosecution of covid-19 relate fraud 
 the government be do everything possible to recover the million in public fund lose to covid-19 relate fraud the crown prosecution service be work closely with investigator to pursue all those who dishonestly line their pocket with government money 
 in the previous health secretary say in relation to covid-19 contract that 
 where a contract be not deliver against we do not intend to pay taxpayer money”.—[official report   february vol c. 
 judge from the figure that highlight the enormous scale of covid-19 relate fraud that be little more than a promise make and a promise break by the previous government i be pleased that our government have make it a priority to recoup as much of that money as possible from scammer who profit at taxpayer expense however and a half year on from the lockdown my constituent in ipswich many of whom sacrifice so much during the pandemic will be wonder why it have take this long and a change of government to take the issue as seriously as it deserve can the solicitor general tell the house whether that be down to the previous government ’s incompetence or lack of effort or whether it be symptomatic of their more general recklessness 
 order of we have to sit down and it be not go to be i that be a very long question the hon gentleman could have shorten it he might want to apply for an adjournment debate on the subject which be obviously very important 
 my hon friend raise an important point in contrast to the previous government this government be take action on covid relate fraud we have hear from the chancellor that she will be appoint a covid corruption commissioner who will review and assess all the ppe contract that be enter into before any be write off i think i speak on behalf of all our constituent in say that where money be fraudulently obtain we want our money back 
 what step her department be take to support the serious fraud office in tackle economic crime 
 what step her department be take to support the serious fraud office in tackle economic crime 
 this government be commit to crack down on fraud that be why we have confirm an additional £ in funding to improve the performance of the serious fraud office far enhance its case management and ensure well system for asset recovery 
 i welcome the additional money for the serious fraud office my hon and learn friend will know that transparency international have assess the uk as have reduce enforcement of foreign bribery measure for the time and the last bribery investigation to be publicly confirm be in what step be be take to ensure that the sfo actively fulfil its role as the primary enforcement body for foreign bribery 
 i acknowledge my hon friend ’s proud track record in highlight economic crime and his work in expose dirty money i meet the director of the serious fraud office yesterday in this house we be work closely together to crack down on corruption fraud and bribery and i assure my hon friend that the sfo be work incredibly hard in that area 
 in more than crime involve fraud be commit in scotland since crime of that kind be often commit online and observe no border will the solicitor general advise the chamber on whether the uk and scottish fraud office be co operate on that issue 
 my hon friend be correct to say that so often these terrible crime do not respect border fraud that be specific to scotland be investigate by police scotland and prosecute by the crown office and procurator fiscal service which work closely with english base agency and the sfo where it be appropriate to do so this government be commit to strengthen the union and that extend to law enforcement in this area 
 i warmly welcome my hon friend the shadow solicitor general to her post it be good to see she back and i thank the solicitor general for her kind word 
 i equally warmly welcome the advent of a failure to prevent offence in relation to certain kind of economic crime the solicitor general will agree that the purpose of that exercise be not to engender further prosecution but to change behaviour will she therefore reassure the house that she will work with colleague across government to ensure that business receive all the advice they need about how to put in place the reasonable anti fraud measure that will give they a defence under that new offence 
 i thank the right hon and learn gentleman for his question just this week guidance be publish by the home office in conjunction with other organisational partner and the sfo in relation to prevent fraud and that will of course entail work with business to ensure that it be operate as effectively as it can for those who be impact by fraud both individual and business alike 
 not so long ago a tv programme i think it be panorama”—showe that dirty money and bribery be move from latvia to germany and northern ireland and it clearly show that international criminal gang and paramilitary group be work together have the solicitor general have an opportunity to discuss how well to tackle those gang for instance by work well regionally or by work together with the republic of ireland to ensure that we combat those group 
 i can not comment on any specific case but i know from my discussion with the director of the sfo that it be alive to those cross jurisdictional issue that be part of the purpose of the additional investment that the government have provide to the sfo to ensure that its process investigation and case management be as effective and nimble as they can be include in tackle those cross jurisdictional issue 
 we now come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i welcome the solicitor general to her place and i very much look forward to work with she i echo the comment of other welcome the shadow minister   the hon member for maidstone and malling helen grant to her place the solicitors regulation authority recently label the legal services board ’s damn report into the handling of the axiom ince fraud as merely an opinion can the solicitor general clarify what mechanism be in place to ensure that the regulator be properly regulate what action be be take by her department to prevent similar economic crime to ensure that all constituent include mine in north cornwall of whom be in the gallery today can have confidence in our legal system 
 i welcome the hon member to his place he raise an incredibly important point this government in general be commit to raise standard and rebuild trust in the justice system that mean regulator work effectively with investigator in the public interest he will know that in accordance with long establish practice it would not be proper for i to comment on the specific case that he mention but i can assure he that we will be work to ensure that regulator be work effectively with investigator in the public interest 
 what step she have take with the crown prosecution service to ensure that the victim right to review scheme be operate effectively 
 the victim right to review scheme be a vital mechanism for ensure that victim have the right to request a review of certain prosecutor decision either not to start a prosecution or to stop a prosecution we be continue to work with our partner include the cps so that the victim right to review scheme operate as effectively as possible to deliver for victim the justice they rightly deserve 
 in my short time in this place i have be shock and concern by the rate of violence against woman in my constituency of monmouthshire many constituent have reach out to i for support i be pleased that the government be aim to halve violence against woman and girl in the next decade but can the solicitor general tell we what proportion of violence against woman case request review how be victim support through the process because it be incredibly difficult to maximise their ability to exercise their right to review 
 we be look at the victim ’s right to review scheme closely it be inform the subject discussion that i hope to have later today with the director of public prosecutions we be also work closely with the victim commissioner who be raise issue around how we might reform this process i can assure my hon friend that the cps be look at this matter closely thing it be introduce be that where no evidence be offer for the most serious rape and serious sexual offence that decision be review by a deputy crown prosecutor before it be take that oversight be already produce result 
 what recent discussion she have have with regional mayor on rate of prosecution for street crime 
 what recent discussion she have have with regional mayor on rate of prosecution for street crime 
 council leader and regional mayor play an important role in tackle the unprecedented challenge that this government inherit we be commit    to work closely with local leader to deliver the safe street that our community deserve i have already meet several deputy mayor mayor and council leader to discuss these important matter and we will continue to do so in the month ahead 
 shoplifting be a major concern for my constituent business and retail worker in weston super mare many of whom have contact i for support shoplifting have increase massively with more than case these past month that be a annual increase to reassure my constituent can the solicitor general outline what step she be take to prosecute those responsible for shoplift 
 my hon friend be right to raise this important issue shoplifting be a scourge in many of our constituency that be why this government be commit to introduce respect order and beef up legislation to tackle persistent antisocial behaviour we be also work with the cps to ensure that we clamp down on assault against shopworker which will be part of a new stand alone offence and we be re commit to prosecute in these core area 
 the solicitor general will be aware of concern about knife and violent crime in many community include huddersfield in particular there be serious concern about how child and young people be be criminally exploit in wide county line gang how be the department work with regional mayor to improve prosecution rate for knife and violence- related offence and to ensure that those at risk of offend receive target intervention 
 as my hon friend state knife crime be a scourge that particularly impact on young people too many of whom senselessly lose their life or be injure every year mayor and council will be essential partner in the mission to achieve safe street i have already meet the deputy mayor of west yorkshire to discuss this matter the prosecutorial piece be part of this government ’s review to crack down on the sale of offensive weapon the government be in a hurry we have already implement a ban on the possession of zombie style knife and machete but of course there be a lot more that we can and should be do 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for housing communities and local government if she will make a statement on the government ’s policy on council tax referendum threshold in 
 since the financial year local authority fire authority and police and crime commissioner have be require to determine whether the amount of council tax they plan to raise be excessive the secretary of state set threshold on excessiveness and know the referendum principle for different class of authority since those threshold have also include a social care precept provide high threshold for authority with social care responsibility 
 decision on the council tax level to set or whether to hold a referendum to go beyond the referendum principle sit with council but the government have be clear that we expect the threshold to be maintain at the current level set by the previous government the office for budget responsibility forecast of the last government assume that council tax would increase by a core plus an additional for local authority with adult social care responsibility for the entirety of the forecast period we will set out further detail in the local government finance settlement in the new year 
 beyond that we be determined to support local government and undo the mess that have be create over the past year that be why at the budget we announce over £ in new local government funding include an additional £ in the local government finance settlement that as the hon gentleman will be well aware have be warmly welcome by the sector 
 council tax fund about £ of expenditure in england on social care which be of all council funding it be therefore of huge interest to our constituent the prime minister and ministers have repeatedly tell the house that we need to wait for the spending review and the local government finance settlement to know what will happen with the referendum limit include at the dispatch box yesterday when the prime minister tell my right hon friend the leader of the opposition to wait shortly afterwards the press be tell that the limit would remain in place 
 answer to parliamentary question show that the government be expect spending power to increase by £ fund by grant of £ that demonstrate that the chancellor ’s budget have open up a £ black hole in council finance in addition to that the county councils network have highlight its concern that although we have not yet have a formal statement in the house there be proposal to change the way in which funding be allocate far deprive local authority in urban suburban and rural area of the funding that they need 
 i would like to put question to the minister will he promise the house that fund allocation through the grant mechanism will follow the cost pressure   on local authority and not any other form of indexation or formula to ensure that place face the high cost receive the funding that they need next while nobody would want to see the referendum limit scrap simply to bail out central government the announcement of the constrain local authority when it come to their fundraising will the minister tell the house whether it will be our high street through increase business rate or whether significant cut to other council service will be need to fill the government ’s £ black hole 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question let i take they in turn the government be commit to a fair funding settlement for local government we will set out further detail in the usual way in the upcoming local government finance settlement which will be present to parliament 
 on the £ figure i be afraid that we simply do not recognise it i assume that the hon gentleman in his calculation fail to take account of the over £ raise from business rate and £ in additional new house come along yes it be right that £ will be raise through council tax in but as i make clear that be because the government be clear that we be maintain the previous government ’s policy on council tax in line with the obr forecast make in march 
 the question for the opposition be be they say that the cap should be abolish as the conservative local government association group ’s rebuild the road to victory document call for all cap to be remove or be they say that the limit should be reduce which would be contrary to the policy in place when the now leader of the opposition be the local government minister 
 i call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee 
 it be worth remember why a number of our local authority be face this decision and the tight financial situation the funding crisis over the past year force a number of local authority to make those difficult decision a number of our area be face major in year cost pressure from thing such as temporary accommodation and special educational need and disability provision do the minister agree that we need to accelerate the house building plan in order to get local authority back on a level playing field so that our local resident do not see that cost increase in their council tax bill 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for that question she be absolutely right after year of the previous government ’s record in office local government be on its knee we have a system on the verge of collapse we have multiple year when in year spending pressure be ignore the headroom that we have provide through the budget more than £ in new local government funding which i reference early will allow we to start to turn that system around and to get ahead of some of the challenge we be face whether the pressure on adult social care child ’s service or homelessness cost as a result of temporary accommodation that be why our house   building programme within my specific remit of responsibility and in particular the increase in social and affordable housing supply that we be commit to be so important 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the liberal democrats be deeply concerned that people be simply pay more council tax for few service that be quite clearly the result of conservative tax cut and their failure to tackle social care as a former council leader i know that the burden on council have increase to such an extent that they be force to make impossible choice the burden and the cost that council of all colour have to shoulder as a result of the conservative government ’s policy must be review will the minister ensure that council do not have to close library cut bus route and reduce road repair in order to meet the grow demand of the most vulnerable member of our community despite the announcement in the budget will the minister recognise the lga analysis that council face a £ shortfall because of inflation increase wage demand and demand pressure on local service 
 the government certainly recognise the pressure on local authority and the burden place on household as a result of year in which local government be run down we be determined to turn that situation around as i have say by provide the headroom that local authority need to get ahead of some of the challenge that they have face for many year that be why the more than £ in new local government funding announce at the budget include an additional £ in the local government finance settlement have be so warmly welcome that bring the total real term increase in core spending to around we remain committed to the referendum cap we believe that be the right threshold to protect the most vulnerable we be also committed to the single person discount and local council tax support scheme under which as i be sure the hon gentleman be aware more than household do not pay a full council tax bill 
 i really do not know how the opposition spokesperson   the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds can stand there and talk about cut and shortfall with a straight face we know where responsibility lie and on the lib dem benches as well interruption 
 order i think that   the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake   will want that yorkshire cup of tea it will come very quickly if he carry on i call clive betts another yorkshireman 
 let i take my hon friend on a trip down memory lane when i become a councillor only year ago council have the freedom to raise rate for domestic and non domestic property should we not at some point start a conversation with council and the wide public about whether threshold at all be appropriate council in this country have less freedom to raise local taxation than virtually any other council in western europe council tax itself be regressive both between individual and between different local authority can we not start that conversation at some point 
 i thank my hon friend for that point and i will relay it to the local government minister on the general principle we be determined to rebuild local government from the ground up that be why we be provide multi year funding settlement to council and remove a number of ringfence and be commit as i say to fair funding on his general point about the opposition i completely agree it remind i of a phrase my nan use to use more front than harrods she use to say that be what opposition member have 
 will the minister rule out additional council tax band be among any change that the government make 
 i say to the right hon gentleman that we be not talk about council tax band in this urgent question we be talk about the threshold that remain in place we be committed to those threshold as i be sure you would expect mr speaker we will set out more detail about the local government finance settlement at the appropriate point next year in the usual way 
 area like hull city council be savage by the previous government when it come to funding absolutely savage to the point where they be almost on their knee will my hon friend the minister tell the house what the government be do for area of high deprivation like hull 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the damage do to local government over the year in which the conservatives be in office be profound we have inherit as i say a system on the verge of collapse we be absolutely committed as part of rebuild that system from the ground up to a fair funding settlement as i say the minister for local government will announce more detail in the upcoming local government finance settlement in the new year 
 local authority across the country will welcome multi year settlement so they can plan for the future however do the minister have any plan whatever for a revaluation of property give that property be originally value back in when council tax begin   the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts   and i produce a select committee report on what could be do to ensure that council need not be strictly neutral in term of finance and could revalue property to bring valuation up to date 
 the hon gentleman tempt i to discuss the local government finance settlement ahead of it be formally present to the house i be afraid i can not do that but the government have hear his point and i will ensure that it be pass on to the local government minister 
 as a councillor i see year of austerity and cut to local government and a cut equivalent for my council in medway the opposition the medway conservative group recently state that it would not only scrap the   recent council tax cap but introduce a local income tax on resident do the minister agree that there need to be consistency on this issue whereas the opposition ’s approach be to say in case scrap the cap and in another keep it 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and we still have not have an answer we do not know the opposition ’s position on threshold interruption we be in government as   the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake   chunter from a sedentary position and we have confirm that when it come to threshold we intend to maintain the position as it be under the previous government and as bake into the office for budget responsibility forecast for the spending period the opposition really do have to answer this question be they say that the threshold should be remove or increase or be they say that they should be reduce and core service cut 
 unfortunately it be not for the opposition to answer the question they be in opposition 
 the chancellor and the international monetary fund be know to favour end council tax and replace it with a wide property tax the welsh labour government try to revalue all the property in wales for council tax purpose can the government rule out do either of those thing 
 i be not go to get into speculate about more fundamental reform of the council tax system as i have in a number of my response to this urgent question the government will set out their position on the threshold and on other matter in respect of the local government finance settlement at the appropriate point early in the new year 
 york be the lowest fund unitary authority in the country but have of the high cost of living that put real pressure on it we be also among the poorest fund for health fire and police service when the minister look at the funding formula for local government will he look at the presumption make to ensure more equity in the way it be put together 
 as i have say repeatedly i commit to it again we be determined to ensure that there be a fair funding settlement for local government and as i have say more detail will be forthcoming in the settlement early next year 
 labour use to say that it would freeze council tax can the minister now confirm that its policy be actually to put council tax up because of the flawed break promise on national insurance 
 no that be not the case we be maintain the policy of the previous government which as per the obr forecast estimate that £ will be raise through council tax the position of the government be that it will maintain the threshold   if the hon gentleman think differently he should tell house what his position be on threshold should they be reduce or increase 
 i be pleased about the support for and tier council and the commitment to fair funding which will make a real difference in for instance cornwall however in unitary authority such as our where a great many service have be share large town council have have to step up and take the strain but have not have the grant and other measure that have be available to those and tier council could the appropriate minister meet i to discuss the position of large town council in cornwall 
 i be more than happy to commit the local government minister to a meeting with my hon friend 
 during prime minister ’s question yesterday the government accept that they be give council a maximum of £ but the local government association have say that there be £ worth of pressure do the minister accept that council will have to increase their tax by about £ to fill the gap between what the government be offer they and what they need to provide local service 
 as i have make clear we do not recognise the £ figure it fail to take into account increase that i have already mention such as the £ increase in business rate income and the £ increase in income from new additional house the hon gentleman be absolutely right that we expect council tax to raise £ in but that be in line with the previous government ’s spending plan and bake into the obr forecast as of march 
 as a former deputy council leader i be somewhat amazed by the collective amnesia of conservative members   the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds   speak of what constrain local government spending power do my hon friend agree that it be cut such as those that southampton city council have suffer for year that have really reduce that spend power and do he agree that rather than faux outrage what we need be an apology 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend we deserve an apology but i doubt that we will get before it be vanishingly rare for council to fall into serious financial difficulty since then council have be affect in just year there be a pattern here for too long the conservative government not only fail to carry out their duty to local government but hollow out frontline service and crash the economy we be turn that around with the support that we be provide to local government in the budget we will set out more detail in the local government settlement early next year as i have mention 
 as the minister will know although we do not have council tax per se in northern ireland the pressure on our family finance   be on a par with those on the uk mainland the government need to be clear about just how much furth the finance of average family will be stretch because this be a very worrying trend what extra help can family especially disabled family expect to receive this year 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question which relate to an early i think that in the urgent question the opposition fail to account for the various other source of support that we be provide for family we be continue the household support fund that be £ there be a £ uplift for special educational need there be uk share prosperity funding of £ the list go on but if the hon gentleman wish to discuss the specific condition in northern ireland far i be more than happy to pass on that request to the local government minister 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests i be a vice president of the local government association opposition front benchers might want to reflect on that 
 my hon friend mention front i could talk about the opposition ’s brass neck in talk about concern about the pressure that local council face do he agree that year of conservative austerity initially with the liberal democrats devastate the ability of many council include luton council to provide much- need service to family in our constituency 
 i have be a local councillor as have many member of this house   the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds   have be a council leader so he will know what have happen to the system over the past year the opposition continue to claim that there be a multibillion pound black hole in local council budget when ask how they would fix it however they say it ’ not for we to do we ’re in opposition it ’ for the government it be a classic policy of have no plan to fix the mess they have provide no clarity on their position on threshold and fail to take responsibility for what they do over year in government 
 my conservative control council in the london borough of bexley have to apply for a capitalisation order year ago and make of our staff redundant despite that it still overspent its budget every month for over year and be currently overspend on the safety valve agreement make with the previous government in addition the conservative leader of the council in respond to a question from i last year accept that she be part of the lga conservative group executive that publish a manifesto last year ask their own government to remove cap on council tax    give that do my hon friend agree that it be rank hypocrisy for the conservative party to complain now about black hole in council finance 
 i absolutely do and the government be determined to extract from the opposition some clarity on their position on threshold do they agree with the lga conservative group which have call for the cap on council tax to be remove do they want those cap to be reduce we be still none the wiser hopefully we can find out in the week and month to come 
 as a member of a council for more than year like other member of this house i be still i have to say that in the last few year i have not meet a single councillor from any political party across the local government family who do not believe that local government finance be in its bad state for decade the late lga figure indicate that in labour authority council tax be £ low than in conservative authority do the minister agree that this show that labour council the labour party and the labour government provide well value for money 
 my hon friend be absolutely right labour council charge less on average than tory council and the council with the low rate of council tax be all labour council tax bill in labour council be on average £ less than in tory council when it come to local government financing and council tax pressure people be right to vote labour it will ensure that their council tax be low than if they be under a conservative local authority 
 i be a former local government leader do the minister agree that we should thank local authority leader especially labour leader such as pete marland at milton keynes city council for keep service during year of austerity milton keynes city council have keep weekly bin collection keep child ’s centre open and reduce rough sleeping while keep council tax lower than in its neighbouring tory authority do the minister agree that instead of use local authority leader to make cheap political point the conservative party should thank they and apologise for year of austerity 
 my hon friend make a good point i extend the government ’s appreciation to all local government leader i mean that in a cross party spirit for what they have do to keep service go despite the pressure that they have face over the past year when the previous government run down local government we should thank local government leader and this government do we want to consult they on how we rebuild the system after year of pressure and we would be more than happy to work across the chamber and have a mature cross party conversation about we fix this mess that will not happen if the political game playing from the opposition continue 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make a statement on the impact of change to employer national insurance contribution on primary care provider hospice and care home 
 i be grateful to the hon member for ask this important question it give i the opportunity to say to gps dentist hospice and every part of the health and care system that will be affect by change to employer national insurance contribution that this government understand the pressure they face and take their representation seriously the chancellor take into account the impact of change to national insurance when she allocate an extra £ to the department of health and social care there be well establish process for agree funding allocation across the system and we be go through those process now with this issue in mind 
 this government inherit a £ black hole in the public finance break public service and a stagnant economy upon take office we be tell that the deficit the previous government recklessly run up in my department alone would mean deliver few appointment a week instead of the more we promise the chancellor and my right hon friend the secretary of state be not prepared to see further decline in our nhs that be why we put in an extra £ to stop the nhs go into reverse this year 
 we build on that at the budget deliver the significant investment that the nhs need to get back on its foot back staff with investment in modern technology new scanner and new surgical hub and rebuild our crumble primary and secondary care estate alongside that we deliver a real term increase in core local government spending power of around which will help to address the range of pressure face the adult social care sector include £ in new grant funding for social care we be now work through exactly how that money will be allocate as per normal process as the secretary of state set out yesterday we will ensure that every pound be invest wisely to deliver the government ’s priority and provide value to taxpayer 
 the department will set out further detail on the allocation of funding in due course include through nhs planning guidance and the usual consultation include on the general practice contract as part of these process we will consider the impact of change announce to employer national insurance contribution in a fair and open way over the next month before the change come into force in april 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my declaration of interest 
 many in the health sector will have be pleased to hear the announcement of the extra funding for the nhs only for their joy to be strike down by the realisation that a manifesto promise not to raise national insurance contribution have be break that be compound far by the discovery that a raft of frontline care   provider care home hospice care charity pharmacy and gps to name but a few will not be exempt from the ni rise leave they with crippling staff bill and the threat of closure and redundancy the hospice sector expect the cost to be £ closure and redundancy the initial assessment of the cost to gps be £ closure and redundancy at the expense of appointment for the care sector the change will cost £ dwarf the £ in social care support that be announce do the minister accept that it be inevitable that council tax will have to rise to support the increase in nic 
 for the time the national pharmacy association have announce collective action its chair say 
 the sense of anger among pharmacy owner have be intensify exponentially by the budget with its hike in national insurance employer contribution and the unfunded national living wage increase which have tip even more pharmacy to the brink 
 will the minister clarify who be exempt from ni will the government admit that they get it wrong and make a change the prime minister health secretary and chancellor have all say that allocation will be make in the usual way will the minister clarify what the usual way be will mitigation be put in black and white to the house and the public be this part of the £ or new funding 
 more importantly will the minister lie out a concrete timetable for hospice care home gps pharmacist and all other ally health professional who be make decision now this seem to be another example of a big headline from the labour party but no detail 
 well really i be quite dumbfound by the hon gentleman ’s response i respect he for his professional practice and he know the state of the nhs that we inherit from the previous government as report in lord darzi ’s report he talk about joy but there be no joy when we inherit the mess they leave back in july he talk about people be tip to the brink and they absolutely be as lord darzi make clear 
 as i say we will go through the allocation of additional funding in the normal process which will be fast than under the previous government because we be commit to give the sector much more certainty the normal process as the hon gentleman should know from his time in government be to go through the mandate and the planning guidance and to talk to the sector about the allocation due next april as i say in my opening statement 
 do my hon friend join i in welcome the opposition ’s new interest in social care do she far agree that the problem that social care face owe more to the previous government ’s failure to do anything with andrew dilnot ’s report than they do to anything that be happen now with national insurance 
 my hon friend make an excellent point when i join this house in i remember that the act of the new non coalition conservative government be to take the leg from underneath that social care commitment by postpone the care act they cynically say at the time that they would bring it forward by which they think would coincide with the next general election we all see how that go 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the increase in employer national insurance contribution will erode the very investment in the nhs that the budget seek to prioritise katie a gp from lindfield in mid sussex write to i say that the nic increase 
 serve to directly undermine access and patient care
