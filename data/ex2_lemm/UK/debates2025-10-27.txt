i congratulate the minister on bring forward this raft of very important change it be a pleasure to follow   the hon member for rochester and strood lauren edwards i would ask my hon friend   the member for maidenhead mr reynolds   to address the point raise i be not qualified but i imagine that the purpose of new clause be to make technical change so that the measure be even more effective which clearly we would all support in any case my understanding be that it would require the secretary of state to bring forward such change rather than stipulate what those change be in detail 
 like other i warmly congratulate   the hon member for bolsover natalie fleet   on a very impressive and powerful speech i know that the minister congratulate she in advance on the campaign she have run equally   the hon member for knowsley anneliese midgley   make a very powerful speech my hon friend   the member for wimbledon mr kohler   and my hon friend the member for maidenhead make strong case as well 
 i repeat the reminder of my hon friend   the member for chichester jess brown fuller   that the primary purpose this be certainly what i have always say of custodial sentence must be public protection it be on that issue that i wish to concentrate my remark be entirely inform by a case i have be pursue on behalf of my constituent tina nash the minister be aware of this because i have correspond with she on the subject tina be horrifically attack by her former partner in for a hour period until she manage to escape in that time she be batter and have her eye gouge out and her jaw and nose break it be an appalling beating that she be lucky to survive and a survivor she be 
 the following year her former partner be jail for life with a minimum term of year however early this year he be move to a category d prison with open condition my constituent be not consult about this and be only inform about it after the decision have be take bear in mind that she be blind it be understandable that she fear that if she go out shopping he could be in her company without her knowledge she be incredibly scared as a result of the decision she have no say in it and nor be she consult 
 i table new clause to urge the government to accept that victim have a right to a veto in reasonable circumstance for their own protection not in all circumstance and not in every condition but we should certainly ensure that they be properly consult as a result of this experience i think there be a number of other failing in the system that require the government to ensure belt and brace support for victim throughout the process 
 tina want to pursue this matter with the parole board but it do not respond to she until my intervention and then there be an offer of a meeting that be not good enough it should not be down to a member of parliament to force a response she be give the support of the victim contact scheme which i will come to in a moment 
 my constituent be give the opportunity to complain the prisons and probation ombudsman provide she with a complaint form but month after she have complete the complaint she be inform that the ombudsman have assume she be the prisoner not the victim can that level of incompetence or her treatment throughout the process be believe she be treat appallingly while the process waste her time and stress she out her complaint be reject as outside the ppo ’s remit that fact be not initially communicate to she which cause her enormous distress and confusion despite circumstance in which she be blind by her perpetrator she still somehow have to navigate and overcome all these process and problem of course the ppo apologise for its error but with a lack of empathy for my constituent in an officious response that direct she to the victim commissioner 
 i turn to tina ’s interface with the victim liaison officer and the victim contact scheme this week i receive further communication from she in which she say that she have be attempt to seek support from the service and make inquiry about the restorative option that might be available as mention by my hon friend the member for wimbledon i think it be incredibly brave of she even to consider that in such circumstance but she be prepare at least to explore what that would mean how she would go about it and so on 
 tina get a response from her victim contact officer in her message to i she say 
 he shout at i that the perpetrator be scared of i so they be now try to make i feel like i be the perpetrator and the perpetrator be the victim and they have to protect he 
 that be from the victim contact scheme which be there to support the victim not to defend the perpetrator what be go on she continue 
 so i have remove myself from the victim contact scheme i do not trust they i be not be support 
 that simply be not good enough what be happen to the system to allow such circumstance to arise 
 hon member might think that my new clause which would entitle victim to a veto be an unreasonable request but something have to be do tina have be appallingly let down by the system if a victim who have go through all that be treat in such a manner we really do need to strengthen the system and not allow it to continue as it be she have be tell that her perpetrator be now remorseful and contrite about the whole thing but i wonder whether psychopathy of people of that nature be fully understand they can be as violent as that and they can also act up and persuade professional that they be remorseful i think it be theatrical contrition and insincere repentance and i worry that the system be vulnerable to such people i urge the minister to look again at this area and ensure that victim and survivor be properly support

 we now come to topical question to the secretary of state for work and pensions i call catherine fookes interruption i beg your pardon i have be give the wrong piece of paper 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his department ’s policy of the report by the institute for fiscal studies entitle how do people already out of employment fare when the state pension age rise publish on september 
 the clock go back at the weekend and you nearly put they forward again mr speaker 
 i be pleased to be here answer my set of question as the secretary of state for work and pensions i look forward to my exchange with the shadow secretary of state   the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately and the other spokespeople in the house 
 the state pension age will rise to from we continue to support later life planning by help people review their health finance and skill for example by have specific work coach for over-50 in our jobcentre consideration of the future of the state pension age be already under way as ask for under the pensions act 
 i welcome the secretary of state to his new position in my seat of newbury over woman have be unfairly affect by change to the state pension age those woman be wrong through no fault of their own and they deserve justice with a high court hearing due in december this could be a crucial moment for the government a moment to finally do the right thing will the secretary of state now listen to the ombudsman ’s recommendation and commit to provide compensation to woman of the women against state pension inequality campaign 
 i have to remind the hon member that when his party be in government it support the acceleration in the rise of the basic state pension age and that have give rise to some of the question he raise you would not expect i to comment on ongoing litigation mr speaker and i will not but i can assure the hon member and the house that we will take all relevant factor into account when consider the process for the future 
 previous to my election to this place i work for a homeless charity in harlow call streets2homes of its case involve a man who be homeless due to delay in get his state pension how be the department ensure that delay like that be not commonplace 
 we hope that those entitle to the basic state pension receive a seamless and fast service this be a pension that people contribute to throughout their life and when they reach state pension age we of course hope that they get it as soon as possible 
 what step his department be take to assess the effectiveness of the access to work scheme in help to enable long term career progression for disabled people 
 what step he be take to improve the access to work scheme 
 what change have be make to the access to work scheme in this parliamentary session 
 access to work do an important job but current delay with the scheme and our ambition for an rate of employment point to the need for reform the consultation launch in the pathway to work green paper close on   june we be review all aspect of the scheme in the light of the response that we receive 
 a constituent come to my surgery the other week who feel pretty frustrated that the access to work scheme which once support he be pull the rug from beneath his foot as he progress in his career he have be a model example he have not let his multiple neurodivergent diagnosis hold he back he have work hard and with support have earn a promotion   to a deputy leadership position at that point the dwp decide to reassess he and it downgrade his support right at the moment when he feel he need to maintain that support give his new responsibility can the minister assure we that when the reform come they will ensure that people be support over the progression of their career as well as into work in the place 
 the hon gentleman make a good point obviously i do not know the detail of the case that he refer to but it be important that access to work and our wide employment support enable people not just to get into work but to thrive once they be there exactly as he say 
 the access to work scheme provide vital support and it be of the good form of support for blind and partially sighted worker but when their award come up for review they find that their support and award be be significantly reduce give the government ’s commitment to keep britain work will the minister explain why blind and partially sight people be see their support cut will he agree to meet i and sight loss organisation to see how we can address some of the challenge with the scheme 
 there have be absolutely no change in the policy on access to work but there have be more scrupulous application of the exist policy and guidance over the last year that mean that access to work award have be more consistent and i know there have be case in which support have be reduce i be look forward to attend the forthcoming meeting of the all party group on eye health and visual impairment which my hon friend chair that might give we an opportunity to discuss the issue she have raise 
 on   may i meet the minister to speak about access to work claim that be be deny change or reduce all contrary to the guideline the minister assure i that it be a communication issue that the guideline have not change and that official be go to fix the problem by speak to the local jobcentre the problem be not fix since then both dawlish gardens trust and the no limits café in newton abbot have cease to provide access to work service because the system just be not work and they say every claim be be reject that assessment have be mirror by the access to work collective who change the guideline and why be they simply be ignore to save money at the cost of vulnerable adult if the minister would like more information i be happy to meet he again 
 i be very happy to meet the hon gentleman again but i assure he that the policy have not change in fact just last week we publish the spend figure on access to work which go up by in the last year and by in the year before that i do not know what happen in the particular case the hon gentleman refer to but would be happy to look at it far 
 access to work be vital at the high end of the scale it can sometimes be more expensive i have in my constituency a very senior person in the world of theatre who run graeae theatre she require access to   work support but even with the right support there be not enough for her need because she need a british sign language interpreter with she at all time graeae theatre be at the pinnacle of assess what people need and i would love to invite the minister to visit it because staff there be great at support disabled people into work with and without access to work support 
 i be aware that a big chunk of access to work funding go on british sign language interpretation and it be not unusual for people who draw on that support to hit the cap which increase last year and be now £ a year we will look at that along with all other aspect of the scheme in the review we be undertake 
 i call the shadow minister 
 back in may last year while in opposition the labour party be outraged to learn that the average processing time for application to the access to work programme be run at day in fact so outraged be labour members that they make it a manifesto pledge to tackle that problem after more than month in government labour be far from have slash waiting time applicant now have to wait an average of day that be more than twice the wait time under the previous government after a year in government the labour party have double the misery and uncertainty suffer by disabled people why 
 we be fix the very serious problem leave behind by the previous government the number of people who be process access to work application have be increase by since may last year but the hon gentleman be right that delay be still a problem that point clearly to the need for reform which be what we be get on with 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help ensure that post-16 education provide the necessary skill to support the economy 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help ensure that post-16 education provide the necessary skill to support the economy 
 skill be vital to give young people opportunity for economic growth and to our country ’s renewal that be why as part of our youth guarantee we be increase short course for high demand sector such as artificial intelligence and construction expand the number of youth hub and partner with sport club to get help to people where they be in the community last week we publish the skill white paper which set out the next step for train the workforce of the future 
 i still want every young person in derby to see technical education and apprenticeship as class not good route to success university   technical college from which student be time more likely to progress on to apprenticeship be key to unlock that success will my right hon friend meet pride park utc to discuss its plan to give young people in derby real choice and real opportunity by roll out a new technical centre in our city 
 my hon friend have speak often about this and i believe that he start his career as an apprentice as a former rolls royce worker he will have note the skill white paper and of course he know all about the importance of that company to the city of derby i congratulate pride park utc on its plan for a new technical skill centre and i will ensure that he get a meeting with i or with the relevant minister 
 my committee ’s recent report on further education and skill highlight the poor amount of information on vocational and technical training opportunity include apprenticeship available to young people while they be in school we recommend that ucas be expand to provide a single portal for information on academic vocational and technical opportunity so that every young person be aware of how they can train in the skill that they need to access a good job will the secretary of state consider this recommendation and work with the department for education to deliver it 
 i welcome that question as my hon friend raise a very important point if we be go to have equal status for high education and apprenticeship route we should look at how the information about they be disseminate to potential applicant i hope that she will be pleased to hear that i have already ask the department to begin work in this area 
 of the worry about the new regime and skills england be the loss of independence and the loss of what we have in the former institute for apprenticeships and technical education a guarantee business voice write into law how will the secretary of state ensure that business have a voice in set standard and in make sure that those standard be uphold so that everybody can have confidence in the change system 
 the right hon gentleman be right to say that the business voice and employer voice be very important in this when i write the new remit letter to skills england i ask it to take into account the view of employer because it be very important that the skill system be train people in a way that employer want and that meet the future demand of the labour market 
 i welcome the secretary of state to his place and to his new responsibility for skill the government recently reduce the amount of funding for level apprenticeship so can he tell the house what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of this reduce funding on the number of nurse in training 
 the apprenticeship and skill budget like every other budget demand choice we be choose to prioritise the level that we need in the economy and the area where the value be great that do imply   certain choice and i be confident that the choice we have make will benefit the workforce as a whole and future opportunity 
 what step he be take to support people with health condition into work 
 what step he be take to support people with health condition into work 
 we be determined to open up opportunity in work for people with health condition the keep britain working review will be publish soon in pathway to work we have work adviser support this group and we will devolve power so that area can shape their own join up local work health and skill offer 
 i recently visit pluss in exeter which support people live with physical disability and mental health condition back into employment i meet some of the fantastically commit mentor who provide tailor training and support help hundred of people who have be long term unemployed into meaningful job boost their confidence and help they rebuild their life do the minister agree that under the last tory government disability employment be shockingly neglect in contrast this government ’s recent announcement about connect to work funding for devon will help many more people back into the workplace 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the disability employment gap have be stick at around percentage point ever since what he refer to in his constituency sound like a great example of exactly the kind of resource we want to draw on in each area to make sure that disabled people have the opportunity in work that they be deny in the past 
 the motability scheme provide a lifeline to people with disability allow they to get to health appointment study maintain employment and so much more cut to the scheme risk increase health need and increased unemployment which be likely to cost much more than any short term saving do my right hon friend agree that before any propose cut be implement it be vital to carry out a proper impact assessment 
 i can assure my hon friend that there will be no change to the eligibility condition for the mobility component of the personal independence payment or indeed other aspect of pip until the conclusion of the review which i will be lead and co produce with disabled people that be expect to report in autumn next year 
 when severe mental illness strike it can be devastating and totally debilitate but the problem from the department ’s point of view be that its symptom be invisible there have be report of people fake mental illness in   order to gain benefit be the right hon gentleman satisfy that his department have appropriate check in place 
 yes appropriate check be in place as i have just mention we be undertake a review of the pip assessment and we will need to look carefully together with disabled people at the way in which those decision and judgment be make 
 at a recent roundtable at the eyres monsell club for young people in my constituency parent tell i that their young adult with learn difficulty who volunteer for year often with major supermarket still struggle to secure work what step be the minister take to ensure that young people with high function learning disability in long term volunteering role can access clear pathway into pay employment 
 the hon gentleman raise a very good point he will have see as many hon member will have do recent publicity about a particular case of this kind at the moment the proportion of people with severe learning disability who be in employment be tiny so we be work with employer and some very good support internship programme in the hope of open up opportunity for work and i hope we will see many more opportunity in the future we appoint an expert panel early this year to look at how well to support people with neurodivergence into work and the panel be come forward with some interesting proposal 
 i call the chair of the work and pensions committee 
 health equity north recently produce an analysis for the select committee that reveal that get just of people with disability or health condition into employment would yield cost saving of over £ what progress be be make with employer to enable sick and disabled people who want to work and be able to do so to get into employment 
 my hon friend raise an important point i agree with she about the tremendous value for the people who benefit and for the economy more widely of open up opportunity in employment in the way that she describe that be exactly what the keep britain working review lead by sir charlie mayfield be look at i be look forward to sir charlie ’s report and i be sure my hon friend will find it interesting i expect it to be publish quite soon 
 people in somerset many of they with disability be be transition from employment and support allowance to universal credit they be assure that they would not lose out but constituent wait month with no income at all until an intervention by i and the department somerset be not warn about this transition which be cause it huge difficulty with assess the implication for council tax benefit what step will the minister take to ensure that just as people be tell they will not lose out in the transition to universal credit 
 i be not sure why the news of the transition do not reach somerset the plan have be quite well publicise we have put in place a careful enhance support journey for people include a number of people on esa who might struggle with the transition the hon gentleman raise a particular case but if there be other case where there be difficulty we be able to provide extra support to ensure that people can make the transition without hardship 
 how many people be in receipt of carer ’s allowance 
 some people be be pay carer ’s allowance in england and wales include some people in the hon member ’s constituency 
 we all know that carer give everything to care for their love one physically emotionally and financially the government receive the carer ’s allowance report month ago and under lib dem pressure have agree to publish it by the end of the year do we know how many carer will be unfairly penalise in the month between the government receive the report and publish it 
 i agree with the hon member ’s characterisation of the degree of commitment and sacrifice be make by very large number of carer right across the country as he have say the report which we commission from liz sayce will be publish by the end of the year together with the government ’s response and his question will be address in that response 
 what step he be take to support young people into employment education or training 
 when we come to office almost young people be not in education employment or training this government be determined to offer young people proper opportunity our youth guarantee will ensure that to year old be learn or earn help to prevent they from become economically inactive almost before their career have even begin as my hon friend might have see the chancellor have announce that a job guarantee scheme will be a future part of this work 
 with in young scot not in education employment or training include hundred across my constituency i welcome the government ’s youth guarantee to give young people the training or job support they need however with stubborn youth unemployment the scottish government ’s swingeing cut to the college sector and employer warn that scottish apprenticeship be less favourable than those in england how will the secretary of state work to ensure that young people across the uk can benefit from this government ’s ambition 
 not for the time we have to point out that the scottish government have benefit from the big financial settlement since the introduction of devolution it should not be too much to expect that at least a proportion of that should be spend on expand opportunity for young people in my hon friend ’s constituency and throughout scotland scotland have give so much to the world in creativity and innovation and it be absolutely critical that the next generation of young scot get the chance to do the same 
 skill bootcamp in cumbria have provide a great opportunity hour of training for young people in discipline as varied as cod scaffolding and project management the cost to deliver those bootcamp across the whole of cumbria be £ chicken feed compare with the benefit that those young people and their future employer get out of they what conversation have the secretary of state have with his friend in the treasury to ensure that that scheme be maintain and continue 
 i be always have conversation with my friend in the treasury i agree with the hon member that flexibility and some short course in the skill and training system be very important not everything have to be do accord to the exact same formula and recipe and short training course have a big part to play 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i welcome the secretary of state to his new job and wish he luck in it especially because with every day that pass under this government we see few people enjoy the chance to start a new job unemployment have go up month after month nearly young people be not in education employment or training because of this government ’s policy job tax and business red tape even the pensions minister ’s former think tank agree with i people all around the country be out look for work young people who want to get on in life and all those try to provide for their family so can the secretary of state tell we and they when he will get unemployment down 
 the hon lady have a short memory the government in which she serve preside over the big slowdown in living standard in recent memory and there be more people in work now than there be at the start of the year we will keep support young people into work and will change the system that we inherit which have the wrong incentive and a lack of support we be put both of those thing to right 
 no surprise there mr speaker the prime minister can put new face on the front bench but they still do not have the answer the right hon gentleman criticise the previous conservative government but we get unemployment down to a year low a record labour could only dream of the government do not want to be hold to account worse still the right hon gentleman know that what he be do will not work because the country be look down the barrel of more tax rise in next month ’s budget which will kill yet more job and opportunity   whether it be graduate look for their job or old people be make redundant people be cry out for a government who be on their side what will it take to get the chancellor to understand that it be business that create job not the government and do the right hon gentleman not agree that the more the chancellor damage the economy the big the welfare bill will get 
 since we come into office interest rate have be cut time help business and household accord to lloyds business confidence be at a year high and there be to be much more private investment include the £ announce during the recent state visit add to that the trade deal that the conservatives could not secure there be reason to be optimistic about the future of the economy and i hope the hon lady share they 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reduce the number of child in poverty 
 my right hon friend the secretary of state co chair the ministerial child poverty taskforce which be lead our work across government to develop the uk wide child poverty strategy which will be publish later this year we be consider all available lever to give every child the good start in life build on work that be already under way across all nation ahead of publication the government have already take action for the whole uk include introduce a fair repayment rate and improve the adequacy of the standard allowance of universal credit from april 
 the child poverty action group estimate that because of this government ’s policy especially the child cap more than child be drag into poverty every day that equate to almost child between now and the chancellor ’s autumn statement at the end of next month here be a lever as child poverty in scotland be fall why do the minister not finally listen to reason by scrap this cruel policy why be he wait why do he not just act now 
 this government be act now we have already announce that all child in family in england that be in receipt of universal credit will receive free school meal lift child out of poverty we have cap the cost of school uniform and introduce a new crisis and resilience fund our child maintenance service reform will lift child out of poverty and much more will be do when the child poverty taskforce report later this year 
 despite what those on the far right try to claim the cost of living crisis remain the main issue that people face way to really help struggle family would be to lift the child benefit cap that would lift hundred of thousand of child across the country out of poverty   include many in my constituency be it not the case that the forthcoming budget should announce that the child benefit cap will be scrap 
 my hon friend will understand that i be not go to make policy from the dispatch box what i would say to he as i have already say to   the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan be that all available lever be under consideration as part of our child poverty taskforce which will report later this year we will do what it take to bear down on child poverty there be many lever that we can look at use to do so we have pull some already and we will continue that work 
 i call the shadow minister 
 every member in this chamber share a commitment to lift people out of poverty especially child we just have different view on how to go about it child in workless household be nearly time more likely to live in poverty than those in household where adult work we know that work pay yet we on the conservative benches find ourselves surround by party that be just itch to scrap the child benefit cap resort to yet more sticking plaster like universal breakfast club to reduce uncomfortable figure without put in the hard work to tackle their cause do the minister share my concern that lift the child benefit cap will increase worklessness and can he guarantee that taxis will not go up in next month ’s budget for adult who work hard and make careful decision about family size in order to pay for the £ it will cost to lift that cap 
 i be stunned to hear that the fight that the opposition front benchers be choose to pick on this occasion be oppose universal free breakfast club when we know that well feed child have hungry mind interruption for those chirping from a sedentary position that be exactly what the shadow minister what i find even more staggering be the lecture from an opposition who leave almost people in this country economically inactive and around young people out of work they drag child into poverty when the last labour government lift out it be the last labour government who we will be take lesson from not the last tory 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i note that last year the new secretary of state for work and pensions say that it be open to debate as to whether the child limit be harmful i note also that this policy have be the most impactful in drive child more than of they into poverty will the minister acknowledge that the child limit be harmful and work with treasury colleague to overturn it 
 i be happy to acknowledge the finding of the child poverty action group which i think have put forward the statistic that the hon gentleman set out i remind he and all member of this house that this be not the only lever available to we and that all lever be under active consideration i also remind he   as i have remind other colleague of the step that this government have already take include the roll out of free school meal to all family in receipt of universal credit which alone will lift child out of poverty 
 what step he be take to ensure that skill provision meet the need of employer 
 the skill white paper which we publish last week will create more opportunity as i say in response to an early question my remit letter to skills england make clear the importance of work closely with employer employer have tell we that they want more flexibility in the apprenticeship levy so the growth and skill offer be deliver that with more foundation course and short course launch next year 
 at a recent roundtable meeting in my thornbury and yate constituency small business tell i about the particular challenge they face in deliver apprenticeship give that the secretary of state ’s department be now responsible for this important policy area what be he do to reform apprenticeship to make they easy for small and medium sized enterprise to deliver and what support will he provide so that more can do so 
 we want apprenticeship to be available to employer of all size we have reduce the length of time an apprenticeship need to take and i think we can go far with short course flexibility which should be particularly helpful to small and medium sized employer 
 i recently visit premier forest products in newport to learn more about the vocational training and employment opportunity that the business be offer to care experienced young school leaver in newport with some wonderful success story will the department look at the model that company be create and can the secretary of state say more about how the government be work with business to make sure that such opportunity be more accessible for people from all background include those who be care experienced 
 i be happy to look at the experience of that particular employer i enjoy a recent visit to a different part of south wales to open an opportunity hub which be aim precisely at get more young people into work particularly those who have be out of the labour market through long term sickness issue we want to support wales in do that and we have allocate an extra £ to this work over the come year 
 if he will take legislative step to ensure that company who previously provide indexation of pension right accrue before april but have since lapse reintroduce indexation from april 
 what step he be take to help tackle the potential impact of the lack of indexation on pre-1997 pensionable service in define benefit pension scheme on people affect 
 i obviously recognise the challenge face those without inflation protection particularly after the cost of living pressure of recent year and i think that recognition be share by member on both side of the house i meet a cross party group of mps early this year to discuss exactly this issue reform in the pension schemes bill give trustee more flexibility to share surplus in their db pension scheme with employer and to negotiate for member to benefit from any such sharing of surplus that could include discretionary increase to address the issue raise by my hon friend   the member for llanelli dame nia griffith 
 as a result of the effort of pensioner association we know that there have be unintended consequence of the pensions act which make it legal to stop payment of indexation to the pre-1997 pensioner of successful multinational such as m and hewlett packard enterprise who have be recruit with the promise of index link pension be now suffer hardship their pension have already be freeze for at least year despite healthy fund and trustee plea what will the minister do to stop this dishonourable practice so that these company deliver the financial security that they promise 
 i absolutely recognise the issue that my hon friend have raise any of we in that situation would want those pension increase to continue she be aware of the legal background but i should point out that scheme rule govern when inflation link increase can be pay they be not change retrospectively but the pensions regulator have spell out that trustee should consider those who be not receive inflation link increase when make their decision and should also consider the history of make such award particularly in some of the example that my hon friend have give as i have say i think that the provision in the pension scheme bill give trustee more power to argue for those increase 
 i have be contact by a constituent who along with her husband work for hewlett packard they accrue their pension before and now along with about member of the pre-97 alliance they be face real financial hardship in year time their pension will be pretty much worthless will the minister not consider legislate to ensure that these people be not leave in poverty have be promise proper pension when they start work for the company concern 
 the hon lady have mention a specific company although a small number of other be in the same position i be sure that not only the people run that company but the trustee will have hear the powerful case make by member on both side of the house these decision must be make in line with the scheme rule but no want saver to see the value of their pension fall over time and i hope that employer will take the case be make in the chamber seriously 
 what assessment he have make of trend in the level of child poverty in cornwall 
 it be unacceptable that of child in cornwall be live in relative poverty we will set out measure to tackle its structural and root cause in our child poverty strategy later in the year 
 child poverty can not be tackle if child have nowhere safe to live of the most shameful legacy of the last tory government be cornwall be leave with more than child live in temporary accommodation while only of home be now affordable to family receive the local housing allowance what assessment have the minister make of the extent to which that shortfall in affordable home be drive child poverty rate even higher and what urgent step will he take to reverse it 
 the hon gentleman be right to highlight the appalling living standard and condition in which some child and indeed some member of the broad population find themselves live my advice to any liberal democrat member would of course be to stop block the home that we so desperately need let i also remind the hon gentleman that this government have invest £ in the delivery of social and affordable home because unlike the liberal democrats the labour party be determined to tackle the housing crisis and to build baby build 
 rise 
 order this be a cornish question and i be call perran moon so i ask other please not to stand 
 meur ra mr speaker 
 i represent the most deprived constituency in cornwall which be itself of the most deprived area in northern europe child poverty shoot up under the conservatives today our local further education college cornwall college rat outstanding by ofsted be turn away young learner in construction and engineering because of a lack of space the college have a solution allow it to expand but will the secretary of state meet i to discuss the issue and help our amazing young people to break this cycle of deprivation 
 i be sorry to hear of the situation that my hon friend have outline if the secretary of state be unable to meet he i would be more than happy to do so 
 what recent progress he have make on establish the youth guarantee trailblazer scheme 
 the trailblazer be up and run and have be deliver support for young people since early this year that include for example mental health support and flexible work experience session we have extend the programme for a further year bring the total funding to £ the insight from those trailblazer will inform the national roll out of our youth guarantee 
 do my right hon friend agree that the action of this government in support young people be in stark contrast to the situation in scotland where we have have year of snp neglect with the college sector suffer a cut over the past year do he also agree that as the energy sector in scotland transition to green form of energy production the job and skill need to bolster that industry could be teach at those college and that we risk have a double whammy of young people not be able to take on these important job while lecturer be pay off and our college be in dire financial strait 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to the importance of the energy transition as i say the scottish government be receive the large spending review settlement in real term since devolution be establish we know that young people in scotland have the talent but be their government back they by give they the opportunity we believe that a proportion of those fund should be devoted to that i be pleased to say that for example bae systems will be a major beneficiary of the £ deal to build type frigate for norway a critical investment in european security and that i hope the scottish government have get around to support 
 i welcome the secretary of state to his place and wish he well in his new role i be quite confident that he will give we all the answer we wish to have northern ireland continue to have a high proportion of young people not in employment education or training some to 13%—compared with the uk average so what discussion have he have with the relevant minister in northern ireland to ensure that the necessary support and opportunity be provide to young people in northern ireland 
 there should be no part of the united kingdom in which we do not give young people the maximum opportunity i have a good work relationship with the northern ireland executive in my previous post and i hope to have a good work relationship with they in this post with the share agenda of give our young people the well possible chance in life 
 what step his department be take to ensure that benefit sanction be proportionate when consider neurodiverse claimant 
 work coach be require to tailor work relate requirement to claimant capability and circumstance and they can pause they if that be appropriate 
 my constituent ross have neurodiversitie and be in employment work at a garden centre but his income be supplement by universal credit after inadvertently miss a telephone appointment with a job coach he be sanction lose out on month worth of rent and he risk be make homeless and lose his job if his parent have not be there to step in can the minister assure folk such as ross that they will be power up by our benefit system not punish when they make innocent mistake 
 we certainly do want the system to support people such as ross if work relate requirement be miss the reason for that should be ask for with day allow for an answer there should also be a pre referral check before a sanction referral take place if the hon gentleman would like to send i the detail of what happen in that particular case i will happily look into it 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 i be very conscious of the responsibility of the department which touch million of life in this country every month we have join up skill and employment support in the department to bring the skill system close to the labour market and as part of our youth guarantee we have announce that it will include a backstop job guarantee together with that and connect to work we be both tackle the incentive in the system and provide critical support because my priority be to have a welfare state that look after people when time be tough but also provide a platform of opportunity to help get they out of welfare and into work 
 at the conservative party conference the shadow chief secretary to the treasury call for the state pension to be mean test this have cause deep concern to pensioner in monmouthshire who have work hard all their life and build up modest saving under the conservative party ’s plan they would risk lose their state pension will the secretary of state confirm that under this labour government the state pension will remain available to all 
 i be happy to say that what my hon friend say about means testing be not the government ’s policy but can the conservatives confirm whether it be theirs the shadow chief secretary let the cat out of the bag can she confirm that this be not her policy or be it that her leader still stick to the position she set out early this year when she say 
 we be go to look at means testing 
 be they still look at it or be they not 
 the good thing be that the government be only responsible for their own problem i call the shadow secretary of the state 
 indeed question be to be answer by the government on this occasion 
 the right hon gentleman have an important and not always easy job i be sure that we all remember the fiasco before the summer when the government try to make welfare saving and end up legislate for welfare spending since then the prime minister have say that there be a clear moral case for welfare cut and the chancellor have say that she can not leave welfare untouched do the secretary of state agree 
 i notice that the hon lady do not want to clarify the position on mean test the state pension welfare reform be happen all the time we pass important change to the universal credit system that be vote through by the house and as i say we be put in place important employment support to help not only long term sick and disabled people but young people into work through many of the policy that i have talk about today 
 i can not help but notice that the secretary of state continue to attempt to deflect from his job of answer the question the fact be we just hear that he will not commit to make the welfare saving that his prime minister and his chancellor have say they need to make i think the prime minister be mean to be in charge 
 get people off welfare and into work not only save money it be morally wrong to condemn people to a life on benefit without welfare reform this country be stick on labour ’s break record of high taxis and low growth we have even offer to help the secretary of state so why will he not commit to make welfare saving 
 we inherit a situation that have people inactive and almost people not in employment education or training we be put in place critical employment support to help long term sick and disabled people into work we have change the incentive through legislation on the universal credit system and we be increase the number of face to face check in the system which fall on the conservatives watch what do people think it fall by do we think it fall by do we think it fall by no it fall by under the system over which the hon lady ’s government preside 
 many other hon member have today outline the prove track record of access to work in enable disabled constituent to access employment in addition to the challenge pose by the current shortfall in funding some £ worth of additional employment support funding have be announce this year can the minister reassure the house that access to work remain of the potential avenue for that funding 
 demand for access to work have rise sharply i mention early that spending go up by over the past year but i do not think access to work can replace a well design support programme that be what we be determined to put in place and the   department ’s new independent disability advisory panel will help we work out the good approach to employment support 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the government have make a promise that those transfer from legacy benefit to universal credit will find themselves no worse off yet liberal democrat colleague from all over the country be find that people be bad off will the minister share evidence of how the government be support the most vulnerable where they find themselves bad off 
 transitional protection be available for people make the transition across and i speak early about the support be provide through the enhanced support journey to people for whom the transition may be particularly difficult i be think for example about some people on employment and support allowance if the hon member be worried about particular case and would like to send i the detail i be very happy to look at they 
 for too long too many people in the north east have be leave behind due to stubbornly high unemployment but the economic inactivity trailblazer offer an opportunity to tackle the often complex reason that sit behind that can the secretary of state set out how this will work alongside exist programme such as the new deal for north east worker to support people into fulfil productive employment 
 people should not be deny the opportunity to work which be why the department have back the economic inactivity trailblazer in the north east with £ this year and a furth £ next year it be test new way to help people overcome barrier to work we be determined to turn around the situation that we inherit from the conservative party and we be work closely with the excellent mayor of the north east to bring these policy together 
 only of people with autism be in work compare with nearly of disabled people charlie who be celebrate his birthday on saturday live in baltonsborough with his parent but like many young adult with autism he have struggle to find employment his mother jenny tell i yesterday that charlie be a classic example of waste talent so what step be the minister take to ensure that adult with autism and other special educational need can find fulfilling and secure employment 
 the hon member raise an important point and i agree about the importance of not waste talent in the future that be the reason for the reform we be introduce early this year we set up an expert panel to advise we on how good to support people with neurodivergence into employment build on the work of sir robert buckland and his review of autism employment in the last parliament we have now receive that advice from the expert panel and be consider how to take that work forward 
 i still have parent in my constituency come to i because they be not get the money their child need constituent report her ex repeatedly self declare employment until the child maintenance service catch up with they switch on to benefit for a few month drop to £ a week and then return to self employment to restart that cycle online forum openly trade tip about how to avoid child maintenance what will the minister do to close these loophole and ensure that every child get the support they need 
 i thank my hon friend for his question the government plan to consult on change to the calculation that will automatically capture more income type within that calculation where parent wilfully avoid their financial obligation the cms financial investigation unit do have the power to act and will investigate child maintenance be key to keep child out of poverty and we will use these power wherever necessary 
 the year old son of of my constituent unfortunately lose his leg when it be amputate above the knee after a motorcycle accident but he be award personal independence payment and a specially adapt car and he have be able to rebuild his life however in august he be tell that the pip and the adapt car would be withdraw from he sadly he be clearly not go to get any well how can we be in a situation where people whose condition be permanent be have their support withdraw 
 i would be very happy to look into the particular case the hon member raise of course an appeal process be available so i hope that her constituent have submit an appeal if she let i have the detail i will gladly have a look at the case 
 early this month i visit the spear programme in north kensington which be do fantastic work in support young people back into employment through programme that the dwp datum lab have find to have a significant impact could the secretary of state outline how evidence produce by unit such as the data lab will help guide the trailblazer funding to get young people back into work 
 the spear programme be of the organisation to go through an evaluation with the datum lab a few year ago i be pleased to tell my hon friend that the finding from that be really positive and i be delighted that his constituency be locate in of the youth guarantee trailblazer area as we have reiterate several time it be crucial that we do everything we can to help young people into work and address the issue which we inherit of people not in employment education or training 
 many young care leaver live in supported housing want to increase their hour at work but find themselves catch in the benefit trap ymca eastleigh tell i that this   be impact care leaver in my constituency what recent discussion have the minister have with cabinet colleague on reform to the tax and benefit system to make work pay for young care leaver 
 there be a problem in the interaction between housing benefit which provide housing support for people in supported accommodation and housing support in the universal credit system that interaction do cause difficulty and i think that be what the hon lady be refer to we be look at that at the moment we be talk to other part of government and work with people such as ymca and centrepoint to look at the problem and what we can do to fix it 
 many of my constituent be experience delay in migrating to universal credit due to year of tory mismanagement of our welfare system this be a stressful time for claimant and a very busy time for the department will my right hon friend outline what step the department be take to ensure it be fully resource so that delay be reduce and claim be process 
 the department be prioritise ensure that there be adequate staffing resource available to support claimant and deliver migration smoothly and on time i be concerned to hear what my hon friend say about the experience of his constituent in coatbridge and bellshill i will look into this issue far on his behalf and report back to he 
 the trussell trust recently report that in people who be refer to food bank in be in work household and that the majority be on universal credit what more can the government do to ensure that work pay and we can take low pay worker out of poverty 
 i recently speak at an event in parliament host by that organisation i be pleased to say that its report say there have be a small drop in the use of food bank over the past year we have put the household support fund now the crisis and resilience fund on a proper basis for the next year to support those family in the most desperate need 
 give sick and disabled people agency and draw on live experience set the only path to get policy right so that they can access work appointment and get out of their home avoid worklessness health decline and isolation with their mobility support need recognise through pip far to the minister ’s previous answer will he ensure that any policy reform to pip mobility payment be fully co produce with sick and disabled people 
 i can reassure my hon friend that the review of the pip assessment include the mobility element of that benefit will be undertake fully in co production with disabled people and disabled people ’s organisation i will be set out very shortly how the review i be go to be lead will be undertake 
 business be cry out that the employment rights bill will cost job now the tony blair institute for global change the spiritual home of the secretary of state   laughter.]—says it will cripple the job market especially for young people it be not a laugh matter what be the secretary of state ’s view will the employment rights bill help his department to increase employment or will it cost even more job 
 it should be no surprise that a labour party support well right at work for people history be replete with warning that well employment right would result in few job those be the warning the conservative party give when we introduce the national minimum wage many many year ago of course it be important that when legislate on these issue we do it closely in consultation with employer that be precisely what we intend to do 
 some of child in my constituency live in poverty the minister mention that he will consider all lever do that include speak with the treasury to look at a wealth tax to bring in much need money to the treasury to remove the child cap 
 as we have discuss a number of time of course we want to reduce child poverty my hon friend will not be surprised to hear that when it come to tax that be a matter for the chancellor and not for i 
 i welcome the secretary of state to his place and wish he well last week i attend a drop in for the women against state pension inequality campaign where i be inform that there be currently woman in dewsbury and batley affect by the waspi scandal that number be previously high but many of the woman have already pass away without justice on   july   i write to the former secretary of state regard her support for the waspi campaign after be contact by more than of my constituent but i have yet to receive a response with the government still refuse to engage in civil mediation to deliver justice to the waspi woman will the new secretary of state reconsider meet campaigner to find a just way forward 
 the previous minister for pensions meet representative of the waspi campaign in order to hear directly from they about their experience she be the minister to do so in year i will look into the detail of the letter the hon gentleman mention 
 i welcome the secretary of state to his office and thank the under secretary of state for work and pensions my hon friend   the member for stretford and urmston andrew western for a recent visit to the dwp debt and fraud centre in my constituency there be job at the centre do tremendous work across the uk prove that civil service job dispersal do work be this not a template for other departments and an example to the snp government in scotland who have disperse no job no power and no fund from edinburgh 
 i endorse everything my hon friend have say i have a fantastic visit to the very beautiful constituency that he be fortunate enough to represent    where i see exactly what can happen through our place for growth initiative which look to relocate job out of london and into place such as stornoway 
 i have meet many pensionable age constituent most of whom live on the duck estate who have lose their entitlement to pension credit because of as little as 50p do the minister agree that pension credit the employment and support allowance and pip assistance could all do with more common sense and a little less of a computer say no mentality 
 i thank the hon lady for her question in general lot of life could do with less computer say no so on that basis we will agree on the specific of the question she raise about pension credit the nature of the system be obviously that it provide a guarantee level of income it be not set out an entitlement like universal credit so there do have to be a limit somewhere and i be afraid that that do mean that some people will always be on side of it what we do not want to see in a system be too many thing in that winner take all perspective i take the point she raise 
 i recently visit drake hall woman ’s prison in my constituency of stafford eccleshall and the village which have the brilliant initiative of a halfords training centre to support people into employment once they leave the prison estate it support people all over the country not just in my constituency can the secretary of state tell i what conversation be happen with the ministry of justice about support or expand scheme like that 
 that sound like an excellent initiative of course if we be to rehabilitate prisoner it be important that they get training and the chance to get into constructive employment after their sentence i be sure that that apply not just to the prison in my hon friend ’s constituency but throughout the country 
 alan marnes be a constituent of mine in southoe who have staunchly campaign since on the issue of the lack of indexation for pre-1997 pension right have be of people who lose their occupational pension   i write to the secretary of state more than month ago ask whether the newly revive pensions commission will address the issue of fail pension fund and i have still not receive a response will the secretary of state agree to meet i and alan to provide some much need clarity on such a long stand issue 
 i be not absolutely clear whether the particular case that the hon gentleman be raise relate to people within the pension protection fund and the financial assistance scheme or to a pre-1997 indexation within a solvent pension scheme but if he write to i with the detail i will absolutely make sure that i come back to he 
 in child in my constituency be grow up in poverty with the budget approach what discussion have the secretary of state have with the chancellor of the exchequer about scrap the child limit a policy widely recognise as of the big driver of child poverty in britain today 
 we have already take action to reduce child poverty by extend free school meal to all family on universal credit and we will of course explore other avenue we want to reduce child poverty in stark contrast to the record of the conservatives 
 when my constituent move into new social housing they find it strip of perfectly good white good curtain carpet and so on what can the government do to address this it be drive my constituent far into poverty and benefit dependency it be also environmentally destructive surely there be a way through this issue so can i call on the minister to work with other across government to address it 
 the right hon gentleman raise an important issue it might be well raise at question to the ministry of housing communities and local government but as he ask i to pick this up with ministers across departments i be happy to do so i can tell he that the crisis and resilience fund formerly the household support fund be in place to support people set up in their new home as be grant that be available from housing association directly 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net if he will make a statement on the future of the north sea oil and gas industry 
 the north sea will be at the heart of britain ’s energy future for decade its worker business and community have help to power our country and our world and they will do so for decade to come the oil and gas industry have lose around a of its entire workforce in the last decade as oil and gas production have decline a plan be now need that be why in march we consult on a framework for build a world lead offshore clean energy industry in the north sea alongside manage exist oil and gas field for their lifespan we will respond to that consultation in the come week 
 alongside that we publish our clean energy job plan which set out that over more good job be to be create across the uk include in scotland by the end of the decade that be facilitate thank to record investment in clean energy as well as over £ of private investment since july thank to the certainty our plan have create 
 turn to today ’s news colleague will be aware that petrofac ltd have for some time be work on a restructure relate to its global portfolio the restructuring plan fail follow the unexpected termination of a contract by tennet a dutch transmission company at am today hold company petrofac ltd announce that it will be enter administration while that be obviously disappointing for the company it be the product of long stand issue with its global business 
 contrary to mislead report today the uk arm of petrofac have not enter administration and be continue to operate as normal as an in demand business with a highly skilled workforce and many successful contract indeed only last month petrofac ’s uk arm extend significant contract demonstrate that the business have a viable future today ’s announcement cover only the top level hold company petrofac ltd which have no employee the petrofac group have face long stand challenge include a high profile £ financial penalty impose in follow a serious fraud office investigation into bribery 
 we understand that there be reason to be optimistic about a commercial resolution that include the uk arm the government have be and will remain in close contact with the company i repeat this to the house the uk business have not enter administration it be successful and grow and it will continue to operate as normal 
 another week and yet another hammer blow to our north sea oil and gas industry another gut punch to energy worker and another blow to our energy security whatever the minister say today the blame lie squarely with this labour government interruption they do not like to hear it but it be true 
 today the energy giant petrofac have enter administration cast doubt over the future of its employee in scotland as its global headquarters be in aberdeen and the countless more who be support indirectly through the supply chain as the minister say this company have have issue for many year but the hostile environment in the uk continental shelf create by the government have make operate here nigh on impossible for far too many company 
 our offshore energy industry have see thousand of redundancy since the general election harbour energy complete a new round of redundancy just last month and with depress regularity we hear of more job loss in the north sea whether at harbour energy apache hunting or petrofac each job lose mean uncertainty for a family a mortgage jeopardised investment flee our community and our world class supply chain and skilled workforce push towards extinction 
 how many more will it take for the secretary of state to change course these be political choice this be a manufacture decline as a direct result of the hostile trading environment the closed for business sign be hang over the uk continental shelf from the energy profit levy extension increase to the ban on new licence and the refusal to defend the government ’s decision on rosebank and jackdaw the odd be stack against the north sea industry damage the business environment threaten investment harm our economy and undermine our energy security these be political choice that have result in job loss 
 what step be be take to support petrofac ’s hq employee in aberdeen how many more job have to be lose across the industry for the government to change course when will the thousand of job promise through gb energy for aberdeen and around the united kingdom materialise will the minister personally act and ask his boss the secretary of state for energy to change course or be he content to sacrifice aberdeen the north east and our energy industry on this vainglorious campaign to destroy our fossil fuel industry 
 on petrofac the hon gentleman should be careful with his tone to come here and try to undermine effort to find a buyer for the uk arm and to talk down a business which as i just outline be a successful and grow business in the north sea be deeply irresponsible there have be long stand issue at the company he of all people should be well aware of that give his previous role as a minister in the department for energy security and net all of we across the house have a responsibility to support the company at the moment not to undermine it and to send a positive message to those worker the supplier and the customer that the uk arm be continue to operate as normal all the sign be that there be a viable long term future for the company but that will not happen if we have comment like those make by the hon gentleman undermine that business 
 on the wide question of the north sea the hon gentleman should know as well as anyone that we lose over a of the job in the north sea during the conservative party ’s time in government he want to pretend that the transition arrive in july but he be in government when those job be go and the conservatives fail time and again to come up with   any credible plan for manage the future of the north sea we will not do that we will come up with a plan that be why we be build the industry of the future on hydrogen on carbon capture on offshore wind and on the supply chain the very investment that he and conservative members turn their back against time and again they be turn their back on the future of the energy story in the north sea as they be more interested in exploit problem than solve they time and again they have learn no lesson from their time in government when they leave these worker without a credible plan we will not do the same again 
 will my hon friend outline to the house how the government be deliver the clean energy job plan which will see new job in the clean energy industry in scotland by i be sure that move will be welcome around the chamber will he advise we what support will be give to that plan by the scottish government 
 my hon friend make an important point about build up the industry of the future i have say on a number of occasion that we should rightly be proud of decade of oil and gas in the north east of scotland and we should be proud of the work that that workforce have achieve but we should also recognise that we have be in transition for a long time build up the job of the future in carbon capture hydrogen offshore wind and supply chain be how we ensure a long term viable sustainable future in the north east alongside oil and gas for many decade to come 
 the particular work that the scottish government need to do in this space be about improve the skill offer so that more of scotland ’s young people can take up the job we will create over the come year that be a huge opportunity for scotland ’s young people but only if we improve scotland ’s education system 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 this be worry news petrofac be of the north sea ’s large offshore contractor but it be enter administration today after year of financial difficulty while i can not share the desire of   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   to ditch the climate change act i do share his concern for those job in scotland and those worker who face uncertainty about their future so the secretary of state must act swiftly to find a sustainable path forward hopefully secure a buyer and safeguard those skilled job 
 this underline why the liberal democrats have call for an independent just transition commission put oil and gas worker and local community front and centre it be good to see the much await publication of the government ’s clean energy job plan last week however we know that job creation be not happen fast enough to keep up with job loss in the north sea so can the secretary of state and the minister confirm what will be do to fill that gap in the meantime in the short term and to deliver a genuinely just transition that keep those skilled worker power britain ’s clean energy future 
 can i just say what a contrast it be when someone rightly respond to this concern issue in a serious way and do not talk down the industry this be where the house should stand tall and recognise that that company be do good work and that there be worker out in the north sea right now carry out their duty we want to ensure that there be a viable future for the company and we be do everything that we can in that space all the sign be that it be a grow successful business and we should recognise that and talk it up not talk it down as the conservative party seem hellbent on do 
 on the hon lady ’s wide point she be right to say that the future of clean energy involve ten of thousand of job across scotland and hundred of thousand across the uk but that we need to ramp those job up as quickly as possible and ensure that people can achieve those job we be do what we can around look at the skill framework but we also ensure that through the investment we be make through great british energy those job come forward much fast and that people be support to move from job in oil and gas into job that have a real correlation in skill we be pick this work up after the failure of the previous government to have any plan we be move as fast as we can and we will see more on that north sea plan in the come week 
 i have to say that this be a very underpowered urgent question it be similar to a stroke engine attach to a rowing boat—[interruption 
 order when i decide on an urgent question i do not need to be question about how urgent it be or whether it be like a stroke engine or a cc actually some of we think it might be a litre 
 i be of course refer to the shadow minister   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie who know full well that he have miss the story here petrofac go into administration because the dutch government cut a contract for offshore wind farm development i dare say that that raise concern about the viability for finance and the supply chain for the offshore wind farm industry but as the minister have point out and as the shadow minister well know petrofac be successful in the uk it have job in the uk and it have contract in the uk so we need less scaremongere from this underpowered opposition and more assurance from the minister that he will look after those job 
 i will just reflect on something that my hon friend say this be a global company and it have not have its trouble to seek for some time it be subject to an investigation back in and it have go through a number of restructuring route since then ultimately that process come to an end when it lose a significant contract from tennet of the dutch transmission operator this be a company that have face global headwind for some time but i repeat to the house that the uk business have a viable long term future it be already grow it be successful and we have a responsibility across this house to talk up british business and the worker in those job not to talk they down 
 may i convey in the strong possible term to the junior minister the anger and anxiety that be feel by my constituent in aberdeen right now they be provide energy security to each and every of we on these isle as well as revenue to his treasury yet their only reward and the only certainty they seem to have on this government ’s watch be that of loom job loss may i ask—[interruption he shake his head may i ask he to come to aberdeen and explain to my constituent when he be go to listen to the trade union the academic the worker and the industry and protect that industry not only for our energy security but for scotland ’s economy 
 i be in aberdeen regularly and do meet constituent of the right hon member who work in renewable carbon capture and hydrogen as well as in oil and gas it be his constituent who will benefit from the investment that great british energy will make for example which he fail to vote for and who tell i that after a long period of have no credible plan—[interruption he can shout i down all he want he ask a question 
 order i bring   the right hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn   in early because i think that be right for his constituent and because he have apply for an uq but i do expect a little respect even if he do not like the answer 
 the right hon member ask a serious question and i be try to give he an answer if he would but listen for a few moment we take the issue of job loss seriously of course we do but we have to recognise that over job have be lose over the past year because there have not be a credible plan on the future of the north sea we be go to deliver that alongside new job in the energy future 
 i also say to the right hon member that i be somewhat confused what the snp ’s policy be on this because as far as i understand it it be exactly the same as this government ’s policy which be to look at the licensing position if he be tell we now that the snp ’s position have change that be news to i and i suspect to the house but of course the snp have not publish the draft energy strategy which have be in draft form for year so it be hard for anyone to know 
 what step be the minister take to ensure that the uk arm of the company which be an in demand business with a highly skilled workforce and many successful contract have a long term future in the uk particularly in the context of our clean energy job plan announce last week and as my hon friend   the member for na h eileanan an iar torcuil crichton   point out some of the risk around the development of offshore wind in holland 
 we have obviously be liaise with the company over quite a long period of time on the restructuring indeed the previous government do as well we have be look at this issue and will continue to work very closely with the company to ensure that there be a viable long term future for the uk part but it be an in demand business and as i say just last month it expand some of its contract which   show that it be successful of course it have a highly skilled workforce work in a huge range of job right across oil and gas 
 the wide question about investment into renewable be also that we should take seriously we have a huge opportunity in the united kingdom to capitalise on the economic opportunity that come from offshore and onshore wind hydrogen and carbon capture but that require consistency and a view that the uk be a safe place to invest thing that be threaten by the conservatives 
 anyone who have meet business in aberdeen will know that they rely on the oil and gas sector this labour government ’s net at all cost policy be a disaster for high quality skill and job in the north east and across scotland what urgent action will the government take to restore confidence and stability in the energy sector 
 i reject the hon member ’s assertion that this government be somehow follow a course without look at the evidence clearly oil and gas be a crucial part of our energy mix and will be for decade to come we have be clear on that but so too be build up what come next that mean invest in the supply chain that be so often not part of the building of infrastructure that we have in our water we tow thing in and switch they on but have none of the job that go with they we be determined to change that but that come with have a credible industrial strategy and a long term plan for the future of the north sea which we do not have under year of the previous government 
 incredibly it be now month since the prime minister announce £ from the national wealth fund for the industrial future of grangemouth i have have meeting with numerous company that have proposal and be frankly impatient to get start when will this money be spend and when will those job come to my town all there be to show for it so far be the bone of an unjust transition and industrial devastation 
 we have be look at a number of proposal i meet the company that be the frontrunner for national wealth fund investment along with the scottish government energy minister a number of proposition be to be take forward and i hope we will have an announcement to make in due course of course we have be try not to just spend £ on the thing that come along but to find the genuinely long term viable industrial opportunity that deliver job at grangemouth not just for a year or but long into the future the hon gentleman be right that for far too long the site have be the victim of a lack of planning and it be an example of a just transition do wrongly we want to make that different by have a serious plan for long term job on the site the nwf have bring company to the table and we will deliver an announcement on that in due course 
 i accept the minister ’s comment about petrofac but it be a very worrying day not just for the worker whose job   be at stake but for the entire oil economy in north east scotland thing be miss that we desperately need in scotland be investment in the job and skill that we will need for the renewable industry the minister talk about and the other be the reform of the taxation system and the windfall tax to ensure that it be consistent for the north sea area what be the government go to do about those thing 
 the hon lady be of course right that any announcement like this be worry not only for those directly involved but for the wide community i entirely recognise that point she be right that it be critical to invest in the job of the future we have work with the scottish government because we do work with they to deliver joint funding for transition support so that worker can get the direct skill support they need to move from an oil and gas job into a renewable job that be really important but we also need to see much more upskilling of the next generation who can take advantage of the job we will create in the clean energy of the future on the question of taxation i be afraid that be a matter for the chancellor 
 my constituency include small and medium sized enterprise and large business that work in renewable oil and gas solar onshore wind and offshore wind do the minister agree that some of the outburst today from opposition members both conservative and snp will do nothing but undermine confidence for those company furthermore can he please reassure i that he be work extensively with college and employer in scotland to ensure that we see a skill transition from oil and gas into renewable so that people in my constituency can take full opportunity of the investment that the government be make 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that huge opportunity be come i have say that we should be proud of the history of oil and gas and we should also be really proud of what the industry be do to transition into the future we need to do much more to ensure that job be deliver now but certainty and confidence that the plan be not go to change overnight be critical for how we get private sector investment into the uk to deliver on those job that be also why it be so important that we look at skill in the round 
 i have to say that despite the outburst today the snp in holyrood and the uk government be work closely on ensure that the skill opportunity be deliver would i like that to go far of course i would and i hope we will have a change of government and can make that happen this only work if we have a serious approach to recognise the challenge build the job of the future and ensure that people can take advantage of the opportunity right across scotland 
 we urgently need to restore confidence and stability in our oil and gas sector or we will be here again and again as more and more business suffer and more and more job be lose whether in my constituency across north east scotland in scotland as a whole or in the uk as a whole there be oil and gas and energy job everywhere in the uk   the future of petrofac ’s skilled and expert staff as well as the indirect job that rely on they be now at risk and reliant on petrofac be able to find a buyer for its north sea asset do the minister think that the job of find a buyer have be make more or less likely give that the government have create in the industry ’s word the most unstable fiscal environment in the world 
 i have enormous respect for the hon lady but i have to say that this be not the day to be talk down this particular company she can make the wide point about this government ’s policy i totally recognise that but this be a hugely important moment in which not to undermine a successful and grow company we need to ensure that the supplier related company and customer of petrofac continue to support that business because as of today it be operate as normal it be incumbent on we all to ensure that that continue to be the case we be work closely with the company to ensure that that outcome be deliver the hon lady be right to mention the wide impact but those job and the supply chain job that rely on they have continue as normal today and any suggestion to the contrary be just not correct 
 do my hon friend agree that it be important to speak responsibly with care and accuracy about the successful uk arm of petrofac to do otherwise will only serve to undermine the business and job security that we all want to see across the house what step be he take to ensure that it have a long term future in the uk 
 i rightly expect to be challenge in the house on the government ’s policy a strong back and forth exchange be important in this instance however and separate from any view that member might have on the wide policy of this government it be important that we come together where we can and say that this be a strong successful grow company it be in all our interest across the house to talk up the importance of that company ’ continue to be successful so that a buyer or another commercial resolution be find and those job can be maintain that be surely in all our interest 
 every single of we have be criticise government policy not criticise petrofac the expertise and worker at petrofac or any of the worker in our oil and gas industry the minister say that he have be spend time in aberdeen do he have any idea how it feel to be in aberdeen just now with another hammer blow come and it be because of the government ’s policy it be because there be this massive gap skilled worker in the oil and gas industry will just go abroad they will go elsewhere it do not matter whether we retrain they the job be not there for they right now what be he go to do to plug that gap what will he do to keep these skilled worker in scotland in aberdeen and in these island and not drive they away 
 i take the hon lady ’s point with a pinch of salt after her point that this come as a hammer blow to the community there be no hammer blow those job have be protect today worker be wake up and do the same job they be do last week
