my hon friend name a fantastic business in his constituency and the contribution that it make there be a lot more that we need to do to support small employer to be in a strong position to benefit from apprenticeship 
 this bill will bring together the many disparate part of a very fragmented system which employer particularly small employer often find hard to navigate the right way through and be not always clear about the good training and qualification route in order to find the people that they need also the change we have make to english and math in particular will support employer to create additional apprenticeship every single year this be a call that we hear loud and clear from employer and it be a simple straightforward change that will open up opportunity for people across our country they will still have the english and math standard as part of their apprenticeship but they will no long be hold back by some of the red tape that have deny they the chance to get on in life 
 the skill system that we have right now be too fragmented too confusing and too tangle up across too many organisation there be no single source of truth no single organisation able to zoom out and see the big problem and no single authority able to bring the sector together to solve they the result be a system that amount to less than the sum of its part for young people it can be hard to know where the opportunity lie adult look to upskill or reskill and work people hop for a fresh start be too often meet with confusion not clarity they be present with a muddling mix of option when they need clear pathway to great career 
 it be no well for employer they tell we that the system be difficult to navigate and slow to respond they tell we that they be too often shut out of course design and that their voice be too often not hear the result be frustration learner and employer be frustrate and they be right to be frustrate many business do a good job of invest in the skill of their workforce but other simply be not spend enough 
 investment be at its low since at just half the eu average we must empower business to reverse the trend by invest in their employee and for that we need to move forward there will always remain a strong and galvanise role for competition but where it be harmful add complexity duplicate effort or twist incentive we will balance it with supportive co ordination to ensure that all part of the system be pull in the right direction 
 here be our vision and the change we need from sideline to support we need a system that help everyone so that business can secure the skilled workforce they need from fragmented to coherent we need a system define by clear and powerful pathway to success and towards effective co ordination we also need a system of partnership with everyone pull together towards the same goal that be the change that skills england will oversee 
 this labour government be a mission lead government with a plan for change and skill be essential to labour ’s mission to drive economic growth and break down the barrier to opportunity in fact skill go way beyond that skill training contribute across our society and great skill training drive by skills england support by my department guide by the wisdom of college university business mayor and trade union and direct by national priority and local community be the skill system we need it be a system that will drive forward all our mission it will help we fix our nhs create clean energy and deliver safe street 
 skill be the fuel that will drive a decade of national renewal which be vital for our plan for change that be why early this month we unveil our plan to help thousand more apprentice to qualify every year that mean more people with the right skill in high demand sector from social care to construction and beyond we have listen to what business have tell we we will shorten the minimum length of apprenticeship and put employer in charge of decision on english and math requirement for adult 
 last november the government announce £ of investment in homebuilding skill hub once fully up to speed the hub will deliver more than fast track apprenticeship a year help to build the extra home that the people of this country desperately need we be drive change for our skill system and skills england be lead the charge it will assess the skill need on the ground regionally and nationally now and in the year to come where skill evolve rapidly and where new and exciting technology be accelerate from ai to clean energy skills england will be ready to give employer the fast and flexible support they need 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of president trump ’s proposal to move palestinians from gaza to neighbour arab state 
 we do not support force displacement of palestinians or any reduction in the territory of the gaza strip palestinians must be able to live and prosper in the occupied palestinian territories that be why it be essential that we work together to ensure that all aspect of the ceasefire be implement and that it become permanent 
 it be very sad that the past month have mark a new and horrifying phase in the long history of attempt to ethnically cleanse the palestinian people from their homeland president trump ’s recent comment call for palestinians to be expel from their home in gaza in order for the us to take over the land along with his failure to rule out israeli annexation of the west bank constitute the most explicit denial of the palestinian people ’s right to self determination by any us administration to date will the foreign secretary therefore condemn president trump ’s remark and set out what action the uk government be take to prevent far force displacement of the palestinian people 
 this house have watch with horror the loss of life in the gaza strip particularly and the plight of the hostage hold in bunker under gaza the us play a pivotal role and all credit should go to president trump for brokering that negotiate ceasefire agreement i be thankful for the role that the israeli government qatar and egypt play in get to that ceasefire it be our belief and this be a cross party belief that there should be a negotiate state solution a sovereign palestinian state which include of course the west bank and gaza alongside a safe and secure israel 
 i have just be out in the middle east with the conservative friends of israel i put that on the record before i ask my question 
 give emily damari ’s personal testimony to the prime minister that she be hold at united nations relief and works agency facility in gaza during the conflict and that her captor refuse her access to medical treatment do the foreign secretary stand by the government ’s decision to restart send uk taxpayer money to unrwa when hamas terrorist be hold british hostage at its facility and when it have be crystal clear for month that unrwa have many member of hamas in its rank include people involve in the   october   terrorist attack who have hold hostage ever since 
 i think we be all pleased to see emily damari emerge of course we have be in touch with the damari family as the right hon gentleman would expect we have also be in touch with unrwa the minister for development raise this issue with mr lazzarini directly which have instigate an investigation 
 the israeli force be now use the same tactic in the west bank as they use in gaza the forced displacement of community and the use of heavy weapon against civilian what be the government ’s response both to israel and to the un be it not time that we respond to the advisory opinion 
 my hon friend raise a serious issue as i have say repeatedly from the dispatch box i condemn the expansion and the violence that we have see over the last period and i reject the call for the annexation of the west bank i meet tom fletcher of the un recently to discuss these very same issue and renew our commitment to the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs that humanitarian work be important of course at this time i have be in touch with the israelis and with prime minister mustafa as we discuss these issue together 
 back on   october when the hospital in palestine be bomb the al ahli arab hospital much conversation be have about who could have commit such a heinous crime since then the israeli army have destroy all medical facility in gaza and now we have a president of the united states use gangster style intimidation to forcibly remove palestinian people from their land will the foreign secretary who have repeatedly refuse to call out the israeli government for the war crime they be commit refuse to ban all arm sale refuse to acknowledge that a genocide be happen and refuse even to consider economic sanction because £ be too high a price to pay accept the reality of the situation and accept that trump and netanyahu ’s plan propose ethnic cleansing of the palestinian people in gaza 
 we be well under time but i just need to get other member in 
 we be in the phase of a ceasefire that we want to hold and go to phase that be the issue i be discuss with arab leader last week at the munich security conference the quint group be work with president trump to get to that phase and the governance issue that will be so important with the palestinian authority involve in gaza 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 my thought continue to be with the hostage hold in gaza and the appalling suffering they and their family be face the world have see the brutality inflict by the iranian sponsor terrorist hamas who be a major obstacle to bring about a sustainable and just peace in the middle east the foreign secretary have previously agree that there can not be any future whatsoever for hamas control gaza can he provide an update on the action he have undertake to put an end to hamas control and ensure we get to the phase of the ceasefire will he discuss this issue when he go to america with the prime minister to meet the president of the united states 
 i can confirm that i discuss this issue with ron dermer from the israeli government last week i discuss this issue with arab leader the so call quint the week before in the end we can not have a gaza run by hamas all road lead back to hamas i think the world have look with horror at the scene of armed man wear bandana seem to glorify murder and hostage who have be hold of course we will act with international colleague to make sure that hamas have no role to play in the future of gaza 
 what progress his department have make on tackle hiv and aids globally 
 investment in the global fund unitaid unaids the joint un programme on hiv aids the world health organisation and other have help to cut new hiv infection by since and aids relate death by since i be pleased to meet hiv positive activist in parliament recently and to be videoe while undertake a quick and easy hiv test together we can eradicate hiv aids 
 the minister be aware that pepfar the us president ’s emergency plan for aids relief be the large and most successful global health programme and have save life it have be advise that freeze pepfar will result in few hiv test be carry out daily unaids predict that aids relate death will occur if pepfar lack funding for the next year can the minister ensure that the foreign office include hiv in all international discussion especially at the g7 in canada this year 
 test and treatment be critical i be pleased that the prime minister recently announce that together with south africa the uk will co host the replenishment of the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria the global fund be the lead financier of the global fight against hiv aids and we will work with canada to draw attention at the g7 to the importance of the global fund replenishment 
 what detail can the minister give we about the financing that will be give to the global fund more importantly there be a rumour that official development assistance be go to   be cut from to to cover an increase in defence spending can the minister confirm whether that be the case 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise the importance of funding for global health of course this be not just important for those directly impact it be important for we here in our country because we know that disease do not respect border i set out a few moment ago the fact that the prime minister be committed to that global fund replenishment and rightly so 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of step take by the british virgin islands to tackle illicit finance 
 the overseas territory include the british virgin islands work to uphold international standard on tax transparency and illicit finance and enforce uk sanction the overseas territory agree to implement corporate register that be accessible at least to those with legitimate interest by june we be aware of bvi ’s public consultation on its register and be work with it to improve its proposal 
 the bvi will soon close the consultation on its proposal to grant only limited access to a register of beneficial ownership that proposal mean that it will be virtually impossible for even a select few to trace those use the bvi as a place to secretly stash their cash and this come some year after the deadline to set up a register be miss i know that the secretary of state agree that sunlight be the good disinfectant when it come to combat illicit finance so what step be he take to ensure that the bvi establish a genuine and fully transparent register of beneficial ownership 
 the bvi commit at the joint ministerial council to improve access to its corporate register by june i meet bvi representative just after that time at the end of last year and my hon friend the minister of state will meet the bvi again in the come week it be important that that public consultation on the propose register will close this friday and we be work with the bvi to improve its proposal 
 the foreign secretary will be aware that under the sanctions and anti money laundering act the british virgin islands be oblige to introduce open register of beneficial ownership by the end of or be subject to an order in council it have not do so it be in contempt of parliament so when will the foreign secretary issue the order in council 
 i say to the right hon gentleman that if the agree requirement be not meet we will carefully consider what further step to take our expectation remain clear those register will ultimately be public and my hon friend the minister of state will meet the bvi to make clear our expectation 
 what assessment he have make of the potential merit of sanction violent illegal israeli settler 
 what assessment he have make of the potential merit of sanction violent illegal israeli settler 
 settler violence be unacceptable on   october   the uk sanction outpost and entity link to violence in the west bank under the global human right regime those measure will help bring accountability to those who have support and perpetrate such heinous abuse of human right the government do not comment on future sanction measure as to do so would reduce their impact 
 comment make yesterday by the un secretary general about increase violence in the west bank by israeli settler have shock my bath constituent and people across the country and member across the house be frustrate by the lack of action will the government sanction those who advocate for that violence especially minister smotrich and former minister ben gvir 
 we have condemn the unacceptable language that have be use by israeli minister bezalel smotrich and former minister mr ben gvir the foreign secretary and all ministers have be clear with their israeli counterpart that the israeli government must clamp down on settler violence as the foreign secretary say early and end the settlement expansion as i say in my original answer we will not comment on future sanction as to do so could reduce their impact 
 many people in my constituency be passionate about resolve the situation between israel and palestine and there be concern that violence in the west bank have increase and illegal settlement have continue to expand do the minister agree that if he also want to see a reduction in settler violence we should be consider sanction those settlement 
 i be seriously concern by the expansion of israel ’s operation in the west bank and palestinians have reportedly be displace palestinians must be allow home civilian must be protect and the destruction of civilian infrastructure minimised stability be essential at this crucial time we recognise israel ’s security concern but it must show restraint and ensure that its operation be commensurate with the threat pose i refer to my previous answer on sanction 
 israel have send tank to the west bank for the time in year and some palestinians be be displace from refugee camp there the very least that should be do to stop these contravention of international law be to impose a ban on israeli good come from illegal israeli settlement so i ask the minister be it now the time to do that 
 we call for trade to be do in the proper way there be clear provision around where israeli good be produce we do not recognise illegal settlement produce must be properly label and there be clear advice to business on that basis 
 the government and their partner be do important work to support the continuation of the fragile ceasefire in gaza but in the west bank as well as increase settler attack we have see israeli force attack a palestinian bookshop in east jerusalem unrwa school close tank move into refugee camp and the forced displacement of some palestinians what action be the government take to prevent the gaza isation of the west bank 
 as i say in my previous answer we be follow event in the west bank closely stability in the west bank be crucial to ensure that the fragile ceasefire in gaza can last all side should work to ensure a lowering of tension in the west bank at this time it be in no ’s interest for further conflict and instability to spread in the west bank 
 i call the father of the house 
 a week ago i be in a palestinian village with colleague include   the hon member for rochdale paul waugh we go to a school that have be demolish by illegal settler immediately punk turn up with sub machine gun intimidate we that be happen all over the place we go to hebron it be completely close down this be appalling the whole house should unite against the extremist jewish settler and the illegal settlement because it be not in the interest of moderate israeli opinion it be directly contrary to peace and we must fight this hon member hear hear 
 the father of the house my constituency neighbour can hear the strong support for his remark from member on the government benches 
 as the father of the house just reference i be in israel on the west bank last week and thing become instantly clear there be widespread revulsion at the sicken desecration of the body of the israeli hostage by hamas and there be widespread fear among palestinians particularly those in rural area whom we meet who have hand experience of their child have stone throw at they by settler their neighbour have their car torch and their own windscreen be smash every night will the minister reassure we that those extremist settler will be deal with really thoroughly in our foreign policy 
 my hon friend set out some of the horrific scene that have come out of israel and the occupied palestinian territories in recent week i restate our opposition to a further expansion of extremist settler violence and illegal settlement 
 what assessment he have make of the potential security implication of the propose uk mauritius treaty on the sovereignty of the british indian ocean territory 
 what his plan timetable be for the transfer of sovereignty of the chagos island to mauritius 
 we remain committed to conclude a deal that protect the base on diego garcia without a deal the base can not operate in practical term as it should in its important role protect the security of this country the united states and our ally we be currently discuss the agreement with the us and mauritius we will not put a deadline on its finalisation and will come to the house in due course 
 the labour party ’s determination to give away vital strategic territory in the chagos island seemingly to satisfy of the prime minister ’s lawyer friend over our american ally be baffle to my colleague on the conservative benches do the minister agree that it be far more important to maintain our special relationship with the us and the new trump administration than to pay billion of pound in the face of the self inflict worsen domestic economic situation in order to give the chinese government access to that vital region 
 there be so many thing in the hon gentleman ’s question that i disagree with that i do not know quite where to start we be not give away the base on diego garcia the deal secure that base if there be not a problem with its operation and its future why do his government start negotiation on it 
 the minister will be aware that the chinese have a smart city situate in mauritius so what safeguard be in the deal to prevent chinese installation on diego garcia that could compromise our western naval security 
 we be absolutely clear that we will retain full control over diego garcia and will have robust provision to keep adversary out there will be unrestricted access to and use of the base for the uk and the us a buffer zone around diego garcia a comprehensive mechanism to ensure that no activity in the outer island threaten base operation and a ban on the presence of any foreign security force i absolutely assure the hon gentleman that the provision be in place to defend the security of that critical base 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 the foreign secretary have proudly say that his chagos surrender plan be a good deal he tell the foreign affairs committee back in november that it be a very good deal and that he be 
 confident that the mauritians be still sure about that 
 week ago the prime minister of mauritius tell his national assembly that since his election he have conclude the deal 
 be so bad that we say no way 
 and that he have extract more concession from the uk on the length of the lease the extension on sovereignty and the cost can the minister confirm that change have be make since the announcement of the deal on   october   last year and do he disagree with the account give by the prime minister of mauritius 
 the fundamental of the deal remain the same and the overall quantum remain unchanged 
 what step his department be take to support woman and girl right in afghanistan 
 we condemn the taliban ’s appal treatment of woman and girl in afghanistan the taliban must reverse their barbaric decree and we keep work hard with international partner to maintain collective pressure 
 the cruelty and inhumanity of the taliban should appal we all and no doubt we all condemn the ban on medical training the uk have provide significant aid to afghanistan to support the health of woman and baby but with the taliban now undermine woman ’s health as well as their right what will happen to these aid programme and fund what action can we take to put pressure on the taliban to reverse their decision 
 the hon lady be absolutely right that the taliban have be undermine so much of woman ’s and girl live in afghanistan we be determined to support girl in afghanistan include when it come to education i have directly discuss that with the aga khan foundation to ensure that support be get directly to girl but we also need to push hard politically i be very pleased to announce that the uk be politically support the initiative to refer afghanistan to the international court of justice for violation of the convention on the elimination of all form of discrimination against woman 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the treatment of woman and girl by the taliban be disgusting and pressure must be exert in response the minister will know that there be concern about the protection of right for woman and girl and other minority in syria too give the ideology of hayat tahrir al sham minister have issue a statement on the future of the uk sanction on syria can the minister give detail of the measure that need to be put in place in syria to protect those right and say whether such issue will be tie to future decision on sanction 
 i be grateful to the right hon lady for her question and for her passion for the protection of woman and girl protect they and indeed religious and ethnic minority have be at the core of the uk ’s engagement with the syrian authority it be at the core of the intervention i make at the conference   on syria that i attend in paris just a few day ago and it be also very important in relation to the change to sanction that my right hon friend the foreign secretary set out 
 what step he be take to increase diplomatic co operation with his european counterpart 
 the prime minister the foreign secretary the minister for the cabinet office and i be engage extensively with european counterpart include through the prime minister ’s attendance of a european council meeting for the time since brexit we be work closely with european ally and be call for increase defence spending and support for ukraine this deep engagement have already deliver result on growth and security include a landmark defence and migration agreement with germany 
 the thames valley be of the most important economic zone in this country at a recent meeting that i hold with the business leader of the thames valley chamber of commerce the overwhelming message be that brexit have be a disaster for business and that boris johnson and the tories do they dirty will the minister commit to correct that wrong and start negotiation to join a european union custom union 
 we have be very clear that we do not seek to rejoin the custom union but our co operation be already deliver result particularly in relation to growth and business we recently secure a £ czech investment in rolls royce small modular nuclear reactor and a furth £ investment by polish firm inpost in its uk operation and as i have say we have also sign deal on migration with serbia kosovo slovenia and slovakia 
 ceasefire talk between russia and ukraine be under way whatever our opinion of they but the eager eye of putin may now look to other former soviet country such as the baltic state i be in estonia a couple of week ago and the distance between the russian border and the russian hold kaliningrad territory be just mile for context that be roughly what i travel every week to plymouth from london what step be the government take to deter the russians from look at possible future military action there 
 as i have say security be at the heart of our engagement with european counterpart and the uk ’s commitment to the security of the baltic state be iron clad we be help to uphold that region ’s security through our nato forward land force deployment in estonia the prime minister meet joint expeditionary force leader in tallinn in december to discuss close co operation in response to both conventional threat from russian aggression and hybrid threat and of course our work together on ukraine i have visit that border and meet our enhance forward presence   troop there they be do an excellent job and it be crucial that we stand with our baltic neighbour and all of europe when it come to our collective security 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the uk can be proud of the leadership it have show in support ukraine and rally our international partner around this cause what work be the minister lead with european ally on unfreezing sanctioned asset so that they can be use to equip ukraine and what be his timeframe for release critical sanctioned fund so that they can be use to strengthen europe ’s defence of our value security and defence 
 as the right hon lady know we have already do important work with european partner to secure the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan which will make a tangible difference to ukraine we continue to work with european partner on sanction and of course we be consider all lawful option go forward we have have important discussion in the weimar group and through the g7 and will continue to look with european counterpart at all option for support ukraine 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 it be shocking yesterday to see the united states vote with the despot of north korea belarus and russia against a un resolution propose by the uk and other european democracy liberal democrats want to see the uk lead in europe against putin ’s war on ukraine so we be pleased to hear the foreign secretary say yesterday that he be take forward our liberal democrat proposal that the £ of frozen russian asset hold in european central bank be seize and give to ukraine can the minister confirm that the foreign secretary will push the us administration to join in that initiative when he visit washington later this week 
 i be genuinely glad of the continued cross party co operation on ukraine which we see during the foreign secretary ’s statement yesterday of course that include get important resource i be not quite sure that the proposal be a liberal democrat proposal but i think there be a united front across this house on get ukraine the resource that it need we will continue to work with european counterpart in support of ukraine at the united nations across europe and through nato use all the mean that we can to support ukraine militarily economically and diplomatically 
 what step he be take to support civil liberty in georgia 
 who want it 
 rise 
 minister well do 
 apology mr speaker i be answer a lot of question today 
 i have significant concern about the georgian authority violent crackdown on peaceful demonstrator and journalist which be completely unacceptable in response we have suspend programme support to the georgian government restrict defence co operation and limited engagement with georgian dream we have impose visa ban and sanction on some of those responsible for the violence and we continue to work with international partner to support a free and open civil society and medium in georgia 
 meur ra mr speaker last month at the council of europe i meet several georgian opposition member who show i graphic evidence of the brutal physical abuse mete out by the georgian regime before during and since the recent parliamentary election bidzina ivanishvili the putin back oligarch and de facto ruler of georgia continue to suppress peaceful protest use an identical modus operandi to that use in russia violence and intimidation be distort the political process the united states have impose sanction on ivanishvili but much of his wealth be base in the uk or in british overseas territory will the minister commit to the uk join our ally and freeze the asset of such a despicable tyrant 
 i thank my hon friend and his fellow member of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe delegation for the important work that they be do include on the issue of georgia it be hugely important that we stand together with fellow europeans in the council of europe on these matter in co ordination with the us the united kingdom have impose sanction on the minister and deputy minister of internal affairs and police chief responsible for violent attack against journalist and peaceful protester in georgia my hon friend will understand that while we continue to closely monitor the evolve situation in georgia we do not comment on potential sanction designation as to do so would lessen their impact 
 the european parliament recently recognise salome zourabichvili as the rightful president of georgia protester who be on the street of tbilisi day in day out agree with that view she have meet the president of france emmanuel macron and she attend the recent inauguration of the us president will the minister commit to meeting with madame zourabichvili the next time she visit the uk

 the slave trade be abhorrent we recognise its horrific impact and the ongoing strength of feeling but there have be no such discussion as the foreign secretary make clear to the foreign affairs committee after the commonwealth heads of government meeting 
 there be no discussion about reparation and money the prime minister and i be absolutely clear that we will not be make cash transfer and payment to the caribbean 
 we be focus on work with our caribbean partner to tackle the most pressure challenge of today and the future include security growth and climate change 
 last week see the ordinary session of the african union assembly of heads of state and government the topic of which be justice for africans and people of african descent through reparation caribbean heads of state be also present and we know that the caribbean community or caricom have long engage in discussion on reparative justice whether or not we participate in these discussion they will continue to happen do the minister accept that the world and its power structure be change in our turbulent post brexit reality we need ally and friend but we will not even say that we be sorry we would be foolish to think that we be not deeply resent for that be it not well for the uk to engage in these discussion and ensure that we play a constructive role in address the endure legacy of slavery and colonialism 
 we recognise that this be an issue of endure concern to many we listen to view from our caribbean partner on the full range of bilateral issue but our policy on reparation be clear we do not pay they we be determined to work together for the future 
 a quick question to what extent do the government support caricom ’s point plan for reparatory justice

 end the conflict in sudan and the appalling consequence of it be a uk priority both the foreign secretary and i have visit the region include chad and south sudan we have increase aid and we have be determine to increase international attention that include the april conference to which the foreign secretary refer but i also convene development ministers from a number of country a few day ago with the emergency relief co ordinator to try to pile on the pressure 
 the last time the minister be in the house talk about sudan she tell we it be important to have trust in the international system give that the rsf be accuse of ethnic cleansing and genocide be so far act with complete impunity and have just pledge to form a rival government what be the uk government do to garner trust in the international system and to hold the rsf to account 
 i regret that we see both party to the conflict behave in a manner that be have a truly catastrophic impact on civilian we see famine and appalling level of conflict relate sexual violence and the international community must step up that be why the foreign secretary be seek to convene leader on this in april why i have pull together development ministers on this and why we have repeatedly raise these issue at the un

 i be delighted that my hon friend have visit those incredible commando during their training i too have visit our royal marines and army commando in the high north in norway and witness the vital role that they play in our strategic defence effort the uk and norway work closely together as nato and joint expeditionary force ally our prime minister sign a strategic partnership agreement in december and last week the defence secretary visit norway to launch a new agreement on deep defence co operation i and the foreign secretary have also visit our counterpart and i can tell my hon friend that security and defence co operation be absolutely at the heart of our effort and discussion with our norwegian friend

 the security of europe be absolutely paramount what new step be the secretary of state take to deter russia from far invade european border give that we be now in a new situation of ongoing negotiation 
 i be very pleased yesterday to announce of this country ’s big ever sanction package which will bear down far on russia ’s shadow fleet i remind my hon friend that interest rate be run at in russia and inflation be run at we be do a lot to take off the table money that putin use to fund his war machine 
 in january a minister in the foreign office say that they would challenge the northern ireland executive to be more robust in their reporting of international affair and meeting at the start of this month the minister and the deputy minister meet again with the chinese consul but still no detail of that meeting or previous meeting have be report or share have that challenge be make and what be the response 
 we regularly engage with northern ireland on all matter of foreign policy however this chinese consular matter be not something that ministers can discuss at the dispatch box 
 i warmly welcome the massive sanction package announce yesterday by the government but do the foreign secretary agree that china should be take a significantly more proactive role in prevent its company from supply russia ’s military 
 i thank my hon friend for his praise and support for the action that the foreign secretary have just mention this be our large ever sanction package since the start of russia ’s illegal and barbarous invasion we and our g7 ally be absolutely clear on the principle that russia must pay for the damage that it be cause to ukraine and we of course look at country route by which support be be give to russia ’s illegal action in ukraine as part of the package announce yesterday we be take a number of step in that regard include with company in china 
 last week the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs   the hon member for lincoln mr falconer leave open the possibility that the fcdo might revisit the issue of explicit carbon monoxide warning on fcdo travel advisory page a change that we contend would have a cascade effect on the uk travel industry drive up the use of carbon monoxide alarm and save life of british traveller overseas may i encourage the front bench team to pick up this   issue in the name of my constituent hudson foley to ensure that the life of british traveller overseas be keep safe 
 i can confirm that i will be add information to our dedicated page for independent traveller to highlight the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning globally i shall be write to cathy foley who i be move to meet and to the hon member

 i be grateful to my hon friend for that important question we have be work closely with egypt which have seek to support many of those require medical assistance across government we continue to look carefully at this issue but gazans need healthcare support in gaza and the uk government have be support that 
 as i be sure those on the treasury bench know soft power and diplomacy be most effective when they be back up by hard power when will the government commit to spend of gdp on defence to make sure that we have a real voice at the international table to encourage european country to increase their defence spending 
 why do the right hon gentleman not decide to do that the conservatives leave it to this government to get back to which we last have under a labour government the right hon gentleman should have do it and we be go to do it 
 i look forward to see relation between the uk and iraq blossom in the year to come under this labour government will the minister share the recent conversation that he have have with iraqi counterpart on reduce barrier to trade such as diverge trade regime 
 i be very pleased to meet the iraqi foreign minister dr fuad hussein during the official visit of prime minister al sudani to the uk from to   january during that visit our prime ministers sign the landmark partnership and co operation agreement a wide range treaty on trade and strategic co operation and announce a trade package worth up to £ 
 before the prime minister ’s statement let i point out that the government ’s own ministerial code say that the text of statement should be provide in advance to the opposition and the speaker it do not provide for the text to be redact i be particularly concern by report that some of the redacted information be provide to the medium in advance if correct that be very discourteous to this house and i take it very seriously it could well have be leak in which case i hope that there will be an inquiry into what have happen i ask the prime minister to look into what have happen and to report back to i and to the house as soon as possible 
 let i begin by give my word to this house that the statement be not give to the medium i will absolutely have an inquiry into that i speak to you mr speaker this morning i would not be discourteous to you the leader of the opposition or the house in that way i give you that assurance from this dispatch box i apologise to the leader of the opposition and i will have that inquiry 
 year since russia launch its vile assault on ukraine i would like to address the international situation and the implication for britain ’s national security in my week as prime minister i travel to the nato summit in washington with a simple message nato and our ally could trust that this government would fulfil britain ’s and indeed the labour party ’s historic role of put our collective security i speak of my great pride in lead the party that be a found member of nato the inheritor of the legacy of clement attlee and ernest bevin who not only stand behind winston churchill in wartime but win the peace by establish the great post war order here and abroad 
 it be a proud legacy but in a world like ours it be also a heavy because the historical load that we must carry to fulfil our duty be not as light as it once be we must bend our back across this house because these time demand a united britain and we must deploy all our resource to achieve security 
 mr speaker as a young man i vividly remember the berlin wall come down it feel as if we be cast off the shackle of history a continent unite by freedom and democracy if you have tell i then that in my lifetime we would see russian tank roll into european city again i would not have believe you yet here we be in a world where everything have change because year ago that be exactly what happen 
 britain can be proud of our response british family open their door to flee ukrainians with the yellow and light blue flutter on town hall and church the length and breadth of the country the conservatives in government be robust in our response i support that in opposition and i applaud they for it now we have build on that bring our support for ukraine to a record level this year 
 we should not pretend that any of this have be easy work people have already feel the cost of russian action through rise price and bill none the less of the great lesson of our history be that instability   in europe will always wash up on our shore and that tyrant like putin only respond to strength russia be a menace in our water in our airspace and on our street it have launch cyber attack on our nhs and only year ago a chemical weapon attack on the street of salisbury 
 we must stand by ukraine because if we do not achieve a last peace the economic instability and the threat to our security will only grow and so as the nature of that conflict change as it have in recent week it bring our response into sharp focus a new era that we must meet as we have so often in the past together and with strength 
 the fundamental of british strategy be unchanged i know that the current moment be volatile but there be still no good reason why they can not endure so let i now spell out to the house exactly how we will renew they for these time nato be the bedrock of our security and will remain so it have bring peace for year it be as important today as the day on which it be found putin think he would weaken nato he have achieve the exact opposite it remain the organisation that receive the vast bulk of our defence effort in every domain and that must continue 
 secondly we must reject any false choice between our ally between side of the atlantic and the other that be against our history country and party because it be against our fundamental national interest the us be our most important bilateral alliance it straddle everything from nuclear technology to nato eye aukus and beyond it have survive countless external challenge in the past we have fight war together we be the close partner in trade growth and security 
 so this week when i meet president trump i will be clear i want this relationship to go from strength to strength but strength in this world also depend on a new alliance with europe as i say in paris last week our commitment to european defence and security be unwavering but now be the time to deepen it we will find new way to work together on our collective interest and threat protect our border bring our company together and seek out new opportunity for growth 
 thirdly we seek peace not conflict and we believe in the power of diplomacy to deliver that end that of course be most press in ukraine nobody in this house or this country want the bloodshed to continue nobody i have see the devastation in ukraine at hand what you see in place such as bucha never leave you but for peace to endure in ukraine and beyond we need deterrence i know that this house will endorse the principle of win peace through strength so we will continue to stand behind the people of ukraine we must ensure that they negotiate their future and we will continue to put they in the strong position for a lasting peace 
 fourthly we must change our national security posture because a generational challenge require a generational response that will demand some extremely difficult and painful choice and through those choice as hard as they be we must also seek unity a whole society effort that will reach into the life the industry and the home of the british people i start this statement by recall the era of attlee and bevin and this year we will mark many anniversary of that great generation we must find courage in our history and courage in   who we be as a nation because courage be what our own era now demand of we so start today this government will begin the big sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war we will deliver our commitment to spend of gdp on defence but we will bring it forward so that we reach that level in and we will maintain that for the rest of this parliament let i spell that out that mean spend £ more on defence every year from 
 however we also face enemy that be sophisticated in cyber attack sabotage and even assassination so our intelligence and security service be an increasingly vital part of protect both we and our ally on top of the funding of that i have just announce we will recognise the incredible contribution of our intelligence and security service to the defence of our nation which mean that take together we will be spend on our defence from 
 we must go far still i have long argue that in the face of ongoing and generational challenge all european ally must step up and do more for our own defence subject to economic and fiscal condition and align with our strategic and operational need we will also set a clear ambition for defence spending to rise to of gdp in the next parliament 
 i want to be very clear the nature of warfare have change significantly that be clear from the battlefield in ukraine so we must modernise and reform our capability as we invest i equally want to be very clear that like any other investment we make we must seek value for money that be why we be put in place a new defence reform and efficiency plan jointly lead by my right hon friend the chancellor and the defence secretary 
 this investment mean that the uk will strengthen its position as a leader in nato and in the collective defence of our continent and we should welcome that role it be good for our national security it be also good for this government ’s define mission to restore growth to our economy and we should be optimistic about what it can deliver in those term but in the short term it can only be fund through hard choice in this case that mean we will cut our spending on development assistance move from of gni today to in fully fund our increase investment in defence 
 i want to be clear to the house that this be not an announcement that i be happy to make i be proud of our pioneering record on overseas development and we will continue to play a key humanitarian role in sudan ukraine and gaza tackle climate change and support multinational effort on global health and challenge like vaccination in recent year the development budget be redirect towards asylum backlog pay for hotel so as we be clear that backlog at a record pace there be efficiency that will reduce the need to cut spending on our overseas programme none the less it remain a cut and i will not pretend otherwise we will do everything we can to return to a world where that be not the case and to rebuild a capability on development but at time like this the defence and security of the british people must always come that be the no priority of this government 
 but it be not just about spending our whole approach to national security must now change we will have to ask british industry british university british business and the british people to play a big part and to use this to renew the social contract of our nation the right and responsibility that we owe another the test of our defence policy be of course whether it keep our country safe but the should be whether it improve the condition of the british people do it help provide the economic security that work people need because ultimately as attlee and bevin know that be fundamental to national security as well we will use this investment as an opportunity we will translate defence spending into british growth british job british skill and british innovation we will use the full power of the procurement act to rebuild our industrial base 
 as the strategic defence review be well under way and across government we be conduct a number of other review relevant to national security it be obvious that those review must pull together so before the nato summit in june we will publish a single national security strategy and bring it to this house because as i say early that be how we must meet the threat of our age together and with strength a new approach to defence a revival of our industrial base a deepening of our alliance the instrument of our national power bring together create opportunity assure our ally and deliver security for our country 
 mr speaker at moment like these in our past britain have stand up to be count it have come together and it have demonstrate strength that be what the security of our country need now and it be what this government will deliver i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i thank the prime minister for the partial copy of his statement now that i have hear the unredacted bit i must welcome his response and his fulsome support for ukraine 
 this weekend mark a grim milestone it be now year since putin ’s invasion the conservative party stand resolutely with the people of ukraine our heart be with those still catch up in this conflict as we remember the many innocent life lose i will always be proud of the support that the last conservative government give in the run up to putin ’s invasion and in the crucial week and month of the war we help prevent kyiv from fall and we support ukraine in regain territory initially lose to russia but it be also true that overall the west have not do enough to support ukraine 
 as have be the case from the outset it ultimately remain for ukraine as a proud and sovereign nation that have sacrifice so much to defend itself and the fundamental freedom that we all hold dear to decide its future we want this terrible war to end but ukraine need to be at the negotiating table like president zelenksy we hope for a last reliable peace but the west must continue to be intensely robust in the face of putin ’s aggression the lesson of the past year be clear he only come back for more 
 the duty of every government be to protect their people that mean a strong state that stand up for our national interest our foreign policy should seek to support our national interest which should always come so i be very pleased to hear the prime minister announce the increase to by all of we on the conservative benches welcome that we have all want to see more spending on defence on the inclusion of the intelligence budget will the prime minister confirm whether that mean new money for the intelligence service do it mean that there will be new money in the next financial year 
 the prime minister will know that i write to he at the weekend with suggestion on what we can do to help increase defence spending so i welcome his announcement on repurpose money from the overseas development budget that be absolutely right and i look forward to he take up my other suggestion of consider what we can do on welfare he will know that we have a fully fund plan and we urge he to take it up 
 have say that can the prime minister say with confidence that by be sufficient we need to look at exactly how we fund this he must not raise taxis far as that would destroy our economy and we need a strong economy to pay for strong defence he can not borrow more we be already spend more on debt interest than on defence we all know that he must make difficult decision on spending and he have our support in do that 
 in his statement the prime minister also tell we about his new value for money defence reform and efficiency plan do he agree that the thing that must be look at be the spending of billion of pound of taxpayer money to lease back the defence base on diego garcia which we currently own why be he still pursue that deal early today i make a speech about the realism that should drive our foreign policy as part of that he must scrap his disastrous plan to surrender the chagos island and have british taxpayer pay for the privilege 
 the key difference between we conservatives and the labour party be that we know that we need a strong economy for defence we need a serious plan to get the british economy grow again we do not have that with the late budget from the chancellor will the prime minister tell we whether there will be a fiscal event this spring even though his government be commit to only fiscal event per year 
 in summary the prime minister make point i agree with he that nato be a bedrock of our security as i say this morning and that the us be our most important bilateral relationship but friend tell each other when they disagree we agree on this issue we know that ukraine must be support and i share his concern about statement that have be make about president zelensky i agree with he about protect security in europe and i welcome his continued strengthening of alliance but we must do that through nato build on the joint expeditionary force approach of course we agree that we need peace with ukraine agree 
 i do not necessarily agree with the prime minister ’s change of the national security posture because we have different view on that i be a conservative realist not a progressive internationalist but i want he to know that when he do the right thing we will work with he in the national interest 
 may i thank the leader of the opposition for her support in relation to today ’s announcement and on ukraine that be important to the government to the house and most of all to the ukrainians and president zelensky they want to see unity in our house they value unity in our house as they enter after year of conflict a very difficult stage in the war with russia and against russian aggression i hope and believe that we can maintain that unity in relation to ukraine as we have do for year i be very proud that this house have do that notwithstanding a change of government for long year we will continue to do so 
 the leader of the opposition ask about the money for defence security and intelligence there be new money in the budget in relation to that but what i be do here be in addition to the which be the increase defence spend as it have always be understand to recognise that the nature of the threat to our county be different now and that the security and intelligence service play a key part for we and our ally in our defence that take the total to 
 the leader of the opposition ask whether we will tax or borrow to pay for the the answer be no which be why i have today set out precisely how we will pay for it pound for pound that have mean a difficult decision on overseas development a very difficult decision and not that i want or be happy to take but it be important that we explain where the money will come from in term and today i be only ever go to come to the house with a plan that have a timeline and a percentage in it and an answer to the question how will you pay for it i would not have come to the house with a fanciful plan 
 the leader of the opposition say that they have a plan—[interruption she say of course we do i have my view on that but the institute for government say that the conservative pledge of by do not add up and be not a serious plan the institute for fiscal studies call it misleading and opaque i be not give my view i be give the view of other body on the plan that the conservatives put forward they say that they would fund it by cut the civil service and then increase the civil service by i be not prepared to operate in that way which be why we have take the difficult decision on overseas development today to be absolutely clear on where the money be come from 
 in relation to the leader of the opposition ’s final point on the approach that we take here and whether there be a difference between we i hope not what i have set out be nato as the bedrock of our security i hope that be common ground whatever we may call our respective position i also set out that we must not choose between the us and our european ally that be what i fundamentally believe and i will resist that choice i hope that be common ground between we notwithstanding the language that she use because it be important not for exchange over the dispatch boxes but for the future defence and security of our country and of europe 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s statement on defence and security because time be a change and we must all recognise   that these be pivotal moment not just for our nation ’s security but for our ukrainian friend whom we must wholeheartedly support in their fight for survival 
 in my various interaction with key stakeholder in my role as chair of the defence committee i have begin to realise that there be considerable consternation among our european ally about whether long establish and hard earn alliance rather than a short term transactional approach can still be rely on to secure last peace also give the propose reduction in the american presence on our continent people be look for leadership i feel that this be our time to step forward as a nation and take the lead on defence and security matter on our continent 
 will my right hon friend the prime minister convey to president trump and our american ally the anxiety of our european ally and the need to strengthen our transatlantic nato alliance at this perilous time for europe and do he agree that he can be the person to take the lead on defence and security matter in europe coalesce with our nato ally 
 order i say gently to the hon gentleman that i know he have a lot to say but i have a lot of member to get in include other party leader 
 i do agree that our alliance be important and that be why nato be the bedrock of our approach it have be for many many year and will continue to be i do accept that european ally and the uk have to step up and do more in our heart of heart i think across this house we have know that this moment be come for the last year we have put that plan before the house and of course i will do everything i can to strengthen the alliance and the relationship between the us and the uk it be a special relationship it be a strong relationship i want it to go from strength to strength 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement year ago putin begin his brutal full scale invasion of ukraine and as we watch russian missile rain down on ukrainian city we fear he might have strike a decisive blow to ukraine and its sovereignty yet putin underestimate the strength of the ideal we share with our ukrainian friend of democracy truth and liberty he underestimate the courage and grit of ukrainian soldier who have spend year heroically resist putin ’s war machine 
 britain stand together with our ally in support of ukraine and family up and down the country open their door wide for ukrainian refugee because we know that ukraine ’s fight for democracy and liberty be our fight too in this house we stand strong together and yet year on the future of ukraine and security in europe seem even more perilous then washington be clearly on our side but now the united states be vote with russia belarus and north korea in the united nations president trump label president zelensky a dictator but not vladimir putin 
 after the world war britain come together with ally around the world to establish nato and with america agree to underwrite security on this continent recognise that a threat to the security of nation be a threat to the security of all nation the event of the past few day be clear that era be over we may be watch before our very eye the betrayal of our ukrainian ally by america and with it the potential betrayal of europe and of britain too we must respond now it be up to the united kingdom to lead in europe as a nation we must seize this moment 
 it be for our national interest that liberal democrats have support the prime minister ’s proposal on ukraine include british troop join a reassurance mission in ukraine if a just settlement be reach that be why we strongly support the prime minister raise defence spending to preferably use seized russian asset to pay for extra defence support for ukraine we will scrutinise all aspect of the government ’s spending plan carefully but i hope that move at pace to mean that ministers will shortly announce the reversal of the conservatives short sighted cut of troop from our armed force 
 the prime minister be right we must go far so will he initiate talk between all party in this house to establish the vital consensus need to take we to spend of gdp on defence as soon as possible the prime minister will know that for month we liberal democrats have urge the government to seize frozen russian asset which amount to over £ and repurpose those fund for ukraine ’s defence will he take immediate step to gather european leader and begin the seizure of russian asset so that we can support ukraine no matter what america do will he on his trip to washington try to persuade president trump to do the same to make russia pay 
 the prime minister will know that the whole country will be will he on hop that he might be able to persuade donald trump to change his mind on ukraine we on the liberal democrat benches think he be right to try but should that not work will he be clear where the united kingdom then stand will he make it clear that if absolutely necessary it will be with ukraine and our european ally not putin and trump 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his support on ukraine it have be steadfast and it have be across this house for the same reason that i give to the leader of the opposition that be important not just here but to those in ukraine 
 we do need to step up and lead in europe we have be say that for a very long time all european country need to do more and now be the moment to do so but we need to do that together with the us because what be need more than anything be a last peace a ceasefire that simply give putin the chance to regroup and to go again be in nobody ’s interest a last peace mean that we must talk about issue such as security guarantee we be prepared to play our part as i have indicate but i have also indicate that to be a security guarantee it require a us backstop us support for that security guarantee that be at the heart of the case i have be make for some time 
 as the right hon gentleman know of the asset that have be seize already the interest on those of £ have already be commit to ukraine and   we be work with our european ally to see what more can be do in relation to the funding that will be necessary step up mean step up on capability on co ordination and on funding which be what we have do today with this statement 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 i warmly welcome the prime minister ’s statement and this strong commitment to defence spending i welcome as well the work be do with the chancellor and the defence secretary on ensure that we get as much value as we can for each pound spend on deliver capability will the prime minister reaffirm his commitment to the parliamentary scrutiny of that spending include on the most sensitive area 
 yes of course it be extremely important and my hon friend know that well she be absolutely right to say that we must get value for money this be a huge increase in defence spending it be very important that it be use on the right capability in the right way and that be why we intend to get a much well grip on the money that will be put in 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s announcement i personally think it be a start not a finish i think we will find that we have to raise defence spending far but i welcome it none the less and on behalf of all of this house and my right hon friend   the member for north west essex mrs badenoch i will support it 
 the prime minister be due to go to washington problem we have there be that they seem to have reach the conclusion that peace be simply the absence of war can he remind the president that a peace without justice the right to freedom and choice in democracy be not peace but a partial ceasefire he might also remind the president that the last great test we face unite the united kingdom and america with lady thatcher and ronald reagan take decision that move europe in the right direction can he appeal to the president that instead of run around make adverse comment he should link hand with the united kingdom to persuade the rest of europe to step up as we be now step up 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his support the point he make about a last peace and what it must be be really important this be not just about stop the fighting it be about an endure and last peace for europe and of course the sovereignty of ukraine the sovereign ability to choose the alliance that ukrainian people want to choose their own government and to choose how they defend themselves in conjunction with other it be about the sovereignty of ukraine but it be also about the value and freedom across europe include our value and freedom that be why this be such an important moment to ensure that nato be as strong as it have be in the last year as we go forward and that the bond between we and the us be as strong as it have ever be that have to be part of the case the argument and the way in which we have step up today and will continue to do so 
 i warmly welcome the prime minister ’s statement and particularly his commitment to accelerate the increase in defence spending although i fear that we may have to visit the target before the next parliament it be very important that we have a whole society approach to defence will he be bring forward a strategy to make that happen particularly around the great need to improve our reservist force 
 it do have to be a whole society response which be why i set that out in my statement in the house and i be grateful to my hon friend for raise it of course it have to be a driver of industrial growth and our industrial strategy 
 aside from a few of putin ’s poodle who be not in their seat in the chamber today we be of course unite in our support for the people of ukraine and in wish the prime minister well in his discussion with the president of the united states later this week but i be afraid that be where the unity end because while we support increase defence spending we can not support the populist playbook of cut foreign aid indeed that position be share and agree with by the foreign secretary just a matter of day ago when he say that it would be a big strategic mistake that would allow china to step in why be the foreign secretary wrong and the prime minister right 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his support on the question of ukraine which be important i reassure he that the decision that i have take today on development aid be not an ideological i absolutely understand its importance it be a difficult and painful decision but a necessary he talk about choice snp members welcome the big settlement since devolution in the budget but they vote against it because they could not take a choice the right hon gentleman welcome the increase in defence spending but he do not want to say how he will fund it grow up choice about the future of europe require grown up decision and choice and that be what we have do 
 instability in europe wash up on our shore and i accept the hard decision that the prime minister have make to invest in defence which mean difficult decision on international development can we please invest more in cyber give the disinformation and cyber attack that our country face on a daily basis 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that because cyber be of the tool for warfare these day that be why we increase funding in the budget and why i have adjust the to in the case present to the house today 
 i agree entirely with the strategic direction that the prime minister have set out defence and security must come but he do have choice about how he fund that important uplift in the last parliament he and i vote together against balance the book on the back of the poor people in the world do he still think that vote be right 
 i be proud of that vote at the time and proud of the work that our country have do on development this be not a decision that i want to make and i absolutely want we to get back to more funding on overseas development and increase those capability some of that will be help if as we be do we get the asylum backlog down and stop use that money to pay for hotel which be not what it be intend for this have be a difficult decision the right hon gentleman know how much i value overseas development and how important it be but i think and think that the most important thing today be to be clear about the commitment we be make on defence to spell out the reason that we be make those decision and to set out penny and pound exactly how it will be fund i would not come to the house with a plan that be not credible and not cost because that would be far bad for our country but i accept the tenor of what he say about the importance of the issue 
 i thank the prime minister for his statement and for the leadership that he have show in these uncertain time as the member of parliament for the home of the british army i know that this be hugely welcome news for my constituency and that my community be ready to serve what will the prime minister do to help to create job in the defence sector in my community 
 i thank my hon friend for her question give the make up of her constituency and constituent they be hardwire for this this be an important obligation that we must rise to but it be also an opportunity to ensure that the job that will be generate be british job with british skill in all our constituency we will endeavour to ensure that that be the case 
 we be pleased to hear the announcement that the government will increase defence spending to but we be still wait for the strategic defence review to be complete as without that we be in the dark will the sdr be announce soon and if not will the prime minister outline how the additional money will be spend 
 the sdr be advanced and i will come to the house with it as soon as we can i want to make sure that we have properly identify the challenge and capability obviously we have put the funding forward today we will do that as soon as we can and when we do it will be a credible plan for the house 
 i thank the prime minister for his tireless effort to bring security to ukraine because its security be our security do he agree that that be possible only because we be united kingdom and that that strength that solidarity be possible only because our nation work together do he agree that those who attempt to fragment that union in these perilous time do we great harm 
 i do agree with that as the united kingdom we have always stand up in moment such as this and we stand up again as the united kingdom and be proud to do so this be an important moment and a juncture after year of a conflict   and the whole house will be aware of the potential consequence of decision in come week it be a time for we to pull together 
 president trump say that he want his legacy to be that of a peacemaker in his difficult conversation with the president in a few day time will the prime minister remind he that the reason the enforce division of czechoslovakia before the war be a step on the road to disaster but the division of germany at the end of the war do not lead to world war be that the western half of europe at the end of world war be not demilitarise if there be to be a stable ukraine after any such enforce division there must be military protection for the unoccupied half of ukraine 
 the right hon gentleman be right to talk about peace it be what everybody want not least the ukrainians but it must be a last peace and not a temporary ceasefire i agree that that mean it need security guarantee the configuration of that need to be agree but the security guarantee must be sufficient to deter any further aggression otherwise it will be a ceasefire and that would be the bad of outcome for the whole of europe 
 i thank the prime minister for his leadership and the announcement today commit we to of gdp on defence spending and beyond that that be in stark contrast to the year of erosion of defence spending the hollowing out of our service and the service life that result do the prime minister agree with i that the reform put forward by the defence secretary be essential to deliver deterrence and to prevent further act of russian brutal imperialist aggression in europe
