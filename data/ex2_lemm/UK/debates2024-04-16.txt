year of experience of lead and scrutinise complicated legislation tell i to be cautious with the bill i strongly admire its aim but i have some question to set out as to whether it will work 
 with direct knowledge of cancer and deep commitment to cancer awareness i want people to smoke less as we have hear smoke cause around in of all   uk cancer death tobacco especially cigarette smoking be the single most important and as we have hear preventable cause of ill health disability and death in this country i agree with the bill ’s hope of reduce that suffering i also desire the bill ’s aim to realise an economic saving on healthcare name as more than £ in the impact assessment and a productivity gain of £ over year my hon friend   the member for winchester steve brine the chair of the health committee be right that we should be take the long term view and look for the gain from prevention for all that to be possible however the legislation have to work 
 i be join today ’s debate i shall keep it concise madam deputy speaker because i care very much about politic and democracy work as i stand down from parliament this year this be of the final piece of draft legislation for i and it be a significant proposition so i will raise some point that be all intend to be thoughtful and be base on term of constituency work and ministerial experience in department in of my past role i have to undo legislation that i have help to implement because it do not work 
 the age of sale mechanism in the bill be the untested thing it would be the of its kind in the world but that accolade would come only because a few have try and fail to carry support the bill as a whole have an imperfect evidence base that be clear throughout its analysis in particular because we do not yet have the full datum picture about the effect of vaping so what be in front of we today be inherently risky and theoretical it be also possible that it may be divisive by ask group of adult to live under rule different from those for another i understand that the malaysian equivalent be challenge on equality ground and i would be really interested to know what lesson the minister have draw from that 
 it be legitimate to be worry that something so novel may be unfair on retailer the british independent retailers association point out that the quite sophisticated enforcement need of the mechanism fall on its member as the association of convenience stores add the 
 proxy purchasing of any age restrict product be extremely difficult for retailer to detect and prevent 
 indeed the deterrent in the bill for proxy purchasing be just £ if a person catch and pay promptly after my right hon friend the chancellor ’s effort at the late budget that be actually only the cost of about or packet of cigarette i be therefore concerned that the design of the proxy buy deterrent in the bill could be fatally impractical for what be try to be achieve let we put that in really super practical term a person ’s friend a year old may well be able to go into a shop or online and get packet and let their friend have and the cost of their do so add up in the end to only or packet for themselves we ought to give considerable thought to that 
 the british retail consortium say that a well policy be need on id i agree i be surprised that the impact assessment say nothing about the impact of individual need to provide id throughout their life instead of just up to the age of adulthood the document of course do deal with the cost to retailer of check id but it be silent on the burden of ask a particular group of adult to have to prove their date of birth   for life i be talk about those who be or look and would continue to be or to look just above the age state in the bill healthy or unhealthy right or wrong they have every right to buy cigarette and would remain in possession of that right but they would have to prove it for life under the bill 
 when i take the bill that become the elections act through the house we be rightly question hard about the notion of ask adult to bring identification to polling station we acknowledge up front that not everyone hold a drive licence or a passport and ensure that other form of id be available give the importance of people ’s democratic right this be a slightly different point and i be not make a direct comparison but for the purpose of retail free id for example the citizencard be already available however it need to be renew every few year and a new requirement in the bill mean that it would need to be use for life i think the government should have more reassurance to give law abide people than silence 
 i say that i strongly admire the aspiration of the bill for the sake of all those who be entangle in a lethal addiction i would like to see smoking stop in this country so i be not stand here on ideological ground i be make sensible point about whether the bill be go to work we have have rightly a wide range reflective and constructive debate but good intention and heroic ambition be not enough if we be to do something very novel and use the power of legislation to do it we need to have confidence that the legislation be workable i hope that my fellow legislator will rise to the challenge that be present by this idea and will scrutinise it carefully 
 i smoke until 30usb year ago and it be a very hard business to stop the evil weed i come from a completely different era and i be consider something of a dinosaur hon member never but i do still hope to be here in i wish to god that vape have be around when i be go through the process of stop smoking do we not need to be very careful that the bill do not throw the baby out with the bathwater and stop help people come off the evil weed 
 i be grateful to my hon friend who make such a powerful point and speak with such authority similar point be make by my hon friend   the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson who as a paediatrician speak with great expertise on this matter it be absolutely true it be a false choice it be not a freedom of choice it be a choice to become addicted and that then remove your choice 
 every year more than child age between and light their cigarette what they can look forward to be a life of addiction to nicotine spend thousand of pound a year make perhaps attempt to quit with all the misery that involve and then experience life limit entirely preventable suffering third of they will die before their time some of people start smoke before the age of which be why we need to have the gut to create the smoke free generation across the united kingdom make sure that child turn or young this year will never be legally sell tobacco that be the single big intervention that we can make to improve our nation ’s health smoking be responsible for about death every year but it would still be worth take action if the real figure be half that or even a of it 
 there be also a strong economic case for the bill every year smoking cost our country at least £ far more than the £ of tax revenue that it draw in it cost our nhs and social care system £ every year with someone admit to hospital with a smoking relate illness almost every minute of every day and gp appointment every week for smoking relate problem that be a massive and totally   preventable waste of resource for those of we on this side of the house who be try hard to increase access to the nhs and enable more patient to see their gps this be a really good target on which to focus on the positive side create a smoke free generation could deliver productivity gain of nearly £ within a decade potentially reach £ by improve work prospect boost efficiency and drive the economic growth that we need in order to pay for the class public service that we all want 
 i know that hon member who oppose the bill be do so with the good of intention they argue that adult should be free to make their own decision and i get that what we be urge they to do be make their own free decision to choose to be addict to nicotine but that be not in fact a choice and i urge they to look at the fact child start smoke because of peer pressure and because of persistent marketing tell they that it be cool i know from experience how hard it be once hook to kick the habit i take up smoking at the age of my little sister be at the time and we use to buy no and a little book of match and yes smoke behind the bicycle shed and at the bus stop on the way home from school interruption yes i know i be out myself here 
 have take up smoking at the age of i be smoke a day by the age of and as a birthday present to myself i give up but today year later i be now so do the math with all this talk of smoking i still feel like a fag sometimes that be how addictive smoking be this be not about freedom to choose it be about freedom from addiction 
 there be another angle those in the tobacco industry be of course issue dire warning of unintended consequence from the raising of the age of sale they say that it will cause an explosion in the black market that be exactly what they say when the age of sale rise from to but the opposite happen the number of illicit cigarette consume fall by a quarter and at the same time smoking rate among and year old in england fall by almost a raise the age of sale be a tried and test policy and a policy that be support not only by a majority of retailer which understandably have be mention by a number of member but by more than of the british public 
 i have a short announcement to make regard the implementation of recommendation make by the procedure committee in its report correct the record which the house agree to on   october 
 hansard have now make the necessary change to enable all member to submit write correction to the official report when they have make error of fact in their contribution when such correction be publish a footnote will appear in the print version of hansard with hyperlink in the online version that will direct the reader to the original content the same will apply to correction make via point of order and in write ministerial statement in accordance with the committee ’s recommendation a central correction page list all correction in chronological order and update weekly will be publish on parliament ’s website

 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to support float offshore wind project in the celtic sea 
 what plan she have to support float offshore wind farm 
 britain be a pioneer of float offshore wind we be work with the crown estate to lease gw of seabed capacity for float offshore wind in the celtic sea and we be support emerge technology with a separate funding pot in allocation round 
 the white cross project in the celtic sea have a cable due to come ashore in my constituency and it advise i that it be unable to agree compensation to business disrupt by these work due to a lack of government guidance will my right hon friend meet i and ideally come to see where the project be due to make landfall to find an alternative cable route and if not will she ensure that white cross be in a position to fully compensate the business that will be hugely impact if the plan cable route proceed 
 i thank my hon friend who be a doughty campaigner for float offshore wind i be unable to comment on any specific concern about a particular planning decision but i be sure the relevant minister will be happy to meet she to discuss how the government can provide well guidance on compensation people whose land be acquire compulsorily should not be leave bad off financially and compensation should be offer in line with the statutory compensation code 
 what assistance can be have for those fast grow enterprise principally reliant on equity 
 i thank my right hon friend for a typically pithy question we be do an enormous amount to support the landscape for investment in this country that rely on equity whether that be through full capital expensing or in my area of responsibility the green industry growth accelerator 
 i be sure the secretary of state will agree that much of britain ’s energy need could be meet and generate offshore alongside float wind power we also have the opportunity to take advantage of tidal and marine power do she recognise that britain have the large tidal range in the world after canada yet we use so little of it to put that right will she agree to meet i other colleague in this house and the northern tidal power gateway to look at how we can gain green renewable secure british energy from morecambe bay 
 i thank the hon gentleman i have be follow tidal power for many year and he be right to point out that the uk have both a strong record in renewable and an interesting geological landscape for new renewable technology we have dedicate £ our big ever budget to the flow of emerge technology through ar6 but i would be delighted to meet he to discuss his work far 
 i thank the secretary of state for her response there be always a competition as i represent strangford the fishing sector be very important to i it be important that we have float offshore wind project but also to ensure that fishing can be sustainable in these discussion can she confirm that the interest of the fishing industry and representation from the fishing industry be give appropriate weight take into consideration the need for sustainable fishing to continue without fish my people will lose job 
 i thank the hon gentleman we be passionate supporter of the fishing industry we continue to have conversation with the department for environment food and rural affairs to ensure that we share our marine bed in an equitable way not only get the most out of it for our clean energy need but protect the fishing industry 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be sure the secretary of state do not want a repeat on her watch of the failure of allocation round when her department manage to crash the offshore wind market   however the industry be already warn that the parameter set for float wind in the next round ar6 could mean that only sub gigawatt project succeed in get contract for difference support way off the government ’s recently trumpet target of gw of float offshore by what step be she take to ensure that we do not see another failure and lose the global race for this emerge technology 
 if people want to ensure that we win the global race for renewable technology they should frankly vote conservative under the conservatives world lead mechanism have be introduce the only country that have build more offshore wind capacity than the uk be china we have an enormous and very successful track record and continue to work with industry to ensure that ar6 will be a success 
 i be not sure that answer give much reassurance to industry or this house the truth be that uprate our port infrastructure be critical for deploy float offshore wind and for reach a carbon power system but government support be so inadequate that they be fund only port drop viable project on the way when accord to the float offshore wind taskforce to reach float offshore wind ambition we need infrastructure upgrade in at least port be this not another example of the government fail to invest for the future and fail to back british industry 
 the only failure on renewable energy be the record labour leave when they be in power when of our electricity be generate from renewable whereas now that figure be on port not only have we get our world lead freeport agenda but we have put forward project such as flowmis the float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme which be also help to build our port infrastructure 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 with gw of float offshore wind plan to be anchor within nautical mile of aberdeen what step will the secretary of state take to ensure that technological and engineering knowledge and wherewithal and supply chain investment be also anchor within mile of the north east of scotland 
 we be do an enormous amount of work on supply chain we have put forward our £ green industry growth accelerator fund to support british supply chain and we be also take step to attract investment into this country to build british business all of that will be positive for the scottish offshore wind sector 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household that be in fuel poverty in winter 
 what estimate she have make of the number of household that be in fuel poverty in winter 
 as previously state fuel poverty be devolve statistic for england estimate that there be household in fuel poverty in over few than in 
 april ’s new price cap will see household across the uk in fuel poverty and national energy action estimate this figure will include household in north tyneside alone the government promise their household upgrading scheme would help household but in month it have help few than and only in my constituency can the minister account for the abysmal failure of the flagship policy 
 i stand by the government ’s record of support on fuel poverty we have help with affordability and with insulation and energy efficiency we have give unprecedented support to household who be keep out of fuel poverty at the energy peak in 
 electricity standing charge for people in the north east be 71.2p per day while those in the south pay 40.79p per day can the minister explain why the people in the north east the area experience the high level of fuel poverty in the country be pay more than those in other region simply for the privilege of be connect to the grid 
 the hon gentleman make a reasonable point on standing charge which be reason why we have urge ofgem to gather information on they we have have over response and will be look at this in due course 
 in the office for national statistics and house of commons datum fuel poverty in england be back in it rise to by and as have already be mention it fall back to in do the minister agree that that show that conservative deliver energy policy with environmental and economic good sense and have do a lot well than the last labour government 
 as i say we be incredibly proud of our record on head towards net and ensure energy security so that never to have to go through the cost of living crisis that we have recently go through 
 if she will make an assessment of the ability of the national grid to connect to large solar farm in a and   b 
 network company be expect to deliver connection by the date stipulate in customer connection agreement reform to accelerate the connection process and build time for transmission infrastructure will help to ensure that expectation be meet 
 may i welcome the minister to his new responsibility and urge he to focus on this particular issue accord to a recent report by the uk sustainable investment and finance association    of investor in solar power say there be problem get interconnection with the grid we know there be issue in the distribution network which mean that the transmission network be probably the only place that large scale utility solar farm can connect and people be worried that only particular part of that network accept contract will the minister look at that in detail because there be major concern in my constituency that there will be connection at eaton socon power station which be of the few place where contract be be offer 
 that be absolutely understand as set out in the spring budget the government be work with ofgem and network company to release more network capacity and to prevent speculative project from obtain and retain network capacity that alongside fast network infrastructure delivery should result in more capacity across the country and help to reduce any clustering of generation project 
 national grid infrastructure be critical to the delivery and connection of these solar farm as it be for onshore and offshore wind the importance and urgency of that be stress by the winser review of august last year the government have get until to deliver this policy will the minister update we on the transmission acceleration action plan 
 the hon member be spot on we be proud to have go from renewable energy to to go far we must hit those ambitious target by unlock additional investment for example through the accelerate strategic transmission investment process we anticipate unlock a furth £ of investment by alongside the change i have already set out that will be key to get that extra power generate through solar 
 surely it be not an adequate justification for build solar farm on acre within a mile radius that gainsborough be close to the national grid serve the old power station be that not gross overdevelopment on good arable land and should the inspector not take account of this overdevelopment 
 i understand my right hon friend ’s raise this point that be why it be clear in plan policy and guidance that solar project should be direct to previously develop or non greenfield land that be the message we reinforce in the january national planning statement to ensure that we reduce unnecessary clustering 
 may i also welcome the minister to his new role accord to national grid £ of investment be need to meet our decarbonising target british electricity demand be expect to rise by in the next year and the current system be still design around electricity source of the past such as coal new cable need to be build to bring electricity from renewable energy source as we have already hear what assessment have the department make of the impact this problem be have on green investment 
 i thank the hon member for her kind word i enjoy work with she on many occasion in my former role the government have continue to work with the public and business to unlock additional investment for example through the connection action plan we expect an additional gw of accelerated collection date to be release which will particularly help in the area of solar we be also look at the £ of investment we have unlock since the autumn statement through the transmission acceleration action plan those be all vital component to hit our ambitious target 
 what recent discussion she have have with business and investor on the government ’s net target 
 what recent discussion she have have with business and investor on the government ’s net target 
 as a department our ministerial team meet regularly with industry for example through the hydrogen investor forum the offshore wind industry council the solar taskforce the green jobs delivery group and the cross cutting net council which be shortly celebrate its anniversary 
 car maker warn what would happen before the government delay the end date for the sale of new petrol and diesel car sure enough sale of new electric car be down by in the late figure from the society of motor manufacturers and trader switch to electric driving be cheap over the lifetime of the vehicle why do the government not listen to the warning from business do they not want people to benefit from cheap travel 
 i proudly drive an electric vehicle myself and i celebrate the fact that electric vehicle be register in march alone 
 in of the large energy company recently survey by the uk sustainable investment and finance association agree that the uk be fall behind in the race to become the most investable market for low carbon technology what step will the minister take to reassure the clean energy industry that the uk be serious about the transition to net which must include move away from a commitment to max out oil and gas production 
 i very much welcome the hon member ’s highlight the importance of this area i be sure that he will join i in celebrate the fact that we secure £ of investment in low carbon technology in up a staggering on the previous year we be head in the right direction to meet our ambitious target 
 do the minister agree that it be economic madness to pursue our current ruthless net agenda outsource carbon production to the like of china and force we to pay more to heat our home and power our economy we must put the british taxpayer 
 it be crucial that we work with the public and business not against they in power up britain we set out our plan to secure our energy system by ensure a resilient and reliable supply increase our energy efficiency and crucially my hon friend will welcome this bring down bill 
 the carbon humber project be a vital part of the country ’ achieve its net target however there be concern among potential investor particularly in connection with the carbon cluster project that the government be move a little too slowly will the minister reassure those business that the timetable will be honour 
 my hon friend regularly champion investment in his constituency work closely alongside the business he support we understand the importance of that just before christmas we set out a road map to speed up the process which we very much hope will unlock that vital investment for his community 
 we come to the shadow minister 
 i welcome the minister to his post i think he be struggle a little bit to get with the programme but hopefully he will soon be on message hon member oh that be in term of his answer to the question about be anti net 
 the department confirm last month that curtailment payment cost a whopping £ last year that be bill payer money be use to pay provider to switch off wind power and switch on gas why should people be pay even more on their energy bill to switch off clean and cheap energy because the government have fail to deliver the net capacity that we need 
 that be why we have be focus on expand the interconnector network so that where we produce energy that we can not use domestically it can be sell i also welcome last year ’s large scale expansion of battery farm they have be spring up at an amazing speed which allow we to store the energy supply that exceed demand 
 i look forward to hear the minister ’s prediction of what the curtailment payment will be in the come year because they be up for the previous year in a survey of energy industry leader nearly say that we need new policy to make the uk more attractive to investor nearly third be move investment out of the uk and quarter blame a lack of clarity from this government on net be it not time for ministers and back benchers to drop the culture war and put british industry and job 
 on a lack of clarity i think the shadow minister have mix thing up with the green prosperity plan even i can not keep up with the late position of senior figure in the labour party but i think the shadow team lose that battle the reality be that in we secure £ of private investment in low carbon technology which be up a staggering on the previous year that be a credit to our team who deliver that 
 what step she be take to encourage the installation of rooftop solar panel 
 the government recently consult on the future home and building standard which explore how we can drive on site renewable electricity generation such as solar panel in new home and building in december we simplify planning process for large rooftop installation by remove the mw cap for non domestic array in permit development right 
 the cpre ’s rooftop solar campaign call for far great emphasis on the installation of solar panel on our nation ’s rooftop rather than the promotion of ground mount solar on greenfield and agricultural land which harm our natural environment and imperil uk food security would the minister be kind enough to read the cpre ’s light the way report which highlight international good practice on this issue 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and his recommend reading i be aware of the cpre ’s rooftop campaign and i be keen to understand the finding of its late report as set out in the british energy security strategy and the energy security plan we be aim for gw of solar capacity by that would be more than quadruple our current instal capacity we need to maximise the deployment of both type of solar to achieve that ambition 
 this be my chance to offer my condolence to you mr speaker on the death of your dad he be a great man and help induct i into this place when i come here in 
 if we be to have a proper domestic solar roll out across we desperately need more train people in the green sector what will the minister do about that be it not about time that every university and further education college offer apprenticeship and way in to these wonderful job will he talk to industry leader such as octopus about their shortage of skilled man and woman 
 absolutely my right hon friend the secretary of state regularly meet company such as octopus through our green job delivery plan we be entice more people into the job of the future to help deliver our ambitious target it be interesting to note that labour ’s plan would halve the number of apprenticeship for those job in the uk should it ever get into power 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on trend in the number of onshore wind planning application 
 in onshore wind planning application be submit in great britain a increase from we have recently change planning policy in england to pave the way for more onshore wind project where there be local support 
 it be now month since the government claim to have lift the onshore wind ban the secretary of state at the time claim that her decision would speed up the delivery of project since then no new application for onshore wind farm for domestic use have be submit do the minister think that that have be a success 
 unlike the opposition we like to work with and listen to community around the country we believe in local consent for project it should be up to local community to decide whether and how much onshore wind they want in their area the opposition do not like to talk about this but we must remember that in a pitiful of electricity come from renewable that be up to under this government 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of solar farm on local community 
 as with any new development solar project may impact community the planning system consider all perspective when balance local impact with national need it be important that local area benefit from host net infrastructure many developer already offer community benefit package 
 if the minister have want to see the impact that a massive solar farm such as the so call lime down carbuncle in my constituency will have on local people he should have come to malmesbury town hall last week where people be protest against this appalling plan in north wiltshire it be go to be acre of panel panel acre blight and mile to the near connection down at melksham it be an absolutely disgraceful proposal it come at a time when wiltshire have out of of the large solar farm we already have enough vastly exceed our county target for solar production will the minister consider the cumulative effect of all these solar farm will he ask the national infrastructure commission to take into account the cumulative effect of solar farm when consider such application 
 i very much thank my hon friend for that question he raise a very interesting topic and that we be listen to the project he speak to be at the pre application stage an application be expect to be submit to the planning inspectorate between january and march due to my quasi judicial role in determine application for development consent it be not appropriate to comment on any specific matter i be aware that some of his constituent be come to parliament this thursday and i will be happy to meet they to discuss their concern 
 what step she be take to support off grid property to decarbonise 
 the government offer grant of £ to those want to install a heat pump or £ to install a biomass boiler under the boiler upgrade scheme support for energy efficiency upgrade and low carbon heat be also available through our help to heat scheme 
 cornwall have a very large number of off grid property way they can decarbonise their heating be through the use of renewable liquid heating fuel last year the government say there would be a consultation on promote and support the use of that fuel in the coming month however in response to a recent write question it be suggest that it would not be launch until at least september this year will the government bring forward the consultation as soon as possible so we can help people to decarbonise through the use of renewable fuel 
 the government recognise the potential for renewable liquid fuel to play a role in decarbonise heat where heat pump be unsuitable and we be work at pace to develop a consultation that will explore that role in more detail we will be issue a consultation in september in line with commitment make by ministers during parliamentary debate on the energy act 
 i support the cause of   the hon member for st austell and newquay steve double the transition to hydrotreate vegetable oil be far cheap than heat pump we be talk about a conversion that be do in an hour for about £ i urge the government to proceed on that with haste 
 it be important to note that we be take this matter incredibly seriously we be also provide funding to tackle fuel poverty and reduce carbon emission through the energy company obligation the home upgrade grant and the social housing decarbonisation fund 
 what step she be take to increase nuclear energy capacity 
 the historic nuclear road map that i announce in january reconfirm the government ’s ambition to deploy up to gw of nuclear power by the road map set out plan to make investment decision concern gw to gw every year between and 
 nuclear be essential not just for our economy but for our national security a truly sovereign supply do not just mean commission new reactor but increase our skill base so i welcome the £ invest in that what step be the department take to ensure that people in community such as heywood and middleton can access that skill funding so they can take advantage of high skille well pay job in the sector 
 my hon friend be absolutely right he be a doughty champion in this area indeed he should be with atom valley in his constituency as he reference last month the prime minister announce significant investment in develop the nuclear skill pipeline help the sector to fill new job by the end of the decade include support plan to double the number of nuclear apprentice and quadruple the number of specialist site and nuclear fission phds 
 what step she be take to help increase investment in green technology 
 what step she be take to help increase investment in green technology 
 the uk have already make tremendous progress in secure investment in green technology recent figure indicate that the uk see £ of investment in mean that since the uk have see £ of public and private investment in low carbon sector as a department the ministerial team and i meet regularly with investor such as through our hydrogen investor forum event and regular roundtable to understand how we can well encourage investment 
 it be true that the uk have a remarkable track record of win investment in green technology but give that other country be now proceed apace with their own green investment plan do my hon friend agree that if we can show that we have effective policy for speed up planning consent for energy project and expand grid capacity at a far fast rate and if we can fix our contract for difference regime we shall be able to demonstrate to investor once again that this be the very good place in which to invest in such technology 
 my right hon friend be right we have a proud record of investment in green and clean technology and in many respect we be lead the world in that regard last year we launch our giga project and this year we be launch cfd allocation round which be the stand out leader when it come to entice investor but of course we can go fast and far and where we can we will that be why i be so pleased to see the work that be be do within my department and indeed with industry with the aim of do just that 
 give that there be no more important technology in the uk ’s green industry than hydrogen i be pleased to note that after much dilly dally the department have listen to my continued advocacy of hydrogen blending in pipe i look forward to see its plan imminently but what support be it give to home appliance provider who want to take advantage of the benefit of hydrogen to create hydrogen ready technology that can be use for both blend and fully hydrogen power appliance 
 my hon friend be another doughty champion for of the expand sector in which we be invest his championing of the hydrogen industry in this country be unmatched i should be happy to meet he to discuss how we can progress far and speed up investment in hydrogen which will be key to secure the progress of so many of our ambitious project 
 along with my hon friend   the member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands i co chair the all party parliamentary group on green deal mis selling after nearly year we be still wait for justice for our constituent who be tell to invest in green technology for their home a legal process be under way but it be very lengthy most of our affected constituent be over when all this happen and some be over 
 there must be a political solution numerous prime ministers and secretaries of state have agree that what happen to our constituent be dreadful so why do they not find a solution that will encourage other people to feel confident that they too can invest in green technology in the knowledge that the government have their back should it go wrong 
 i agree with the hon lady that what happen be dreadful as she have say an ongoing legal process be under way so i be restrict in what i can say at the dispatch box but i should be happy to meet she in the come day to discuss the specific involve her constituent who be affect 
 the south west be proud to be punch above its weight in green technology and will soon welcome a £ gigafactory at the gravity site near bridgwater which will create new job and boost the green economy investment in infrastructure around the country be need if we be to see more development of that kind so what step be the department planning to facilitate such venture 
 it be fantastic to hear liberal democrats champion conservative policy that be bring investment and new job into the country for that be what happen under a conservative government and it be great that a gigafactory be plan for the south west as a result of giga and so many of the other project and fund launch by the department we expect to see many more such development but of course there be work to be do we can go far and fast and as i have say where we can we will i look forward to work with the hon lady in far champion the uk as the destination of choice for all who want to invest in these new technology 
 what recent estimate she have make of the cost of decarbonise the grid by a and b 
 what recent estimate she have make of the cost of decarbonise the grid by a and b 
 our plan to decarbonise the grid by be ambitious but achievable and have be assess as realistic by the climate change committee they will build on the uk ’s achievement in become the major economy to have halve emission accord to independent analysis secure a net grid by would cost taxpayer £ and it would mean a make in china transition 
 the conservatives have a strong track record of promote renewable and this government be support british company and supply chain through programme such as giga with funding which now stand at more than £ do my right hon friend agree that labour ’s unaffordable and unrealistic plan to achieve a net grid by will not give british supply chain time to grow as well as mean the make in china transition to which she have refer 
 i completely agree with my hon friend only recently we have see european country have to wean themselves off russian oil and gas we can not do that only to become dependent on other part of the world for our energy need our plan will give british supply chain time to develop ensure that british worker can reap the benefit of the energy transition accord to expert analysis the labour plan will cost taxpayer £ all to undermine british manufacturing and risk blackout 
 as the secretary of state be aware the environmental audit committee inquiry into decarbonise the economy have hear evidence that no newly commission nuclear capacity even from small modular reactor be able to come on stream until new energy project give planning consent today be unlikely to connect to the grid before and the scale of the necessary grid network roll out to reach our target be already huge what do my right hon friend make of the feasibility let alone the cost that she have highlight today of the fantasy pipe dream of official labour party policy to decarbonise by 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question the plan that we have set out represent the large expansion of nuclear in year with radical reform to the grid however it do take time to build thing labour ’s policy be mad bad and downright dangerous i have yet to meet a serious expert or a single person in the industry who believe it be possible we have a record to be proud of become the major economy to halve our emission but labour ’s plan would heap cost on to taxpayer in stark contrast to our pragmatic and proportionate approach 
 if grid decarbon isation by really do cost the billion of pound that the secretary of state claim she might care to explain why her own policy be to achieve of full decarbonisation by the very same date she know that independent analysis actually say that labour ’s plan would reduce family energy bill by £ a year so will she fess up will she admit that the true price of her failure will be pay for by hard press family in their energy bill 
 i would completely reject that base on the many conversation that i have have with industry and expert the plan that we have set out have be assess by the climate change committee as be realistic the plan that the labour party have set out have be criticise by pretty much every single part of the energy system rather than play politic with this issue the hon gentleman should consider the reality of the taxis the raise bill and the problem with the economy that labour ’s plan would force on britain 
 last year the government promise that they would publish their decarbonisation plan by the end of but they have fail to do so be that because the secretary of state be too embarrassed to admit the truth she be way off track even for deliver clean power by because she have bungle the offshore wind auction be fail on energy efficiency and refuse to end the onshore wind ban be it not the case that she want to attack labour ’s plan because she can not defend her own 
 i thank the hon lady but that be an extraordinary question there would be much more credibility from the labour party if it would recognise that the uk be the country in the g20 the large economy to halve emission while labour member might play politic with this issue i be absolutely happy to defend our position on deal with our climate change obligation in a pragmatic way that protect household finance 
 whether she have make an assessment of the potential merit of public ownership of the energy system 
 properly regulate market which incentivise private capital to invest in the energy system provide the good outcome for consumer and promote market competition as the good driver of efficiency innovation and value 
 despite the minister ’s disagreement public ownership exist in our energy system for example of our offshore wind asset be publicly own just not by the uk they belong to the state own company of country such as denmark and norway publicly own energy company can accelerate the transition to clean energy while create job reduce bill and ensure that the public benefit directly from our common resource country that be lead the transition to renewable have realise this when will the minister 
 i thank the hon member it be flattering i be hour into my role and she would like to upgrade it so that i can personally be in charge of deliver energy company i gently remind she that in her own local authority of nottingham city council robin hood energy which be chair by a politician the public probably want few not more of we manage to cost taxpayer a staggering £ 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the number of oil and gas licence issue by her department on the level of carbon emission from import liquefy natural gas 
 north sea transition authority analysis show that produce natural gas domestically be almost time clean than import liquefy natural gas from abroad without continued licensing our dependence on import oil and gas include lng will only increase more quickly in the future 
 i have always be a fan of we fully exploit our natural resource we have get to take a pragmatic route to cut our carbon emission but at the forefront of our thinking must also be drive down energy cost boost energy security and not do anything that enfeeble our country on the global stage do the minister agree that this be the right approach in term of energy cost and that not import as much liquefy natural gas will also make our carbon footprint small 
 i completely agree with my hon friend ’s analysis utilise our own domestic resource be just common sense when the alternative be to import more fuel from abroad it would be an act of self sabotage to put restriction on our own domestic sector damage job and investment only to liquefy and ship gas from halfway around the world and create more emission in the process 
 i welcome the minister to his post but he will know that most of our gas import be not lng and that they actually come via a pipeline from norway where gas production be half as pollute as it be in the uk new oil and gas would not only be disastrous for our climate it would also fail to boost energy security follow the welcome announcement that the uk will finally withdraw from the energy charter treaty will the government also reverse their decision to license the rosebank oil field which will cost the climate and the public purse extremely dear 
 i thank the hon member for her kind comment while we scale up our clean energy success include in renewable which have go from to there be still a need for oil and gas a failure to issue a new licence would make no difference to the consumption of oil and gas but it would increase import which typically have high emission and also damage our economy 
 whether she plan to support offshore energy grid 
 offshore transmission be central to the government ’s balanced approach to deliver an electricity network fit for net 
 the minister will be aware of the norwich to tilbury pylon proposal which will put metre pylon through swathe of the norfolk suffolk and essex countryside he will also be aware that the recent electricity system operator review indicate that it will soon be cost neutral to have an offshore option for that same energy transition and that multiple point for connect offshore wind turbine to the grid be face planning problem will he do what he can to engage with national grid and get it to do the right thing and look at a cost neutral option of offshore transmission rather than the current onshore proposal 
 my hon friend have a long stand record of make powerful suggestion on behalf of his constituent and neighbouring constituency on this important issue the eso ’s recent study consider a total of a alternative option for transmission route in east anglia include predominantly offshore option and hybrid onshore and offshore option it be important that we try to work with community 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 i would like to pay tribute to my right hon friend   the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart who serve this government for year include as minister for energy security and net since he will be miss in the role for his expertise he attend his cop in and be instrumental in our achievement at cop28 last year he help the uk to halve its emission which be an extraordinary achievement we be the major economy to do so he also work with the net council protect family through the global energy crisis and back british oil and gas worker he leave a legacy of which he can be very proud i would also like to welcome the minister for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for north swindon justin tomlinson a tireless campaigner who i know will continue this government ’s world lead work 
 since i last update the house family be benefit from a drop in the energy price cap worth almost £ a year to the average household i have set out plan to reform tariff save bill payer up to £ a year and invest £ in nuclear skill as part of my plan for the large expansion of nuclear in year 
 the consultation on renewable liquid fuel from september be welcome but the recent survey by the future ready fuel campaign show that of respondent from off grid household actively want the option of switch to a renewable liquid fuel will my right hon friend work with i to ensure that we can get consumer the choice that they actually want and not the heat pump that many do not 
 i thank my hon friend i know that he be a fantastic champion for people live off the gas grid we be support off grid home to transition to heat pump or biomass boiler through the boiler upgrade scheme with grant of up to £ renewable fuel   such as hydrotreate vegetable oil have the potential to play an important role in heat off grid building and we will be issue a consultation on that role by september in line with commitment make by ministers during the passage of the energy act 
 we now come to the shadow secretary of state 
 mr speaker can i start by pay tribute to your father doug he be a remarkable fighter for social justice and we share your sense of loss 
 a year ago after preside over the absolute scandal of the force installation of prepayment meter the right hon lady ’s predecessor promise full compensation for anyone affect unbelievably she have leave it to the energy company to decide who get compensation and how much they have assess people and just get anything—99 get nothing why have she so catastrophically fail to deliver justice for those affect by the ppm scandal 
 the right hon gentleman do actually raise an important issue we have grip the question of prepayment meter since the scandal emerge not only have we make it clear that the horror that we see last winter of people force prepayment meter on vulnerable household should not take place but i have be in contact with ofgem in recent day about make sure that people can get the compensation they deserve at the speed with which they need it 
 that be simply not good enough it be a year on the right hon lady be the energy secretary she should be deliver that compensation to people and she be fail across the board the onshore wind ban remain the offshore wind market crash the insulation scheme be a disaster while she spend her time appease the flat earth anti net brigade in her own party no wonder the former energy minister   the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart   resign be it not the truth that the secretary of state be fail in her job and the british people be pay the price 
 the right hon gentleman do not listen to my previous answer it be this government who work with ofgem to make sure that force prepayment meter installation stop take place for vulnerable household we have say very clearly that it be abhorrent and we do not want to see it again on compensation we be work with ofgem 
 however if the right hon gentleman talk about the wide energy plan and we should do that i think that he should consider the recent comment from industry that labour ’s plan would leave the country uninvestable that they would hike the bill that people would pay and that they would cost so much in need taxis over £ of cost for labour ’s mad plan to decarbonise the grid by which let i be clear be not back by industry the union or consumer 
 we have see the price of fuel go up at the pump because of what have happen in ukraine but in this country we have also see that there be great variety at different   petrol station i be really pleased that the competition and markets authority have look into it and that the government be come forward with pumpwatch we have see something similar in australia that save up to £ for the individual can we make sure that when this come into play the government have an advertising campaign so that the public know that they will be able to see local price up to date every minute for the good place to get their fuel 
 we will publish the government ’s response to the recent pumpwatch consultation as soon as possible and we continue to work closely with the competition and markets authority and the sector technology company to launch pumpwatch this year of course my hon friend make an incredibly important point that when we launch this we will of course make sure that everybody know about this valuable resource 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 we learn last year that no few than department for energy security and net job be go to transfer from london to aberdeen that be champion by no less than the secretary of state for scotland   the right hon member for dumfries and galloway mr jack   and the minister responsible for nuclear and renewable   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie it now transpire that only job will transfer to aberdeen for context that be of the desnz workforce be the secretary of state content for that derisory transfer of job from her department to aberdeen presumably she will not be so what be she go to do about it to give the north east of scotland a well deal 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise this issue we be very proud i be particularly proud that we have announce aberdeen as our headquarters host our headquarters underline the importance of the north east of scotland in our net transition unlike the scottish national party we champion the north east of scotland they be anti exploration anti new licence and anti oil and gas the headquarters already have more than staff and our ambition be for more than by march i have be do some research though it turn out that the scottish government his party ’s government have a grand total of job in his own constituency of angus 
 resident in cranbrook and tithebarn have face frequent energy outage and woeful customer service from e.on ’s district heating network the government ’s energy act mean that district heating network will finally be properly regulate will my right hon friend outline when this regulation will be bring in 
 the initial phase of heat network regulation include transparency rule will come into force in some requirement such as pricing regulation and guarantee performance standard require more market datum and will be introduce in the phase regulation in 
 do the minister acknowledge that the alarm delay in track carbon capture and storage expansion and track timeline endanger the humber ’s status as a global leader in hydrogen and ccs endanger £ of private investment and jeopardise industrial decarbonisation and economic growth 
 we recognise the role that ccs can play for the economy not just in the humber but across the wide british economy which be why we have set out £ of investment commit to this sector we set out an ambitious road map just before christmas and we continue to meet investor to see how we can speed up the process 
 i have be speak to my constituent about the whole net agenda although the people of romford be very determined to see clean and green energy source i have to say that their priority be energy security energy self sufficiency and energy sovereignty i be worried that we be not take the people with we on net because many people simply can not afford this extreme agenda that could end up give china a competitive advantage and bankrupt our own country 
 order i remind member that these be topical question i have to get through they just because the hon gentleman miss out on question it do not mean that he can have an extended topical question let we help each other 
 thank you mr speaker 
 my hon friend   the member for romford andrew rosindell   highlight the importance of work with the public and business whereas the shadow secretary of state sneer at those who be sceptical we have to win heart and mind that be why my hon friend will welcome our power up britain plan to secure our energy system by ensure a resilient and reliable supply increase our energy efficiency and crucially bring down bill 
 do the former energy minister the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart leave because he be worried about lose his seat to labour at the next election or because he could no long bear to support the woeful energy policy of this government which be it 
 i direct the hon gentleman to the letter of my right hon friend   the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart i reiterate our pride in his work and the amazing contribution he have make to this government and this country 
 clayton le moors in my constituency be home to the lancashire centre for alternative technology initiate by the government ’s get building fund will the minister agree to visit to see how the centre be provide financial and research and development support to accelerate the commercialisation of low carbon technology 
 i agree that it be incredibly encouraging and exciting to see those development i would of course be delighted to visit my hon friend in her constituency at any time 
 energy security and net question have once again prove to i how out of touch this place be with the rest of the country the poor of uk household will be make much bad off by net policy accord to a report from york university the poor in ashfield will get poor and rich eco fanatic like dale vince will get rich and pass on some of his million to that lot in the labour party and just stop oil can the minister confirm how much net will cost to the near pound 
 i be very proud of what this government have do to protect the poor in society from rise bill which be the result of international factor and a volatile gas market i make it absolutely clear that the only way that dale vince the climate extremist and his enabler will come anywhere close to have influence on energy policy be if a labour government be elect frankly that be the only thing that vote reform will achieve 
 at my constituency surgery on friday i meet representative of the riddings lane solar action group who be concerned about the proposal to build a new solar farm cover football field worth of land between the village of gleaston dendron leece and newbiggin do the minister agree that solar farm be great but should not go on prime agricultural land 
 as my hon friend be aware we have a presumption against build on the good and most versatile agricultural land due to my quasi judicial role in planning i can not speak to the issue directly but i be very happy to meet he and indeed any representative from his constituency to discuss the project in question 
 i have be contact by a popular village pub that be struggle with its energy debt and astronomical energy bill such pub be at the heart of our local community and they be close at an alarming rate will the secretary of state consider measure to enable they to manage their historical debt by allow they to pay it off more slowly or support they in another way so that we can keep these important pub open 
 i could not agree more that these pub be at the heart of our community which be reason why i have regular meeting with ukhospitality to think about how we can look at bill include thing such as blend and extend 
 on ynys môn company such as mona lifting in llangefni support by the green digital academy which have be fund by £ from the community renewal fund be work hard to use their business to help to deliver net with the installation of solar panel and charge point do the minister agree that it be thank to the   uk government that innovative forward think company such as mona lifting be lead the way so we can deliver net 
 my hon friend once again champion her constituency work with business so that in conjunction we can drive up our use of renewable it be thank to this government that we change the planning rule to make it easy to set up large scale solar installation i also welcome household play their part with solar panel installation a month last year 
 i call rupa huq 
 thank you and big hug mr speaker for the loss of your father 
 my constituent joe stean do the right thing and switch the family car to electric but now the cost and lack of charge point have put he into fuel poverty what be the government do to encourage charge option for people who do not live in detach home be it true that the new minister vote against the emission vehicle mandate 
 it be an important point as a proud electric car driver i have concern that not all people have equal access to charge which i have on the driveway to my house i be therefore thrilled when the government manage to deliver a increase in ev charging point in the last year alone 
 energy security be national security and food security be national security up and down the country there be plenty of rooftop residential industrial and agricultural that be suitable for solar panel will my hon friend the minister reassure the country that we will prioritise those site for our solar footprint rather than jeopardise prime food produce land or indeed our precious greenbelt 
 my hon friend be absolutely right food security and energy security be both vital which be why the uk solar taskforce identify the need to address barrier relate to rooftop solar deployment include access to finance as a priority the rooftop subgroup be establish to focus specifically on this area and we be explore option to facilitate low cost finance from retail lender to help household and business with the up front cost of solar installation on rooftop 
 smart meter be vital to help family to cut bill and save money on their energy outlay yet the government ’s own figure show that smart meter be faulty be that not another catastrophic failure when be the secretary of state go to get a grip on the issue 
 clearly this be an issue that concern we in the government which be why we be strive to do everything that we can to make sure that we be solve the issue 
 the giant pylon they be absolutely huge associate with the transmission route have cause grave concern in the highland can i have an assurance that strong consideration will   be give to undergrounde the cable near the community that be affect and indeed to go under the ocean where that be possible 
 while   the hon member for bristol east kerry mccarthy   heckle to say that there be yet another nimby we recognise that we want to work with community and respect local knowledge to inform present and future work all transmission project be require to progress through the robust planning process which include statutory consultation and individual planning review and i be sure that the hon member will feed into that directly 
 per cent of property in this country do not even have an energy performance certificate and of those that do in the private rented sector and in the private ownership sector only be epc c rat last year we make an improvement of only on this epc c be the standard so when do the minister expect that we will ever get to epc c in our housing stock and what be the government do to increase the speed of the process 
 the pace of delivery of the great british insulation scheme be accelerate quickly with the rate of delivery double over the past month we have a proud record on energy efficiency in we inherit a situation in which only of home be well insulate but now we have that figure up to nearly 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for transport if he will make a statement on step be take to prevent job loss in the uk ’s rail manufacturing sector 
 mr speaker before i start may i thank you for have i up in your constituency of chorley over the easter holiday i pass on my deep condolence to you and your family for the loss of your father 
 i thank the hon lady for her urgent question i be respond on behalf of the secretary of state who will shortly be meet the alstom group chairman and chief executive to discuss a potential way forward the secretary of state will come to the house and make a statement at the appropriate time note the fact that they be sensitive commercial discussion 
 as set out in the comprehensive open letter from the secretary of state to the hon lady on   march the government be well aware that company such as alstom and hitachi face short term gap in their order book the letter set out clearly that these be complex problem to which there be not simple solution but the government have be do everything they can to support the workforce over many month and continue to do so 
 while alstom be currently consult its union and employee on possible job loss this must be a commercial decision for alstom the government have be work with the company to explore option to enable it to continue manufacture at its derby site we have convene a cross whitehall group to advise on how to support continued production at derby and how good to support those worker who be at risk of redundancy we have hold similar discussion with hitachi both in correspondence and face to face we remain keen to work with hitachi as it look for commercial solution to guarantee the long term sustainable future of its newton aycliffe site hitachi be not currently consult on any change to its workforce 
 the fact remain that the market for passenger train be a competitive the department can not guarantee order for individual manufacturer train be major asset with a lifetime of to year so there will naturally be peak and trough in the procurement cycle nevertheless we expect substantial continued demand for new train in recent month london north eastern railway confirm an order of new tri mode train for the east coast main line a tender for new train for transpennine express be launch in december 
 in january this year i write to train manufacturer to outline the pipeline of current and expect order for new train that include detail of current competition for northern southeastern chiltern and transpennine express and an expect procurement by great western railway the contract be worth an estimate £ with more than vehicle to be procure over the come year in the meantime we will continue to work with uk manufacturer include alstom and hitachi to ensure that there be a strong and sustainable future for the rail industry 
 may i add my personal condolence to you mr speaker for the loss of your great father he be a fine man and a great champion for warrington and for worker right 
 britain ’s rail manufacturing be in crisis of our large train manufacturer have warn that their very presence in this country be at risk alstom in derby be star down the barrel of job loss and hitachi in newton aycliffe another in their supply chain it be more than job alstom have be make train in derby for year but both alstom and hitachi be clear that their uncertain future be thank to this government ’s inaction alstom ’s manage director have say that continue delay in provide certainty and clarity from the transport secretary be to blame 
 the fact be that the secretary of state have know about this problem for month i raise hitachi ’s concern with he in this house more than a year ago both manufacturer have say that the situation could be rectify by amend their order schedule for a small number of exist privately finance train and we understand that the transport secretary have be privately promise they action on that for month but crucial deadline have be miss avoidable job loss have already be make and local business have already be force to close 
 the minister dismiss people ’s livelihood as peak and trough in his letter to i of   march the transport secretary as usual duck all responsibility he claim that he have no influence over procurement contract yet his department have varied contract in the past he claim that this be nothing to do with his mismanagement of hs2 but both struggle manufacturer claim otherwise he claim that he be provide certainty for the industry yet he be refuse to bring forward his long delay rail reform or set out a rolling stock strategy for the industry 
 britain be the country that create the railway but that legacy be be trash by a conservative government content to oversee its manage decline will the minister and the secretary of state finally take responsibility put aside their ideological opposition to support british business and finally step up for the people of derby and newton aycliffe and for britain ’s railway 
 the hon lady ask whether the secretary of state will take responsibility and work on this matter he be do that right now he be about to start a meeting with the chief executive and chairman and that be not the meeting he have hold meeting with alstom and with hitachi to find solution our official in the department for transport have work incredibly hard as have everybody in the whole derby family the train operator the union that i have meet and the workforce we be all row together to try to find a solution 
 i have to say that it do not help to see this cause be use almost like a political football as an example i do not use the expression peak and trough when it come to deal with individual i say that the procurement cycle lead to that my word will be clear in hansard and i resent have they misinterpret because it impact on people and their feeling i find it quite irresponsible of the opposition to do that 
 another example of get the fact completely wrong be the continued mention of hs2 let i be clear the order for hs2 be for train that order remain at train because they be always for phase which be go ahead the schedule remain the same and the number of train remain the same so let we deal with the fact rather than the fiction and scaremongere that i hear so often 
 when it come to fact let i say that of the train manufacturer we be proud to have in this country have be build their plant here since under this conservative government no doubt they decide to do so because we have commission new rolling stock vehicle since the average age of roll stock be year back in it be now under year because we be invest in rolling stock and there will be more order none the less it be a complex legal solution that require sensible mind and i be very proud that the secretary of state be lead on that endeavour 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 i be pleased that the secretary of state and the minister be take charge of negotiation with alstom hitachi and other i appreciate that as commercially sensitive discussion be ongoing the minister be constrain in what he can say but they need to be resolve soon the wide issue be the peak and trough not just in roll stock procurement but in railway industry investment more generally how do the minister believe great british railways and wide rail reform will help to smooth out the peak and trough in the long term 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for his work the committee as a whole have look at this issue and really probe for solution on the gbr point it be also provide the body of pre legislative scrutiny of rail reform and i thank my hon friend and his committee for their work in that endeavour he be absolutely right that a more holistic approach to the railway in which track and train be integrate will help we to make further decision into the future and give more certainty with regard to order none the less i have set out the order that have be take over the precede year the order book be healthy and we will look to get the tender out this year and next for the train operator that i have mention 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 my condolence to you and your family mr speaker on the loss of your father 
 clearly the news come out of derby about the precarious nature of alstom be grim not just for the worker and the wide economy of derby but for everyone involve in the supply chain across the country include rail supply job in scotland the fact be that this be predict we have all know about it for month these be skilled well pay job of the type that we be continually tell the uk be in the market for 
 do the minister accept that the stop start procurement of new roll stock be a direct result of the fragmented and disconnected railway system that have place   financialisaton and the treasury ’s miserly attitude to investment above rail ’s key role in a decarbonised century society why be roll stock leasing company rule the roost rather than straightforward procurement how be it possible that the island that invent the modern railway the anniversary of the stockton and darlington railway be next year could have next to train production capacity within a matter of month we need a proper rail strategy and integration when will that rail reform be put before the house 
 again let we look at the fact since new rolling stock vehicle have be manufacture that be out of a total fleet of so it be a relatively young fleet take into account the fact that the fleet tend to last to year and that it now have an average of year service i hope that the hon gentleman will see that there have be a substantial investment in roll stock from the government the uk taxpayer and from private train operator 
 the hon gentleman ask when the legislation for rail reform will be bring forward i be very keen for that to happen and it be on its journey right now the transport committee of which he be a lead member be provide the pre legislative scrutiny i very much hope that the committee will finish its work in time for the summer recess give we month to respond and that there will be cross party support in both houses for what be i believe be sensible legislation that will allow we to deliver rail reform 
 although labour be play party politic on this issue it be really important for derby and derbyshire include for the worker at alstom and in the supply chain that feed into it will the minister confirm that conservative members of parliament have be work with the secretary of state over the whole period and that he have be work with alstom for many many month to get this right 
 i thank my hon friend the members for mid derbyshire mrs latham and for derby north amanda solloway for the amount of work that they have put in to press we privately but firmly to ensure that we be work on this issue give their concern as constituency mps i could not credit they enough for the amount of work that have go in on their side and for do it sensibly and that include those in derby council to whom we be grateful i believe that this be the way to approach the matter the number of meeting that we have have the cross departmental taskforce that be in place and the sheer number of hour that the official have put in have all lead we to a point where we very much hope to be able to provide a solution the matter be complex there be legal challenge and these type of contract often end up in litigation so we have to be careful with the process but we be keen to find that solution i thank my hon friend for their work 
 i be disappointed and sorry to hear what   the hon member for mid derbyshire mrs latham   just say because as she know perfectly well there have be a substantial amount of cross party work on this issue over many month and year give that the factory be in my   constituency i find it a little disappointing that although i be tell that there have be many meeting between the secretary of state and local conservative member at no point have he or his office choose to involve i 
 however that do not matter at all what really matter and what i find most difficult about this whole issue be that over the year that i have be in this house we have have so many of these conversation about fail industry we ask what be the prospect for the future and there be a struggle and as always an argument between those who want to look to the long term and those who want short term financial saving this be not an industry in which that be the problem in the long term there will be million of pound worth of order for roll stock because roll stock renewal be need right across the country as everybody in the rail industry be aware it be an industry with prospect and an ongoing realistic vision of secure high value and high reward job yet in which government inaction be i be afraid put those job at risk particularly as be say moment ago on both side of the house in the supply chain 
 i thank the right hon member for the point she have raise the discussion have be cross party the leader of derby council have work very closely with the department to try to broker a solution i will take away her point about meeting i do not have that information to hand but i will ensure she get the meeting she have ask for 
 the point i be make be that the comment from the labour front bench do not help matter at all this be a sensitive commercially and legally challenging situation that we be try to find a way through we can not find contract just for train manufacturer we have and it have to be an open process otherwise the matter end up in court despite that we be do everything we can to find the right order for those train manufacturer as well as the letter i have write to all of the manufacturer specify the tender pipeline that be to come the secretary of state have write to all the entity that finance train operator make the point that they should bring forward matter that they can see that will help with refurbishment as well as new rolling stock 
 i thank the rail minister for the huge level of rail investment go into my constituency as he know alongside my hon friend the members for dewsbury mark eastwood and for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates we secure £ of levelling up cash for upgrade on the penistone line with station at honley and brockholes in my constituency i thank the rail minister for visit huddersfield railway station last year and i be pleased to report that a major upgrade which be part of the £ trans pennine route upgrade be under way at that station once that be complete there will be major upgrade to slaithwaite and marsden station include disabled access rail investment be be deliver to my wonderful part of west yorkshire 
 i thank my hon friend he be a champion of the railway and it be an absolute delight to visit he at huddersfield station and talk about some   of those project of course his point be completely relevant to the matter before we the trans pennine route upgrade for which there will be more government investment than there be for the entirety of crossrail allow we to put an order in for transpennine express train so there will be more train manufacture as well as well station long platform and more resilience interruption i thank that team which be do a brilliant job which the sunday times have highlight rather than chuntere it would be nice if the opposition thank those who deliver railway project to time and on budget 
 my condolence on your loss mr speaker i thank you on behalf of the workforce for grant this urgent question because the situation be become critical 
 my union unite tell i that there be over people employ on temporary contract at hitachi in newton aycliffe and at alstom in derby whose job be already at risk this be before any formal redundancy occur unite believe that that could happen as soon as june i be well aware that the minister know that the industry need a steady stream of order to sustain train manufacturing here in the uk and preserve those vital job in area such as county durham where we do not have an abundance of skilled employment so in all honesty i earnestly ask the minister to use his good office to persuade the secretary of state to intervene urgently and ensure a bright future for this vital uk train manufacturing industry 
 i certainly take that point from my good friend the hon member have work tirelessly for the rail workforce and i know that he mean everything he say with passion and conviction i have talk about the situation be a complex from a legal perspective and i would take he back to the contract award for hs2 which go to alstom and hitachi that be challenge in court by siemens the department succeed on every single point but that just show how careful we have to be from a legal perspective during the tendering process because it will end up in litigation the bad thing would be to hand out contract in a manner that be not legally fair and then find that they be be unpick which bring fresh uncertainty instead we be look at the entire order book to see where we can bring matter forward in the pipeline matter that alstom may be work on already where it be the fair and right thing to do we be look to see whether we can bring those contract order forward in the pipeline 
 the situation at alstom be of great concern to a number of my constituent who work there however probably even more of my constituent work in the supply chain so will my hon friend reassure i and my constituent that whatever the outcome of today ’s discussion that supply chain will not be forget 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we be talk not just about the job at the manufacture plant in derby but about all the job throughout the supply chain i work really closely with the supply chain and its trade representative the railway industry association and railfuture and i be keen to continue to do so our work and our endeavour be to try to find a   solution not just for the workforce in derby work directly for alstom but for those who be temporarily employ at alstom and for the entire supply chain that be why the secretary of state be meet alstom right now so that we can try to find a solution for they all 
 the government ’s inaction in sign off new order for train be now threaten hundred of job in county durham and wipe million of pound off the value of rail manufacturing company inadequate supply to our rail infrastructure will have a big impact on decarbonise the uk transport system be the minister aware of that and what be the government do in the long term to invest in our rail infrastructure 
 thank to the uk taxpayer the government have invest over £ in the railway and a lot of that investment have go through to roll stock as i have mention the rolling stock be now on average under year old with a life cycle that go to to year i will give the hon lady a good example of where the future be bright in the area of innovation and technology great western have just complete a battery trial for a train that have cover mile with stop on just single charge my hope be that as well as new order for train we will find new solution for manufacturing rolling stock that be green than it be right now 
 my condolence to you mr speaker 
 many of my constituent be involve in rail manufacturing both at hitachi and in the wide supply chain and be genuinely concerned about the situation can my hon friend reassure i and my constituent that this situation be get the full attention of the secretary of state and can he outline to the house why the issue be not as simple as the stroke of a pen as allege by the labour party 
 i can give my hon friend that assurance he be absolutely right this be a complex matter and it be important that we get it right we be work with alstom with the council and with all other party 
 i should just correct the record i be very happy to take up this issue with   the right hon member for derby south dame margaret beckett but my understanding be that she meet the secretary of state for an hour on   march which she say she have not 
 indicate assent 
 that be correct good i be glad i have get that on the record 
 my hon friend   the member for darlington peter gibson   be absolutely right this matter be complex and challenging but i can tell you mr speaker and the house that the secretary of state be work at full pelt on this matter with alstom i be hopeful that a solution will be find that will demonstrate all of that hard work 
 derby ’s litchurch lane be unique the only site in the uk that design develop build and test train as have already   be acknowledge the alstom factory be a very significant employer but it also support thousand of good supply chain job particularly in nottinghamshire and derbyshire frankly this government will never be forgive if that factory be allow to close due to an entirely avoidable gap in order the minister say that this matter be complex but my question be simple when do the department for transport intend to issue the invitation to tender for the promise new train fleet for chiltern northern and southeastern 
 the answer be over the course of this year and next year for all of the train manufacturer that the hon lady have mention i well remember the visit that both she and i make to the alstom site with the transport committee as she rightly say it be a fantastic site which be why we be work to find a solution i be certainly encourage by the conversation that have take place we know that everyone want to find that solution the government certainly do but the hon lady will know from all her work on the transport committee that legal challenge have to be deal with in the correct manner this matter be very sensitive and it be market sensitive as well so find a way through which provide certainty and do not get unpicked be absolutely the right thing for we to do and that be what we be do right now 
 the threat to the alstom factory in derby be of great concern to the employee in amber valley and those employ by the supply chain their mood be not help by the fact that this appear to be a problem not with the quality of the train or even with their price but with compliance with procurement rule that we ourselves put in place only a year or so ago if it come down to a choice between have all the i ’ dotted and t ’s cross or have that factory save for the long term can i urge the minister to take a risk on the contract sort that out later and save the factory rather than prioritise the contract and risk lose the factory 
 as my hon friend have describe this be a careful balance i reiterate that if we be to award contract outside of the usual process other workforce would also be impact such as those in newport in newton aycliffe and in the hull area we have to take into account the whole workforce as well as fair process on the contract however as he mention train be be manufacture right now and roll off the production line up in derby south western train and east midland train and they be good quality train as i have say the challenge be that we have produce a lot of train over the year and i really want to help those train manufacturer to export more because that will fill up the order book so that they be not reliant only on the domestic market as it get fresher and young in roll stock year we need to find a solution outside this country 
 i offer my condolence to you mr speaker 
 the minister say this be a complex issue but be it not rather simple these company will not be around to enjoy the sort of export opportunity he talk about if they do not sustain on his answer to my hon friend   the member for nottingham south lilian greenwood   can he just apply his mind to what he say about the invitation to tender if it be go to take that long to issue those tender these company will not be around it be not about they not compete it be about their be able to compete and to be here can he not recognise that it be the constant chopping and change in procurement that have land the rail industry in this terrible situation
