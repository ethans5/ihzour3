 workplace sexual harassment blight our society not a week go by in which we do not hear about sexual misconduct in an organisation somewhere in the uk some of woman have experience at least incident of sexual harassment at work most victim do not report it for fear of not be believe or of damage their working relationship and career prospect although sexual harassment be not confine to woman the vast majority of victim be woman 
 harassment have a devastating impact on victim nearly half of woman harass at work say that it have harm their mental health in say that they avoid certain work situation such as meeting course location and shift to avoid the perpetrator more than in say that they want to leave their job but could not nearly in leave their job as a result of this treatment 
 every person should be safe from sexual harassment but every day new story expose the extent of the problem in our workplace just this year there have be a torrent of misconduct allegation against prominent company and organisation there remain question to be answer at the cbi odey asset management the royal national lifeboat institution the fire service the national crime agency and even our nhs 
 the hon lady be make a very important speech about a powerful topic as a former nhs employee for over year i be aware of some poor practice and lack of control over certain individual who be sexual predator they be only a small minority but they have a massive impact on other nhs worker do she agree with i that we must protect our precious nhs staff and stamp out sexual harassment in all workplace 
 i could not agree more the hon lady point out that a few individual damage the reputation of a whole organisation and especially when it come to our nhs that be devastating the bill should be good for organisation because it protect they as well 
 will the hon lady clarify i be not sure from her remark so far whether she be in favour of lords amendment or be she speak against it 
 i will come to that later but i will be support the lords amendment 
 there be many good employer who have implement measure to safeguard their employee however far too many have not do enough to prevent and punish sexual harassment 
 my hon friend be make a powerful speech about an issue that as she say have blight our workplace do she agree that part of the problem be that employer do not act when harassment begin at a low level put worker down talk over they and belittle they be just the start and it grow from there too often in the past people have just be move to a different department will her bill put an end to that sort of atmosphere in the workplace 
 yes it should be the beginning of a culture change to prevent sexual harassment happen before it get to a point where it have such damaging effect 
 the equality and human rights commission find that in nearly half of case report the employer take no action minimise the incident or place the responsibility on the employee to avoid the harasser what also find again and again be that the employer do not really know what to do when the bill become law there will be guidance for employer so that they know exactly what be expect of they that should help organisation to face those problem 
 i thank the hon lady for give way because she be make a very important speech protect people especially woman from harassment be hugely important the government have a fantastic track record of bring in legislation to protect vulnerable people i have strong concern about the bill in its unamended state particularly on make employer responsible for party harassment however yesterday i contact denise rossiter the chief executive of essex chamber of commerce to ask the opinion of essex business the message i receive back be clear local essex employer warmly welcome   the amendment make to the bill in the other place   i be delighted the government have back they i welcome the amendment in particular lords amendment and i support the bill in its amend state 
 i thank the hon lady for that intervention and i be pleased we have come to a point across both houses where we can pass the bill as amend into law i will come to the amendment later in my speech and she will hear what i have to say 
 the current law on sexual harassment mean that employer often adopt individualised response to institutional problem that create space for employer to minimise what be go on and lead to confusion about how to respond appropriately only of manager feel support by their organisation when report be make to they ultimately our current law do not protect people who have encounter traumatic experience we can and must do well 
 my bill will strengthen the legislative protection against workplace sexual harassment it will help to create safe working environment that be fit for the century it introduce a standalone duty for employer to take responsible step to prevent sexual harassment within their organisation that will make a real difference as it will require employer to take proactive step to address sexual harassment it will help to instil a culture change and it will ensure that people who abuse woman and other can no long rely on their workplace turn a blind eye instead they will be hold accountable for their action make workplace safe more productive and more enjoyable for everyone 
 i have be pleased to see cross party consensus for my bill from the outset with all party willing to work together to ensure its passage there have be unstinting cross party support from a sizeable majority of mp and peer which clearly demonstrate that workplace sexual harassment be not a party political issue anymore i be glad that today should mark the final point of the passage of these vital protection into law it take the good part of to get we here and i thank everybody involve for their patience and support i express my particular gratitude to the minister for women and equalities and the government whips whose support during the up and down of the difficult passage of the bill i have greatly appreciate 
 i say a big thank you to baroness burt of solihull who have work tirelessly in the other place to ensure that my bill get to this stage my thank also go to the team at the government equalities office whose constant advice and encouragement have be outstanding finally i thank my own team for stick with i 
 i will now speak to lords amendment and which have undoubtedly narrow the scope of my bill lord amendment table by lord hannan of kingsclere remove clause from the bill get rid of the propose liability of employer for party harassment in the workplace it mean that incident of party harassment will continue not to be cover by the law other than in extreme case result in clear personal injury or where a criminal offence have be commit the legal situation   will remain as it have be since party harassment protection be repeal in i personally think that that be a shame 
 lords amendment table by baroness noakes narrow the concept of all reasonable step to simply reasonable step the practical step that an employer might take would be substantially the same for example employer might consider implement an effective equality policy provide anti harassment training and deal effectively with employee complaint among other thing the difference in the wording mean that the tribunal would apply a low threshold when assess a breach of the employer duty compare with the original drafting of the bill 
 the equality act already contain a statutory defence that require an employment tribunal assessment of whether an employer take all reasonable step to determine legal liability the amendment will not change the equality act ’s exist statutory defence but will create a different test for the new duty on employer to prevent sexual harassment the employer duty will still send a strong signal to employer that they need to take action to prioritise prevention of sexual harassment and ultimately improve workplace practice and culture 
 i can not stand here and say that i be completely happy with the amendment but if i do not accept they the bill would not progress into law and that would be a lot bad peer in the other place have reach an understanding with baroness burt of solihull and i to ensure the passage of the sexual harassment preventive duty we have accept the amendment under discussion today the long it take for legislation prevent sexual harassment to become law the more worker especially woman will be leave at risk of workplace sexual harassment that would simply not be acceptable 
 in the face of continuous scandal we as lawmaker can not stand by and do nothing once the bill have pass into law it will be the beginning of a much need culture change i have be most grateful for the guidance of the fawcett society and the wide alliance for woman who continue to support the bill because of the substantial difference it will make to woman ’s life without their support and guidance i would not have be able to take this revise bill forward those group remain disappointed that the clause that would have provide protection from party harassment have not be take forward i fully accept their disappointment further protection be essential to give business and organisation clarity on what they need to do to make their workplace safe for everybody we hope that the debate on this bill have encourage all business and organisation to recognise that they can make a significant difference in protect staff from harassment by customer and client there remain unfinished business but the discussion be move we forward and it be important that we get cross party support in both houses which be why i keep say that i be accept the lords amendment 
 the government ’s own survey on sexual harassment find that every day people face sexual harassment from a party at work that do not even consider the scale of other form of party harassment for example those of a racist or homophobic nature i will continue to make the case for protection against party harassment to be put in place and i hope that the government will listen and continue to   work with the fawcett society and the wide alliance for woman to bring the require legislation forward in the next parliament 
 i be content that as of today we have reach a consensus on a pragmatic way forward it be vital that we send a clear signal that sexual harassment in the workplace be not acceptable and step should be take to prevent it i be grateful for the cross party support and particularly the support of the government i ask the house to accept the lords amendment so that this bill can pass into law no should have to wait any long for this vital step towards safe and more respectful workplace 
 i do not propose to divide the house today and i be happy that we have get to a place where the bill have be effectively gutte by their lordship i be happy with the cross party consensus on where we have get to it be right that we have remove the party liability but there be something regrettable about the way this bill have develop there be a good moment when in response to pressure from their lordship the government propose to introduce a new defence against equality act harassment whereby it should be possible to defend a suit on the ground that there be no intention to injure the injure party and merely overheard conversation and civil discussion be they among colleague or customer should not be liable to legal action that be a good step it develop and improve our equality law in response to pressure from the other place the government have now withdraw the party liability measure which be a good thing i agree with my hon friend   the member for southend west anna firth   that we be now in a position to abstain from oppose this bill 
 however we need to debate our equality framework in this country fundamentally we need to stop bring forward what i call performative legislation intend simply to outlaw behaviour we disapprove of immoral conversation bad manner and action likely to cause hurt and distress we can not legislate against all of those action and if we try 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 i will be happy to give way to the hon lady in a moment i recognise that we all intend to do the right thing by bring forward this legislation i recognise that the government be try to do the right thing as be   the hon member for bath wera hobhouse however we get into all sort of trouble when opposition member get hold of this sort of law in committee and when the court be require to judge on what will necessarily be obscure language about the management of human relation and free speech the precedent be set by this law be dangerous 
 do the hon gentleman agree that a lot of the damage that be do in a workplace which leave an individual perhaps a young in their employment feel undermine damage bully and harass often come from exactly the sort of casual conversation they overhear in a canteen or in the office the intent of the bill be not to be restrictive of people but to protect young people in the workplace on whom these thing can have a huge impact 
 the hon lady define exactly the issue she talk about the intent of the bill be to protect people from feel distressed which i think be absolutely right we should all intend that but it be difficult for law to manage and protect people ’s feeling the consequence of write that into black and white mean that we then require court to adjudicate on all sort of very difficult emotional issue 
 the hon lady talk about the intent behind the bill we all intend the right thing here we be all in unity that we disapprove of harassment and incivility but we disapprove of all sort of thing that we can not and should not try to criminalise the consequence of criminalise bad manner even very bad manner be fundamentally to curtail free speech and the freedom upon which all of our civility as a society depend 
 i be glad that we be have this discussion in a very respectful way because that be how it should work i recognise that that discussion may not have be have enough and we need a little more time have it do the hon gentleman think that legislation guide well behaviour and that for that reason it be important that we pass certain law that be the intention of the bill as i say i have accept the lords amendment but do he agree that legislation guide well behaviour and that be what we should aim for 
 this be an important discussion the hon lady be say that the law be a teacher indeed it be and influence the culture it be also true that the law need to reflect the culture so we modernise our legislative framework in response to public opinion and how thing be we now legalise thing that be illegal in the past in response to the way culture evolve 
 however the law be a teacher in a bad way too it can introduce negative effect into our culture and chill free speech it can inhibit the sort of conversation that be necessary for the development and progress of our society which be a topic that will come up later in other legislation there be significant attempt during the pandemic to effectively criminalise or inhibit free speech around the pandemic response on exactly the same ground that we might use in this debate namely that it be important for public protection and the protection of the vulnerable that misinformation disinformation and in this context harassment should be criminalise that be wrong and i really worry about the possible chilling effect of this legislation 
 a narrow gap be leave in this law to criminalise free speech many member will raise the outrageous and unacceptable behaviour that many employee have to put up with in the workplace i recognise that too we absolutely need to insist that that do not happen but that be a job for the culture and for employer in a sense it be a job for all of we to instil the right sort of moral conduct in our community but frankly it be impossible to write legislation in black and white that achieve the outcome the hon lady wish without also inhibit free speech 
 i will end with an observation about another piece of legislation that i understand be be contemplate for the king ’s speech a conversion therapy ban i be afraid that that be another instance where under the noble and honourable impulse to stop outrageous and unacceptable practice go on we be propose a   piece of performative legislation in response to a vocal and activist lobby group that will put into law an imprecise and fuzzy set of moral aspiration once opposition member get hold of it in committee on reading and in the house of lords the scope will be expand and then court will be require to criminalise conversation between adult and their therapist parent and child which be exactly what happen in other country where this well intentione legislation have be pass into law the law be a teacher but it be not an opportunity for moral grandstanding and virtue signalling we have an obligation to put into black and white word that the court clearly understand and that do not end up curtail free speech 
 it be a relief that we have this bill back here today give that it be report early in the year that it be likely to be shelve possibly because of the backlash we have just hear the bill have come back from the other place albeit heavily amend and it still represent a step in the right direction albeit a very small   the hon member for bath wera hobhouse   have do a sterling job in get this bill through the parliamentary maze she have be extremely gracious and generous in her comment today give what be leave in the bill i think it be a fine description to say that it have be narrow in scope alternatively it could be describe as   the hon member for devizes danny kruger   have just do as have have the gut rip out of it i know which description suit what have happen well 
 there be quite a contrast between what we have now and what we have when the bill start its journey through the house the bill be never about criminalise free speech it be about tackle a real and live issue in the workplace 
 when the bill start its passage member rightly speak in unison about the appalling scale and nature of sexual harassment in britain ’s workplace indeed we should all be deeply concerned about the number of woman face harassment at work the late datum from the government show that nearly in employee experience some form of sexual harassment in the previous year that mean that woman each year experience harassment in the workplace and we know that the impact on those victim can be profound we know that it can lead to a variety of harm include psychological physical and economic harm and all too often the perpetrator get away with it accord to recent datum of perpetrator of sexual harassment see no sanction at all meanwhile of those who be sexually harass end up work elsewhere due to their experience in that be not good enough those figure speak for themselves about why parliamentary intervention be need 
 i be glad that we be support this bill my hon friend talk about woman be subject to sexual harassment and we know that the problem be endemic but it also seem that increasingly young man be report that they be fall foul of that even in this place it be really important that we recognise that man particularly young man can be victim as well 
 yes that be absolutely right the equality act be frame in such a way that it protect everyone from harassment on the basis of their sex i think that we now have a bill that after the amendment to our regret will not protect worker from party harassment the duty to take all reasonable step have now be reduce or water down to take reasonable step we be disappointed that the bill return in a form that look very different from what be originally pass by this house it seem that the original good intention of the bill have to use the term of the hon member for devizes be gutted and i be sorry to say that seem to have be with the support of the government let we not forget that when the bill pass through the commons originally it do have support from the government and it also have cross party support which be a rarity these day therefore it be extremely disappointing that the democratically elect house seem to have give in to the unelected lords seemingly with the endorsement of the government 
 i have to say that the government ’s decision to support the lords amendment that have take the gut out of the bill be frustrating give that the bill be enact pledge that the government have make 
 do the hon gentleman not recognise that this be the bill of   the hon member for bath wera hobhouse   and it be up to she to decide which amendment she do or do not accept the government have fully support the hon lady this be not a government decision it be part of the parliamentary process 
 i thank the minister for her comment the government have a majority so if they want to keep the bill in its original form they could have ensure that it pass let i quote what she say at committee stage she say that 
 the government commit to a package of new measure aim at reduce incidence of workplace harassment that include the legislative measure be bring forward in the bill explicit protection for employee from workplace harassment by party such as customer and client and a duty on employer to take all reasonable step to prevent their employee from experience sexual harassment ”––[official report worker protection amendment of equality act public bill committee   november c. 
 it be true that i have accept the lords amendment indeed it be ultimately i who propose that we should go all the way in order to preserve thing that i find incredibly important which be the preventive duty on employer do the hon member not agree that this be an important step and for that reason it be right that i accept the lords amendment 
 i accept what the hon member say we will certainly not oppose the bill but we do have to challenge the minister on why she have change her mind give that last year she say that the measure in the bill 
 continue to form a key part of the government ’s national strategy for tackle violence against woman and girl ”––[official report worker protection amendment of equality act public bill committee   november c. 
 why have the government decide to change their mind on it it seem to i that they have fold to pressure from their back benchers let we not forget that the bill come about as a result of an extensive government consultation which receive more than response 
 it be not necessarily for i to come to the government ’s defence here but i think the hon gentleman be tie himself up in knot with his argument the amendment be pass in the house of lords he will have notice i be sure that the government do not have a majority in that house so they can not be hold responsible for an amendment pass in it if the government have do as he ask by overturn the lords amendment the bill would have fall altogether so i be not entirely sure what he be argue for 
 i be sure that the hon member be aware that we vote regularly on lords amendment in this place and that the government use their majority to overturn they the point that i be try to make be this where do this leave government policy on the issue the fawcett society find that of woman work in the hospitality sector and of those work in the service industry have face sexual harassment in the workplace what will the government do about that 
 if the hon gentleman wish to press the matter to a vote as a point of principle he could vote down the lords amendment i be sure that my hon friend   the member for devizes danny kruger   would be delighted if he do because in do so he would guarantee that the whole bill fall be that really what he want 
 no that be not what i want which be why i have say that we will not oppose the amendment but we be still entitle to express our disappointment about the capitulation the equality and human rights commission ’s report find 
 a quarter of those report harassment say the perpetrator be party 
 and that party sexual harassment be deal with poorly and consider 
 a normal part of the job 
 by some employer i do not think that be a situation that we should defend let we be clear we would not have object to the bill if that have be in place we certainly would have support it but we will support it as it stand because as the hon member for bath say it be an important step in the right direction albeit a much small step than originally intend 
 the question remain what be the government ’s plan to deal with party harassment if they will not bring forward a legislative solution what do they intend to do if there be a repeat of the scene at the president club tomorrow what would be the consequence for the perpetrator we need answer to those question 
 despite the removal of the word all from the bill the duty to prevent sexual harassment be as the hon member for bath say a new duty that represent a positive step forward establish that preventive duty will shift the emphasis away from a reliance on individual report harassment to employer and will encourage   employer to take preventive step we be optimistic we can be and hope that the bill will drive structural change by fundamentally shift the responsibility from the individual to the institution but what that will mean in reality and how much capacity the ehrc will have to investigate complaint remain to be see its responsibility to create a statutory code of practice should mean that the focus will be more on work with employer do the minister have any information on when she expect that statutory code of practice to be publish should the bill be pass and will it draw mainly from the non statutory code of practice that have already be produce 
 we believe that everyone should be able to go to work safe from sexual harassment know that their employer have take step to create a safe work environment that be why a labour government would go much far than the house have today 
 i congratulate   the hon member for bath wera hobhouse   on progress this bill which tackle the important issue of sexual harassment in the workplace i thank she for the pragmatism she have show to ensure that the bill can progress with agreement from across the house it be slightly disappointing to see the shadow minister   the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders take such a partisan approach because the bill have have cross party support throughout all its stage 
 it be often very difficult for private member bill to pass through this place but the government have fully support the bill because it be such an important issue to tackle we have especially make time for an additional sitting friday to ensure that the bill pass we remain committed to tackle sexual harassment in the workplace by introduce the employer duty to strengthen protection in the equality act 
 while i note the concern from my hon friend the members for southend west anna firth and for devizes danny kruger i be very pleased that consensus have be reach here and in the other place and i hope member will agree that this important bill should now be on the statute book i would like to particularly thank my hon friend the member for devizes who have some genuine concern about the bill that he have express today and at previous stage 
 this be a difficult subject while there may be difference in view and opinion i be really pleased that the hon member for bath have be able to progress the bill through both houses because we need to make our workplace well and safe that be particularly true for woman we have hear recently about some of the experience of female surgeon in the healthcare system with my other hat on as a health minister i be particularly pleased that this legislation will hopefully prevent some of those experience in future 
 i turn to the lords amendment lord amendment leave out clause to remove the propose liability of employer for party harassment in the workplace i be glad to hear that the amendment to remove this party harassment liability ease concern that it could have have a chilling effect on free speech in the workplace i be pleased that that have be address there be some i know the hon member for bath be of they who be disappointed that the amendment have remove the party harassment liability for   very valid reason but this be about get a compromise so that we get the majority of the measure in the bill through this place 
 the government believe it be important that worker be protect against this form of harassment and good employer be already take step to ensure that their employee be protect from harassment by party regardless of the legal position however to progress the bill we have have to be pragmatic acknowledge the complexity at play and find a suitable balance while we want to strengthen protection we also do not wish to infringe on individual right to freedom of speech everyone have the right to their view and to debate they just as we be do today respect other view in the process the aim of the bill be to tackle workplace harassment and not limit people ’s freedom it be important to remember that despite the removal of the party harassment provision the bill will still introduce a new duty on employer to take reasonable step to prevent sexual harassment 
 the government ’s priority be to ensure that the legislation work effectively we have consistently consult with a wide range of stakeholder and have listen to all their view as my hon friend the member for southend west have consult with her chamber of commerce the government have do so more widely when concern regard the potential chilling effect on free speech be raise as the bill progress through the commons the government take on board those issue it be fear that employer may take unreasonable or drastic measure to avoid liability for harassment of their staff particularly by party to the extent that they would feel oblige to shut down conversation in the workplace while employer will be expect to take action against workplace harassment we recognise that those action should fall short of prohibit conversation free speech be crucial to our way of life and it be important that we find a way forward 
 with over amendment table to the bill in the other place follow its reading on   march even after the government table their amendment it be clear that there remain concern that the bill would still have a chilling effect on free speech the government take those amendment very seriously as they be fatal to the bill in our engagement with stakeholder and peer we hear the strong concern particularly about the party harassment issue so we be eager to find a balance and a way forward for the bill to reach the statute book with cross party support therefore the government have be pragmatic and alive to the issue raise and consensus be reach with peer by remove all but of their amendment the shadow minister the hon member for ellesmere port and neston do not comment on the other amendment over of they that we manage to get remove 
 on   july   in committee the lords amend the bill to remove from it the propose liability of employer for party harassment in the workplace which we be ask member to support today again i have say all along that we will not be introduce protection against party harassment it have to be remember that we will still be introduce a new duty on employer to take reasonable step to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace so i hope hon member can see that we be strengthen protection but we have to be alive to the concern of the other place 
 we have accept lords amendment to leave out the word all in clause page line which change the requirement on employer in respect of their duty to prevent sexual harassment from take all reasonable step to take reasonable step i understand that the removal of all mean that that duty do not go as far as the hon member for bath would originally have like but it do reassure member in the other place that the introduction of a duty on employer to take reasonable step to prevent sexual harassment will strengthen protection for worker 
 before i close i will touch on the concern express by my hon friend the member for devizes it be important to say that the government recognise that sexual harassment in the workplace exist and while protect free speech be important we constantly hear of these experience day in and day out particularly the experience of woman but   the hon member for bristol east kerry mccarthy   touch on the harassment of man as well we can not stand by and let that continue guidance and measure be already in place to encourage employer to protect their employee and the tribunal system be in place as well but that be clearly not enough which be why the bill be so important however we have listen to the concern around the impact on freedom of speech 
 i be very happy to support the hon member for bath and thank she again for all her work in this place on the bill and for her pragmatism i know that the amendment be difficult one to accept but this bill will make a difference to the safety of worker in the workplace and i congratulate she on her work 
 private member bill be fragile thing they rely on cross party support but also support in both houses for that reason it be very important to be pragmatic otherwise the whole bill would have fall i be grateful for the government ’s patience and their support for the part of the bill that we all can agree be so important which be to create a preventive duty on employer if the bill pass today it will be a good day and i hope everybody will be able to support the amendment so that it can pass 
 lords amendment agree to 
 lords amendment agree to 
 reading 
 debate resume 
 question march again propose that the bill be now read a time 
 i call sir christopher chope 
 mr deputy speaker i have already finish speak and i think the minister ’s predecessor be in the middle of respond 
 that be entirely my error i do not have the pleasure of be here for the part of the debate i call the minister 
 thank you mr deputy speaker and i thank my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope   for raise this important topic if i may say so in pass we do not debate today his thought about child ’s clothing but i be very happy to meet he about that on behalf of my treasury colleague 
 my hon friend and indeed i and all my colleague believe passionately in people keep more of what they earn to do that we need to ensure that government money be spend as if it be our own we need to ensure it be always spend prudently and deliver the maximum return possible for ordinary taxpayer it be also true and i hope he would join i in recognise that many of our public sector worker be a source of real pride to this country from our healthcare worker in the nhs to our armed force on the front line and those local government official who do such important work for our local community their service be pay for by the taxpayer and indeed they be taxpayer themselves and all of we seek to take a responsible and balanced approach to the condition offer to public sector worker we as a government have seek to do that in every pay round for the round we accept the headline pay recommendation of the independent pay review body in full for the armed force teacher prison officer the police the judiciary medical workforce and senior civil servant for most workforce accept these recommendation have result in the high pay uplift for decade provide a fair reward for worker and a fair deal for taxpayer and employer alike 
 exit payment such as for redundancy be an aspect of this they help employer to make necessary organisational change just as regularly happen in the private sector and they support individual and uphold employment law as they leave employment however my hon friend be absolutely right that the taxpayer ultimately foot the bill for these individual payment they can be many time large than average earning elsewhere in the public sector and it be absolutely right i hope to have support for this across the house that we look at how fair and how proportionate these payment be particularly at a time when it fall to the government to make difficult but responsible decision about the public finance the government share his concern   about the overall level of spending on exit payment particularly the number of very large exit payment make to individual in recent year that be why we be committed to limit large exit payment and make provision for the recovery of those payment when that be appropriate 
 can the minister also give an assurance that large exit payment will never be agree for public sector worker face disciplinary proceeding who choose to leave instead of face those disciplinary proceeding can he assure i that no big exit payment will be give in those circumstance 
 i thank my hon friend who be a doughty champion of the value of taxpayer money and he make a very important point the commitment i can give go rather more broadly than that which be that the government will seek to make sure that any exit payment always offer value for money and that every pound of taxpayer money should be well spend in respond ultimately to the consultation that the government conduct almost a year ago i will ensure that the point he raise be fully address 
 my hon friend say that the government be commit to do something but we be now in and it be in that the government resolve that something must be do about obscenely high public sector exit payment in excess of 95k in the intervene period the government have be all over the place and i wonder whether the minister could tell i the result of the most recent action which be a consultation paper in august the closing date for that be   october more than a year ago what have happen to that 
 my hon friend make a fair point about the pace with which the government have be able to proceed i will write to he follow his important intervention with the late on the prognosis for that i hope he will also recognise that it be not correct to say that the government have do nothing the chief secretary to the treasury my right hon friend   the member for salisbury john glen   be as we speak lead an important piece of work about productivity across all public sector spending all my colleague in government be endeavour every day to ensure that every pound of government money be well spend my hon friend will recall this be why it be so important to get this right that past attempt have not always deliver the desire result 
 in the government lay legislation notwithstanding his own prolific endeavour on this i know that my hon friend be not in general a big advocate of the government constantly legislate but in the government legislate to introduce a cap on payment that be subsequently withdraw follow unintended consequence and the risk of override and conflict with people ’s contractual entitlement let i be clear my hon friend be absolutely right in his intention 
 the minister say that he will write to i i always love receive letter particularly from he but the government have know that this bill have be on the order paper it be introduce in   june last year and in august last year the government issue a consultation paper and say everybody must respond to this paper by   october thereby indicate some sense of urgency what have happen to the response to that consultation surely the minister can give an answer now rather than say that he will write to i later 
 as so often be the case it be sometimes well to be right than to be quick give that the government absolutely understand and share my hon friend ’s concern it be much well that when they bring forward that response to the consultation we celebrate i acknowledge today the anniversary of the closing date for that and it would indeed be unfortunate for there to be a anniversary notwithstanding that it be not the case that the government be not make progress on this matter and if my hon friend really support the cause that he have so nobly champion over so many year chronicle the period since that he talk about we must do it right we be deal with a complex interplay between exist public sector arrangement consultation with impact body include the union and the potential role of legislation i say i will write to my hon friend he will have to contain his excitement as to the specific of my letter but it will follow in due course 
 only in due course”—it be not be promise for next week even perhaps it will be next year sometime will my hon friend accept my interpretation of what have happen which be that we have have year since the government commit to do this and the score now be to the blob and nil to the ordinary people of this country who be the taxpayer 
 i will not accept that construction but what i will accept be my hon friend ’s entreaty that every day it be the duty of this government indeed it be the proud philosophy of this party to spend taxpayer money wisely there be many many way in which we can do that i have refer to the productivity review by right hon friend the chief secretary local government have a significant responsibility local government be not in scope of that consultation but separate guidance have be give to local government and it be the duty of we all to ensure for example that the many arm ’s length   body that be so important to the delivery of government in this country be entirely responsible with their pay arrangement the government have also separately legislate and take action to curtail the use of non disclosure agreement and confidentiality agreement that prevent the transparency of daylight and oxygen intrude into this space and that be an important measure too 
 to conclude unless my hon friend the member for christchurch want to intervene far this be a very important topic the government and my hon friend be at in term of the destination i understand that he would like more velocity in reach that destination as i say not only will i write to he but i be happy to meet he or other colleague on this important bill that seek to achieve the right balance of fairness between those who serve our community in the public sector and protect the interest of the taxpayer 
 what more can say this be just desperate be it not i would say it be no joking matter we have make light of it and in sense perhaps of the reason why the blob might respond ultimately be that we be mock it so much up to now it have be successful in prevent any action be take on this key policy issue which be of concern not just to national taxpayer but to local government council tax payer there be so much abuse we reckon the cost to the exchequer may be as much as £ a year we hear from the prime minister about his commitment to reduce the burden of tax and the debt of this country but why be we not reduce this area of public expenditure it be avoidable we can do it but nothing be be do and that suggest to i that there be something fundamentally wrong with how this conservative government be operate they be not in control the blob be in control i urge my hon friend the minister to reverse that situation so that the government once again take back control 
 what more can say today i will let the house know if and when i receive a response in writing as promise by my hon friend but i be so lose for word on this that i can only ask that the debate be adjourn i do not want to put the bill to a vote 
 order that the debate be now adjourned.—(rebecca harris 
 debate to be resume on   friday october 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 this be a very serious issue which i raise in the house back in the summer of on   june when i present what be then call the covid-19 vaccine damage bill that bill be give a short reading debate on   friday september and at the time i describe it as be 
 about all those who have suffer injury or even death as a result of enlist in the war against covid by be vaccinate 
 i go on to say 
 there be a lot more damage be do to our citizen as a result of covid-19 vaccination than in any other vaccination programme in history that do not mean that it be not worth while and i be not an anti vaxxer but what be important be that if people do the right thing they should not be deny access to 
 reasonable 
 compensation official report   september vol c. 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for his campaign on behalf of so many of all our constituent who write to we express concern about the vaccine programme and in particular about the injury scheme do he agree that it be very wrong for the medium and indeed colleague here to castigate campaigner for the vaccine injure for be conspiracy theorist anti vaxxer and troublemaker as my hon friend say these be people who take the vaccine in response to a call from government and they deserve the support of not only the health service but the government themselves if they turn out to have be injure by it 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his generous comment he himself have be a valuable member of the all party parliamentary group on covid-19 vaccine damage and he be right to say that many people not just our constituent in this country but people elsewhere feel that they have be ignore by the power that be there be a glimmer of hope in that during the public inquiry into covid-19 lady hallett when discuss the term of reference for what be call the module of the inquiry which will take place next july seem very much minded to deal with the issue that my hon friend have mention and about which i continue to be concern 
 in order to emphasise that this be not just a subject for the united kingdom let i mention a book that be publish recently i declare an interest as of the contributor canary in a covid world how propaganda and censorship change our my world be describe as 
 a collection of essay from contemporary thought leader 
 in my own essay i say a great deal about these issue include about the failure of our own vaccine damage payment scheme to recognise that people have suffer harm and in some case bereavement as a result of the vaccine we could not i say continue to ignore these pressure it be encouraging to learn about all that be   happen in other part of the world from contributor in canada the united states the rest of europe australia and new zealand i have here a house of commons library edition of the book and i be go to return it to the library so if any other member want to have a look at it they can 
 i commend my hon friend for all the sterling work he have do on behalf of the people who have be injure by the vaccine may i return he to his point about the covid inquiry and what baroness hallett say i would not want he to give the impression that that mean the government should be able to leave it to the inquiry to deal with this issue give that it may not produce a full report for many year people need compensation now do my hon friend agree that the government should adopt his proposal which provide for a much short timescale and get on with it rather than use the inquiry as a get out of jail card 
 absolutely my hon friend have anticipate what i be go to say later namely that the government need to take their head out of the sand and face up to the reality that this issue will be debate at the inquiry next year people with the right of audience have already make their preliminary statement would it not be so much well for the government to undertake the action set out in the bill now rather than wait for the inevitable next summer 
 in a sense the government have be find out now everybody realise that contrary to the impression give for a long time for some people an unfortunate minority the covid vaccine be very bad news in some case they result in death and bereavement the failure to face up to that be at the heart of my concern and lead to my produce the bill i be grateful to my hon friend for sponsor it 
 unlike many bills that i have introduce in this place this bill have some explanatory note so people who look at it can see that what we be ask for be reasonable it do not need legislation all it need be will on the part of the government to act now and do the thing set out in the explanatory note 
 as my hon friend say this be an issue that will not go away and it be now very much on the agenda in the meantime thousand of people have put in their claim and those claim be be deal with pitifully slowly only about half of they have be assess some of the late statistic that i have get it be quite difficult to drill they out of the government through parliamentary question say that as of   september claim would have be successful on the basis of causation but fall short because they do not meet the disability threshold and claim have be award because they do exceed the threshold that be case where it be accept that the disability suffer be as a direct consequence of the vaccine be it not interesting that of those claim that fall below the disability threshold some would have exceed a threshold do that not show that the government be be unreasonable in stick to a disability threshold rather than reduce the threshold in the way that i suggest in the bill 
 in the response to parliamentary question which i receive on   september i be tell 
 from   october   to   september claim relate to covid-19 vaccination 
 have be make under the scheme 
 and claim relate to vaccine for other illness 
 include for measle mump and rubella 
 i think most reasonable people would say that the alarm bell should be ring very strongly because almost all the claim that the vaccine damage payment scheme have receive in the last year have be in relation to covid-19 vaccine there have be hardly any in relation to mmr—15 as against and fail to deal adequately with those claim be actually undermine the case of vaccine confidence as a consequence we be see a low take up of vaccine people do not trust the vaccine and do not trust the government and their lack of trust be centre around the way in which the government have respond or fail to respond to the vaccine damage that have result from covid-19 vaccine this be a very serious issue 
 this be a serious issue i just hope that the minister will be rather more forthcoming in her response than she and her predecessor have be in the past we have not really get beyond the point of the government accept that people have die or suffer serious injury as a result of the vaccine 
 i be sure that my hon friend will come on to this point and i do not want to steal his thunder however the authority be now accept that people have be damage they would not be make these payment unless they accept that damage have actually take place nevertheless in some case the compensation be give do not cover the cost of deal with the disability that people have as a consequence give how the government coerce people into take the covid-19 vaccine without particularly warn they about the adverse reaction that might happen in some case do my hon friend think the cost of deal with the disability cause should be cover by the government in full rather than up to the arbitrary limit that be in place 
 absolutely in essence that be what the bill call for at the moment someone can put in a claim and it be resolve month or year later even if they be find to have suffer serious injury the maximum payment be £ which be mean to cover all the consequential loss the cost of care and perhaps the lifetime support that they may need as a result of those injury 
 the government say do not worry you can bring a civil claim in parallel but the civil claim that some people be bring in parallel be be frustrate by government lawyer in some case month have go by and then the department of health and social care have say you should be make your claim against astrazeneca rather than against the department however essentially that be a claim against the same organisation because the government be the indemnifi of any liability on the part of the producer of these at the time experimental vaccine 
 i will quote briefly from a reply that the prime minister give to my right hon and learn friend   the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright    on   march   this year my right hon and learn friend have a constituent who be a litigant he suffer week in a coma and have permanent injury as a result he have carer with all the associate cost and loss of earning and the £ do not begin to get near the compensation to which he would be entitle under normal circumstance my right hon and learn friend ask the prime minister about the £ maximum payment and about the arbitrary threshold but do the prime minister respond to either point sadly he do not all he say be 
 we be take step to reform vaccine damage payment scheme by modernise the operation and provide more timely outcomes”.—[official report   march vol c. 
 that be not an answer it be hardly accurate either because the outcome be not timely many people have be wait for more than month for their application to be deal with there be many hundred of application for which the medical note have still not be receive the government under pressure from i say that they would introduce subject access request to ensure that people could get the medical note subject access request have be put forward but not in respect of every case a lot of those request have be outstanding for more than month against a statutory limit of month i do not think that the prime minister be correct in say that effective step be be take to modernise the operation and provide more timely outcome 
 i turn briefly to what be in the bill particularly to link it in with the uk covid-19 inquiry on   september   this year lady hallett hold the preliminary hearing for module of the inquiry which as i have say will take place in july next year the issue of the adequacy of the vaccine damage payment scheme will be fully on the agenda for that meeting in july at the hearing we hear from legal representative of some of the group of people who have suffer vaccine damage ms morris be their counsel she say 
 the primary cause of these injury and death be vaccine induce thrombotic thrombocytopenia or vitt vaccine induce vasculitis stoke cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and guillain barré syndrome survivor be have to cope with the aftereffect of their injury include brain damage and physical disablement whilst the bereaved be struggle to live without their partner child or parent all vibuk member have a confirmation that their injury be cause by the covid-19 vaccine 
 that issue will be debate at the inquiry next year ms morris kc go on to say 
 in addition to their injury and bereavement those we represent have also experience a trauma a lack of medical knowledge and understanding about the risk and presentation of vaccine injury have leave injure people undiagnosed and without treatment furthermore the prevail institutional mindset within medical body and the government have be fixate solely on acknowledge the benefit of the vaccine this have lead to those report vaccine injury to feel disbelieve unheard and marginalise 
 she go on 
 censorship be a very real issue my lady for the vaccine injure and bereaved their support group have be shut down by social medium platform and their experience censor by the mainstream medium they have to speak in code online for fear of have their only source of support take away from they they face stigma and abuse for share their symptom in the context of the covid vaccine and even be brand as anti vax for share very real and medically prove vaccine injury 
 she then say 
 in august of last year the uk cv family lose its member to suicide and a survey of their member report have consider suicide 
 these issue be go to be debate at the covid inquiry why be the government not do something more actively now 
 my hon friend as ever be make a powerful case have he have any indication of whether in the covid inquiry or even his bill it be not entirely clear from my reading of it although perhaps he will correct i any change should be make retrospectively so that case that have already be consider either on the disability threshold or maximum compensation would be revisit in the event of any change be make 
 my hon friend make a very good point my view be that the change should be retrospective in relation to those whose claim have already be deal with the relatively small number of people in respect of whom causation have be establish but the disability threshold of have not be meet could be deal with in a routine way 
 there be also the big issue of whether the £ payment which have not be increase since should be update in line with inflation when i have raise this with the minister in the past she have say she be look at it or take into account the point that have be make it be a blatant abuse if in the government think that £ be a reasonable payout why do they now think that a significantly low sum in real term be appropriate the government be the cause of this rampant inflation and they be of the main beneficiary of it because they be refuse to index tax allowance in line with inflation 
 the government ’s coffer be fill up as a result of these inflationary pressure and yet they continue to be scrooge like in relation to people who do the right thing and get themselves vaccinate in the interest of public health but suffer consequence because of an adverse reaction this be just not good enough will the government listen that be what i hope will happen as a result of this debate and of the pressure that the government must be feel from what will happen at the covid inquiry 
 there be other point make in the submission to the covid inquiry but what be most important be that lady hallett and the counsel to the inquiry have make it quite clear that they will be spend a lot of time look into these particular issue no long will the government be able to avoid answer question as they be able to in this house when we raise question and they can give we non answer they will be face the cross examination of the counsel to the inquiry and be hold to account for their action or lack of action that be why although the bill obviously will not get a reading the government need to take into account and act on the recommendation in it because this issue be not go to go away 
 i be conscious that other member want to speak in the debate so i will just make a couple of other point if the government be not prepared to increase the rate at which people can be pay how be we go to get anywhere at the moment people who be sadly victim of the contaminated blood scandal do not have to show disability in order to qualify for compensation should there be some equivalence between the compensation that be payable under the contaminated blood inquiry and that which should be pay to those who have become victim of covid-19 vaccine 
 if we look at personal injury payout under the judicial college guideline a disability be the equivalent of an above knee amputation of leg under the guideline that would give rise to damage just for that trauma of anything between £ and £ the consequential loss flow from that the loss of earning the health cost and all the rest of it would be in addition to that do that not just show how paltry these sum be it make the case for a no fault system why be we mess around with try to establish liability if somebody confirm as be perfectly healthy have a vaccine and then suffer a lot of adverse consequence why can we not accept that in the absence of any other explanation it must be assume that those consequence be as a direct result of the vaccine 
 interestingly oxford university ’s centre for socio legal studies have describe the vaccine damage payments act as a no fault compensation scheme would that it be if it be we would not be where we be now that be of the most important issue that should be address the government indeed it be be address in other jurisdiction let we remember that for year the government say that these vaccine be absolutely safe and effective there be no qualification at all germany ’s health minister say something similar but more recently retract say that he have get it all wrong and that although they be safe and effective in most respect they be not safe and effective for everybody as a result germany be pay out significant sum to people who be adversely affect our government need to address this issue seriously and try to get back on to the right foot in advance of the hearing at the covid inquiry next july so i ask that the house support this bill on reading 
 it be a pleasure to see you in the chair mr deputy speaker i commend my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope   for not only a tremendous speech set out his inarguable case but the ferocious and tenacious way in which he have pursue this matter he be like a dog with a bone and i be sure that victim of damage from the covid vaccine be very grateful to have he as a champion for their situation as he point out i be a sponsor of the bill and so i support it wholeheartedly i would also like to encourage he to think about extend about its scope a bit far so that it not only deal with the damage cause by the vaccine but seek to try to prevent such damage from happen in the place obviously once people have be severely disabled or as in some case have die as a result of the vaccine that be no comfort we want to prevent this from happen in the place and some thing could usefully be do to try to help in that regard too 
 of course the authority love to play down the fact that some people have suffer adverse reaction to these covid-19 vaccine i be sure many of we have have contact from constituent who have experience serious symptom follow vaccination i be talk not about a sore arm which many people suffer as a result of the vaccination but about a range of life change condition such as stroke heart attack and blood clot to name a few my hon friend mention anna morris kc and her submission to the covid inquiry as she say these be not normal side effect that anybody   would reasonably expect from a pharmaceutical product i very much hope that when the minister respond to the debate she put it clearly on the record that she and the government accept that some people have suffer adverse reaction to the covid-19 vaccine and in some case very serious adverse reaction in some case people have die as a result of take the vaccine this be an opportunity for she today to make that clear on the record for everybody to hear i can anticipate her speech in some regard she will no doubt say that the vaccine programme be a great success and that it give the vast majority of people a great deal of benefit but that be not the point in this particular case as my hon friend say at the start of his speech nobody be argue about that we be talk about the small proportion of people it be a large number of people who have suffer adverse reaction as a result of the covid-19 vaccine that be what i hope she will address directly in her speech 
 the point my hon friend make be important on   june in answer to a question as to whether the government accept that some people have die as a direct result of have receive the covid-19 vaccine the minister ’s response be that the mhra publish a weekly report 
 cover adverse reaction to approve covid-19 vaccine 
 which be available on a following link 
 quite my hon friend be right and today give the minister the opportunity to make it unequivocally clear that the government do accept that that have happen that would be a big step in the right direction and would at least give some comfort to those people who have feel ignore for far too long 
 the authority be of course play down the adverse reaction that people have have from covid vaccine because they do not want to pay up as my hon friend have set out clearly and secondly it be they who push these product so strongly to the public in the place or dare i say it coerce the public into take they at the time it be of course coercion when this house back in july vote to mandate the vaccine for care worker result in ten of thousand of hard work carer leave their job we also come within an ace of mandate the vaccine for all health worker just think of the damage that that would have be do with potentially worker leave the nhs on the back of that 
 in december this house vote for plan b which introduce vaccine passport for large gathering among other thing as we know then and as we know now the vaccine do not stop infection or transmission there be no evidence base for the policy there be no impact assessment do on the policy thank goodness that that ugliness that we see in this house be short lived i be and still am proud to have be of the who vote against that mandation 
 people be coerce in other way people be tell that they be not allow to go on a flight anywhere unless they have take vaccine they be not allow to visit anywhere in effect everything be do to force people to take the vaccine whether that be in utilitarian term a good or a bad thing be neither   here nor there with regard to my hon friend ’s bill what be here or there be that give all of that when people do have adverse reaction to the covid vaccination in some case very serious one in some case sadly people have die the government have an absolute duty to pay the appropriate compensation to people when they move heaven and earth to force they to take it in the place in some case they force people to take it against their will otherwise they would have lose their job the government have a duty to do something here where we be at the moment be just not good enough 
 it be worth note how shocking the treatment of unvaccinated people become our policy lead to untold damage to their livelihood and mental health friend and family turn their back on they because of the prevail narrative in politic and the medium that they must be bad people for make up their own mind about a personal medical intervention i think my hon friend   the member for broxbourne sir charles walker of the great people in this house sum it up well 
 suggest that these people who for whatever reason have choose not to get vaccinate be somehow deserve of our bile be a disgrace it do not reflect badly on they it reflect badly on we ”—[official report   january vol c. 
 in black and white on the pfizer website can read important safety information concern the pfizer biontech covid-19 vaccine 
 myocarditis and pericarditis have occur in some people who have receive 
 that product 
 most commonly adolescent male through year of age 
 it go on to say that the chance of that occurring be very low”—i be sure the minister will reiterate that today but of course the chance of somebody of that age suffer serious illness relate to covid be very low as well the minister might not be so keen to point that out and pfizer do not seem to point it out on its website but we should make that clear too 
 i raise that because i hope the minister will address this in her remark i have be rather alarmed to hear of a clinical trial for a moderna mrna covid vaccine involve healthy child age and up that be not something from the past from during the pandemic it be happen now it have be approve by the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency and involve the bradford patient recruitment centre which be on the edge of my constituency so some of my constituent could be involve 
 i write to the health research authority in august to ask what ethical rationale there be for the inclusion of healthy child in the trial because it be know and have be for a long time that healthy child be at a vanishingly low risk of covid-19 they be at the height of the pandemic and they certainly be now so far i have not receive a coherent answer to that simple question but it have come to my attention that the centre have be recruit child for the trial use advertisement that have not be ethically approve as be require by uk law child can be recruit to a clinical trial only if they as individual have some reasonable expectation of significant benefit when balance with the risk associate with their participation potential benefit for adult that may flow from a trial be not a good enough rationale and do not trump that principle 
 so give that there can not be any expectation of significant benefit for a cohort of people who be not at significant risk what be go on here why be those decision be make it come back to where i start the authority seem completely unable and in some case unwilling to protect people in this case child from potential harm the cost benefit analysis if it have be do i be not sure that it have certainly do not appear to stack up 
 i will finish by commend the recommendation of my hon friend the member for christchurch in the bill the government have a duty of care to the people who have be injure by or lose love one to the vaccine which they take because the government pressure they into do so the government also have a duty to prevent harm from happen in the place fail to act on this will only lead to more harm and further damage to the public ’s trust in authority i hope that the minister will in sum up refer to what be happen in bradford and explain why that particular trial have be allow to go ahead 
 during the pandemic the authority do not go big on warn people of the potential damage or adverse effect of the vaccine they be just interested in coerce as many people as possible into take it they must accept responsibility for those who have do the right thing but face damage as a result i hope that the government will put that right today 
 i too thank my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope   for introduce the bill for the work and research that have go into it and for his reach out and speak to people about it at the tail end of his speech he talk about the phrase safe and effective and i will start my speech there 
 safe and effective become the covid vaccine catchphrase we will call it that and it be repeat so many time over that couple of year it crop up everywhere in government communication in interview with expert and across a media that be only too happy run with that covid slogan safe and effective so ingrained do it become in the national psyche that to ever ask question about the covid vaccine become very difficult to do indeed ask question be a vital part of scientific and political debate however when discuss covid we no long appear to be deal with science oh no mr deputy speaker rather we be deal with the science to question the science be to risk be call and label a covidiot or that most poisonous of term anti vaxxer people who just want to query this new vaccine be close down and vilify 
 i look up the definition of anti vaxxer and be surprised to learn that it be someone who oppose the use of some or all vaccine regulation mandate vaccination or usually both there be of we in this house who on   july vote against mandate the vaccine for care worker that be anti vaxxer in this house accord to the late definition that be absolute nonsense people be not anti vaxxer other people have be concern that family be lose faith in other vaccine because of the way that they be treat over the covid-19 vaccine there have be   drop in the take up of the mmr and polio vaccine which be wrong people need to take those vaccine but all member in this house want to do be to question the new vaccine and to have a debate on it particularly when the house want to mandate it for people and for care worker 
 my point be this if we allow language to be corrupt in this way and definition of word to be bent out of shape we lack the tool for nuanced debate it be only by have a wide and open debate that we get to the central gravity of truth we have not have anything like a wide and open debate on the topic of the safety and efficacy of the covid-19 vaccine 
 i come back to the word safe which mean free from harm or risk of any kind it be a word with an absolute definition it be not to be qualified or diminish yet we know that like all medical intervention the covid-19 vaccine be not free from risk or danger that be why the blue guide a document publish by the mhra that give detailed guidance on they legislation control how medicine be advertise in the uk say 
 advertising which state or imply that a product be safe be unacceptable all medicine have the potential for side effect and no medicine be completely risk free as individual patient respond differently to treatment 
 that principle be replicate in the uk pharmaceutical industry ’s own self regulatory code of practice which also state that the word safe must not be use without qualification on that basis and worryingly both pfizer and astrazeneca be guilty by their own industry ’s self regulatory code of break their own good practice they be find to have mislead the public both by misrepresent and overstate the efficacy of the covid vaccine and erroneously describe they as safe in press release and on social medium without qualification how many other organisation and individual be also guilty of mislead the public in that way 
 we be tell that astrazeneca vaccine be perfectly safe”—that word again and that there be no evidence of blood clot but the advice be change on   april   so that those under the age of would be offer an alternative brand due to the now prove link with blood clot the advice then change again so that   the under-40s would be offer an alternative brand a safety signal be pick up and act on thank goodness but in denmark the problem be pick up much soon it pause the use of the astrazeneca vaccine on   march after it have vaccinate people at the same time people have be vaccinate in the uk without the mhra detect a signal of a problem why be we so far behind the curve be it because debate have be close down and people be not allow even to question what be go on 
 what about mrna vaccine in florida last year the state surgeon general recommend against male age between and receive mrna covid-19 vaccine of any brand my question be what evidence be florida react to and be the mhra urgently look into whether we should be follow suit here 
 in july the government publish the do no harm report which highlight significant problem it state 
 the mhra need substantial revision particularly in relation to adverse event report and medical device regulation it need to ensure that it engage more with patient and their outcome 
 it also state 
 the spontaneous reporting platform for medicine and device the yellow card system need reform 
 and that the 
 system be not good enough at spot trend in practice and outcome that give rise to safety concern 
 what have be do since that report be publish just over year ago have these concern be hear and act on 
 dame june raine the head of the mhra recently say that the covid pandemic 
 have catalyse the transformation of the regulator from a watchdog to an enabler 
 which do not exactly sound like good news for anyone concerned about safety 
 ultimately it come down to this the government repeatedly tell the public that covid vaccine be safe and for many probably the vast majority they be but plenty of people have suffer as a result of their decision to follow the government advice and take this new medical intervention some have tragically lose their life and as be note last month at the covid inquiry by anna morris kc victim and their family have be marginalise and 
 face stigma and abuse for share their symptom and even be brand as anti vax for share very real and medically prove vaccine injury 
 this be really quite unacceptable 
 it be way past time that the government do the right thing and follow the recommendation of my hon friend the member for christchurch it have be shocking to hear how slowly the vaccine damage payment scheme have be operate applicant be have to wait month we hear from the solicitor peter todd at a recent hearing of my all party parliamentary group on pandemic response and recovery he describe how applicant have be wait for more than month for a decision on their case this be excessively long especially when people be injure and potentially unable to work we be also tell that claim be find to have have disablement cause by the vaccine but it be judge that those people be just not disabled enough to merit a financial reward in many of those case the decision be reach without a doctor meeting or even speak to the applicant to help with the assessment in the rare case that money have be award the payment have not change since as my hon friend have say so its value have be erode by inflation which simply be not good enough 
 in conclusion i will make a plea for transparency and integrity it be time to be honest with the public about the safety of these vaccine and we must start by give they access to information and datum without further delay we must also as an urgent priority look after those who have be damage or those who have tragically lose love one we may then begin to restore the faith that have undoubtedly be lose in the authority responsible for protect and promote public health there be many unanswered question and the repetition by ministers of those words—“safe and effective”—is   simply not a good enough answer for all the reason i have just give so i be delighted to support the   bill introduce by my hon friend the member for christchurch 
 i congratulate   the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope   on secure reading of the bill i thank   the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey   and   the hon member for shipley philip davies   for participate in the debate i have listen attentively to the issue they raise 
 i will begin by set out labour ’s position on the matter we believe that the covid-19 vaccine be safe and effective it have save countless life not only in britain but across the globe over the course of the pandemic over people across the uk die with covid-19 therefore it be important we do not understate that get a vaccination have be and continue to be the single most effective way to reduce death and severe illness from covid-19 
 rise member from across the house will be aware that all vaccine go through extensive and ongoing testing procedure the covid-19 vaccine go through multiple stage of clinical trial before be approve interruption the vaccine have meet strict independent standard for safety quality and effectiveness 
 on that point will the hon lady give way 
 i will not 
 order it be entirely up to the hon lady whether she give way or not but member should not walk into the chamber quarter of the way through a debate and then seek to intervene 
 it be important for i to set out labour ’s position on the matter without the vaccine and the work of scientist volunteer and nhs staff we would not have be able to end the lockdown and return to our daily life i be sure we all agree on that therefore the shadow health and social care team remain extraordinarily grateful to all those who have work so hard to build and roll out the vaccine across the uk 
 however while the covid-19 vaccination programme have be hugely successful there have be some extremely rare case of people sadly suffer side effect and deteriorate health with possible link to covid-19 vaccine while serious and adverse event be rare compare to the number of dos administer when they do occur they can have unexpected and life change implication 
 it be therefore right that our healthcare system and this government do all they can to improve the diagnosis and treatment of those who have suffer from this the yellow card scheme already collect and monitor information on suspect safety concern and a dedicated   team of scientist review information to monitor the vaccine roll out i encourage everyone to keep use that scheme to ensure that information can be collect 
 where vaccine damage tragically occur it be right that individual and family can access the vaccine damage payment scheme it be important that that scheme be fit for purpose and that the government act to make that happen there have be report of operational delay within the vaccine damage payment scheme those report suggest that hundred of people have be wait over month for an outcome with some wait more than month 
 in fact follow a question about the vdps early this year the prime minister vow to improve the scheme so i will be interested to hear from the minister about the government ’s response to tackle those delay will the minister confirm that the government believe that the scheme be fit for purpose and whether they plan to update it will the government assure we that the nhs business services authority have the capacity to process application to the vdps in a timely manner i urge ministers to meet and engage with affected individual and their family to look at way to improve diagnosis and treatment and at how claim under the vdps can be address more quickly 
 on that point will the hon lady give way 
 i will but the hon member have speak at length already 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for give way do the labour party believe that the vaccine damage payment scheme be fit for purpose or do it not believe that 
 as i have say i have ask the minister to meet member of the family who be directly affect to see whether there be way to improve the scheme and how that could be address more quickly that be the good step forward and we need to listen to individual regard tailor support and where it need to be improve 
 finally it would be remiss of i not to join colleague in call out the scourge of vaccine misinformation get a vaccine be so important especially for those who be most vulnerable we must ensure that all vaccine misinformation be debunk and that the most important message that the vaccine be safe and effective be share i hope the minister will echo my remark on the danger of misinformation get a vaccination be too important for the health of this nation indeed this world to be play fast and loose with the fact although the opposition do not support the bill we hope that the government will tackle the issue that i and other hon member have raise and address whether further action be require 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope   on secure the reading of this bill this be an important issue and i thank he for the tone in which he have conduct the debate and for his sentiment at the start when he say that this be not about   be anti vaccination as my right hon friend   the member for tatton esther mcvey   indicate vaccination be a crucial part of our armour in deal with disease across the world the bill be specifically about the covid vaccination and i advocate as do the shadow minister that after clean water vaccination be the most effective public health intervention in the world in term of save life and promote good health 
 the flu vaccination which be be roll out as we speak will enable many people to be healthy over this winter and avoid hospital admission the hpv vaccination for prevent cervical cancer which be roll out to young girl and boy in our school have the potential to eradicate cervical cancer in future and we must remember that vaccination have a powerful role to play in the health of our nation globally we have of the good immunisation programme around the world and it be important to pay tribute to all those staff who take part in vaccination programme and make they such a success 
 let i turn to the covid vaccination the uk be at the forefront of tackle covid-19 through the vaccination programme and it be the healthcare system in the world to deliver the covid vaccination outside clinical trial we should be proud of that as the shadow minister say it be reason why we be of the country to lift restriction because of our success in covid vaccination on the point make by my hon friend   the member for shipley philip davies i be happy to go on record and say that although covid vaccine have save ten of thousand of life unfortunately there have be extremely rare circumstance where individual have very sadly experience harm and difficult circumstance follow a covid vaccination thankfully such case remain rare but that do not reduce the impact on those individual who experience that and their family i be sure the whole house will join i in express concern for those individual who suffer such harm and their family 
 vaccination remain the good way for individual to protect themselves and other from the impact of covid-19 we have do the right thing by encourage people to have the vaccine to protect both themselves and other more vulnerable member of society 
 i be grateful for what the minister have say but i think that the people who as she acknowledge have suffer harm and damage from the vaccine they be coerce into take it in form or another would probably prefer more than just sympathy and concern from people in the house what they really want be proper compensation will she therefore take on board what my hon friend   the member for christchurch sir christopher chope   say and ensure that people be adequately and properly compensate for the damage do to they will she at the very least ensure that the maximum amount that can be pay out rise in line with inflation 
 i will come to those point shortly all medicine have risk and side effect even simple paracetamol which be take safely by the vast majority of people can have serious side effect for some and it be no different for the covid vaccine that be true of all vaccination and that be why we set up the scheme specifically for vaccination in the place 
 the government can not support the bill ’s proposal to make provision about financial assistance specifically for those who have have a covid vaccination the scheme as a whole be to support anyone who have have side effect to a certain level of impairment from any vaccination and it would be wrong to single out covid-19 for a separate scheme the government already provide long stand mechanism to offer financial assistance to individual suffer disablement follow vaccination in the form of the vdps 
 just to clarify the vdps be not a compensation scheme it be establish in to provide a off tax free payment to individual who have be find on the balance of probability to have be harm by a vaccine list in the vaccine damage payments act in december covid-19 be add to the scheme to ensure that those who have severe disability find to be link to the covid-19 vaccine would receive support through this try and test system 
 the government ’s current focus be on scale up the scheme ’s operation by the nhs business services authority which take over its running in november from the department for work and pensions because we feel it be well place to access patient note and to improve timeliness we have see a significant improvement in try to process claim which i will come to 
 the bill also ask the government to report on the merit of a no fault compensation scheme for covid-19 vaccine damage establish a dedicated stand alone scheme would risk favour those who in extremely rare circumstance have sadly experience harm follow a covid-19 vaccine above those harm by other vaccine which again do happen in rare circumstance that would create inequality between vaccine which could be damaging to other vaccination programme 
 another element of the bill be to question whether there should be an upper limit on the financial assistance available it be important to reiterate that the vdps offer a off lump sum payment it be not intend to cover lifetime cost for those impact the amount have be revise periodically by statutory sum order the initial payment when the scheme be set up in be £ it have be review several time with the current amount set at £ as of july the award should be consider in addition to the government ’s support package for those with a disability or long term health condition which include statutory sick pay universal credit employment and support allowance attendance allowance and personal independence payment 
 the minister say that the figure have be review periodically and that we be now at £ she just say that it be last review in which be year ago do she not think it be time for another periodic review
