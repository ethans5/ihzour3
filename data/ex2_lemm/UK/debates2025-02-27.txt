 we recognise the recent challenge for the industry and we be continue our support with the video game expenditure credit provide £ for the uk game fund next year the uk be home to some amazing company and developer and we want to continue to support they as they grow and develop world lead game 
 the secretary of state be right the video game industry be a great british success story it contribute £ a year to our economy and job many of which be outside london from dundee to brighton it really be right across our nation however there be grow concern that the uk be lose its competitive edge our tax relief rate have drop below those of ireland france australia and canada all our big competitor in this sector what be the secretary of state do to really push the treasury to ensure that our video game expenditure credit and everything else be up to date so that we retain our competitive edge in this vital sector 
 the hon lady will know that there have be a global slowdown in the video game industry as a whole that be of the reason why we have step up to provide additional support we always keep our tax relief regime under review and we be aware that   this be an intensely competitive area not just in video game but in film tv and other area the video game industry be part of a wide ecosystem that need support and we be determined to provide the full support we can so that our industry can thrive 
 what step her department be take to support the television industry in wales 
 i be glad to say that we have a thriving tv industry in wales we have not only our own broadcaster s4c but phenomenal studio include dragon studios just outside my constituency where willow be produce with the magnificent warwick davis and above all we have gavin and stacey 
 i know that it be completely out of order mr speaker but can i say thank you to dawn in the tea room who be retire today 
 diolch mr llefarydd only of my constituency of caerfyrddin have gigabit availability compare with the uk average of in fact of my constituency have very little broadband at all while more and more people use on demand and internet base tv service many still have to rely on terrestrial tv to watch their favourite welsh programme will the minister support the tv industry in wales and reassure viewer in my constituency that broadcast tv will remain available for they all to enjoy 
 the series will be over 
 i think it be a part series mr speaker i commend the hon lady on manage to get gigabit capable broadband which be my other responsibility as a department for science innovation and technology minister into this session we be determined to try to make sure that across her constituency everybody be able to take part in the digital future incidentally that be why we publish a digital inclusion strategy yesterday which i very much hope all member will support 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of the cost of electronic travel authorisation on inbound tourism 
 we be absolutely determined to reach our goal of international visitor to the uk by i be very hopeful that the electronic travel authorisation system will be simple and make it easy and safe for people to visit the uk in the come year 
 our travel tourism and hospitality sector continue to face huge challenge yet the home office ’s own impact assessment of the increase in electronic travel authorisation fee conclude that it could reduce the number of tourist want to come here and result in a loss of revenue to the wide economy of £ over year if the government be to succeed in   achieve the inbound tourism target of by would an agreement between the eu and the uk to facilitate easy travel not be a good place to start 
 i be absolutely delighted that even the liberal democrats be cite our target of international visitor by we have get that into this session time now the hon lady be right of course we have to bear in mind all the issue that could affect those number i do not know whether she have see the recent video produce by visitbritain star great britain which include film clip from james bond tom cruise and many other but we be determine through the visitor economy advisory council to make sure that we reach those number we will work with the home office to try to mitigate the problem that we may have 
 i call the shadow minister 
 accord to visitbritain the estimate value of inbound tourism in will be in the region of £ so it be a huge economic contributor to the united kingdom when speak to tourism business that rely on seasonal tourism alongside the rise cost of etas they express great concern that the reduction in national insurance threshold and the rise in employer national insurance contribution mean that many more worker will be catch in a damaging tax trap it will mean that business have to reconsider how many people many of they young and many of they in their job they can employ while remain profitable do the minister have an impact assessment of the effect of those ni rise and what do it say about how many job will be create or lose as a result of labour ’s job tax trap 
 of the problem with the conservatives be that they want we to endlessly spend more money on thing but they do not want to find the money that enable we to afford that expenditure there be lot of thing that affect the tourism industry in the uk incidentally i think the hon gentleman mistake his million for his billion in what he say but it be really important that we look at how we can extend the season in the uk and make sure that more international visitor do not just come to london and the south east but go to place across the whole of the united kingdom that be precisely the kind of thing that i hope we will be able to incorporate into our national tourism strategy this autumn it will be the time that the uk have ever have

 what step her department have take to help support creative industry in loughborough constituency 
 what step her department have take to help support creative industry in bradford 
 the creative industry be of the industrial strategy ’s priority sector and they play a critical role in drive growth across the country in january we name west yorkshire as a creative industry priority region with funding to be devolve to support growth in the region that be a sign of our belief in west yorkshire and the role that it have play and will continue to play in the heritage culture art and cultural life of our nation 
 local theatre art centre and gallery enrich our life and our local economy each job in the creative sector create elsewhere in our local economy in my constituency of loughborough we be build the generator an art and community hub restore a disuse building to do so i could not be prouder of the people who have make that happen include jill vincent a local alderwoman and former councillor jonathan hale the late kev ryan and many other will the secretary of state join i in congratulate they on get the project go and will she come and visit i when the generator open later this year if she do come i will buy she a pint i have about leave on my tour

 in a statement release month ago the government claim that bradford city of culture will generate £ of growth for the district by and that new job will be create about £ of taxpayer money have already be allocate to bradford city of culture pound be of course the same as the financial black hole that bradford council face as it cut service to child with special educational need and sell off local asset the centre for cities say that the government have massively overstate the economic benefit that be the city of culture bring in the interest of transparency will the secretary of state release the impact assessment that be make to reach the £ figure and the job growth that they say will be create 
 as the hon gentleman should know the impact assessment be do under the last government i be slightly confused be he against the city of culture or do he just think that bradford do not have a full contribution to make to this country ’s cultural life we believe in bradford we believe in its people its history its heritage and what it can contribute to the uk in the future 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 much like loughborough and bradford chichester be a city that punch well above its weight with its creative and cultural offering much of the local authority funding that support organisation in my constituency such as chichester festival theatre the pallant house gallery and the novium museum come via the district council local government reorganisation put such funding stream at risk especially when combine with an authority that be struggle with the cost of for example social care and highway what will the secretary of state do to ensure that these vital organisation be protect during this reorganisation

 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 artificial intelligence be a significant innovation but our medium and creator be innovator too almost the entirety of those in the creative sector say that government proposal be not fit for purpose they would allow ai company to scrape content without creator get pay ukai have say that labour ’s plan would damage public confidence in the ai industry and hinder the industry in that light will the secretary of state admit that the government ’s approach to ai and copyright be a mess and that government proposal be not fit for purpose be she as disappointed as i be that the secretary of state for science innovation and technology admit on the radio this morning that he have not even meet those in the creative sector 
 i can tell the shadow secretary of state that i and my hon friend   the member for rhondda and ogmore chris bryant who be also a joint minister in the department for science innovation and technology meet those in the creative industry regularly we be crystal clear that the creative industry have be power the british economy for decade and as our future economy move towards high consumption the creative industry will be even more critical to our future success 
 i also say gently to the shadow secretary of state that this be an issue his government fail to grip for a long time we be deliver certainty through a copyright regime that provide creator with real control and transparency and that help they to license their content while support ai developer to access high quality material so that they can train lead ai model in the uk we be work with our fantastic creative industry to get that balance right we be not prepared to do what his government do for year which be to leave this country with uncertainty drift and low economic growth 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 tour performer contribute hugely to the creative industry but sadly best for britain estimate that since brexit the number of uk performer tour in the eu have fall by a elton john and david furnish back the cut the red tape campaign which ask for an exemption to the trade and co operation agreement tour performer be still stand but they should not be ask to make a sacrifice impose by the previous government ’s fail brexit deal will ministers show i that they do not have a cold cold heart by agree to meet i and representative of the campaign and will they promise i that it will not be a long long time before tour performer get the support they deserve i be plead with minister do not go break my heart 
 all i can say be that the hon member be lucky that i be answer this question not my hon friend the member for rhondda and ogmore or we   would be here for several hour my hon friend meet the eu commissioner on precisely this issue yesterday we firmly believe that close co operation with our friend and ally across the european union be not just in our interest but in their interest and we be seek close agreement on this issue 
 what step her department be take to support small theatre and perform art venue 
 we be absolutely committed to support small and large theatre across the uk it be reason why we have specifically announce capital funding as the secretary of state have say of £ for theatre and other cultural infrastructure across the uk 
 i thank the minister for that response in my constituency formerly represent by the great jennie lee the council own theatre and museum be due to close in just month time passionate member of our community have come together to form the cannock chase theatre trust and the chase heritage cic to save these precious venue will the minister join i in thank those group for all their effort and will he set out how the government be support such community group to take on culture and heritage venue at risk 
 i commend my hon friend and all those who have engage as volunteer to try to take over the theatre and run it in an effective way i look forward to the production after all the play ’ the thing i see hamlet last week and richard ii twice the most important thing be that we try to ensure that young people have an opportunity to act and have a creative education in their school and that there be local theatre and other venue where they be able to see really high quality live entertainment such as in the theatre he be talk about i be very happy to ensure that official meet his volunteer

 the right hon gentleman use to be in the treasury so he be very good at make financial bid and i think he have just make a bid on behalf of salisbury ’s theatre we warmly commend the work it be do as i have say it be brilliant if we can get lot of kid come into theatre i want every single child as part of their education to be able to see live theatre and live music because that be a part of what stir their   creative opportunity in life yes we be look at whether there be other way of bring in not only commercial money but philanthropic money to try to match fund the funding that can come from government 
 whether her department plan to commemorate the anniversary of formula 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group on formula and motor sport the hon member be a keen supporter of motor sport in the uk and i pay tribute to he for all his work last month i meet with formula and i congratulate it on its anniversary 
 formula be a world championship but it be a predominantly british success story would the good way for the government to join its anniversary celebration not be to get behind the effort of susie wolff and other to get more woman into the sport and to back the hamilton commission in get more people from more diverse background to participate in motor sport at all level 
 i pay tribute again to the hon gentleman for all his work the milestone provide an excellent opportunity to reflect on the sport ’s long history in the uk and the huge contribution that it make i echo and agree with his comment about diversity f1 also have a significant economic impact out of formula team be base in the uk collectively generate £ in turnover in

 i think kate bush be run up that hill too look the truth of the matter be as i have say many time that we will not progress in this area unless we be absolutely certain that we will secure more   licensing of content by british creative rather than less that be absolutely key to what would be success for we i hope that people will take we at face value on that 
 mr speaker i be afraid that i do not have a song title to go with this question oh no bath council ’s spending on youth service have decline by since accord to a recent ymca report with the cancellation of the national citizen service can the minister tell we whether the money will be reallocate to support new service in area such as mine 
 we be astonish when we take office back in july to discover that there be no national youth strategy to help shape and grip the challenge face a generation we be determined to change that we have move at pace to set up the youth steering group that be imminently launch a consultation it will be the big conversation that we have ever have with this nation ’s young people we be also allocate more than £ worth of capital funding to create welcome space for young people through the new better youth spaces fund i can assure the hon lady that the young people remain our top priority

 what assessment the church of england have make of the contribution of rural parish 
 the church of england have more than church in our town and village in rural area in addition to their regular process of prayer and worship parish church play an important role in the life of our rural community 
 in my constituency of bridlington and the wolds rural parish face huge financial pressure to maintain their historic church building their cost often run into ten of thousand yet they receive no funding from the church of england or the government the church of england ’s building comprise more than of the country ’s list building but all the money need to maintain they have to be raise locally this maintenance will soon be beyond the ability of our local church in rural area so will the hon lady make representation to the church of england to ensure that there be more financial support for local church so that we save this wonderful part of our heritage 
 i congratulate the hon member on be a true champion for his constituency and also for the need for additional resource that will ensure that our church can truly stand the test of time i shall certainly raise these issue and write to he about what step he can take at a local level it be also worth point out that represent rural community and diocese bishop do meet regularly on a quarterly basis to look at good practice and other way that they can support their diocese well 
 what discussion the church have have with the government on the extension of the list place of worship grant scheme 
 what assessment the church have make of the potential implication for its policy of the level of funding available from the list place of worship grant scheme in 
 as i set out in church commissioner question in january the list place of worship scheme be an effective way to deliver transformational benefit to local community the government ’s extension of   the scheme be very welcome but there be a number of unanswered question about the impact of the change to the scheme 
 the extension of the scheme will be welcome news to those involve with church such as st botolph ’s in aspley guise in mid bedfordshire people there have tell i of their concern about the lack of certainty for long term project that may need support beyond month will the church commissioner join i and other colleague in press the chancellor to provide long term funding certainty 
 the hon member have raise this issue at church commissioner question previously and he be right to continue to do so although the scheme be be extend until march we do not have a long term plan or solution it be only right that the government should set out their plan we know that in large scale project cost over £ not all the vat can be return it be important that the department for culture media and sport come up with a solution to ensure that the list place of worship scheme can continue 
 holy trinity church in sunningdale have serve the parish for year it want to build on that legacy with a community hub complete with new facility include a volunteer run café for the wide community the £ cap on vat relief may be enough to sustain small project but this will cost well over £ that mean that another £ in donation will be need which can not stretch that far i understand that the government be encourage church to apply for lottery funding but rev. jon hutchinson have raise the fact that the scope of that funding be too narrow to cover the project will the church estates commissioner meet i to discuss how we can get this project over the line 
 the hon member make an important point and raise an issue that affect many church the £ cap work for small project but it will not go far enough for large project such as the in his constituency the church that i attend holy trinity in clapham be experience similar challenge i be happy to meet he 
 the capping of the list place of worship grant scheme have leave many church in physical ruin such as the belfrey in york which will lose £ even though it have do everything that be expect of it clearly we need to find a solution and the suggestion from government have be insufficient will my hon friend ensure that the church commissioners co ordinate a meeting of all church that be mid project to ensure that they can complete the work that they have undertake 
 i will take my hon friend ’s question back to see if we can set up a meeting as she highlight many church will be miss out on vital fund to carry out necessary repair particularly those that have already start work if that work extend beyond the march deadline they will not be able to reclaim any vat it be important that we find a long term solution i will be happy to take that forward

 newcastle ’s beautiful cathedral be an important part of our economic life as well as our cultural and religious life but it receive very little funding from the church of england and do not benefit from any significant endowment or property ownership unlike other cathedral with of england ’s cathedral predict to post budget deficit what discussion have the church estates commissioner have with the church of england regard the financial sustainability of cathedral 
 as i say the church of england meet regularly to look at the impact of cost on cathedral and i be happy to write to my hon friend about the issue 
 if the commissioner will have discussion with their counterpart in the church of scotland on support for place of worship with decline congregation 
 the pastoral and closed church department of the church commissioners have recently consult with the church of scotland on the experience of manage parish and small congregation 
 scotland ’s churches trust estimate that the church of scotland could lose of its church in the come year st andrew ’s in clermiston in my constituency could be of they it celebrate its anniversary this year but could face closure because of decline congregation and low income that threaten a valuable community space that be particularly use by vulnerable and elderly people can the church estates commissioner outline how the church of england could work with the church of scotland to share good practice on manage church with small congregation to preserve those valuable community space 
 the national church institutions and the church of scotland sign the columba declaration commit to joint dialogue on a range of issue i understand that they meet regularly to discuss these issue it might be useful for she to reach out to the church of scotland on that and if she be unable to do so i be happy to put she in touch with it 
 what support   the   church   be provide to   the diocese of jerusalem in the context of the situation in   the occupied palestinian   territories 
 the situation in gaza and the west bank be devastating and the church continue to support the diocese of jerusalem through prayer financial assistance and advocacy the archbishop ’s appeal for the diocese continue to provide much need support for church organisation and body whether that be in gaza or the west bank 
 on the west bank and in jerusalem the security situation and the economic condition be worsen with increase violence and a decline in the number of pilgrim visit that have lead to a rise level of emigration as many christians leave the holy land where generation before they have live will my hon friend outline the work the church be do to assist the diocese in support its dwindle congregation in these difficult time 
 there be no safe place on the west bank include in east jerusalem for palestinians the attack on the christian community there be focus on seize land and property and have be increase in recent month with armenian church bear the brunt the christian community face a co ordinated and aggressive move to drive these live stone of our faith to leave the region bishop have frequently visit the region over the past month they have regularly meet the archbishop of jerusalem to discuss how good they can help the diocese to respond to the many appalling attack it be important that we hold up the people of palestine in prayer for their safety and security violence be not the answer to any of this 
 a year and a half ago i meet the archbishop of jerusalem he outline some of the thing the church be do on education job and opportunity for young people to do apprenticeship those thing can only happen if there be money available what discussion have the church commissioner have with the archbishop and the church on help to retain young people in jerusalem 
 i mention fund in my response to my hon friend   the member for edmonton and winchmore hill kate osamor i can certainly write to the hon gentleman about the discussion that have take place with the archbishop of jerusalem if he would find that helpful 
 whether the church have make an assessment of the potential merit of specific legislative protection for significant church organ 
 my hon friend will know that i do not answer for the church of scotland and that heritage and culture be a devolved matter but when a   parish church be to close the church of england try to secure a new home for its instrument work with local authority the diocese and national heritage body i believe that the church of scotland be take similar step 
 st margaret ’s church of scotland in knightswood in my constituency be close much to the detriment of its congregation and the wide area the church be home to a significant pipe organ build by the renowned maker henry willis in some country in europe there be protection in law for historical instrument such as that to prevent they from be destroy or abandon when a church become redundant do my hon friend agree that such a scheme should be establish in the uk 
 again my hon friend highlight the importance and significance of preserve instrument particularly the at st margaret ’s i would be happy to write to she to suggest organisation that may be able to help the congregation i would also be happy to put she in touch with the church of scotland to see how it can well take the matter forward with she

 the restoration and renewal programme be in the preparatory stage to date key cost driver have include design work and programme and project management cost for survey on deliver the work for the palace delivery option be be develop along with their cost and the intention be to publish that information before the end of the year 
 the option for delivery work seem to represent various degree of compromise between shortened timescale the associate reduce overall cost and the continued presence and functioning of parliament within the palace of westminster it be wise to seek way to negate the need for such a compromise what possibility for decantation into westminster hall might yet be explore would the minister meet i and member of the project team to discuss those possibility 
 my hon friend ’s professional background offer he insight into the choice that we will have to make i understand that the possible use of westminster hall as a host for the chamber have be consider but there be concern about the impact on the old part of the palace the northern estate be the favour location i will ask senior officer of the restoration and renewal team about his idea which i be happy to discuss far with he

 the elections act pass by the previous government impose a strategy and policy statement on the electoral commission undermine its independence for some confected agenda about voter fraud and erode trust and confidence in the commission do the right hon and learn gentleman agree that the good course of action would be not to publish a further strategy and policy statement until such a time as the legislation can be review 
 i can tell the hon gentleman that that be the commission ’s view he will know that the commission remain opposed to the principle of a strategy and policy statement and view such a mechanism as inconsistent with its independent role 
 it be estimate that only of the british citizen abroad participate in the last general election what action can the electoral commission and my right hon and learn friend take to ensure that people who be eligible to vote can do so in future general election

 i thank my hon friend for her fantastic and poignant question historical and recent safeguarding failure have erode trust in the church to rebuild and restore that trust the church must show that it be serious about keep people safe that must include hold to account those who be responsible for failure no no matter how senior can be above scrutiny and accountability

 the hon member make an important point the whole westminster village need to be engage in this important topic which affect all of our workplace

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state if she will make a statement on the coverage of gaza by the bbc 
 as the house will be aware hamas be a proscribe terrorist organisation in the uk it be my view and the view of this government i hope it be share across the whole house that hamas be a terrorist organisation guilty of heinous act of terrorism over many year include the appalling terrorist and antisemitic attack carry out on   october that be a position i set out clearly in public in the medium this week 
 that tragic day and the conflict that follow have have real life impact on community across the uk play out on our street and overseas and every of we have a duty to take the utmost care not to exacerbate the situation that be why i have discuss editorial guideline with the bbc director general in recent day the bbc have clear editorial guideline to report hamas as a terror organisation proscribe by the uk government that be its policy under the last government and that remain its policy now 
 i hold discussion with the bbc director general early this week at my request in order to seek urgent answer about the check and due diligence that should have be carry out ahead of the screening of a recent documentary on gaza and about the commissioning the payment and the use of licence fee payer money i also seek cast iron assurance that no money pay have fall into the hand of hamas and that the utmost care be take to ensure that that be the case i expect to be keep inform about the finding of the internal bbc investigation and i will be happy to update   the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew   and colleague across the house on its progress 
 across all the issue on which the bbc may report the bbc ’s operational and editorial independence from the government be an important principle that we intend to uphold as a former minister at the department for culture media and sport the right hon member will be aware that it be for ofcom as the independent regulator to ensure the bbc fulfil its obligation under the charter and broadcast code nevertheless as i have set out publicly it be essential that the bbc maintain the high standard of reporting and governance as the public rightly expect i have make those view clear to the bbc that be crucial to ensure that the bbc retain the confidence of the public 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for that answer the documentary gaza how to survive a warzone be broadcast by the bbc on   february it purport to show what everyday life be like for people in gaza a topic of huge sensitivity as the uk ’s public broadcaster the bbc have a duty to provide accurate and impartial news and information which be particularly important when it come to coverage of highly sensitive event in this case it be clear that the bbc have fall far short of those standard 
 shortly after it air report emerge that the documentary be narrate by the son of a senior hamas figure initially the bbc defend the programme as an invaluable testament to the conflict and keep it available   on iplayer only after a significant public backlash do the bbc decide to withdraw it then we learn that on at least occasion the word yahud and yahudy”—arabic for jew and jews”—were change to israel and israeli force or be remove from the documentary and then we learn that up to £ in public fund might have indirectly support a terrorist organisation 
 however i regret to say that the government ’s response to these allegation have be just as concern on monday the secretary of state refuse to say whether hamas a proscribe terrorist organisation should be describe as such by the bbc but i be glad to hear her comment today on tuesday the home secretary the minister responsible for address threat relate to terrorism say that she do not know the detail surround this case despite allegation that £ in public fund may have indirectly support this organisation for that reason the leader of the opposition write to the director general of the bbc request a full independent inquiry to consider this and wide allegation of systemic bias against israel 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for her response to my correspondence on this matter i understand from her letter that she have raise these concern about the documentary with the director general and she have just confirm that and it be right that she do so but i must press she far on the letter ’s content do she make it clear that in this case the bbc have fall far short of the standard expect of the uk ’s public broadcaster do she receive any assurance from the bbc that taxpayer money have not be funnel to hamas do she support our call for a full independent inquiry into the documentary what commitment do she receive from the bbc that this will never happen again and if a criminal investigation have to take place what will happen 
 order that should have be minute please will everyone measure how long they have it be unfair because we have a lot of business to get through 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for bring this matter to the house and also for raise it with i as he know i have a long history of take antisemitism extremely seriously for instance when it poison my own party and i will always speak out without fear or favour when i see it raise its ugly head i be however deeply disappointed by his attempt to pretend that the government have be anything other than robust on this he will know that in the medium interview to which he refer i make it crystal clear that the uk government and i believe and have believe for a long time that hamas be not only a proscribe terrorist organisation in the uk but a terrorist organisation and we will continue to describe it as such he will also know that in of those interview i make it clear that i have request a meeting with the director general of the bbc to discuss the matter 
 of course the bbc be not there as an instrument of government minister seek to interfere with editorial decision or the day to day running of the organisation would be in nobody ’s interest in seek to build the trust that be so fundamental to its core purpose ”—[official report   february vol c. 103wh 
 those be not my word but the word of the last medium minister   the hon member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez whom the right hon gentleman serve alongside he be a minister in that government the hon   lady be now the parliamentary private secretary to the leader of the opposition if he disagree with she i suggest that he take that up with she but this be far too important an issue to be treat as a political football 
 along with several other member i visit israel and the occupy west bank last week but there be no access to gaza for we in fact the close we get to it be view the utter devastation of gaza city through a telescope over the last year during the war accord to the committee to protect journalists at least palestinian journalist have be kill in gaza and the bbc and other journalist have have no access to gaza whatsoever do the secretary of state agree that that be as unacceptable as any attack on the independence of the bbc 
 yes the duty to report on what be happen to people in gaza be absolutely fundamental and my right hon friend the foreign secretary have raise the issue of journalist access and protection and safety a number of time that be why the government believe that the bbc and other have the utmost duty to exercise care and due diligence in the way in which they report on this conflict it be in no ’s interest for the public not to have confidence in the information that they be receive 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i commend the secretary of state for her response to the urgent question we agree with the position be take i can not imagine what it must be like to be a palestinian child in gaza in the month of the war alone of the child population be kill or injure and ten of thousand more will have be orphan or leave homeless give this humanitarian catastrophe many in this house today will find it deeply disappointing that due to error make in the production of this documentary we be instead discuss why it be pull rather than the press matter at hand many of we will share the regret that we have end up in this situation clearly innocent palestinian child have suffer terribly over the past month do the secretary of state agree that regardless of today ’s discussion it be vital to shine an ongoing credible and sustain spotlight on the plight of child in gaza 
 yes and i thank the hon gentleman for his careful and consider word on this in the last year i meet with the british family of some of the child in gaza and the story be absolutely horrifying we have a duty to ensure that those story be tell and that people can have confidence in what they be be tell 
 i thank the secretary of state for get to grip with this issue so quickly and acknowledge that what happen on   october   and what happen subsequently in gaza be of huge significance her understanding give i hope will she commit to come back to this chamber and update we on the outcome of whatever happen with the bbc investigation 
 i be happy to say to my hon friend who have a long stand interest and have be a real champion for child in gaza for many year that   i will be more than happy to keep colleague update as this progress and to update the whole house at the early opportunity 
 i call the chair of the culture media and sport committee 
 the bbc have definitely get question to answer here not just on the dealing over this film but on the wide concern about the representation and reporting of the gaza conflict as the secretary of state say hamas be a proscribe terrorist organisation yet they be refer to as such in just of instance of report by the bbc it take day after broadcast for this programme to be take off iplayer and at that point the bbc say there have to be far due diligence with the production company it be not the time that the bbc have have issue with its due diligence but in subject matter as sensitive and incendiary as this language matter and treat issue like this with detail sensitivity and impartiality matter especially the bbc board be meet today how confident be the secretary of state that the board be provide the necessary challenge to executive to maintain that due diligence and to maintain the trust in the organisation 
 the hon lady be absolutely right that the bbc board play the critical role in ensure that the bbc reach the high possible standard which she and i and indeed all member of this house expect they will have hear her word and mine loud and clear we expect they to play that role they must do that and part of my job be to hold they to account for what they do and do not do in relation to this 
 i welcome this statement because i think it be important that we talk about our tone in public life i worry that sometimes the public outside the chamber do not see this house as be the good arbiter of appropriate tone in fact in recent day i have hear joke about suicide i have see sexism and so much more do the secretary of state agree that we should lead from the front and set a good example in this house on how we police our own boundary and language 
 my hon friend as always have take care to strike the right tone and i thank he very much for raise that interruption 
 order the question be not relevant to what we be discuss that be the problem 
 i listen carefully to what the secretary of state say and welcome her clear criticism of this documentary but may i return to some of the at good mistranslation that happen during the documentary that my right hon friend the shadow secretary of state reference instance of the arabic word for jews be change to israeli and possibly bad of all interviewee praise the hamas leader for his jihad against the jews yet the bbc translate that to fight israeli force that be not an error in google translate it be clearly a deliberate attempt to completely misinterpret the approach towards hamas and the situation in the middle east can she   give i an assurance that she will be robust in challenge those translation because those term be clearly antisemitic and take a pro hamas pro terrorist viewpoint 
 i be more than happy to give the hon gentleman that assurance i discuss the precise use of language with the bbc director general early this week on the question ask by   the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage i also discuss the use of the full term a proscribe terror organisation by the uk government and the frequency with which that term be use by the bbc i make it clear that i as the secretary of state believe that it be incredibly important that the bbc adhere to its own guideline 
 hamas be a proscribe organisation and that be as it should be the israeli military have ban international journalist from gaza and at least palestinian journalist have be kill in gaza in the last day do the secretary of state agree that bbc and all medium coverage of gaza can only benefit from journalist be allow in to report on the ground a point raise with i by some constituent in the past few week do she far agree that journalist must be protect from harm in line with international law 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for the work that she have do over many year include as the director of medical aid for palestinians she know well than anyone in this house what be happen in gaza i think she may be the only member of the house who have recently be in gaza to see the condition that many hon member have describe i very much agree with her point about journalistic access and safety i also agree with my hon friend   the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn   that we set the right tone in this house be essential 
 i be sure that member across the house all agree that the most important issue be the maintenance of the ceasefire hostage need to go home aid need to get in and a peaceful future need to be build what more can this government do to ensure that the story of those affect be hear to continue the international determination for the maintenance of the ceasefire 
 when i meet british palestinians whose family member be in gaza and when i meet the family whose love one have be take hostage by hamas and have be hold or continue to be hold in gaza i make a commitment to they that in opposition and in government we would continue to use every opportunity to shine a spotlight on what be happen to they i think they will be very encourage by the word of the hon lady it be a particular to tribute to the house that members from every political party be raise these issue and ensure that we continue to tell those story 
 since the hamas atrocity of   october ten of thousand of gazans have be kill by israeli force and hundred of thousand more have be subject to unimaginable suffering it be essential that their story be tell and it be unacceptable that the bbc should have choose to tell they through those connect   to hamas we understand that the bbc be not allow into gaza so will the secretary of state confirm where this programme be subcontract and to whom on the issue of translation do the bbc not have a translation guide be that publicly available if not should it be finally when israeli ministers and other call for the ethnic cleansing of gaza or for the elimination of the palestinian people surely that must be report in a way that highlight that that be illegal and the cause of immense distress to many in this country 
 my hon friend speak powerfully about the careful use of language and the way in which we all have a responsibility to uphold the high standard on that on her specific question have have discussion with the bbc i can confirm that this be not a bbc programme it be commission by an external organisation.[official report   march vol c. 8wc correction that in no way absolve the bbc from the responsibility to undertake due diligence on a programme that it air when it be air by our national broadcaster it be grant the legitimacy of our national broadcaster and that be why these standard matter i will take away her suggestion about a publicly available translation guide which might help to assuage some of the concern raise by   the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith and discuss that with the bbc 
 it be essential that the editorial independence of the bbc be protect at home and abroad will the secretary of state tell the house whether she or anyone in her department have contact formally or informally with the israeli embassy about the documentary before it be pull from iplayer and will she say when contact be make between she and the bbc between the programme be air and then be pull from iplayer 
 no 
 i thank the secretary of state for her very clear statement the big picture that the opposition be miss here be that the british medium at large have greatly suffer from a lack of access in gaza during the deadly war on record for journalist my former colleague have variously be deny entry and have unnecessarily prolong and risky exit and our palestinian contributor have be stick in a living nightmare will the secretary of state ensure that she continue to safeguard british medium interest and their reporting abroad and work with foreign office colleague to enlarge access for journalist in gaza 
 i be very happy to give my hon friend that assurance as i say in answer to an early question my right hon friend the foreign secretary have raise this issue and he and i be work very closely together on it my hon friend will be aware that the bbc world service play a critical role in ensure that free and fair information be available all over the world which be why we rightly expect the high standard from the bbc 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s robust view on the bbc however the problem be that the bbc do not refer to hamas as a terrorist organisation as it should indeed the problem be that david collier an investigative journalist could   actually go through the documentary and identify all the error that be make while sit at his computer if the bbc can not do that something be seriously wrong particularly when it be in the position of commission this documentary not do it internally can the secretary of state make sure that when she talk to the bbc it make extra effort to ensure that if it commission these sort of documentary they be actually accurate and not use terrorist and potentially funnel money to terrorist 
 i be happy to give the hon gentleman that assurance that be part of the discussion i have with the bbc director general early this week i would expect an organisation like the bbc already to have robust system in place on that and i have be assure that that be part of the internal review 
 do the secretary of state agree that across all the issue that the bbc may report on its operational and editorial independence from government be an important principle that should be uphold 
 yes i very much agree with my hon friend not least because it be the role of broadcaster to hold a mirror up not just to society but to the government and to hold we to account that be why i very much agree with the word of the medium minister in the previous government   the hon member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez who say that the bbc be not 
 an   instrument of government minister seek to interfere with editorial decision or the day to day running of the organisation would be in nobody ’s interests”.—[official report   february vol c. 103wh 
 once again the bbc have get it badly wrong since   october with its treatment and description of hamas as a terrorist organisation once again we be tell that lesson will be learn do the secretary of state think that the bbc be incompetent negligent or just riddled with antisemitism 
 i have be absolutely clear with this house that i think the bbc have serious question to answer the director general be very clear with i early this week that it have serious question to answer and that it intend to answer they in full and i will make sure that be the case 
 it be quite clear that the bbc have not show the standard of journalistic integrity that we expect of it in the case of this documentary or through its coverage of the   october   attack and the war that follow danny cohen the former bbc director of television say that the bbc be institutionally hostile to israel can we have an inquiry into not only this incident but the bbc ’s relationship with hamas the independence of its reporter in gaza from hamas and its wide coverage of israel if there be evidence of bbc fund reach a proscribe terrorist organisation will the secretary of state join i in say that there should be a full criminal investigation 
 ensure that no money have fall into the hand of hamas be the duty of all of we the last government be very clear about that in relation to the aid budget and we be very clear about that too the bbc need to be as clear or there must be consequence 
 i also reassure the hon gentleman that in december i convene a roundtable with the jewish community to discuss antisemitism in the art and the creative industry more generally i be appal by what i hear at that meeting which be convene by lord mann and the board of deputies of british jews we be work very closely together to stamp out the many unacceptable practice that we have see creep not just into the bbc but across broadcasting and the art more generally since this appalling conflict begin 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for her answer to the urgent question we all agree that the genuine inaccuracy and misrepresentation in this documentary and in all reporting must be address and that step must be take to prevent they from reoccurre we also all agree that there be no place for antisemitism or any other racism anywhere 
 the bbc have be accuse by more than of its staff of give israel favourable coverage in its reporting of the war on gaza and criticise for its lack of accurate evidence base journalism the letter send to the bbc ’s director general and chief executive officer say 
 basic journalistic tenet have be lack when it come to hold israel to account for its action 
 its signatory include more than anonymous bbc staff and more than people from the media industry the letter also say 
 the consequence of inadequate coverage be significant every television report article and radio interview that have fail to robustly challenge israeli claim have systematically dehumanise palestinians 
 what step 
 order we have get to get to the question please 
 my apology mr speaker what step be the secretary of state take to investigate and address the unacceptable and biased anti palestinian and pro israel report by the bbc since   october so that it can be trust by those in this house and by the licence fee payer who fund its existence 
 the view that the hon gentleman have express show what a contested and difficult area this be to report on while this government believe it be essential that we shine a spotlight on what be happen to people particularly child in gaza there be no excuse for antisemitism or for the sort of practice that have be allege against the bbc in recent week in relation to this documentary 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s robust response from the dispatch box today and thank she for it this be an egregious example but the problem be the pattern of behaviour for example the bbc have spend £ of taxpayer money on legal fee to cover up the balen report into coverage of this conflict do the secretary of state agree that there be valid question as to why the bbc have refuse   to submit to an independent inquiry do she agree that the finding of the balen report have be suppress and will the government urge the bbc to publish that report 
 the hon gentleman be right that there be valid question to answer the bbc be a treasured national broadcaster it play an important role in our public life and indeed in the whole ecosystem of the creative industry in this country that be why we be determined to hold it to the high possible standard and we expect that it will do nothing less itself 
 i thank the secretary of state for her statement we all agree that the bbc ’s impartiality be imperative and that antisemitism be abhorrent but be it not enough that we have stand by as gazans have be kill include gazan child be it not enough that we have stand by as aid worker and journalist have be kill do the secretary of state agree that child and the narrator of this show specifically can not be hold accountable for the action of their parent or be this just an extension of netanyahu ’s policy of collective punishment of the gazan people 
 of course i agree with the hon gentleman that child can not be hold responsible for relationship that they have but to be clear if the child in question be relate to senior hamas official that be important context for viewer to understand not to inform the public about that context fall way short of the standard we would expect of our national broadcaster 
 can i also say to the hon gentleman that we as a country have not stand aside while over people have be kill in gaza my right hon friend the foreign secretary have make this his top priority he have be in the region several time in recent month and just a few week ago my right hon friend the minister for development announce £ in humanitarian funding for gaza to ensure that we support its people    notwithstanding the very difficult decision that the prime minister announce at this dispatch box on tuesday we be committed to continue to support the people of gaza 
 the day when people gain their news from the bbc and itv be long go we now have a whole range of medium outlet many of which do not have the same editorial standard as we expect from our national broadcaster so do the secretary of state agree that it be vital that we can trust our national broadcaster and that it maintain the high possible standard 
 the hon member make an important point which i do not think anybody have make yet in this debate which be that we expect more from the bbc because it be our treasured national broadcaster there be a media landscape out there and we have get to make sure that all our broadcaster meet the high standard especially when it come to this conflict 
 i thank the minister for her answer to the urgent question the bbc have publicly fund status and therefore have an obligation to report impartially but that have be call into question since the   october   atrocity will the minister act to hold the bbc cameraman and the staff accountable for their failing furthermore what measure will be introduce to ensure that the bbc ’s editorial standard be raise to prevent the dissemination of misleading biased and unverified content 
 the hon member will have hear that i raise a number of issue around this particular documentary and the reporting of this conflict more generally when i meet the bbc director general i expect the high possible standard i hear from the director general that he expect the high possible standard as well and that the review will cover all the area that the hon member rightly raise
