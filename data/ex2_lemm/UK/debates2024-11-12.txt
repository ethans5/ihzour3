we will come on to life peer shortly 
 this be an important change that be in our manifesto as you will recognise madam chair it be important because we need equality of representation which be vital if we be to retain confidence in the way in which both this house and the other place operate it be year since woman be allow to sit in the other place but there be currently no woman among the hereditary peer there and i for am embarrassed by that it be a disgrace as a member from the north west i should add that it have not escape my attention or that of my constituent that individual from my part of this great nation be under represent in the other place especially again among the hereditary peer 
 accord to the electoral reform society of hereditary peer live in london and the south east i do not accept that a hereditary peer who be the son of a duke an earl a viscount or a marquess be any well prepared to scrutinise education than the daughter of a plumber or the son of a nurse 
 bolney in twineham parish in my constituency host the rampion windfarm substation which lead to several battery energy storage solution application what reassurance can the minister give my constituent about the adequacy of the regulatory framework 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to establish international leadership on climate change 
 today the secretary of state for energy security and net my right hon friend   the member for doncaster north ed miliband be already at cop29 in baku where he will be lead climate negotiation he send his apology the prime minister be also at cop29 and will be speak at the global leader summit announce our ambitious ° c align nationally determine contribution and show that the uk be truly back on the international stage a write statement will also be make later today 
 i welcome the leadership the government be show in particular on ndcs as my hon friend mention the news that this year be likely to be the hot on record across the world be deeply concern and remind we that climate breakdown be a global challenge that we must all face do the minister agree that we must have ambitious plan at home so that we can go to cop and challenge other world leader to do more to tackle climate change 
 i completely agree with my hon friend there be a direct link between take action to protect the british people at home and lead on climate action abroad if we want to protect our country from future energy shock and the runaway cost of climate chaos we must work with other country to protect our planet we now have the credibility to do that because of the action we have take since enter government as be apparent when i attend pre cop meeting in baku last month and as the prime minister will demonstrate in baku today 
 i warmly welcome the new government target to cut carbon emission and i know the secretary of state and the minister thoroughly understand the importance of join up action on climate justice can she tell we whether every single government policy across every government department will now be assess to check   whether it be compatible with ° what step be the government take to ensure the global south be properly compensate for climate loss and damage 
 on the point at this cop we want to ensure that we fully operationalise the loss and damage fund so we then start get money into it and channel money to develop country we also want to do that through the new collective quantified goal which we hope will be ambitious and multi layered 
 on the question of look at our policy across the piece that be very much my job we will be respond soon to the committee on climate change ’s report which the hon lady will know be quite critical of the previous government ’s action we will be set out our plan to implement the ndc and look at the next carbon budget all those thing require effort share across department to ensure we actually meet they it be about not just set ambitious target but make sure that unlike the previous government we have a strategy to get we there 
 rise 
 i call noah law be you stand 
 indicate dissent 
 okay i call toby perkins here ’ a man who be ready to go 
 i be ready to go and so be the prime minister it be great to see he in baku show leadership the recent cali conference be a disappointment ultimately nation be not able to reach agreement alongside the positive step the uk government be take what conversation be we have with international partner to recognise the necessity of an agreement that bring all western nation together in show equal ambition 
 i thank my hon friend for that question i know he be at cali there be some progress on such issue as digital sequence information but more need to be do we be very seized of the need to join up action on the nature and climate crisis when i head out to cop29 tomorrow members will hopefully hear more from we on our effort to protect forest and on the support we be give to country at risk of deforestation we be also look at nature base solution to climate change the nature minister the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for coventry east mary creagh will be out there as well and we will have more to say but i entirely agree with my hon friend   the member for chesterfield mr perkins   that we can not deal with crisis in isolation from the other 
 for the uk to be an international leader on climate change we need to bring the business community with we the summer berry company in my constituency recently invest £ in ensure it be carbon neutral but it be then quote a furth £ to be able to feed its excess energy into the grid what be the minister do to make additional grid connection affordable and accessible for green business 
 the energy minister the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks be very much involve with that issue we have also set up the energy superpower mission board head by chris stark i have a conversation with he yesterday about what we can do to ensure grid capacity and grid connection in the right place if the hon lady have a specific issue to raise and would like to write to i i will make sure it be pass on to he 
 i call the shadow minister whom i welcome to the front bench 
 when i ask the secretary of state about the appointment of rachel kyte as his international climate envoy during our last question session he fail to say whether quadrature capital ’s £ donation to the labour party have be declare to the department before her appointment and i have still not receive a reply to my letter of   october will the minister tell i whether the secretary of state declare those interest to the department before rachel kyte ’s appointment and whether ministers have ever meet director of quadrature capital or quadrature climate foundation 
 i be sure that the shadow minister will receive a reply to her letter in due course but i can tell she that rachel kyte be extremely well respected and that her appointment as our special representative have be welcome across the board 
 what progress he have make on achieve clean energy by 
 what progress he have make on achieve clean energy by 
 what progress he have make on achieve clean power by 
 what progress he have make on achieve clean power by 
 in just short month we have make rapid progress on achieve our mission for clean power by we have set up great british energy and announce its headquarters in aberdeen secure a record break renewable project and consent to record amount of solar we be get on with deliver low bill energy security good job and climate action 
 rolls royce in derby be an international leader in research on and the development of small modular reactor and it be fantastic that the government have acknowledge the role that smr will play in clean power generation energy security and green job in the budget we hear that the final decision on great british nuclear ’s smr   competition will conclude next spring do the minister agree that it be important for this opportunity to be seize as soon as possible 
 i agree with my hon friend that nuclear will play a central role in our clean power mission and will continue to be a critical part of our energy mix as we progress towards and far beyond great british nuclear be continue to drive forward the competition on small modular reactor with bid currently be evaluate by the department and i look forward to have more to say about this in due course 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 the last government hold a consultation on electricity market arrangement but despite have say that that be their flagship policy in this area they do not publish the result of that consultation do my hon friend agree that electricity and indeed energy market reform be crucial to achieve the government ’s state clean energy target and to reduce bill and can he say whether this government will publish the result of the last government ’s consultation and if so when 
 i congratulate my hon friend again on his appointment as chair of the select committee he bring a huge amount of knowledge and experience to the role and i agree with he about the importance of review electricity market arrangement we be build on the last government ’s consultation and we will have more to say in the month ahead this be a crucial element of how we achieve clean power by and ensure that our energy system of the future be fit for what will be a different way of manage energy throughout the country we will have more to say about that in the month ahead 
 last week a report publish by the national energy system operator note that although the programme to roll out new small modular reactor be be develop for the mid-2030 a roll out date would in fact be possible give that smr technology hold exciting and significant potential for investment in job and infrastructure in constituency such as mine have the minister consider the value of bring the roll out forward to 
 my hon friend be right to say that nuclear will play a vital role and that it not only deliver on our energy security but create good well pay job unlike the last government who in year do not deliver a single nuclear project there be many consultation and process but not a single nuclear power station be build this government be get on with deliver a nuclear future 
 last week ’s report from the national energy system operator show that not only be clean power by achievable but it can lead to low bill and more secure system do the minister agree that the only way to protect bill payer permanently be to go as far and as fast as possible towards our clean power mission by 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the report publish by the independent national energy system operator lay out not only that reach our clean power mission be entirely achievable but that it will bring down bill the importance of the report be that it set the course for how that be possible the reality which the conservative party refuse to accept be that the only way to get we off the rollercoaster of high bill be to deliver at pace the clean energy that we know will deliver energy security and climate leadership and bring down bill for people right across the country 
 i be delighted that the minister be set out that the report promise an extra £ of investment a year in the energy sector and presumably the taxis to go with it which will of course come from the business that be pay for everything else in the budget that have just go by be there anything at all in his proposal that will actually bring down the cost of energy and not be replace by taxpayer funding it appear at the moment that there be nothing and energy price be already go up 
 i would encourage the right hon gentleman to read the neso report because it set out in great detail not only that clean power be achievable by but that it will lead to low bill what he say about investment miss the point in the last few week we have announce billion of pound of private sector investment in these project indeed scottish power have announce today that it will provide £ company be choose to invest in this country whereas they do not under the conservative party the reality be that once upon a time the conservatives recognise that the drive to net be important they have abandon that commitment now 
 i thank the minister for agree to meet the offset offshore electricity grid taskforce group of mps later today we be very much look forward to the meeting do he recognise that achieve the deadline set out in the neso report require an acceleration of the process which in turn be dependent on much high level of public consent 
 i recognise the hon gentleman ’s point and i be look forward to meet he and his colleague this afternoon to discuss the particular issue in his area we need to build more network infrastructure across the uk to make this endeavour a reality but he be right we want to bring community with we on this journey that be why we have say that we be look again at what community benefit will look like build on some of the work that the previous government do in consult on this issue crucially however if want to bring down bill and deliver energy security we will have to build the infrastructure and that be what this government be commit to do 
 the minister know well the liberal democrats commitment to community energy will the government establish a clean community energy scheme look at the barrier that currently face community energy project and look at support the national grid to deliver community energy 
 the hon lady and i have have a number of conversation and i recognise her commitment on this issue we have commit in the local power plan to deliver investment in community energy across the country importantly we want not only to invest in scheme but to deliver across government the mechanism need to make it more possible for community to deliver such scheme that will build capacity in community so that we can see more community energy 
 what be the beef behind the government ’s reluctance to embrace with enthusiasm locally generate community energy why do they vote against the amendment table to the great british energy bill by   the hon member for bath wera hobhouse 
 i think the right hon gentleman think that be a gotcha question but of course the conservative party do not vote for the bill at all amendment or not i do not think he can really speak about what great british energy might deliver because despite it be of the most popular policy at the last election the conservatives fail to bother to vote for it 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last week the national energy system operator publish a full system cost analysis of the secretary of state ’s flagship project to carbonise the grid by this morning the secretary of state say on several medium outlet that the report show that his plan will lower bill i remind the house that the report assume that gas price be high than the department ’s own estimate that the price of carbon price be at least double what it be now that the government can commission more offshore wind in the next year than in the last combine without move price and that they can build the grid at a pace we have never see before in this country without any delay even if all that be achieve page of the report show that the cost of the system will be high for clarity would the minister like to repeat at the dispatch box the secretary of state ’s claim that the neso report show that labour ’s system will lead to a low cost of electricity 
 what the shadow secretary of state have just outline quite coherently be that the conservatives have no ambition in this space whatsoever but we do i be very happy for the right hon lady to outline where our ambition be we will build fast than the previous government although i have to say that that would not be difficult the shadow minister sit next to she   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie say quite clearly at their conference that the previous government have build infrastructure far too slowly and their former energy minister   the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart say that their onshore wind ban be always mad we be quite happy to pick up where they leave off and deliver the clean power that this country need 
 this be the ministerial team who tell the electorate they be go to cut their bill by £ without do any homework to find out how those   plan would work they vote against our amendment to hold they to account on their own pledge just week ago and now they be try to claim that the neso report show that their approach will lower bill when in fact it show in black and white that the system will be much more expensive do the minister not see that if they follow this plan we will be a warning not an example to the rest of the world and that the british people will be cold and poor as a result 
 time and again the conservatives run away from their record on this in office the reason why people right across this country be pay more on their energy bill be that the conservatives do not get we off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel market but we be now move at pace the right hon lady may want to keep we in the vulnerable state where we be reliant on international gas market but we be determined that we will not do that we will bring down bill and deliver energy security i be not ashamed to say that we will move with great ambition to deliver what this country need and to deliver the good job that go with it 
 what step he be take to establish great british energy 
 we be move at pace to set up great british energy so far we have appoint the start up chair jürgen maier we have announce that the headquarters will be in aberdeen and we have progress the bill through the house of commons this build on the partnership announce for great british energy with the crown estate and on a recent new deal to collaborate with scottish public body we be get on with the job of deliver century public ownership for the british people 
 every family and every business in my constituency pay the price of year of conservative failure with rocket energy bill because the last government fail to invest in clean energy the opposition continue to oppose great british energy do the minister recognise the absurdity of their argument that they be quite happy with foreign public ownership as long as it be not uk citizen who own our energy 
 my hon friend make a good point it be important to remember that despite what the conservatives might have we believe great british energy be overwhelmingly popular with the british people that include the people in scotland because of course it be not just the conservative party who do not vote for great british energy surprisingly the scottish national party also fail to vote for a publicly own champion in our energy space we be get on with deliver job and growth deliver with public ownership through great british energy 
 before the election labour say that great british energy would cut electricity bill by £ after the election the labour government vote against write that into law and instead take away people ’s winter fuel payment and make their bill more expensive the   institute for fiscal studies have now say that their policy be fundamentally raise price for consumer to the tune of £ per household and we know from the neso report that this will get bad even if they triple the pace of wind roll out double the pace of grid connection and make other heroic assumption all of this be go to bump up cost far be it not we be do this from the basis of have the high electricity price in europe what assessment have the minister make of the impact on british industry 
 question after question from the conservatives show that they do not recognise the part they play for year in why we be pay high bill than ever before we be the only party with an ambitious plan to get we off the volatile fossil fuel market the conservatives use to believe that in our drive to net we should build this infrastructure for the long term they be now oppose it but they will have to tell their constituent why they want to leave they expose to rise bill 
 whether he plan to support the development of fusion power plant connect to the grid 
 we agree that fusion could be a globally transformative green energy solution the uk government ’s fusion programme continue to lead the world in the development of fusion energy and our ambition be to continue to do so 
 week ago the budget announcement that the fusion power plant will be build in bassetlaw be welcome news can the minister provide great detail on this commitment alongside the funding support be make available for the next financial year 
 my hon friend be a great champion for her constituency and i be pleased to meet she to talk about this issue and to hear her westminster hall debate i look forward to visit her constituency later this month to see the fusion café and to visit west burton the site of the step project after which i hope to be able to share more detail on how we will support fusion 
 dounreay in my constituency be the site of the uk ’s fission reactor today we have a highly skilled workforce a licensed site and a local population that warmly support the industry will the government seriously consider involve dounreay as we bring fusion to its wonderful fruition 
 i think fusion have huge potential and so many company stand to benefit it be not just about the ultimate goal of fusion energy it be also about all the technological advance we will discover i have speak to fusion company which be for example find use for cancer treatment i be very interested to hear what the hon gentleman have to say about the possibility of fusion in his constituency we want to see this proceed if he drop i a line i will be happy to explore the opportunity in his patch 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we have speak a lot about the conservative party ’s record in government and i be very proud of our record on fusion we launch the fusion futures programme to provide up to £ of funding to train more than people we become the country in the world to regulate fusion as a distinct energy technology and we launch the process to build the spherical tokamak for energy production i can not say that as quickly at what will be the fusion power plant at west burton in nottinghamshire hon member hear hear member be very welcome will the minister confirm that it be still the government ’s intention as it be ours to have fusion power on the grid by 
 as i mention i be very much look forward to visit west burton soon the budget announce significant support for fusion energy in and yes we remain as ambitious as the previous government for the potential of fusion energy 
 have confirm that be still the ambition which do the minister think will come fusion on the grid or the final investment decision on sizewell c 
 the final investment decision on sizewell c as i understand it be expect soon we will hear more about support for that in the next spending review fusion energy have huge potential not just in the long term but from the innovation we be already see in that sphere which i very much welcome 
 what plan he have to support the development of carbon capture utilisation and storage project at acorn 
 what recent step his department have take to support carbon capture and storage 
 on   october the government announce £ over the next year to launch the uk ’s carbon capture utilisation and storage industry we will provide further detail on the next step for ccus include track project such as acorn in the come month 
 i thank the minister for her encouraging answer acorn include the st fergus site in aberdeenshire not only have a significant role to play in achieve net in scotland but have the capacity to accept carbon from mainland europe this project could help the uk and europe to achieve their net goal and be significant not only for the port of peterhead in my constituency as the minister know but for the local power station which share the same integrated ambition acorn present very significant opportunity represent hundred of million of pound in new investment new job and economic growth for the north east for scotland   and for the uk can the minister accelerate the decision making on the acorn project and will she commit to funding in 
 we be commit to track and i recognise the huge advantage of acorn that the hon gentleman have highlight our record £ investment demonstrate our long term commitment and give industry the certainty it need the up and down of ccus under the previous government do not provide the certainty that people require and certainty be what we be look to deliver we understand that people want clarity and we will be make further announcement in the coming month 
 the path to carbon capture and storage be litter with failure previous project never get off the ground despite lot of taxpayer money go into they what precisely be the government go to do to ensure that this project deliver 
 if the hon lady would look towards i a little bit i will be able to hear the question 
 we realise that ccus be an emerge industry but it be also that we can lead on internationally thank to the unique geography of the north sea we will do all we can to help industry scale up in this technology which we believe will play a crucial role in our mission towards clean power 
 whether he have have recent discussion with national grid on diversify the energy mix of its network 
 the government regularly meet stakeholder to discuss the development of our energy infrastructure last week the government receive advice from the national energy system operator outline its advice on the pathway towards clean power by later this year we will publish our action plan which will set out detail on the future of our energy mix 
 offshore wind have be a real positive for our energy security and grid independence but unfortunately not when the wind do not blow give the election of a president who tell we he be go to drill baby drill what revision do the minister anticipate to his timetable towards net 
 as i say in my previous answer later this year we will outline our action plan on how we will deliver on the target there be no change to our timetable in that regard the right hon gentleman raise a good point about what happen when the wind do not blow and the sun do not shine and about ensure we have a mix in our energy system that be why we remain supportive of nuclear and why we have recently announce investment in long duration energy storage to ensure we can capture energy and use it when we need it 
 i be delight by ofgem ’s announcement this morning that it now recommend that the propose nautilus interconnector should be locate at the isle of grain not on the suffolk coast since i have be elect i have make firm representation to the minister and ofgem include via its consultation that the suffolk coast should not have be consider and brownfield site should have be consider will the minister meet i to discuss other national grid project in my constituency 
 ofgem have announce today decision on a number of interconnector those be decision for ofgem and not for the government we have recently announce the launch of a strategic spatial energy plan to ensure that we plan such project holistically across the whole of the united kingdom and take into account a number of scheme when plan future energy such as those my hon friend mention in her constituency i will continue to have discussion about that with member from across the country 
 china ’s large offshore float wind turbine company ming yang smart energy plan to build its manufacture plant outside china in scotland ming yang benefit from huge subsidy in china but there be serious question about energy security and national security the secretary of state say he want to end reliance on foreign autocrat but when he be ask about this on the radio this morning he have no answer will the minister rule out allow any turbine that might be control by hostile state 
 we be encourage investment in the uk to build the infrastructure that we need in the future just today we have announce the clean industry bonus that will give as much support as possible to company to build their supply chain here in this country we will continue to look at supply chain and of course we take seriously the company across the range of business project that be invest in this country there be a series of process already under way across government whenever anybody want to invest in this country those process will be follow in the usual manner 
 mr speaker will you and the minister give the house an opportunity to celebrate the £ of investment announce today in offshore wind in this country it will provide job across the country as promise by this government which the british people be not use to after the past year will the minister meet i to discuss the infrastructure require to connect that clean secure energy to our home in particular the sea link project that could have an impact in my constituency 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the fantastic announcement today by scottishpower of £ of investment here in the uk build the infrastructure that we need and deliver job and skill in this country as well it be of a number of announcement that we expect because we be not agnostic in this government on deliver the industrial strategy that we need my hon friend the minister for   industry be work on that at the moment we will deliver the job in this country to build the clean power of the future we will deliver good well pay job and the energy security we need 
 what step she be take to support job creation in the renewable energy sector 
 deliver good job be the drive force behind our growth and clean energy mission great british energy and the national wealth fund will crowd in private sector investment to spread job across the country through investment in clean energy i be delighted that the prime minister have today launch the clean industry bonus which will incentivise developer to invest in the uk ’s industrial heartland coastal area and oil and gas community boost job and deliver on another of our manifesto promise 
 i be also delighted with my hon friend ’s commitment to deliver clean energy job it be important to constituency such as mine in peterborough which could be the king ’s cross for a new core hydrogen network as recommend by the national infrastructure commission thank to national gas ’s project union national gas have its hydrogen ready gas compression site in our city and we be about to open a new green technology centre to develop new green job and apprenticeship will the minister commit to work with local authority such as mine college and business such as national gas to deliver new job across the supply chain and in all part of the country 
 i completely agree with my hon friend ’s sentiment and commend the work that he be do in his constituency low carbon technology will of course play a critical role in our future from hydrogen to carbon capture and to renewable energy i be pleased that in the budget we see the funding of hydrogen project which will drive job and growth i be really keen to talk to he about his plan for peterborough become the king ’s cross for a hydrogen network and applaud the work that be go on in his constituency around green job 
 rise 
 rise 
 i call jim farron 
 i or he mr speaker laughter 
 mr speaker perhaps if i start   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   could finish 
 in order to safeguard renewable job and to create new one will the minister consider a specific project that have hydro turbine manufacturer such as gilkes in kendal and many other around the country work alongside our farmer to make use of stream beck and river that go through farmland to create renewable industry and indeed new job 
 we be ambitious to create all the job that we want to see in the green technology of the future i would be very interested to hear more about what the hon gentleman have to say the climate change committee estimate that up to net job could be create by opposition members have decide that they do not support that path the question be why be they object to all these new job that we will be create across our country 
 what step he be take to introduce a warm home plan 
 what step he be take to introduce a warm home plan 
 what step he be take to introduce a warm home plan 
 we be commit to an ambitious warm home plan which will upgrade home across the country make they warm and cheap to run by instal new insulation and roll out low carbon heating such as solar and heat pump as a step the government have commit an initial £ over the next year towards upgrade home we have already hit the ground run with the roll out of our warm home local grant and our warm home social housing fund we will set out more detail in due course 
 too many of my constituent be live in poorly insulate social housing new mother dionne for instance have the insulation from her flat removed last year by her social landlord because it be full of mould and mildew she be now face her winter without insulation will the minister confirm that the warm home plan will introduce tough new standard to ensure that social housing provider get on and insulate their housing stock 
 yes absolutely raise standard in the social housing sector will be a critical part of our warm home plan we have already announce plan to lift renter out of fuel poverty by raise the minimum energy efficiency standard in both the private and the social rent sector which will ensure that renter no long have to live in cold drafty home we will also unlock £ worth of investment to the national wealth fund in partnership with lead bank to upgrade more social home and we will set out more detail to build on that in due course 
 i thank the minister for her commitment to the warm home plan many of my constituent in north somerset have write to i in recent week detail their concern that the scheme do not take sufficient account of high energy usage due to long term illness will the minister share whether the department have any plan to look into uplift the warm home discount for participant with relevant long term illness 
 we recognise that many vulnerable people include those with high energy usage often bear the great burden when energy price increase that be why we be do all we can include by work with energy company to make sure that we be provide additional support this winter and beyond i will take my hon friend ’s point away and follow up with he in due course 
 give that of home in shipley have an energy performance certificate rating of d or below i very much welcome the government ’s commitment to the warm home plan the charity groundwork provide a warm home healthy people scheme across bradford district instal energy efficiency measure and offer advice and support on energy bill do the minister agree that local charity need support to continue to help those who be most in need this winter 
 it be a national scandal that so many home across the country have an epc rating that be below c a failure of the last government to deliver the scale of home upgrade that we need we be determined to end the injustice of people live in cold and draughty home i completely agree that we must do everything we can to support vulnerable household with their energy bill this winter that be why we be provide household with the warm home discount why we be work with energy supplier to provide additional support include through charity and why we have extend the household support fund 
 do the minister agree that we particularly need a comprehensive warm home plan in rural area in order to identify very old home and ensure that insulation be target to maximise reduction in their energy usage 
 we will ensure that we see upgrade in every part of the country we will be work with combined authority local government and the devolved administration to make sure that we be deliver the scale of upgrade need across the country 
 in the light of the warm home plan be the minister aware of challenge face by homeowner who use the green home grant for spray foam insulation many now find their home unmortgageable and face significant cost for removal and repair will the minister consider measure to support such homeowner as part of the warm home plan 
 i be aware that many household have have upgrade that have not go to plan it be critical that we build confidence because in the end we need to persuade consumer up and down the country to have these upgrade there be scheme under the last administration that be not regulate and do not have the correct standard and we be work hard to make sure that we raise standard across the piece 
 we be go to need a warm home plan because with the snow and ice come in on a cold front scotland be see a sum front head north from this labour government a £ cut to the winter fuel payment and the pensioner cost of live payment for winter weather that be here now that be not in the manifesto what   be in the manifesto be a £ cut to fuel bill but those cost be now up by £ when will this government do a single thing for people face fuel poverty 
 we will work across the country to tackle fuel poverty but i remind the hon member that fuel payment be devolve the scottish government have be give the big budget and it be time to get on with the job and fix the situation 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 home in the uk be among the least energy efficient in europe with unparalleled health productivity and carbon emission cost to society as a result of the last government ’s failure to act i agree with the minister it be a disgrace that this be happen in of the large economy in the g7 we welcome the news of the warm home plan come next year but do the minister agree that an emergency home insulation programme this winter with free insulation for people on low income be necessary so that people in south cambridgeshire do not have to face the choice between heating and eat 
 let i assure the hon member that we be hit the ground run with home insulation we be roll out our warm home local grant and our warm home social housing fund to target people this winter this year because we need to deliver the big ever upgrade 
 what step he be take to support public sector body to decarbonise 
 as the step towards the warm home plan we have commit an initial £ that include £ towards public sector decarbonisation because we know that we have to ensure that our school and hospital reduce their energy bill 
 decarbonise the public sector be good for our net target but it also release money for more teacher nurse and street cleaner so that saving benefit our community rather than energy giant school across telford be cry out for that investment will the minister do all she can to decarbonise the public sector in the year to come 
 i completely agree decarbonise our public sector will not only reduce emission but low bill we estimate that the £ that we have allocate to public sector decarbonisation will reduce bill by about £ per year that be a big step forward but there be more work to do 
 it be clear that there be a role for all school across this great united kingdom to play in public sector decarbonisation they also have a role in educate the child in their classroom who we want to be the pioneer of tomorrow what have be do to ensure that the good thing that   happen on the mainland of the united kingdom be share with regional administrations such as the northern ireland assembly 
 we will work on that with the devolved administrations across the united kingdom good practice be happen across local government and regional government we will ensure that everyone can learn from it and we will deliver the big upgrade in a generation 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on job creation 
 the energy transition present an incredible opportunity for job creation right across the uk particularly in our industrial and coastal community through great british energy we will build on scotland ’s reputation as a world leader in energy and secure long term well pay job in the industry of the future 
 i recently have the privilege of open an extension to the kype muir wind farm in my constituency the extension alone will generate enough power for home for year my constituency be also home to part of whitelee the large onshore wind farm in europe however not of those turbine be manufacture in the uk let alone locally what step be the minister take to develop uk manufacturing capacity in that area 
 i know well my hon friend ’s constituency it be next door to mine and both wind farm she mention she say quite rightly that for all the expansion in those technology over recent year very few of those job particularly in manufacturing have be in this country we will do everything we can through great british energy and the clean industry bonus we have announce today to grow our domestic supply chain build industry in this country and win job for britain 
 last week just day after the budget apache announce that it would exit the north sea by it say 
 the onerous financial impact of the energy profit levy make production beyond uneconomic 
 what assessment have the government make of the impact of those policy on current job in north east scotland and how will great british energy compensate for the loss of those job 
 we be work with industry in the north east of scotland to ensure that this be a just and prosperous transition we have announce our next step of respond to court judgment and a consultation be open at the moment we will have more to say about that in the month ahead the hon lady must recognise that if she want to see investment from great british energy she might actually have to support its creation in the place the conservatives can not have it both way either they want a public energy company to invest in the job of the future 
 we do n’t 
 or they do not as her right hon friend have just confirm from the back benches she can not have it both way 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 the budget be a major step forward pave the way for investment in clean home grow power create job and deliver energy security last week the national energy system operator provide definitive evidence that our clean power mission be achievable and can give we great energy security and low energy cost the conservatives have spend the past year argue for a system that would keep the british people lock into energy insecurity and high cost while they be lock in argument about the past we be get on with deliver low bill energy security and good job for the british people 
 the price cap rise winter fuel payment cut high standing charge and low temperature be all thing that my constituent in edinburgh west particularly my pensioner be come to i with concern about what be the secretary of state planning to do to work with ofgem and the energy company to come up with a fair set of circumstance for my constituent and other in similar situation 
 we be look to bring down standing charge the hon lady have mention a lot of case where people be struggle we appreciate that and we be do what we can the budget set out how we be go to protect the most vulnerable people and ensure that people be support in the way they need to be we have a lot to do after year of conservative government we be try to unravel that and support people our push for clean energy by will lead to low bill and that be what we will be work on 
 follow on from the exciting announcement of the £ investment in wind power it would be remiss of i not to mention the severn estuary to the west of weston super mare with its transformative potential for the generation of clean renewable energy the potential of domestic energy have be neglect for far too long in a world where global energy market and the cost of living be turbulent do the minister agree that the conservative party appear to have learn absolutely nothing during its time in office preside over the bad cost of live crisis in generation and fail to act 
 order topical question should be short and punchy i be sure you be go to get to the end of your question any minute now 
 can i urge the minister to go far and fast in deliver clean power for our community which the neso report so clearly state would lead to low bill and energy security 
 my hon friend be right there be good project right across the country that we hope to invest in in the lead up to deliver in the neso report clearly set out that our aim be achievable the conservative party want to continue have the argument of the past we be determine with ambition to deliver on the argument of the future 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the prime minister be set to announce at the conference of the party that he be make the uk ’s already stringent carbon emission target even high that be despite the fact that we contribute only of global emission while the leader of the world ’s highest emit country make up over of emission be not attend the climate change committee have say that this target will require for example an accelerated shift away from meat and dairy less travel and a gas boiler ban for the british people yet the government ’s approach would see our reliance on import from china which be power by coal go through the roof do the minister agree that an approach that be ask for more sacrifice and hardship from the british people in return for more good from of the world ’s large carbon emitter would mean few job in britain and more carbon in the atmosphere 
 too long 
 i think the shadow secretary of state need to seek a debate if she want to elaborate on these issue have attend cop last year as part of a cross party delegation i find it incredibly depressing to see the way the uk be receive it be really important that we be step up and show global ambition reach net in this country and get to clean power by be a massive opportunity not a cost 
 some former miner in cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy be rightly delighted that our government have return over £ from the mineworker pension scheme to those who power our country for decade do the minister have plan to deliver similar justice to the member of the british coal staff superannuation scheme in my constituency and indeed all those affect across the uk 
 i be proud that we have finally end the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme miner across the country power our economy for decade work in the tough environment they should not have have to fight for so long for a fair pension i travel to barnsley with the secretary of state to meet former mineworker and talk about the difference that the labour government have make of course we will look at any suggestion that the bcsss come forward with 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the us president elect donald trump have repeatedly call climate change a hoax i share the concern of young people in south cambridgeshire that these view represent a threat to our effort to tackle climate change the global community be meet right now at the international climate summit in azerbaijan cop29 do the minister believe and share with i the view that the uk must rebuild its leadership by get back on track with our climate and nature target 
 i agree that it be now more important than ever that the uk show global leadership and that be exactly what the prime minister the foreign secretary and the energy secretary be do with their presence at cop today i will be head out there tomorrow i be very keen to work with the hon lady cross party on these issue work with young people be very important as well 
 i be proud that exeter be already a global leader in climate research do the minister agree that this government ’s mission on clean power will deliver low bill energy security and allow this country to enter cop29 as a world leader when it come to climate action 
 as i have say show domestic leadership give we the credibility to show international leadership too we will be do both 
 forest in north america be be chop down to supply wood to burn at drax power station at a cost of £ a day in subsidy while pensioner will perish this winter do the minister agree that it be time to end this net madness and admit that fossil fuel be a gift of the god 
 it perhaps will not surprise the hon gentleman or the house that i be not go to agree with his final point net be incredibly important to deliver climate leadership low bill and the job of the future but on biomass we rightly expect full compliance with all regulatory obligation on biomass and consumer rightly recognise the high standard of accountability from generator 
 in my constituency there be nearly member of the mineworker pension scheme i congratulate my hon friend the minister on the superb decision make in the budget to return the investment of the reserve to they i understand that this will mean a rise in their weekly pension can the minister confirm that this be correct 
 that be correct it will mean on average an extra £ a week put right a wrong that have persist for far too long although the money be important and a key part of it we have do the right thing and about time too some member across the country will benefit 
 thank you mr speaker for permit i to raise this important constituency matter from the back benches on   july     this year during the installation of a ground source heat pump in a constituent ’s back garden a gas field be strike and gas be release on   october   there be an explosion which result in the death of of my constituent and the continue evacuation of household matter relate to the period between   july   and   october   be subject to investigation i be advise that this be the such instance of gas be encounter but give that ground source heat pump be expect to play a significant role in decarbonise home heating will the minister undertake to review the regulation cover the installation of ground source heat pump and will she arrange a meeting for i with the relevant minister to discuss these matter far 
 i be sorry to hear about the incident that the hon gentleman have raise we absolutely need to ensure as we roll out all low carbon technology that standard be at the high level i undertake to meet he to understand the specific circumstance and see what we can do in term of review regulation 
 the joint european torus fusion experiment in oxfordshire have be deliver fantastic scientific result stand at the forefront of uk science and the fusion experiment internationally as jet begin to be decommission as we move forward to our next large experiment in bassetlaw can the minister comment on how we will retain all the excellent science expertise that have be build up in jet over the past decade 
 i get to see the jet project when i visit culham there be huge potential for a cluster there many more company be be attract to that sector my hon friend be right that we need to maximise the skill that be there but i be confident have speak to company that have be attract to culham and have speak to international company too that we will continue to do so 
 many home in my constituency be off grid which mean that their owner have to fill up the tank at the beginning of winter to keep warm the pensioner who have lose the winter fuel payment be struggle with that up front amount will the minister review the level at which the winter fuel payment be remove because the most vulnerable be struggle 
 we be do everything we can to help the household that will struggle with bill this winter we have have a big push to increase the uptake of pension credit and we be work with energy supplier to provide additional support this winter alongside our warm home discount which will provide a rebate of £ to household in fuel poverty we have also extend the household support fund 
 i have work for many year with london school of economics academic and uk resident dr gubad ibadoghlu who have be arbitrarily detain in azerbaijan since july for uncover corruption in the fossil fuel industry despite a severe   medical condition during cop29 will minister meet their azerbaijani counterpart to urge they to drop the charge and to release he 
 i understand that the foreign commonwealth and development minister have raise the case with the azerbaijani foreign minister and urge allow dr ibadoghlu to travel overseas for specialist medical care if require we will continue to use our diplomatic channel to raise our concern about the protection of freedom and human right in azerbaijan include for my hon friend ’s constituent 
 conservative members will never stop hold the government to account for their pre election promise to cut energy bill by £ have civil service official conduct any modelling whatsoever that can legitimise that figure 
 we arrive at the figure through independent analysis we stand by the reality that the only way to bring down bill be to commit to our target the national energy system operator back that but the conservative party fail to support that action the hon member therefore must explain what the conservative plan be for reduce bill for people who be pay more than they have ever pay 
 my constituent understand that tackle the climate crisis and get low bill go hand in hand and they be excited about great british energy will gbe invest in community energy project in place such as macclesfield 
 my hon friend be right to make a point about community energy the local power plan that we be commit to will deliver community energy project throughout great britain i be sure that macclesfield have some fantastic project that great british energy will look at we want to unleash the potential of community energy across the country 
 national grid ’s rationale for rebuild east claydon substation be base on speculative application not consent real scheme will the minister therefore meet i to find a way to get national grid more ground in reality rather than speculation 
 i be happy to look at specific case but the secretary of state ’s role as final decision maker on some planning application mean that i can not comment on they however generally speak the hon member make an important point about look at how we plan project holistically throughout the country that be why we have announce the ever spatial energy plan for the whole of great britain 
 the devastating scene of flooding in spain remind we all of why urgent investment be need to deal with the deadly consequence of climate change do the minister agree that that investment should be pay for by the pollute company that have cause the climate crisis 
 we hope that at cop29 in the come week we can settle on a figure for a new ambitious goal which will not just bring in finance from donor country but mobilise private sector finance we will use all the mechanism we can to ensure that we get money to develop country as quickly as possible as my hon friend say it be more urgent than ever to act 
 order i have get to get all member in and ministers have get to help i and work with i 
 bolney and twineham parishe in my constituency host the rampion windfarm substation which lead to several battery energy storage solution application what reassurance can the minister give my constituent about the adequacy of the regulatory framework 
 battery will play an important role in our energy mix in the short duration storage that we need we will continue to look at whether the regulatory arrangement be sufficient obviously we want all the application to be for safe project the regulation be in place to ensure that if we need to do any more work we will happily look at that 
 we have a very successful all party group meeting last week on float offshore wind in the celtic sea i know the minister be supportive and ask he to consider mechanism such as ringfencing contract for difference and investment in port to kickstart the investment in the celtic sea 
 my hon friend be right to raise the important potential of the celtic sea in our green energy transition i will be in wales tomorrow to speak at a green energy conference on exactly that question there be huge potential in float offshore wind we want to bring the manufacture job in the supply chain to this country as well which be why we launch today our clean industry bonus to bring that investment here to build the factory of the future and deliver the good clean job of the future 
 the wind industry have rightly agree a standard compensation package for rural community with big wind plant the solar industry however be unsurprisingly busy whitewash uyghur slave labour in its supply chain rather than do that if it will not act will the government step forward and recognise that they must support rural community by create a standardised compensation programme 
 the hon lady have pursue this and several other issue to do with the solar industry for a long time we be currently look at all the option particularly around community benefit to ensure that they be at a scale follow on from the previous government ’s consultation on whether they should be compulsory that genuinely benefit community 
 my constituent konnie huq with arts council and lottery funding have compile a kid climate guide with jamie   oliver among the contributor will ministers join force with she to get it out there preferably to every school in the country because we have get to start young 
 i would be more than happy to meet with my hon friend and her constituent who sound rather familiar to discuss what more we can do to support climate education among child include in our school 
 i meet with national grid yesterday and communicate my concern about the norwich to tilbury line but we remain constructive and talk about community benefit scheme unfortunately it tell i that the government be drag their foot on define community benefit scheme can the minister update the house on when they will bring forward guidance and can he promise that a community benefit scheme be a real positive economic benefit for my resident who be impact by the pylon 
 clearly i can not speak for national grid but i can speak for this government and in month we have move as quickly as possible on what a community benefit scheme will look like for network infrastructure as well as for generation project the conservative party have year to put in place a different scheme and do not in month we be move as quickly as we can 
 as minister know the european powerhouse of critical mineral be cornwall include its vast quantity of lithium essential for our transition away from fossil fuel will the ministers agree with the industry ’s call for a target of tonne of lithium 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and look forward to meet he shortly to talk about tin among other thing we be look at our critical    mineral strategy there be a big role to play in his neck of the wood for lithium and tin and we will be push that as hard as we can 
 ahead of the general election the labour party be warn that its plan for the north sea in scotland would lead to up to scottish job loss last week this become a reality when the us oil firm apache say that it would end all its operation in the north sea by the end of cite this uk government ’s budget and tax regime can the minister explain why this uk government see the job and livelihood of oil and gas worker in the north east of scotland as expendable 
 i do not believe that at all this government be commit to a just and prosperous transition the reality be that job have be lose in the oil and gas industry in the past year if we do not recognise that there be a transition under way and put in place the measure to produce the job of the future we will have more loss the party that the hon member represent could have do something about that by support great british energy headquarters in aberdeen but he fail to show up and vote for it 
 i declare an interest as a chair of the all party parliamentary group for critical mineral domestic supply of copper and of course cornish tin be critical to the uk ’s energy security what consideration have the minister give to ensure that copper and tin be recognise as critical mineral 
 the process in term of what be on the list of critical mineral be independent but i have a strong interest as do my hon friend in ensure that we produce as many critical mineral here as we can and that the supply chain around the world be work for we i be look at a critical mineral strategy which will come forward in due course 
 pm 
 on a point of order mr speaker minister have repeatedly say today that the neso report show that their plan will lower energy bill but page of the report make it clear that no such thing will happen if minister read their own report and realise that they have mislead the house would it be appropriate for they to come back and apologise 
 i be not responsible for ministers answer but i be sure ministers will have hear that point of order and if they wish to correct the record they can do so 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions when she plan to respond to the social security advisory committee ’s letter publish on   october on the means testing of winter fuel payment 
 we welcome the letter from the chair of the social security advisory committee we be hop to respond to the letter on the day of the budget regrettably there have be an unexpected further delay and we be due to issue the response this week however my official meet the committee in august to discuss the regulation prior to the committee ’s formal scrutiny in early september 
 i want to explain briefly why it be important to invoke the urgency procedure in this case we need to make the necessary exchequer saving in the current financial year as the regulation need to come into force on   september the previous government leave we with a £ black hole with treasury reserve spend time over the day to day departmental spending set out by the previous government in their spring budget be not even close to reality it be now up to we to clear up the mess of the previous government so we have to take some difficult decision such as mean test the winter fuel payment but we remain determined to do everything possible to support the poor pensioner 
 we have take immediate action to increase the take up of pension credit work with charity and local authority and through a campaign in print and broadcast medium the government have write to more than pensioner about the change to mean test the winter fuel payment we have also write to pensioner on housing benefit who could be entitle to pension credit to encourage they to claim we have extend the household support fund until march thank to our steadfast commitment to the triple lock more than pensioner will see their state pension rise by up to £ next year and up to £ over the course of this parliament the warm home discount which we hear about a minute ago be worth £ off energy bill for low income household the warm home plan will in the long term insulate more home 
 by take these difficult decision we be able to provide a cash injection of £ to the nhs budget which be the large real term growth in day to day nhs spending outside of covid since that will bring down waiting time for people across the country include many pensioner we be take the responsible and difficult decision to clear up the mess of the previous government to fix the foundation of our economy and rebuild our public service 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question 
 this government make a choice to take away the winter fuel payment from pensioner this winter and to rely on the notoriously under claim pension credit as a system of means test it that choice will make life hard for pensioner across the country it will see of the poor pensioner miss out on much need help with the cost of heating and accord to the labour party ’s own research it could lead to additional death this winter the government know that that be why they have not do an impact assessment perhaps it be why after week they still have not respond to the concern of their own advisory committee 
 the committee write the secretary of state a letter contain its concern about how the policy will affect the poor people it say that of disabled pensioner will miss out on their payment this winter and it suggest expand the eligibility for winter fuel payment beyond pension credit because the committee know that the government ’s saving be base on a of the poor pensioner miss out in direct contrast to the government the committee say that 
 a more detailed assessment be urgently require 
 as colleague from all part of the house include labour members charity and pensioner group across the country have also say 
 here we be week later and the secretary of state be yet to even respond to the advisory committee in fact she be not even here to answer this urgent question i ask the minister will the government now after week respond to their own advisory committee will they now after week publish a full impact assessment for everyone to see do she accept that her government have get this wrong do she recognise that they have negligently underestimate how many people will fall through the crack i suspect that deep down she be worried as i be about pensioner who can not afford to heat their home i be sure her secretary of state have be lobby the chancellor behind the scene perhaps that be where she be right now instead of be here will the hon lady go back to her chancellor more time and try to make she think again 
 i do apologise for the delay in respond to the committee ’s letter it be regrettable the initial delay as i set out be because we be wait for the obr to come forward with its costing of the policy then there be another unexpected delay there have be a delay—[interruption i do not know why i be be heckle i be try calmly to explain why there have be a delay for which i do apologise we will issue a response very shortly and certainly by the end of the week it be important that we respond to that letter i respect that the hon lady be ask that question 
 regard the public sector equality duty we have do everything in line with the duty which be to provide an equality analysis of the decision that we have take as hon member will know that analysis be publish in september however i say this gently after the election we find ourselves in a situation of have a £ black hole with treasury reserve spend time over the obr have say that its assessment of the previous government ’s budget would have be   materially different have it know the pressure on spending and the real situation in the treasury i note that the hon lady do not come with an apology 
 we have have to take the decision to mean test winter fuel payment we do not want to do that but we have have to take some difficult decision to clear up the mess to tackle our fiscal inheritance and to start rebuild our public service which pensioner across the country and many other rely on 
 government members will obviously not take protestation about poverty from the conservative party with anything other than a mountain of salt but the government spend £ per year and the cut to winter fuel allowance will save the government about £ per year so that cut will save about of government spending on that basis as we look at all the welcome advance make in the labour budget all the great stuff that we can talk about and we consider that this measure save only of government spending i really urge the minister to think again i think the public would welcome that as a sign of real leadership not anyone or any government always get it right and i believe we get it wrong on this occasion could the government rethink on this issue 
 i be proud of the last labour government ’s record of lift over a pensioner out of poverty we do expect to make saving of about £ this year through means test the winter fuel payment that be not an insignificant proportion of the £ of saving that the chancellor set out on   july 
 we come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 many of we in the chamber accept that the new government inherit a financial mess from the old government it be a pity that that be be balance on the back of pensioner the minister quite rightly highlight how many of we have be champion our resident to claim pension credit as i be in torbay she talk of unexpected delay many of we include her own department face unexpected delay in the light of that will she extend the deadline for pensioner to claim the allowance beyond   december 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question i be afraid that i can not commit to extend the deadline it be important that we encourage as many pensioner as possible i know that he be work on that in his constituency and i do a pension credit surgery in my constituency last week to check whether they be eligible for pension credit we have local authority up and down the country help we to check the eligibility of those in need and those on the low income that be the right thing to do those claim can be backdate by month and anyone who be eligible for pension credit in the qualifying week will also be passporte to other benefit such as the winter fuel payment 
 the advisory committee make several recommendation relate to get assistance to people who should be in   receipt of pension credit could the minister indicate whether the government intend to accept those recommendation 
 we be deploy an additional staff to deal with the substantial increase over 150%—in claim that be the right thing to do it be an operational focus for the department to get through those claim as quickly as possible to make sure that we get the help to those most in need 
 the social security advisory committee estimate that more than of people with a disability will lose their winter fuel payment this year do the hon lady really think that cut benefit from this vulnerable group of pensioner be the right thing to do 
 if the hon lady look at the equality analysis she will see that those with a disability will be disproportionately likely to retain the winter fuel payment i urge she to have a look at that 
 i thank my hon friend for her response to the urgent question we have a budget that do so much good for our country in the face of the most dreadful inheritance and the labour government should be congratulate on that but pensioner in middlesbrough and thornaby east be still look to the government to far mitigate the impact of the cut to the winter fuel payment much have be do by the elect mayor chris cooke to embrace the issue around the household support fund and so on but the social security advisory committee note that the £ be base on an increase of only in pension credit take up from to could the minister say what the increase in take up have be to date and what further step she will take to provide yet further mitigation and reduce pensioner poverty 
 we will announce new statistic at the end of this month the committee ask about the increase that assumption be base on what happen when the previous government take away free tv licence and people have to apply for they the obr accept our assumption 
 what be the point of have a social security advisory committee if the government do not listen to and take its advice would it not be well to abolish the committee if the government be intent on ignore it 
 no 
 i be reassure by the minister ’s response that we will soon see a reply to that letter my constituent be not fool they can see that while opposition party oppose the cut they be not propose how they would fund the payment my constituent also see the desperate lack of people claim pension credit i put on the record my thank to age scotland for its guidance to my staff on how to ensure that more people in my constituency claim it the letter refer to winter fuel payment claimant in england wales the eu switzerland iceland lichtenstein   and norway but not scotland be that because in scotland the scottish government have the power both to maintain the winter fuel payment and to fully fund it 
 yes as i understand it that be in the scottish government ’s gift 
 have the minister have the chance to visit the dwp library and have she make a note of how many drive there have be over the year to take up pension credit and whether any of they ever reach as high even as quarter of those who be eligible 
 the previous government promise year ago to merge housing benefit with pension credit which would be a significant advance towards improvement we be introduce that in january we will have be in power for only month but we will have do more than the previous government do in year 
 many pensioner be terrify of go into debt and do not want to switch on their heating in case they end up with massive bill temperature will drop below freezing in scotland at the beginning of next week so will the minister apologise to those pensioner across scotland who will not be able to put the heating on because they fear go into debt 
 i urge the hon lady to look at the support available to low income household through the warm home discount scheme the extension of the household support fund and our commitment to the triple lock which will ensure that pensioner see a rise in their pension of up to £ next year and £ over the course of this parliament in the long term i urge she to look at the detail of the warm home plan which will transform home across the country by make they clean and cheap to heat 
 on   september the minister ’s department tell i in response to a write question that people in my constituency have be eligible for winter fuel payment while we be proud to offer forever home to so many pensioner that be a preposterous figure relate to a heartless and unnecessary decision that will cost more in the long term how do i or any of my resident have confidence in what the government be do since they believe that more than half my constituency be make up pensioner and can not even get the basic number right 
 i quote of the hon lady ’s fellow politician 
 i have people in my constituency tell i that they do not need the winter fuel payment that we give they because they can afford it 
 those be the word of the leader of the opposition   the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch 
 the social security advisory committee ’s letter call for an urgent amendment to allow those in receipt of pensioner housing benefit to    receive the winter fuel payment this year i believe the uk government should go far extend eligibility to people on council tax support attendance allowance disability living allowance personal independent payment and carer ’s allowance will the uk government rethink their position on eligibility and reduce pensioner hardship this winter 
 the hon lady ’s question allow i to focus on the communication around this change it be not just about pension credit but about people on work tax credit child tax credit and other benefit the committee be concern about pensioner in receipt of child tax credit pensioner should check whether they be eligible for other qualifying benefit for winter fuel payment because it be quite a complicated system it be not just about whether someone be already on pension credit 
 the government say that they want everyone who be eligible for pension credit to claim it and get it but as the social security advisory committee point out they expect only a increase in uptake be the reality not that the government need hundred of thousand of pensioner not to claim this entitlement that they deserve in order to make their figure add up and to cut £ from winter fuel payment 
 i would be very pleased if all pensioner who be eligible for pension credit apply and receive the help that they deserve 
 the minister will be aware that billion of pound in benefit and financial help include pension credit go unclaimed every year due to the stigma associate with claim benefit and the huge difficulty that claimant encounter when navigate the system what measure be the government take to encourage great take up and to simplify the benefit system 
 we have run several campaign the late of which be launch recently on radio and tv and in print medium to urge those who may be eligible to apply and to urge their love one to encourage they and help they to apply we have also ask official to see how we can improve the form to make it easy but more than of claim be now make online pensioner can get help either from a love or from charity and local authority which be help to ensure that they get the support that they deserve 
 some pensioner in broxbourne will lose their winter fuel payment how be the minister help those who can not do online application for pension credit to make an application will she commit to continue to write to all those who will lose their winter fuel payment until they sign up for pension credit 
 we have write to all pensioner to tell they about the change in government policy to ensure that those who be not in receipt of pension credit or other benefit know that they will not be get the winter fuel payment this winter 
 minister it be always good to have the necessary answer the report note saving of £ the increase in pension credit take up from to represent an additional household any take up negate saving make by the government the fact be that pensioner who would qualify have lose out this year and be struggle now what can be do to expedite their application and to deal with the long waiting list for decision which mean that for many the potential for additional income to ease their situation and help in the winter month will be too little too late the reason i make the point be that the system be take too long to make a decision and those people need the money right now 
 as i say we have redeploy an additional member of staff to process application for pension credit and we be mostly hit the target for processing time 
 with permission mr speaker i will now make a statement on our new national youth strategy 
 the challenge face young people today be profound they live through a pandemic during which they be deny the chance to test boundary and gain confidence they be at the sharp end of a revolution in social medium the pressure on young girl be significant the effect of antisocial behaviour and violence be stark and while talent be everywhere opportunity be not despite that this generation be as ambitious for themselves their family and their community as any other before they and they deserve a government with a plan to match 
 when i become secretary of state i be shocked to find that there be no single strategy in place for young people i be absolutely determined to put that right this be personal for i of my job be at the youth homelessness charity centrepoint i learn everything i know about politic from those brilliant young people who understand the challenge they face well than any government could that be why today we be kick off of the big national conversation the government have ever hold with young people lead by and for young people 
 as we embark on an ambitious plan to devolve power to local leader and community we be determined to champion that change not just at national level but in every part of government we will take this conversation to our town village and city in every region on their term not ours to allow young people to challenge we every step of the way they will be in the driving seat we will make sure young people be empower at local regional and national level so that funding flow to the thing that matter to they in the come month these conversation will feed into a report today ’s youth tomorrow ’s nation detail young people ’s priority to inform our new approach next year we will present to this house a co produce national youth strategy that be fit for the decade ahead and ensure every young person can live the rich large life they deserve 
 we disagree on many thing in this house but i believe every single of we share a common desire to see this generation thrive they deserve politician who respect what they have to contribute that be what this government be go to do and that begin today 
 in line with this new approach i have to tell the house that we be go to wind down the national citizen service programme from the end of the financial year and the national citizen service trust when parliamentary time allow since its launch in the ncs have provide over young people with opportunity the ncs meet the need of the moment and rightly put active citizenship at the heart of the government ’s programme for young people it have play a hugely important role in support young people to build their confidence and bridge social divide i would like to thank each and every staff member past and present the ncs board and the previous and current ceo and chair i also thank every young person who have contribute to the success of the ncs 
 in when the national citizen service be establish facebook and x have only user now they have over tiktok have not even be dream of in an estimate in to year old have a probable mental health problem now it be in the world have change and we need a youth strategy that reflect that this be not a decision we take lightly i have speak to the chair and chief executive i be so grateful to they for their commitment to work closely together to protect young people and staff to share learning and expertise and to ensure there be an orderly transition from the end of the ncs programme to what come next i be delighted to announce that the current ncs chair harris bokhari will be an adviser on the national youth strategy his experience will be invaluable as we step into a new way of work together with the country ’s young people as part of this i would also like to thank the ncs youth advisory board i hope it will play a major role in our strategy it be commit as we be to build a country of connected confident and care young citizen 
 we will work closely with the whole youth sector to transform our work so that it well support youth worker local authority youth funding fall by under the previous government and we know that this present a significant challenge despite the disastrous economic situation we inherit i be determined that we will rise to this moment for so many young people it be council and combined authority who hold the key to unlock their potential to facilitate they i will be launch a local youth transformation pilot in the next financial year to support local authority to build back lose capability and provide tool guidance and funding to improve their youth offer and empower young people in every community i have also decide to increase the total funding for other department for culture media and sport youth programme to ensure that young people can continue to access opportunity no matter where they be from 
 we recognise the urgent need for young people to have welcome place that they have a stake in that be why in the next financial year my department will allocate over £ of capital funding to place where it be most need that include launch the new well youth space fund with at least £ for youth club to buy new equipment and do renovation we will also complete the youth investment fund project that be under way true to our commitment to put young people back in charge of their own destiny we will ensure that they guide our decision when we choose the space to support 
 we know that building be worth nothing without the army of trust adult dedicate to help young people to thrive as we develop the youth strategy i will continue to ensure we be recruit and train the youth worker who be a lifeline for young people from the initial youth guarantee area which will help young people into employment or training to the young future hub and local prevention partnership this government be commit to break down barrier to opportunity we be also expand the creative career programme to widen access to creative employer across the country and we have commit to continue investment in multi sport facility 
 in addition to that funding i be announce that youth financial inclusion social investment and community wealth fund will each receive a significant portion of the next £ of dormant asset funding i be pleased to tell the house that of that £ will be dedicate to youth outcome between and there will be more detail to come when we publish our dormant asset strategy 
 throughout history the programme that have make the great difference have be the one that meet the challenge of the moment and be build to last the children act deliver by a conservative government enshrine it in law that the good interest of the child take priority above all else and the last labour government ’s every child matters programme put child ’s view and need at the heart of a government that change life everywhere i look forward to work constructively with member across the political divide to get this right together we will grip these challenge to give young people chance and choice put they at the heart of government and unlock the potential of a generation i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement 
 let i begin by say that the opposition really do welcome any focus that the government be put on young people i recall from my time in the department that spend time in the youth sector provide some of the most inspiring moment of my time as a minister in government we have a proud record of listen to young people and put their view at the heart of our agenda and our record show that indeed i always ensure that young people be around the table when we be make decision that would affect they and would often say that i wonder how a middle aged grey haired man could know exactly what young people want 
 it be because we listen to young people that we allocate £ over the next year to fund the national youth guarantee ensure that every young person age to in england have access to regular club and activity something to do after school experience away from home and opportunity to volunteer that be what young people tell we they want as part of the national youth guarantee we allocate £ to youth facility improve and develop of they 
 we welcome the government ’s commitment to the youth investment fund project that be under way but will the secretary of state confirm the fate of those that be not in government we deliver £ worth of sport programme develop and improve sport pitch across the country can she confirm that they will still be invest in give their importance as a resource for young people 
 of course the importance that we place on young people go much far whether the issue be housing the national living wage education or apprenticeship we listen to their view at the very top of government that be why we welcome some of the measure in the statement such as the focus that the government will   place on youth worker through the local youth transformation pilot the relationship between youth worker and young people be of the most important especially for young people with challenging background 
 element that we can not support however be the scrapping of the national citizen service the ncs have grow since when it support participant over the last year more than young people have take part in its programme i have the pleasure of visit many of they and what strike i most be the sight of people from a mix of different background come together it be a great scheme which have cross party support 
 if the government intend to listen to young people can the secretary of state explain why it be scrap a scheme with which of participant be satisfy she say that we do not need citizenship because of social medium but i would argue that we probably do the cancellation of the ncs also mean that a hole will develop in youth service be deliver in so can the secretary of state tell i what immediate action will be take to prevent it from develop and how she intend to spend the £ of saving that she have announce or be that a loss to the sector 
 the ncs be not the only scheme that be be scrap i do not need to remind the house of the importance of cadet both to their community and to young people especially follow the remembrance service that take place yesterday and over the weekend it be a great shame that the government have cut grant funding for cadet and i hope the secretary of state will reconsider that as for the issue of dormant asset this be money that we announce in government but may i ask how quickly that funding will be in the hand of those who need it
