it be a pleasure to follow such powerful contribution from member on both side of the house from my hon friend the members for suffolk coastal jenny riddell carpenter for southampton itchen darren paffey for worthe west dr beccy cooper and for mid cheshire andrew cooper and the hon member for north dorset simon hoare for harrow east bob blackman and for bath wera hobhouse)—as well as the entire ulster unionist party delegation in the form of   the hon member for south antrim robin swann 
 i support this landmark legislation which be an important step towards deliver on this government ’s manifesto commitment to ensure that the next generation can never legally buy cigarette and to create the smokefree generation this be an overdue natural step towards tackle the scourge of smoking which claim about life a year in the united kingdom smoking be the no preventable cause of death disability and ill health in our united kingdom and it be responsible for in cancer death kill up to third of smoker in wales tobacco cause cancer case every year and smoking be still the lead cause of cancer there however cancer do not respect border so the bill will serve the health interest of our entire united kingdom i welcome that and i also welcome the welsh government ’s commitment to support this legislation and bring it into force in wales from 
 in fact the welsh government have be well ahead of the curve on this issue as far back as my constituency colleague mark drakeford present legislation that would have ban cigarette use in public space but it fall owe to shameless politicking on the part of plaid cymru whose member i note have not be present at all for this important debate rather than agree with the welsh government and introduce what would have be landmark public health legislation plaid cymru ’s member be join   by the welsh conservatives and the members of the united kingdom independence party remember them?—all of whom describe it as unnecessary government regulation plaid cymru side with the populist right in wales to make a political point and the people of wales be bad off because of it 
 undeterred in the welsh government launch their tobacco control action plan which include action to protect child and young people from the danger of vaping such as tight regulation on advertising and on the sale of e cigarette that be a clear sign that the welsh government take this issue seriously and it be our responsibility here in westminster to support and complement those effort this bill illustrate that this government take seriously their commitment to create the smokefree generation and to protect child from become hook on vape 
 let we be clear vaping be not harmless in action on smoking and health estimate that of child age to have try vaping although vaping can be an effective way for adult to quit smoking vaping can not be recommend for child as it carry a serious risk of addiction and future harm accordingly rather than be a deterrent to smoking vaping will see more child not few be expose to nicotine if leave unregulated that be why the measure set out in the bill to implement a total ban on vape advertising and sponsorship and subject to consultation on the sale of vape flavour that overtly appeal to child be so important i fully support they 
 this bill be legislation that our teacher headteacher medical professional and health service be all call for the vaping industry have be allow to attract kid with different flavour and bright packaging we would not allow that with any other addictive drug and we should not allow it with vaping in addition the bill do not deal with an aspect of vape that i would be grateful for the government to consider as the bill continue its passage through parliament currently police officer do not have specific power to confiscate vape from child a power that they do have with traditional cigarette pursuant to section 7(3 of the children and young persons act 
 have speak to south wales police officer and police community support officer i know that the power of confiscation be an important tool that they use to deal with antisocial behaviour in designate area of cardiff but their work be neuter if they can not confiscate vape although i recognise that if this bill be pass such power will not be necessary in time indeed it will omit section 7(3 of the children and young persons act from onwards i ask the government to consider whether it would be useful to retain the power of confiscation and expand it to include vape for the period between now and so that our police officer have the same legal power across cigarette and vape as a tool in their armoury to combat antisocial behaviour 
 aside from that specific point i reiterate my support for this important piece of legislation not only will it align this parliament with the progressive action of the welsh government on such important health matter it will bolster our commitment in this place to safeguard public health in so do it will save many thousand of life from the scourge of cancer and protect child from become hook on vape 
 i think the hon gentleman have just talk himself into a job he be absolutely right that the good people to advocate for stop smoking be former smoker 
 we will still encourage adult smoker to switch to vape through swap to stop in england and i be delighted that locality have ask for over half a starter kit so far on advertising regulation of course the consultation will take place after royal assent but i hope that i can assure the hon member for harrow east that we will take away his point about ensure that the nhs can still advertise swap to stop under those regulation on a tobacco industry levy fiscal matter be for the treasury but i be sure that his view and those of other have be communicate to treasury ministers 
 the hon member for lewes mention the rise of the black market this be a line that have be parrot by the tobacco industry for year so we need to spell out the fact whenever government of any guise have introduce target tobacco control measure the black market actually have not prosper consumption of illegal tobacco have go from cigarette nearly year ago to just of that amount last year and when the last labour government raise the age of sale from to the number of illicit cigarette fall by a quarter however this require well enforcement and we will use every of the generously long buffer period to support business in prepare for and implement the change include through information campaign we be provide £ to trading standard to increase their capacity and capability next year and there be £ for border force and his majesty ’s revenue and customs over the next year to tackle illicit and under age sale the bill also allow trading standard to issue on the spot fine of £ and to reinvest the proceed of those fine and indeed the licensing regime back into further enforcement 
 at cop29 under a labour government the uk reclaim its position as a global leader on climate action we recognise now that our security and prosperity hinge on address the crisis will my right hon friend join i in welcome the progress make on climate finance while acknowledge that there be much more to do to keep we on track on that road map and to keep ° alive 
 it be important that our prime minister be the only g7 prime minister to attend cop my hon friend will recall that last year the prime minister at the time do not attend it be hugely important that we reach the £ for climate finance which will help the global south get to clean energy we hope that our global clean power alliance will be able to work with they as they now have the money to do it 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to help increase the uk ’s soft power 
 as these be the departmental question since the appointment of the shadow foreign secretary   the right hon member for witham priti patel i welcome the shadow front bench team to their place 
 alongside the secretary of state for culture media and sport my right hon friend   the member for wigan lisa nandy the foreign secretary be establish a new soft power council to advise government and shape a new strategy to increase uk soft power and enhance it to deliver our foreign policy objective promote all our soft power asset include the british council the bbc world service scholarship and value be crucial if we be to generate growth security and global impact for the uk 
 the government ’s commitment to uk soft power be highlight by the chancellor ’s additional funding for the bbc world service in the recent budget last week i meet moldovan mps who be on the frontline of russian aggression they really value the british council ’s presence but it have to close owe to funding cut do the minister agree that it would be detrimental to britain ’s place on the world stage if the british council be force to close more office particularly where british value of freedom and democracy be need most 
 the foreign secretary have make it clear that the uk be commit to support moldova ’s democratic choice to pursue a path of freedom independence and european integration the fcdo provide £ in grant in aid funding for the to spending review period in an increasingly digital age the british council ’s impact should be judge by operational rather than physical presence the council retain a physical presence in over country those in other country still access cultural engagement and teaching activity online 
 let ’s take a new member of the back benches andrew mitchell on his return 
 may i wish the new shadow foreign secretary my right hon friend   the member for witham priti patel every success in her role may i also wish the minister and the entire government foreign affair team courage and wisdom as they deal with a world more dangerous than at any time in our life when it come to soft power and development i remind they of the importance of the word well articulate by former us defence secretary mattis if you cut development spend you have to order more ammunition 
 i pay tribute to the right hon member ’s long commitment to these issue i return last week from pakistan where i be deploy when he be the secretary of state for international development so i know well his commitment to the issue over a long period 
 i agree with the sentiment of the right hon member ’s question the aid budget be incredibly important and make a significant contribution to our national security right across the world we continue to work hard to ensure that our aid budget be fit for purpose and do the job it need to do on behalf of the uk right across the world 
 i call a new member of the front bench the shadow minister 
 thank you mr speaker whether it be the finding of the election monitor in georgia interference in the recent election in moldova the illegal invasion of ukraine or the chill feel from the baltics to bucharest europe today be a much more contested space this be the moment to pin our colour to the mast and be much more active in support those with euro atlantic aspiration how will the minister build on the effort of the last government and use our considerable soft power to be much more proactive 
 we continue to engage heavily on those issue the foreign secretary be in moldova last week we be committed to enhance the uk ’s soft power after a period of decline and that be why the foreign secretary will be launch the soft power council with my right hon friend the secretary of state for culture media and sport in the come week 
 what assessment he have make of the potential merit of sanction violent illegal israeli settler 
 whether he plan to extend exist sanction in response to settler violence in the west bank to israeli ministers 
 palestinian community have suffer horrific violence at the hand of israeli settler in october the government sanction outpost and entity link to violence in the west bank i will not speculate about future sanction   designation do so would only reduce their impact but we continue to explore all option to take tough action 
 settlement expansion in the occupied palestinian territories remain of the big barrier to peace in the middle east in october the foreign secretary say 
 as long as violent extremist remain unaccountable the uk and the international community will continue to act 
 will he commit today to consider sanction against the extremist ministers ben gvir and smotrich of the israeli government 
 i have be very clear in office in october i target the amana settler group which operate as a commercial construction company and i be pleased that the us follow we in those sanction just last week i be also concerned about a religious school promote violence against jews and i sanction it a non governmental organisation provide volunteer for illegal outpost and i sanction it of course we continue to keep sanction policy under consideration we be very concerned by the violence by the expansion and by the rhetoric that we be hear from member of the israeli government 
 i listen carefully to my right hon friend ’s answer he say that he will not speculate on future sanction but the israeli ministers name be encourage settler violence and have call for the annexation of the west bank by israel do my right hon friend accept that even if he will not talk about further sanction today he can recognise that the threat of annexation be real and that until we come out clearly in support of an independent palestinian state the settler will continue their violence in the belief that they will eventually achieve the annexation that they want 
 i commend my hon friend for stand up on those issue let i be absolutely clear annexation would be illegal and we would stand oppose to it i make that fundamentally clear he should be assure that we will continue to speak out both against illegal violence against settler and against settler expansion 
 international law be vital for we to build a platform for a more secure and peaceful world do the government recognise and support the international criminal court ’s jurisdiction and will they co operate fully with the court to ensure that it can carry out its work without obstruction 
 yes 
 we come to the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 i will also ask my right hon friend about ben gvir and smotrich and perhaps if i ask in a different way we might get an answer lord cameron of chipping norton tell we that before the last general election the foreign office be work up potential sanction against those most controversial and infamous settler and minister i appreciate that sanction be keep under   review but be my right hon friend in a position to tell we when a decision might be make or if have already be make about those ministers 
 i think the previous foreign secretary be wrong to talk about sanction under consideration particularly to talk about sanction that he say be under consideration but then do not implement i will not get draw on sanction policy at the dispatch box but i be pleased that my right hon friend be raise issue of such importance anyone look can see the strength of feeling in the house 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the comment last week by finance minister smotrich advocate the annexation of the west bank together with the continue devastation in northern gaza have reinforce the idea that element of the israeli cabinet have no interest in a state solution there be now a real and imminent risk that the extremist in the israeli cabinet will succeed in annex palestinian territory before any negotiation can take place in the light of that do the foreign secretary agree that now be the time to recognise palestine 
 yesterday at the g7 meeting in rome foreign ministers discuss that very issue we be unite all of we in condemn any suggestion of annexation we would stand against it 
 if he will increase the amount and proportion of official development assistance allocate to humanitarian project 
 the government be determined to rebuild the uk ’s reputation on international development we have announce a doubling of support for people hit by the humanitarian emergency in sudan as well as provide support for people in gaza in lebanon and in other crisis situation 
 the government ’s insistence on continue to implement the tories deep and damaging cut to the aid budget and unprecedented level of oda spend on in donor refugee cost be result in reduction pause and cancellation of overseas oda project 
 indicate dissent 
 i see that the minister be shake her head i look forward to her response do she recognise that the uk government can not say they be back on the global stage while these boris johnson inspire policy continue to cut deep into our development policy 
 i can tell the hon gentleman that our programme budget for the fcdo in will actually be at its high level in recent year we be able to deliver that because this government be take action on the issue that the previous government do not tackle in particular the in donor refugee cost that have eat into that budget we just see gimmick we do not see action instead the new government be take action 
 the humanitarian crisis in sudan be horrific and it be clear that rape be be use as a weapon of war recent datum from médecins sans frontières highlight that of sexual violence survivor in a hospital in chad be abuse by armed perpetrator and be attack in their home this be happen in can the foreign secretary provide detail on how the uk ’s recent pledge on humanitarian aid for sudan and the region be be use to support survivor of sexual and gender base violence 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that incredibly concern situation the uk have be determine to do all that it can particularly in relation to conflict relate sexual violence in october it be the uk that lead move to secure the renewal of the mandate of the fact find mission at the united nations human rights council as be just mention we recently double humanitarian aid and the foreign secretary also lead effort at the un security council to take action on the humanitarian emergency in sudan 
 i welcome the shadow minister 
 the government appear to be in a complete tailspin over whether they will release the cost that will fall to the british taxpayer as a result of the rush deal to give away the british chagos island give the report trip to mauritius by the special envoy jonathan powell can the minister at least confirm today which budget the cost will come from include whether they intend to use the aid budget will she tell the house how much it will cost each year and in total and if the british chagossians will actually have a genuine say would it not make more sense to keep these strategically important island under the crown rather than the secretive deal negotiate no deal be well than a bad deal 
 my understanding be that there be actually round of negotiation under the conservatives but we do not see the uk reach the necessary agreement this be a frankly bizarre argument come from the opposition all the detail of the situation be in the public domain and quite rightly so this be part of the uk ensure that we follow international law 
 what recent progress he have make on help to secure the release of alaa abd el fattah 
 we be commit to secure consular access and the release of mr el fattah we continue to raise mr el fattah ’s case at the high level with the egyptian government the prime minister raise this with president sisi on   august and i last raise it with the egyptian foreign minister yesterday 
 i thank the foreign secretary for his answer alaa abd el fattah ’s mother laila soueif be in the gallery today on the day of her hunger strike in protest at the continued imprisonment of her son a   british citizen whose prison sentence in egypt end in september i be sure that the foreign secretary feel the same as i and understand that laila want to know that her government be do everything they can to bring her son home will the foreign secretary guarantee that the uk government will put a hold on any new economic or financial partnership with egypt unless and until british national alaa abd el fattah be free 
 i look forward to meet mr el fattah ’s mother later on today i reassure my hon friend personally that i share his determination and resolve to see alaa reunite with his family and i think their love and dedication to he be obvious to many parliamentarian whom they have meet and campaign with my hon friend will understand that with the terrible situation in gaza it be important that this government continue to speak to our egyptian friend who obviously have real proximity to gaza i understand the strength of feeling and that be why the prime minister have raise this and i have raise this on successive occasion alaa be a dual national and we will continue to lobby on his behalf 
 i fully support the call for mr el fattah ’s release but in the same area ryan cornelius have spend year illegally hold by the united arab emirates much of it in solitary confinement the secretary of state say that he will pursue these case rigorously but when he go to the uae recently he do not raise the case of ryan cornelius 
 i reassure the right hon gentleman that the situation of ryan cornelius have be raise with the uae and official continue to provide consular access to mr cornelius and mr ridley and be in contact with their family at this time it be a serious case we be absolutely aware of it and the uae know that we be very concerned 
 i completely understand and appreciate what the foreign secretary have say about maintain a relationship with egypt because of the issue in gaza but the reality be that mr el fattah ’s family have suffer enough and president sisi will move only if there be an economic threat therefore after the foreign secretary meet the family tomorrow can i ask he to contact the president ’s office to make absolutely clear that our economic relationship will suffer unless this british citizen be release 
 the right hon gentleman should be reassure that i speak to the egyptian foreign minister yesterday and say to he that i be meet mrs el fattah today i urge he to look at what parliamentarian be say about this case which be of huge concern and press he to do more we have continue to do that with the egyptians it be obviously sensitive because of the situation in gaza but i do not think the egyptians be in any doubt about how seriously this case be take by the british system the government and this parliament 
 the all party parliamentary group on arbitrary detention and hostage affair have be hear evidence from uk national who be be or have be detain we be privileged to hear from alaa ’s mother just this   morning an oft repeat concern be that if a uk national find themselves in that awful situation they be essentially on their own compare with other national do the minister recognise that depiction and if he do not what can he point to as a unique advantage of have a british passport for someone who find themselves arbitrarily detain 
 i recognise that the hon gentleman have get some problem with have a british passport but i have no such problem i be proud to be a citizen of this great country and we have some outstanding diplomat and official in the fcdo of course we recognise in opposition that there be issue in this area which be why we have say that we will introduce a special representative to work with hostage family 
 alaa ’s friend and family whom i have the privilege of represent as my constituent just want their brother uncle and son home safe previously the foreign secretary who have work hard on this issue and as he say have raise it with the egyptians have talk about what we could do if the egyptians will not restore consular access they still have not do that so could the foreign secretary update we i know this house speak as in stand and demand that alaa be free and able to come home to his family for this christmas but what more can and will the foreign secretary do if the egyptians will not restore consular access for the family 
 my hon friend have campaign diligently on the family ’s behalf she will know that the egyptians do not accept mr el fattah ’s dual nationality that be an issue between we and it be for that reason that they deny consular access currently access be through   mr el fattah ’s lawyer i be urge the egyptians to understand that he get his citizenship in the usual way just like other member of his family there be no conspiracy on the part of the state in the way that mr el fattah get that citizenship and i continue to press they on that very issue which would allow he to have the consular access that he deserve 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer and commend   the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman   for raise the matter but it be not the only case   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith   refer to another case and i would add jimmy lai as a the uk and british passport must mean something with that in mind be it not time to set aside a specific section in the fcdo that look at these case and be task with get our british citizen back home to this united kingdom 
 as the hon gentleman mention jimmy lai let i say once again that we call on the hong kong authority to release immediately british national jimmy lai who be a significant priority for this government that be why the prime minister raise the matter with the president of china last week and i raise it with the foreign minister of china the hon gentleman be right this do need a close look by the new government we be just over month old we be look at it and we will come forward with proposal shortly 
 what diplomatic step he be take with his international counterpart to help secure the release of hostage hold by hamas in gaza 
 ensure the safe release of all hostage include british national emily damari and other hostage with strong uk link remain a top priority for this government we support the effort of negotiator and call on the party to return to negotiation we continue to work alongside ally and partner in the region towards secure hostage release negotiation remain the good chance to get hostage cruelly detain by hamas home to their love one i relay these point to the israeli deputy foreign minister yesterday 
 the horror endure by the israelis and foreign national hold hostage by hamas terrorist in gaza for over month be unthinkable give that the effort to secure their release have not yet be successful what further step be the united kingdom take to bring home emily damari a year old british citizen and the rest of the captive 
 i be sure that the whole house will join i in say to those family that we as a house and a government will do absolutely everything we can the horror of be a hostage family be unbearable and we have they in our mind each and every day we be disappointed that talk to secure hostage release appear to have stall for the moment we be urge all party to return to the table a deal remain the good prospect and we hope to work with our ally to see that come through 
 on friday on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member the security council fail to adopt a text put forward by its elect member call for an immediate unconditional and permanent ceasefire in gaza and demand the release of all hostage that be extremely disappointing as it condemn thousand of people in the middle east to ongoing conflict and move no far forward to secure the release of the hostage hold by hamas in gaza although i and many of my constituent welcome the fact that the uk vote for that resolution what will the minister ’s next step be in achieve great global agreement on secure peace a ceasefire and the release of the hostage 
 this government will continue to do everything we can to press for a ceasefire the release of all hostage and a reduction in violence in the middle east the foreign secretary discuss these matter in the g7 and i discuss they with my israeli counterpart yesterday and we will continue to take all step across a wide range of different conversation to try to advance the ceasefire that we so desperately need 
 i call the shadow foreign secretary 
 last week i speak with mandy damari the minister have mention emily and i know the foreign secretary and his team have be in touch with the family as well she and many   other hostage family be go through the most unimaginable suffering so can the minister on behalf of the foreign secretary confirm whether any aid organisation have have humanitarian access to the hostage and if not what pressure be be exert on those agency clearly welfare concern be paramount but these poor family be also suffer unimaginable horror and our aid budget need to be spend in the right way so can the minister tell we what work be be undertake 
 regrettably no organisation have have access to the hostage we continue to call for access for the international committee of the red cross and any other appropriate non governmental organisation in the usual way let we be clear hamas hold these hostage and they be behave abominably and outwith any international norm they be not abide by any convention that we could think of we will continue to press they to ensure that there be the require access to british national but it be regrettable for the whole house that we be in this position 
 what recent discussion he have have with his eu counterpart on security and defence co operation 
 the foreign secretary attend the eu foreign affairs council on   october in the margin he agree with josep borrell the eu high representative for foreign affair to work towards a security partnership and commit to monthly foreign policy dialogue start in early yesterday i meet secretary general sannino of the european external action service to discuss alongside ministerial colleague some of our vital share interest include ukraine hybrid threat and the western balkans 
 president elect trump ’s confirmation of tariff on canada of the us ’s close ally raise serious concern about his willingness to honour the us uk special relationship if that be the future of us relation with its close partner do the minister agree that close co operation with the eu on defence and trade be now urgently need include access to the european custom union and the defence pact with the eu go beyond the recent agreement with germany 
 we have a thriving trading and investment relationship with the united states with more than british citizen work for us firm and vice versa we look forward to work with president elect trump in office include on his policy priority and to improve our trading relation our need to work together in europe on security issue be clear to all member whether that be the threat from russia the war in ukraine hybrid threat the situation in moldova or the situation in the western balkans and that be exactly what we be get on with and do 
 i very much welcome the recent announcement of the uk germany bilateral defence agreement which be sign at record break pace by the new government at trinity house last   month it will bolster close work with europe ’s large economy on wide defence and security matter at a time of increase russian aggression across europe with that in mind can the minister therefore explain to the house how the trinity house agreement fit into wide discussion with eu and nato counterpart around defence and security 
 i thank my hon friend for his remark on that important treaty work i know he take a keen interest in matter relate to uk german relation we continue to engage with german colleague from across the spectrum we be keen to get this treaty agree as soon as possible for i it naturally fit with our nato membership and the new enhance dialogue we have with the eu on security and defence matter 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in the middle east 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in the middle east 
 the humanitarian situation in gaza be catastrophic the uk ’s recent vote for the un security council resolution on gaza have already be mention it call for a huge scale up in aid across gaza we need that aid access and restriction on aid be unacceptable 
 the international development committee hear testimony from nizam mamode a surgeon who have recently return from the nasser hospital in gaza he describe israeli drone pick off injure child after bombing his account echo an october new york times report which cite doctor nurse and paramedic who witness numerous case of pre pubescent child be shoot in the head or chest during the ongoing conflict in gaza what step be the government take to prevent a genocide in gaza 
 we have hear a number of deeply concern report about development in gaza i know that have also be the case for the select committee as my hon friend mention the uk government ’s position could not be clear international law include international humanitarian law must be hold to and that cover in particular the operation of healthcare worker we pay tribute to they operate in such difficult circumstance 
 as we have be hear the situation in gaza especially northern gaza be dire with the un anticipate that this year up to child under the age of could be face acute malnutrition at the same time the truck enter gaza have reduce by since october i welcome the lead role that the government be take in provide vital humanitarian aid for gaza but do the minister agree that the ongoing israeli restriction on the flow of essential aid be completely unacceptable and should be lift immediately 
 yes we be see a disturbing impact from those restriction we have see it in the famine assessment and in the level of malnutrition and ill health now prevalent in gaza winter be now upon we make the situation even bad the restriction on aid be unacceptable they must be lift immediately 
 when the foreign secretary be in baku recently for cop29 do he discuss with his interlocutor across the region the extent to which the global finance goal would impact on humanitarian assistance in the middle east 
 yes the foreign secretary do discuss those matter include directly with mia mottley the premier of barbados who have be lead many of the small island develop state on these issue certainly the uk be determined to play its part on humanitarian issue as well as globally on climate issue that be so important for our own country as well as for the rest of the world 
 some week ago i ask the foreign secretary about get assurance that child receive polio vaccination would not be kill after receive they since then thousand of child have be kill in northern gaza give the icc ’s recent ruling about war crime the british public no doubt want to know why the government be shy away from their legal and moral obligation to ban all arm and all trade 
 the uk government have be determine to use every mechanism to advance international humanitarian law that include within the un security council as we just discuss but we have also be take action at every bilateral and multilateral opportunity include on polio where the uk lead effort to get vaccination go in the place 
 i call the chair of the international development committee 
 in october the israeli knesset pass law relate to the united nations relief and works agency the law for cessation of unrwa activity in the state of israel and the law for cessation of unrwa activity they will take effect on   january and the consequence will be prevent aid distribution in gaza and the prevention of primary care education and refuse collection in the west bank 
 last week my committee be in palestine and jordan there be huge concern that if that legislation take effect it will breach numerous international law and have a catastrophic effect on the humanitarian and security situation in the region what conversation have ministers have with their israeli counterpart to prevent that implementation and what be they do with the international community to protect a un organisation 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that and to her committee for its work on this important issue the uk government have be absolutely   clear that unrwa be the only agency that can deliver aid at the scale and depth require in the middle of this humanitarian emergency 
 my hon friend ask about representation be make by the uk government i have make those representation myself include at the un general assembly the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for lincoln hamish falconer make those representation yesterday the foreign secretary have make they a number of time include to his israeli counterpart it be clear that the restriction on the operation of unrwa must not be implement by the israeli government 
 the humanitarian situation in the middle east be make bad by arm supply from within and beyond the region the liberal democrats have a long stand policy that the uk government should not be export arm to israel or to the occupied palestinian territories give that they be refer to in the fcdo ’s last human right report will the fcdo extend the number of arm export licence deny to israel by the uk 
 i gently encourage the hon member to look at the action take by the uk government some week ago to suspend a number of arm licence we believe that be important because of the risk towards break international humanitarian law the uk government take their responsibility in that regard very seriously indeed 
 the root cause of so much of the terrible humanitarian suffering in the middle east today be the regime in tehran fuel the houthis hamas and hezbollah and brutally repress its own people while bail out putin ’s war machine and even plot to assassinate individual base in the uk beyond sanction with iran which we all support and successive government have put in place over the year can the minister tell we on behalf of the foreign secretary what exactly be the comprehensive plan to start deal with this repressive regime that be cause so much brutality across the middle east 
 we be deeply concerned about the destabilising impact of the iranian regime within the region and beyond the right hon lady mention a number of case where we can see that impact clearly i would also underline that the truly devastating humanitarian crisis in yemen be very much connect to iranian backing of the houthis we have repeatedly raise our concern about this bilaterally and multilaterally we be clear that we need a strong voice as a uk government on these matter and that be exactly what we be deliver 
 what recent step his department have take to deliver the echo programme

 too long

 do the foreign secretary wish to respond 
 i confirm that of course everybody with a british passport have the right to representation i would hope that we be the kind of country that support all sort of people in trouble who be in our country whatever their background 
 with permission mr speaker i shall make a statement about cop29 
 may i start by extend my sympathy to all those affect by storm bert it have be a devastating event for people in different part of our country particularly in wales and my heart go out to the family of those who have lose their life and to all those whose life have be disrupt 
 with permission mr speaker i also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to lord prescott he be a fighter for social justice and a champion of the environment he rightfully have global recognition for his role in negotiate the kyoto protocol and he show how politic can change life for the well i send my deep condolence to pauline and his family 
 the uk attend cop29 to fight for our national interest speed up the clean energy transition in the interest of job energy security and economic growth and tackle the climate crisis for today ’s and future generation in baku our message be clear britain be back in the business of global climate leadership 
 we know that the impact of the climate crisis know no border we have already see the extreme impact we can face here in britain and we know that if we do not act those impact will get much bad that be why as the prime minister say at cop29 there be no national security without climate security it be precisely because britain represent only around of annual global emission that we have to work with other to ensure the remain of emission be address to protect the british people 
 the focus of this cop be on finance for develop country because the reality be that unless we persuade develop country to go down the path of clean energy development we can not hope to reduce emission and prevent climate disaster those country face the triple challenge of need to invest in the clean energy transition cop with the cost of climate vulnerability and need to develop to take their population out of poverty at the same time developed country include britain face extreme pressure on our public finance 
 the cop talk be always complex but those circumstance make this set of talk particularly so i put on record my thank to our outstanding team of civil servant who support i at cop i be repeatedly strike by the enormous respect they have from so many country around the world the uk ’s negotiating team be lead by alison campbell who be leave to work with the un secretary general i want to put on record my special thank to she in help we to reach an agreement 
 the agreement reach be to provide and mobilise at least $ of climate finance by for develop country much of that will come from the multilateral development bank such as the world bank which have step up to set a target to substantially increase the climate finance they provide importantly for the time the agreement reflect a new global landscape where traditional donor will be join by big emitter such as china to help finance the transition that be fair and right 
 the uk will decide what our own contribution will be in the context of our spending review and fiscal situation and that will come from within the uk aid budget i can inform the house that if deliver with the same impact as uk climate finance the $ deal could lead to emission reduction equivalent to more than time the uk ’s annual emission as well as help to protect up to people in develop country from the effect of flood heatwave and drought crucially the agreement will accelerate the global clean energy transition which offer the prospect of export and economic opportunity here in britain let nobody be in any doubt this agreement be absolutely in our national interest 
 in other respect the talk be more disappointing at cop28 the world make a historic agreement to transition away from fossil fuel that agreement stand but we do not reach agreement this year on how to take the commitment forward not because the text put forward be too ambitious but because it be not ambitious enough in particular many develop country include the small island state feel that the text be inadequate give the scale of the climate emergency develop country include britain agree with that view that offer an important lesson under this government britain be part of a global coalition for ambitious climate action that span global north and global south it be at the global centre ground of climate politic we will seek to build on the agreement at cop30 next year in brazil 
 at cop29 the uk also make important announcement on counter deforestation scale up private finance and nuclear co operation as part of the clean energy transition the prime minister also announce our nationally determine contribution to reduce emission by at least by compare with level follow the advice that we receive from the independent climate change committee let i be clear that target be right for britain for energy security good job and growth 
 on the same day as the announcement scottishpower and siemens announce a £ deal to invest in wind manufacturing in hull that will boost british manufacturing and support good job in our industrial heartland it show what the clean energy mission can do for britain and build on the step that the government have already take which include lift the onshore wind ban give consent for nearly gw of solar set up great british energy deliver a record break renewable auction kick start our carbon capture and hydrogen industry and drive towards cheap clean heating through our warm home plan 
 it be in our national interest to use the power of our example to work with other to speed up the clean energy transition globally just as the climate change act which be support by member from across this house inspire other to follow our lead that be why at the g20 in brazil the prime minister launch the global clean power alliance along with a number of other country to drive forward the transition 
 that be just the start of the work that we need to do in the run up to cop30 to make next year ’s talk a success because the truth be that despite progress over the last week we be halfway through the decisive decade for limit warming to ° c and the world be way   off track other country such as brazil have also announce ambitious ndc and in the month ahead we will continue to push other to go far fast on raise ambition scale up finance protect nature and forest and drive forward the clean energy transition 
 the cop process be tortuous and progress be too slow however this government believe that while multilateralism in other word co operate with other be hard it be truly the only way to fight for britain those who say that we should disengage from the negotiation and step off the stage would let down our country deprive we of a voice and leave future generation pay the price despite all the difficulty at cop29 truth be overwhelmingly clear the global transition away from fossil fuel and towards clean energy be happen and it be unstoppable because clean energy be the route to energy security unstoppable because it be the economic opportunity of our time and unstoppable because people in britain and around the world can see that the climate crisis be here and that unless we act thing will only get bad 
 in less than month this government have show that we will seize the opportunity of speed up at home and have demonstrate climate leadership abroad in order to deliver energy independence low bill good job economic growth and the security of a stable climate we be do all we can to keep the british people safe now and for generation to come i commend the statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state claire coutinho 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement i echo his comment on storm bert and thank the emergency service for all that they have do to help those in need i start by pass on my personal condolence to the right hon gentleman on the passing of john prescott i know that he want he to lead the paris accord in have admire his work in kyoto and i believe that at the time he describe john as good at bash head together i hope that as the secretary of state ’s opposite number i can achieve some of that head bash that he so clearly value in john 
 in that vein the secretary of state have talk a lot about regain global leadership but i fear that he be stick in he may not want to acknowledge this but for the past year we have be a global leader we be the only major economy to have halve carbon emission since in that same time america ’s emission have stay the same and china ’s have triple however we have see that country be not persuade just by britain go far fast they be persuade by prosperity and by living standard we account for of global emission and i fear that if he continue down the path that he have set out our country will face hardship and there will be no point in be world lead because nobody will want to follow our lead he would make we a warning not an example to other 
 let we start with what the secretary of state announce at the conference of the party he have set out a new target of cut our greenhouse gas emission by by however what we do not hear in his statement be how much this will cost the british people the independent climate change committee say that that target will   require people to eat less meat and dairy take few flight and swap their boiler for heat pump and their petrol car for electric vehicle at a pace that will require taxis and mandation even the chair of the select committee have acknowledge that people will be force to change their life but the secretary of state say not to worry as he will deliver all the saving through energy policy and those plan will lead to high growth a cut in bill job creation and strong national security but when it come to his plan none of those thing be true the independent institute for fiscal studies have already say that his climate plan will not lead to growth the national energy system operator ’s report show that his rush for clean power in will add eye watering cost to our energy system and that despite those very expensive cost it would still leave gas pricing the system around of the time or it would leave the equivalent of million of home in the dark wait for the wind to blow i do not think that that be anybody ’s idea of energy or national security 
 the secretary of state do not have to take my word for it the head of offshore wind development at rwe of the country ’s large wind developer have warn that the secretary of state ’s rush to meet his target will lead to price spike with consumer lose out the chief executive of octopus have warn about the £ in cost that consumer will have to pay because the right hon gentleman want to build renewable without reform the grid the former head of mi6 have warn the secretary of state—[interruption this be worth listen to he say that from the point of view of national security the secretary of state be pursue 
 a completely crazy energy policy 
 the secretary of state ’s plan to make our energy expensive and unreliable will see job flee to more polluting country because it be cheap energy and innovation that matter in the race for job we need only ask china which dominate clean tech supply chain and be the world ’s large polluter that be where billion of pound of our taxpayer money will be go to pay for his rush transition from our country with all the investment that it have make in clean power to a country still power by coal we be talk about low growth high bill job lose and even blackout for more carbon in the atmosphere that be the opposite of what he have be promise 
 in baku while the secretary of state be sign we up to these target without talk about what they will do to the life of british people he be also sign away billion of pound of taxpayer money he sign we up to a $ annual climate finance target i be afraid that it be not credible to say that taxpayer will not have to pay more they will have to pay more and they deserve to know how much more will he tell we today what that new target will mean for british taxpayer consider the increase in the target the public will rightly question why country such as russia and particularly china now the world ’s large polluter and large by historical standard will not be oblige to pay a penny i think he try to insist that they would but it be very clear that they will not be oblige at all to pay in while britain which have invest billion in cut its emission and account for only of global emission will have to pay more will the secretary of state also set out an assessment of the    impact of increase reliance on coal power chinese import for his carbon plan and of what that mean for global emission 
 the secretary of state be not be honest with the british public he promise they £ off their energy bill by but just week ago he whip his labour mps to vote down that pledge he take away the winter fuel payment despite promise that the elderly would be look after under his energy policy and he now say that he can achieve strong climate target in a way that will require cost from the public this be not a recipe for climate leadership but a recipe for high bill and lost job and it will be a disaster for the british public 
 i just remind those on the front benches that the reply to a statement should last no long than minute 
 oh dear oh dear let i deal with the shadow secretary of state ’s question such as they be let we start with our nationally determine contribution announce at the conference of the party it be so interesting that she now oppose it because the ndc announce by the prime minister be exactly the target that her government legislate for in in the carbon budget which cover she be now oppose the very target that her government put into law and that she claim just a few month ago that she be work towards as secretary of state 
 there be a pattern here mr speaker every week the right hon lady take to twitter to express her outrage about a policy ask who on earth could support this every week someone pop up in her reply and say politely you do just a few month back it be not the only time that she have do this last week she come out against the clean heat market mechanism another policy that she propose interruption she say not but i have a statement from she from only month ago in which she say that the clean heat market mechanism would be introduce in april which be exactly what this government be do the truth be that she will leap on any pass bandwagon even if it mean trash her record 
 let i give the shadow secretary of state a little lesson about opposition the job of the opposition be to oppose the government not to oppose themselves this be where she have end up out the window go any commitment to climate action she be ignore the fact that it be a route to energy security good job and low bill ignore the fact that it be back by business and ignore the fact that this country have an honourable tradition of bipartisan consensus on the issue i be happy to say that the previous government propose some ambitious target and that cop26 be an important milestone for the world this be not just irresponsible and not just crass opportunism it have help take the conservative party down to its bad election defeat in year so this approach will not work for she 
 let i tell the shadow secretary of state what the clean energy superpower mission mean for britain it mean clean up our power system so that we do not leave the country expose to fossil fuel as the previous government do it mean new job in carbon capture   and storage as we decarbonise industry and re industrialise it mean energy efficiency in home mean low bill warm home and low emission as for the neso report that she talk about i know that it be deeply disappointing to she but we have an independent report that say that be achievable she say that it be not it also say that it will give we energy security she say that it will not it also say that it can lead to low electricity which she constantly deny 
 the truth about the right hon lady be that she have nothing to say the conservative party be basically say stop the world we want to get off that will do nothing for the british people she have a lot to learn i be afraid to say that she need to start reflect on where her government go wrong they go wrong in many different way and she do not seem to be learn any lesson 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 may i gently say to the shadow secretary of state that she really should not believe dodgy headline in the daily telegraph in fact i be not sure whether headline in the daily telegraph be ever not dodgy base on what she be quote more importantly though let i congratulate the prime minister on his leadership at the conference of the party and the secretary of state on lead the negotiation and not least on deliver the £ of climate finance for develop country he set out this country ’s achievement since the general election to what extent will the combination of what this country show at cop and what we have deliver at home since   july   encourage country around the world to play their part in address the climate crisis 
 my hon friend ask an important question truth come out of cop the transition be unstoppable and secondly it be not go fast enough there be such a difference from a decade ago my hon friend who be there with i be nod in agreement because every country know that the climate crisis be happen and be affect they the testimony i hear be like the testimony that we could provide about what people be see every country know they have to act and while they all face constraint in act they also know this be the big change from a decade ago that it be massively in their economic interest there be a race on for the good job of the future and the clean energy transition can provide they 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 cop29 conclude with a deal that while welcome leave much to be desire i must stress that we need bold more decisive action if we be to face the great challenge of our time the climate crisis i know that the right hon gentleman ’s heart be in the right place and have be for many year we meet in the run up to cop15 in and i express my thank to he for his staunch leadership in the intervene year i express lib dem support for a brave programme of action go forward and our willingness to work with his department to help the uk step up and seize this opportunity for climate leadership 
 while we welcome the prime minister ’s commitment to ambitious emission target for commitment alone be not enough immediate action be need to insulate home reduce energy cost and ensure that no have to choose between heating and eating the delay to labour ’s warm home plan until spring be unacceptable when million of people include pensioner face a cold and unaffordable winter due to the cut in the winter fuel allowance 
 in my south cotswolds constituency and all across the uk we have see at hand the devastating effect of climate change and never more so than over the last few day with flood and storm become more frequent and severe town and village in my constituency such as purton great somerford and cirencester have be severely affect by flooding and we need urgent action now to mitigate climate change and help our community adapt to the likely impact now and in the future 
 i associate myself with the thank already express to the brave man and woman of our emergency service in the aftermath of storm bert climate leadership must prioritise solution that protect community and restore nature natural flood defence such as wetland 
 you have use your minute 
 my apology i think i have minute 
 the whips need to be give you well instruction 
 may i finish with a question will the secretary of state commit to include natural flood defence as a central part of the £ flood defence spending to ensure that community like those in the south cotswolds be well protect from the worsen impact of climate change while address biodiversity loss 
 i thank the hon lady for her question and support for ambitious action which be important 
 let i pick out a couple of the point she make the point about the devastating effect of the climate crisis already be apparent be important part of the danger be that those effect will end up be the new normal and we will just think of they as part of life they be part of life in a sense and as she say we need the right flood defence in place and so on but we also need to realise that those effect will get significantly bad if we do not act future generation will frankly hold we in infamy say you know about the scale of the devastation and have see a preview of what be to come and you decide you could n’t act so she be absolutely right 
 secondly let i gently correct the hon lady on the warm home plan we be get on with the warm home plan indeed announcement be make last week about action that will help over family benefit from home upgrade next year there be announcement about heat pump and a whole range of action to help family do well and lower their energy bill 
 i will make more point which be part of what the hon lady be say this be a climate crisis and a nature crisis it be a climate and biodiversity crisis it be   a bit disappointing that the nature part of the agenda at cop do not get the attention it deserve and that will be important for cop30 in brazil 
 i call the chair of the environmental audit committee 
 no can doubt the leadership that the prime minister and the secretary of state show in baku and they deserve great credit for that the secretary of state be right that there be a danger of overselle the achievement of the cop develop nation have be critical about the financial agreement that be reach and the commitment make in paris on fossil fuel be not follow through as he say what be the main barrier right now to get the action and pace of action that be need do he have confidence that in rio we will see the real breakthrough that the world be wait for 
 my hon friend ask absolutely the right question the truth on the finance side be that this represent a significant scaling up at a time when develop and develop country face extreme pressure on the public finance there be a significant development whereby the flow to multilateral development bank from large emitter such as china will now count towards the overall finance goal that be a big change and a big step forward 
 on the transition away from fossil fuel the barrier be that some country be worried about what it mean for they that be totally understandable some country think it will be problematic for their prosperity the truth be that we will just have to make well effort with the majority of country that want to see action prevail at next year ’s cop and that will involve hard yard finally we must have a campaign for this be something we will work on with brazil ambitious ndc because it be crucial that that be the job of the next cop 
 i commend to the secretary of state the uk small island developing states strategy report which be produce by the international development committee just before parliament be dissolve for the general election a key focus of that report be the need to support those island state not just at cop but all the time by the uk be an advocate for their need and requirement across the international community 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right and he speak with customary eloquence on the issue this be literally an existential issue for the small island state their testimony at cop be compelling and deeply distressing and that be why the finance deal be important it be not everything they want but it be a step forward 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s statement today and the agreement reach at cop29 in baku he and i go back a long way on cop so we know what it be like when it go wrong i particularly welcome the nationally determine contribution to reduce our greenhouse gas emission by by do he agree that the fundamental reason we have leadership on the global stage now as distinct from what we have have for the past year be   not just because of the target but because we have a plan this cop be suppose to be about implementation and where we lead on implementation other will follow 
 my hon friend be right she be with i at copenhagen and i definitely have copenhagen post traumatic stress disorder at the talk at various moment in the middle of the night her point about the target and action be absolutely right and there be global recognition that this government have up the pace in the multiple way i describe in my statement and that be incredibly important that be also important because business see it happen and think that britain be a country that be clear about its direction and that they will invest there 
 i can only speak for north norfolk but a green energy future be exciting for our local economy especially at bacton just along the coast village like happisburgh be suffer from be part of the fast eroding coastline in europe the secretary of state touch on coastal erosion in answer to my hon friend   the member for south cotswolds dr savage but can i push he specifically on how the outcome of cop will provide reassurance to my resident who be worried about lose their home to coastal erosion now
