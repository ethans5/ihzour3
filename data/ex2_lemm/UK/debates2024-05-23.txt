 hear hear 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to support local journalism 
 if she will make an assessment of the effectiveness of government support for local medium 
 mr speaker hour be a long time in politic as this be the last session of oral question before we hand over to the people we serve and await their decision i want to thank the whole team at the department for culture media and sport and everyone who support our ministerial team let i also wish luck to everyone whose life will be change that include member of course but importantly it also include the staff who support they and the resident they serve have look at sir david amess ’s plaque during prayer i also wish everyone a very safe campaign 
 we be commit to support local medium as a vital pillar of our local democracy our digital markets competition and consumers bill will among many other measure help to rebalance the relationship between local publisher and online platform in addition the media bill which i hope will be pass include measure to help radio to provide high quality local journalism we have also support local press through tax relief and innovation funding 
 the slough observer the slough express bbc radio berkshire asian star radio and other such local medium outlet be the glue that bind and build our slough community hold to account local councillor mp and official and place a local focus on national issue however the tories have neglect local news in the cairncross review highlight the serious challenge face local journalism but to date the government have take no significant action their lack of support couple with low wage and job insecurity be force talented journalist out of local news what step have minister take to ensure that job in local journalism be viable 
 since we be do some name check let i pay tribute to the havering daily time fm and the romford recorder i think the hon gentleman must have miss the digital markets act and the key recommendation of the cairncross review which identify the lack of balance in the relationship between publisher and dominant platform we bring that recommendation to the house and it be pass that be our main effort to protect local journalism but of course it be not our only effort we also provide business tax relief for local journalism office we support the bbc ’s local democracy report scheme we have protect public notice income we be look at how we use government advertising spend and we be speak to the team about what else we can do 
 this seem to be an appropriate moment to acknowledge that in orkney and shetland we be bless with some very good quality local medium the orcadian the shetland times shetland news sibc bbc radio orkney and bbc radio shetland if i have forget anyone i will doubtless suffer for it in the week to come for community such as ours a strong local medium presence be an important bulwark against the relentless centralisation of control power and government in edinburgh which be why we need to protect our medium do the minister agree that what we really need be a coherent strategy for all aspect of local medium include advertising to ensure that local medium outlet remain strong 
 i certainly agree and we have be put forward that strategy but it be a very dynamic market we be now see challenge to local reporting from artificial intelligence and we be consider how we can protect some of these publication because we agree that they be such an important part of our local democracy if any other member want to bob on this question and name check their local medium i shall be happy to pay fulsome tribute to their journalist 
 the minister must have guess that a mention of the torbay weekly which be launch year ago under its editor jim parker would be come in this supplementary question 
 on a more serious note of the worrying trend we have see be the way that national corporation will buy a historic local title turn it into a weekly and run into the ground even when such corporation close down a newspaper they refuse to release the title so that it can perhaps be use by a local group that be try to put together a multimedia platform to continue local accountability what step could the government take to resolve that 
 there be surely no great publication in my hon friend ’s constituency than the torbay weekly i should also say that this house have make it clear just how strongly it feel about bbc local radio service in the course of this parliament and i hope to see they protect in the next parliament he be absolutely right about the challenge of publication be buy up we want to support some of the microsite and we be look at how we can use government advertising spend to try to help support they 
 in the spirit of upmanship i would just like to announce that mr speaker do not read the financial times or listen to radio no he read the bolton news and listen to bolton fm we be very disappointed at the weekend because we lose to oxford united i speak to keith harris from bolton fm this morning and he want assurance that the government will do all they can to ensure that local radio be an essential tool for democracy that it get the legal support it need and that government both locally and nationally can do more to support local platform 
 on a point of clarification i read the chorley guardian and the lancashire evening post i would definitely still be listen as peter kay would say to chorley fm come all over 
 the bolton news bolton fm and the chorley guardian we could not live without they my hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of local radio as media minister i fight hard to make sure that we include provision for local radio in the media bill and i very much hope that it will be pass in the wash up 
 what step her department be take to support the horseracing industry 
 give that my constituency of pudsey will no long exist after the election this may be my final chance to thank all my constituent for the support that they have give i over the year i pay particular tribute to my parliamentary and constituency team who have help i enormously over the past year it have be the privilege and honour of my life and i be extremely grateful for it 
 in answer to the question the government very much support horseracing which be the large spectator sport and a major economic contributor and not just to the rural economy but to the economy more widely we have be work extensively with industry to maintain its status as a world renowne sport 
 i too rise to make my last contribution in this house may i thank you mr speaker and all the staff of the house who have help i enormously over many year i have answer thousand of question from the dispatch box and ask hundred from the back benches i pay tribute to my right hon friend who have be an exemplary minister and representative of pudsey 
 it be perhaps fitting that my final question be about horseracing which be at the heart of the west suffolk constituency and of course newmarket it require significant support in these difficult time i know that the minister and the secretary of state have be work incredibly hard to try to settle the late levy negotiation can he assure i that he will do everything he possibly can to use the last few day in which this parliament be sit to get that deal over the line we now want certainty to be able to take this great sport from strength to strength 
 i think that be a valedictory speech 
 my right hon friend have certainly be an advocate of and a hard campaigner for horseracing and not just in his constituency but for the wide sport significant progress have be make on increase levy contribution on a voluntary basis and a great deal of thank must go to the british horseracing authority the betting and gaming council and dcms official for all their effort and engagement throughout this process with an offer on the table we urge both side to agree on the term of the deal which will see increase investment in the sport allow it to grow and secure its sustainability we will do everything we can to ensure that be agree 
 i thank the minister for that answer the last autumn winter and spring have see a deluge of rain like we have never see many of we be either go to buy a boat or build what assessment have be make of the impact of the past month of increase rainfall and flooding on the horseracing industry 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point i know that colleague in sport england and the department for environment food and rural affairs have be look at this issue particularly as it have affect not just horserace but other pitch such as   for rugby football and so on i have some further detail on the conclusion of that which i would be happy to write to the hon gentleman about 
 what assessment she have make of the impact of the youth investment fund on opportunity for young people 
 as this parliament come to an end i too would like to begin by thank you mr speaker for everything you have do and for the support you have give i as a minister over the past year i would like to thank dcms and my official for all the work they have do the special adviser who have be superb and my hard work and effective ministerial team we work as a team and i be thankful for my engagement with the shadow secretary of state 
 it be really important that we support our young people that be why we have a programme to build or refurbish up to youth facility support young people each year to date £ have be award to organisation to build renovate and expand youth provision 
 like other i would like to thank everyone who have help i over my parliament i hope to come back for another with a different constituency name on the substantive question on   saturday may   i go to the middleton st george scout hall to join the local lord lieutenant and deputy mayor as we open their new scout hall with more than £ from the conservative government ’s youth investment fund could the secretary of state just remind we how important these community group be the scout the brass band and all of the different thing that we see around our community and maybe just remind we of the breadth and scope of support that this conservative government have give to such organisation 
 i thank my hon friend who be a huge campaigner for his area we have give opportunity to young people through our national youth guarantee that be not just about the youth club that i have mention we have also give disadvantaged young people an opportunity to have adventure away from home we have make place for the duke of edinburgh award scheme and we have create new uniformed youth group 
 it be labour government funding that enable i a working class girl from pontypridd to access specialist music lesson to fall in love with opera and to take part in a specialist workshop with welsh national opera we all know what be sadly happen with the wno so what step be the secretary of state take to safeguard our world class wno and the job and opportunity it provide for young people and everyone across wales and the south west 
 i be really delighted to have an opportunity to answer this question about funding in wales because notwithstanding the fact that art be devolve to wales this government have give £ through the arts   council to welsh national opera the same amount that the welsh government have give furthermore the arts council have give transition funding in fact welsh national opera have be in the top of organisation that have be fund my position be that the labour government in wales have reduce their funding to the arts council of wales by and have be call out by those in wales so i be very grateful to the hon member for give i the opportunity to point that out 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 can the secretary of state or anyone else on the tory benches honestly tell the young people in bristol and across the uk that they be well off after year of conservative failure on youth service failure on education and failure on skill development than they would be under a government lead by keir starmer and a change labour party 
 absolutely this government have support young people through education in outstanding schools—80 of young people get an outstanding education we be up in the pisa programme for international student assessment table for education as i say young people have be give opportunity in the creative industry which the hon member fail to mention employment be up in the creative industry and we have double the number of people employ and double the revenue labour vote against our creative industry tax relief every single time 
 what step she be take to support the participation of woman and girl in sport 
 what step she be take to support the participation of woman and girl in sport 
 we have a number of individual initiative to support the participation of woman and girl in sport the national physical activity taskforce be work across government to ensure that woman and girl get more active we have establish the board of women ’s sport to identify challenge and opportunity across woman ’s sport and we be fully support karen carney ’s recommendation to lift standard and deliver sustainable growth for woman ’s football 
 as you know mr speaker football be a great sport in which both boy and girl can participate walsall football club foundation do fantastic work to encourage and enthuse school in my constituency to participate through initiative such as let girl play do my right hon and learn friend agree that this be exactly what we need to do to encourage more grassroots sport for girl will she also join i in congratulate the boy team at cooper and jordan school on recently win the utilita kid cup final at wembley 
 i be delighted to congratulate the boy team and to commend all the work do in local school to encourage girl to get more involve in sport that be why the government be commit to equal access to physical education and sport in school so that girl be able to participate in whatever sport they like if they want to play cricket football or rugby they should be entitle to do so and it be why the department for education have publish guidance on how to deliver a minimum of hour a week of quality pe alongside over £ of funding for primary pe and sport through the sport premium 
 there be no great exemplar of encourage woman and girl into sport than the motorsport sector from susie wolff ’s f1 academy and discover your drive to motorsport uk ’s girl on track scheme the sector be discover british talent like abbi pulling who win both race in miami in the f1 academy and then the very next weekend win the british f4 race here in the uk and that be before i get on to the engineering and design role do my right hon and learn friend agree that motorsport show the way for other sport to follow 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend on the huge value of motorsport i congratulate motorsport on its girl on track scheme which be get more girl and woman into sport i highlight and re emphasise his point that motorsport be not just about the sport itself it be a huge powerhouse for research and development that build and support innovation 
 i draw attention to my recent appointment to the board of llanelli scarlets 
 i pay tribute to both front bench team for the cross- party work in this house because woman ’s and girl sport be really important will the secretary of state join i in celebrate the activity of girl and woman in sport whoever be in government next we will continue to work across party to ensure that the right of all woman and girl be uphold in sport 
 i could not agree more we do quite a lot of important cross party work in this house of the thing i have be most proud to be involve with in this role be support the woman ’s football team and woman in sport it be phenomenal to go to australia to see the woman ’s team almost win the world cup and it have be phenomenal to see the work that the lionesses and former lionesses have do to spotlight that we be at a very exciting point for woman ’s football and the government be continue to support it in so many different way 
 the secretary of state talk a good talk but on her watch the gender activity gap be wide than ever few girl than boy take part in team sport do she agree that it be only under labour the party of equality that woman and girl in bristol and beyond will finally have equal access to sport 
 i absolutely disagree with that statement of course because for a number of year now the conservative government have be support woman and girl to get into sport with a significant campaign   to get more woman and girl into sport and the cross departmental work with the department for education to ensure that young girl have equal access to sport in school in fact year on year we have see those number on participation in sport improve and we also set up the national physical activity taskforce with the specific aim of get more woman involve in activity

 i appreciate the hon member raise the concern of the music industry because we too very much want to support it when i join the department the industry be very vocal about some of the challenge of touring and we methodically work through those challenge to make sure that some of they be ease we have also support grassroots venue however i often wonder whether when labour member raise these point in the chamber they do not have an ulterior motive i be keen to see whether they will put in their own local manifesto their desire to rejoin the european union 
 in my constituency i have many local grassroot football team include newton aycliffe which have just achieve the high league position in their history and ferryhill town youth which be look to provide disability access both of they have be well support by newton youth and the local respectively but do the minister agree how critical it be that money flow down the football pyramid and will she congratulate newton aycliffe on their achievement and commend the local paper for its backing

 the legacy of year of conservative government be a real term cut in local authority expenditure on youth service since will the secretary of state admit just how profoundly the tories have fail our young people and acknowledge that only a labour government can restore hope and opportunity for young people across this country 
 in addition to the £ in the national youth guarantee which be support young people across the country we be approach youth in   a cross departmental way whether through the £ from the home office to support young people not to go into a life of crime the similar amount of funding from the ministry of justice to ensure that that funding come through or the £ that we give to local council we be support young people at every stage of their life

 what step will the government take to ensure robust regulation of the special impartiality rule that apply during the election period this be in reference to my substantive question about the enforcement of the broadcasting code to ensure that multi party democracy be respect devolution be not treat as a sideshow and the people of scotland get an accurate picture of public policy that apply to they so that they be not disinformed and disenfranchise 
 the hon member will know that all broadcaster be regulate by ofcom i be sure that they will all be aware of the importance of impartiality 
 cotgrave football club do a fantastic job of provide access to football for the local community but it be limit by its current facility and need funding from sport england for a g all weather pitch to secure that funding it must qualify as a level club with facility for disabled football and a plan to grow woman ’s football it would love to do that but it can not do it without a g pitch can the secretary of state help we to resolve this chicken- and egg situation so that cotgrave football club can secure the funding that it need and provide access to football for even more people 
 my hon friend have raise that with i in the past and i have speak to my official i encourage she to continue to liaise with the football foundation to understand what might be possible so i suggest she pass that on she be a really successful and staunch campaigner for her local area i have work with she on a number of campaign and i have every faith in her success in this particular campaign

 the hon gentleman do not mention the rugby league result on sunday 
 the hon member for south norfolk the chairman of the public accounts commission be ask 
 if he will make an assessment of the adequacy of national audit office resource to scrutinise the cost of ai in government 
 the national audit office do have adequate resource to scrutinise the cost of artificial intelligence and indeed produce a report in march that find that ai present government with significant opportunity to transform public service and that the government have identify that artificial intelligence could deliver substantial productivity gain potentially worth billion 
 my hon friend have identify the report in which i be interested that report as he rightly say note the importance of artificial intelligence in deliver transformational public service but also note a number of challenge in the die ember of this parliament would he be willing to leave a message for the next chair of the public accounts committee urge that an inquiry be carry out into that report as i believe its finding be of considerable importance 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right that it be an important subject and the public accounts committee be due to take oral evidence on it on   june i will certainly draw his concern to the attention of the new chair of the public accounts committee when i know who he or she be 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his response this be a massive subject and will have to be scrutinise greatly in the next term of government what assessment have be make of the potential negative of ai within the defence industry and government and what step will be take to combat they 
 i think the short answer be that there be inadequate awareness inside government although there be some awareness that there be potentially very large negative with artificial intelligence indeed of the inventor of artificial intelligence have write a book on precisely that subject i suspect that it be something the government will continue to assess 
 if he will make an assessment of the adequacy of national audit office resource to undertake analysis on the efficiency and effectiveness of nhs procurement 
 in its january report the national audit office establish that the nhs supply chain have great potential to secure further saving by aggregate the nhs ’s spending power but that so far it have not fulfil that potential 
 in its january report on the nhs supply chain the national audit office make recommendation to improve the efficiency of the nhs ’s £ annual procurement programme include the need to improve price and make order as straightforward as possible the national audit office report twice a year on whether department have implement its recommendation so will it use that mechanism to monitor the progress of the nhs supply chain 
 i be sure the comptroller and auditor general and his staff at the national audit office will want to listen very carefully to what my hon friend have say although i must tell he that the inability of the nhs to use its huge spending power more successfully on behalf of taxpayer and patient have be a hardy perennial throughout my entire year in parliament while i wish he well in his endeavour i would advise he not to hold his breath 
 it be a little know fact that from to i be a member of the public accounts committee i really enjoy that experience this be of my last question in this house after nearly year here can we do more to show incoming member of parliament how powerful a body the public accounts committee be and what an amazing resource it be for members of parliament in get inquiry look at funding and look at the wise spending of government could we have a programme again perhaps there could be a note on the desk to teach new member how important this national treasure be 
 have spend year on the public accounts committee i completely agree with what the hon gentleman say it be in my view of the good place to spend ’s time as a parliamentarian check that our constituent money as taxpayer be safeguard and well look after by whichever government of the day happen temporarily to be in office i commend what he have say to everyone

 i thank my hon friend for his response but give that affordable housing be such a concern across north devon can the church do any more to assist 
 i know what a great champion my hon friend be on this issue unfortunately the church commissioners themselves do not have any land in north devon that be be consider for housing at the moment but i will put she in touch with the diocese of exeter to see whether it have opportunity in its own land portfolio as i say i know what a big issue this be in north devon and how important it be for my hon friend who have be work on it passionately so we will do what we can to help 
 what recent assessment the church of england have make of the adequacy of the support offer by diocese to a parish in an interregnum 
 during an interregnum a diocese will usually arrange for clergy in neighbouring parish and across the local deanery to take service and to be available to support the church warden and the parochial church council it be important that those local volunteer be well support during an interregnum when they lack the visible and present leadership of a parish priest 
 my hon friend will know that the combined parish of st paul ’s and christ church serve a large part of paignton but be currently in interregnum as he outline during interregnum lie minister and church warden have to step forward what extra support do the church make available to they when they do so 
 it be typical of my hon friend to take this level of interest in his clergy and church as i know he do regularly i can tell he that the diocese of exeter have produce a guide to help church warden and the parochial church council and a duty of pastoral care be clearly owe to all those who keep the church go in the absence of a minister the good help that christ church and st paul ’ paignton can receive be for that vacancy to be really well advertise have do a bit of research on that church i can see that the new incumbent would inherit a dynamic worshipping congregation on the beautiful english riviera i be pleased to be able to provide some free advertising for that tremendous opportunity i hope that parish priest look for an exciting new opportunity will be flock to christ church and st paul ’ paignton to take up that 
 what recent assessment the church of england have make of the impact of church school on the level of educational attainment in a cleethorpes constituency and b england 
 the church of england educate more than child in its school in england my hon friend must be particularly proud of the fact that all church of england school in his constituency be currently rat good by ofsted 
 i recently visit of the church school in my cleethorpes constituency and i be impress by how they be influence by their connection with the church the website of new holland church of england and methodist primary school say 
 as a church school new holland seek to live out the church ’s philosophy of value all god ’s child pay particular attention to our christian vision look forward with hope flourish do all the good we can 
 and stay true to 
 our core christian value 
 do my hon friend agree that those word exemplify the value of church school and what they can bring to their local community 
 the fact that those church school be rat good include new holland primary which my hon friend have visit show that they provide not just excellent teaching which be really appreciate by parent such school be generally oversubscribe but a caring and nurture environment as he rightly say that be well encapsulate by the value of new holland primary school which he read out just now i be grateful to he for highlight their excellent record and i think that we all pass on our thank to those school 
 what step the church of england be take to provide funding to parish church 
 parish ministry be at the heart of all that the church of england do between and the church commissioners be distribute £ to support our mission and ministry that be a increase on the previous year period and the lion ’s share of that funding go to diocese to strengthen and grow local ministry in parish and worship community in addition the commissioner wish to maintain that level of funding over the next year which would mean £ be distribute between and 
 i be grateful for that very encouraging information and i pay tribute to my hon friend for the work he have do during this parliament on behalf of the church commissioners he have be unfailingly assiduous and courteous almost holy in the conduct of his work on behalf of the church 
 do my hon friend share my concern about the forced amalgamation of parish that many diocese across the country be undertake vibrant and viable local church in diocese such as liverpool be be   offer the invidious choice of either surrender their autonomy to become part of new mega parish or give up access to resource from the centre resource that they themselves contribute to the centre as my hon friend have say and imply surely the whole value of the church of england be in the local parish system not in its regional bureaucracy can he tell the house how the church of england will continue to ensure the integrity of our parish system 
 i be grateful to my hon friend he be right to highlight to the house that there be pressure in some area and he be also right to point out that the parish network across the whole of england across every of our constituency in england be extremely precious we must do everything we can to preserve it and i make that point at every opportunity i know that many member of parliament include my hon friend also make that point regularly and that message have be hear at the top of the church which be why we be put the vast majority of our funding back down into parish of course we be also encourage parish to do what they can to raise money at the local level but my hon friend ’s point be absolutely right

 i be very grateful to my right hon friend who have have a long stand interest in these and other church matter he be right in what he say because with third of special school at or over capacity the recent decision to allow faith education provider to run special school will enable the church of england to alleviate some of those pressure and give family more choice and opportunity in the new forest as well as across the whole of england i would say that our strong ethos of community care make our school well suit to provide a nurture environment for all child with special educational need 
 what step the church of england be take to provide support for people in gaza 
 the church of england call for the immediate release of the hostage in gaza and an end to the fighting which have cause the loss of so many   life and cause so much suffering to the palestinians the diocese of jerusalem and the worldwide anglican communion continue to support financially the al ahli anglican hospital in gaza city which as i know from the diocese of jerusalem synod last week be still operate with the wonderful medic in it and be still provide care 
 i thank the hon member for his answer of course while parliament be not sit we know that the horrendous situation in gaza will continue and it be really important that we put the focus on those institution that can make intervention over the next few week i therefore ask he how be the church of england use its soft power and leverage to bring peace and justice to the region particularly to the people of gaza 
 i thank the hon lady for her very pertinent and important question she will know that the archbishop of canterbury himself go out to the holy land just after   october i can tell she that the bishop of chelmsford be there very recently and the bishop of suffolk be also a frequent visitor the worldwide anglican communion as well as the church of england will absolutely continue to play its part in bring peace and justice to this terrible conflict which have go on for far too long

 the hon member for luton south represent the speaker ’s committee on the electoral commission be ask 
 whether the committee have have recent discussion with the electoral commission on the potential impact of disinformation on the integrity of election 
 the committee have have recent discussion with the electoral commission on the matter raise the commission recognise the risk pose to the integrity of election by disinformation and misinformation and it be contribute to effort across the public sector include other regulator and the government to guard against negative impact the legal regime the commission regulate be focus on ensure that political finance be transparent and that campaigning material include an imprint show voter who have produce the material it do not have a role in regulate the content of election campaign material but it encourage all campaigner to undertake their role responsibly and transparently 
 that be good to hear but we have hear there will be a lot of attempt disinformation around the us presidential election in the come month so what assessment have the electoral commission actually    make of the risk of hold a uk general election at a time when there will be a greatly increase risk of hostile disinformation campaign with what appear to be grass- root facebook group on low emission zone recently be expose as have be set up by conservative staff member 
 the commission ’s role be to ensure the financing of campaign be transparent it do not have a role in regulate the content of election campaign material such as by prevent the use of deepfake the commission have highlight that if additional regulatory responsibility for campaign material be give to a uk regulator these power would need careful consideration regulate the content of campaign material would require a new legal framework the commission do not have experience or expertise of such a framework and believe such work would be well manage by other organisation 
 am 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions if he will make a statement on the equality and human rights commission investigation into the treatment of disabled people on benefit 
 it be a pleasure to be call to the dispatch box to respond for the department for work and pensions this morning the department be absolutely committed to provide service through which every customer include disabled people and our most vulnerable claimant can experience fair opportunity and access to our service to ensure they get the support they need 
 the department have be in negotiation with the ehrc since on this matter it be disappointing that we have not be able to come to a mutually agreeable position as the secretary of state for work and pensions state yesterday during his select committee appearance our exist legal advice and understanding be that both the ehrc and the dwp be still bind by confidentiality we be seek further clarity on what we can share so i will not discuss those negotiation far 
 while i do not believe an investigation be necessary we at the department do of course take the ehrc ’s concern seriously we welcome the focus now provide in the term of reference we will work constructively with the commission in its investigation to well understand its concern i hope the investigation will provide a deep insight into some of the most complex case that the department deal with of course if any improvement be identify by the commission we will rightly take step to address they 
 i thank the minister for her answer i have great respect for she but if she be tell the house that the government have be in negotiation with the ehrc for year and this be where we be now that be ridiculous and absolutely underline what many in this house include myself have be say to the government for more than year the scottish national party have be challenge the government over their treatment of those with illness or disability and therefore we welcome this overdue investigation by the ehrc 
 full transparency and accountability be imperative so that the mistake of the past be never repeat we know about that from all the other investigation that have be take place recently if it do transpire that either the dwp or the secretary of state or both have breach equality law the strong possible action must be take it be the least those who have suffer at the hand of this government deserve 
 i have speak over the year to many disability organisation and they be appal at how disabled people be treat as be i. the united nations committee on the rights of persons with disabilities rapporteur have conclude that the uk government have 
 fail to take all appropriate measure to address grave and systematic violation of the human right of person with disability 
 that be a further black mark against this government i have say it time and again the uk government must change course from their cruel and demonising approach to disabled people and start support they in the way be do in scotland the word dignity fairness and respect mean something to disabled people in scotland the scottish social security system be design to treat people with dignity fairness and respect when on earth will this government or the likely follow labour government start do that in the uk it be an absolute and utter disgrace 
 the propose welfare reform be dangerous and look to slash disabled people ’s income during an ongoing cost of living crisis when disabled people be already face high living cost more people be be push into insecure and unsafe work and the government be undermine the principle of an extra cost benefit for disabled people now we have this ehrc investigation how can the minister possibly defend her government ’s ongoing assault on disabled right just to cut cost 
 i agree with the hon lady we have much we agree about and real mutual respect and i know her concern come from the heart i reiterate that we be a compassionate department welcome to all and we be keen to get insight and learning i have give evidence on that most recently to the select committee make it clear that we be a learn department focus on individual in fact our trauma inform approach be testament to that i recently see that in hastings and it be be roll out in south yorkshire plymouth and all our dwp innovation hub to successfully drive a programme of understanding into our core business area include the child maintenance area and service area from a meeting with my dwp colleague i know what a big difference it make 
 we engage right across the uk with a multi agency approach the hon lady will be pleased to know that i recently meet the independent reviewer of the personal independence payment and benefit there be that process in scotland for a mutual learning and understand experience reform that be be bring out be about disabled people ’s voice be fully hear and understand whether that be through our national disability strategy or our action plan this year i also recently engage with the domestic abuse commissioner nicole jacobs who cover england and wales and this give i a chance to pay tribute to she we have be try hard to understand tragic and complex case our sympathy be always with the family and we will continue those internal process review 
 i hope that the chairman of the select committee   the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms will reflect on the useful evidence that be give we have a grow number of visit officer for some of the most vulnerable we currently have and we have dedicated prison work coach i want anybody watch study or read this urgent question to approach we and talk to we many people become involved with the dwp at the most challenging time of their life we be here to help people whether through our youth hub or our disability work coach please tell we what be go on we can link people to the right agency and we be determined to understand what the commission be think and feel and to work with it 
 my hon friend the minister will be aware of the work that my select committee have do around the national disability strategy but i specifically draw her attention to the word of   the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson   early this week nothing about i without i what reassurance can the minister give i that disabled people will be fully include in the ongoing consultation on personal independence payment what reassurance can she give i that she continue to work with disability confident to ensure that disabled people be enable to move into work and support when they be in work what reassurance can she give i that the victim of contaminate blood sodium valproate primodos and mesh will not be subject to ongoing assessment year after year to make sure that they continue their entitlement to benefit what reassurance can she give i that she agree that inclusion be not wokery and that include disabled people be crucial to ensure that their right be uphold 
 i be look forward to give evidence to my right hon friend on many of these matter alongside my hon friend the minister for employment indeed there be work to come forward on disability confident access to work the disability employment goal and much more 
 i point my right hon friend to action we have take include just this week there be the government back lilac review on disabled entrepreneur which be absolutely about listen to disabled people and have they at the heart of the conversation fantastic engagement on british sign language fully in bsl have be at the heart of that there have also be the pip consultation and the wide reform conversation we have also bring forward the buckland review 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right about inclusion it work because when it be embed it be right for the bottom line of the business the organisation and the community it be not a nice to do and it be not wake it be what we should be do 
 i call the opposition front bench spokesperson 
 this be the time in history that the equality and human rights commission have decide to investigate whether a secretary of state have commit unlawful act by discriminate against disabled people as a result of the way that the government have run the benefit system accord to a report by the all party parliamentary group for health in all policy it may have lead to 
 the death of vulnerable claimant by suicide and other cause 
 yesterday appear before the work and pensions committee the secretary of state feign surprise at the equality and human rights commission take that unprecedented step yet he previously claim that he and his department be close to secure a legally bind agreement to uphold disabled people ’s right i wonder what have change 
 will the minister recognise the seriousness of her predicament and apologise to disabled people for her department ’s obvious reluctance to engage meaningfully with the equality and human rights commission why have her department preside over a benefit system   that the commission believe could be unlawfully discriminate against disabled people will she take the opportunity to apologise to all those disabled people who have have their life tear apart by her department ’s potentially illegal administration of the benefit system 
 let i reflect on the secretary of state ’s appearance at the select committee i reiterate that as he say yesterday the investigation of the department be base on a suspicion that something have occur that be not in and of itself conclusive proof the dwp rightly take its obligation under the equality act include the public sector equality duty incredibly seriously and will continue to co operate with the commission on its investigation i hope that help the hon lady we want everyone in the dwp to be able to support customer in an appropriate manner accord to the individual ’s need our mental health training and reasonable adjustment guidance help to empower our colleague by give they the skill to support every customer 
 it have be the great privilege of my life to have be in the most amazing life change department for almost all of the last year we be fully commit to listen to our customer and their representative about their need and to learn from they of course people will be concern about the ehrc ’s response and the department be genuinely disappointed because we be constantly learn work be ongoing to strengthen guidance and training through continuous improvement activity our colleague be local people who live in their community they know their community and what people need whether people be come through the door be from a local special school have be make redundant or have a health condition dwp staff know those people and want to reassure they we will continue to give they the necessary tool and have confidence that our department will respond in the right way to our most vulnerable customer 
 as i depart this house as a conservative mp i thank you sir roger for your service and mentor over my year here will the minister make sure that in the response to the investigation those work in jobcentre and dwp office across the country be give the support that they need to do their job in west suffolk they do that job excellently brilliantly lead by julia nix who frankly deserve an honour it have be a pleasure to work with those people when the minister consider the investigation will she look not only at physical disability include engagement with those who support wheelchair use but hide disability such as neurodivergent condition to the extent that they be disability and ensure that they be at the heart of the response 
 i welcome back my right hon friend from whom i learn so much as a parliamentary private secretary it be pleasing to know that his work on neurodiversity and understand other continue to be at the heart of what he bring to this house even in his last few moment here i be recently at neurobox in cambridge where dyslexia need be discuss as well as the wide need in the labour market to learn about understanding and help people through the access to work scheme my right hon friend ’s interest be mention there whether we be talk about the   buckland review the lilac review on entrepreneurship which i mention or partnership in community such as with julia nix who be stellar leader those message be important for those who only hear about the experience of the dwp through the mouth of those in this house i urge people to go and see their local jobcentre this week there be a recruit britain campaign back by employer to enable people to understand our jobcentre power to bring about change 
 last week i highlight to the minister a report from the un committee on the rights of persons with disabilities that conclude that the uk have fail to take all appropriate measure to address grave and systematic violation of the right of people with disability she say that the uk government be 
 commit to ensure that the uk be of the good place to live and work as a disabled person ”—[official report   may vol c. 
 do she really stand by that assertion give the serious concern raise by the equality and human rights commission do she understand why its chair say that they be extremely worried the ehrc also say that it believe that the dwp may have break equality law what do she have to say to the disabled people watch she must understand that it be a clear demonstration that this tory government be content simply to disregard disabled people their right and their need if she disagree let she tell we specifically why 
 i thank the hon lady for her remark just this week i meet people with disability in the media industry who be thrive while work in itv which try to help people when it come to wide 
 will the minister answer my question 
 i be just try to i meet a company that be work to ensure that nhs building be more accessible so the dwp understand that the hon lady ask whether i really believe that the uk could be the good place in which to be a disabled person in term of accessibility and opportunity we be engage and learn in the context of a change labour market and change need as for her early point we in the dwp want every customer to be support and we be commit to provide a compassionate service for all we take our obligation under the equality act extremely seriously and that include the public sector equality duty 
 we will of course continue to co operate with the commission ’s investigation i stand by my comment that we be disappointed to be in this position we often deal with tragic and complex case and our sympathy be always with the family concern we will continue to review and learn about process in order to understand well why the commission be take this action 
 navigate the benefit system be difficult enough for able bodied people but for those who become disabled because of illness or accident it become a virtual nightmare just at the point when they need the system the most also many   employer concentrate on what people can not do rather than what they can do will my hon friend update the house on the work be do to ensure that people particularly those who suffer disability owe to illness or accident receive the benefit that they need at their time of great crisis 
 we be roll out our workwell service and we have universal support as well integrate care system will pilot workwell the pilot will be locally design to fit local need and will be link to our exist work and health system work will be do throughout london i be not sure whether that will include my hon friend ’s part of london i be sure that we will be able to let he know 
 as i mention my dad become disabled and be not use to navigate the benefit system that happen to many people many think that people be bear with disablement but it can be acquire as a result of accident or incident the gov.uk website give information about the benefit calculator and the citizens advice help to claim service and encourage people to see a disability employment adviser 
 my hon friend ask what more could be do notwithstanding the great support provide by programme such as access to work there be more that can be do but that safety net be there to protect people when they be at their most vulnerable whatever the reason 
 disabled people ’s confidence in the department be at a terribly low ebb we be originally tell that these negotiation would be conclude within a few month but in fact as the minister have tell we they drag on for year and they fail the commission have tell i that now that negotiation have end there be no restriction on what the department can say about what be happen during those negotiation at the very least we need some explanation from the department of why it have not be possible to reach an agreement can the minister give we that explanation now 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for his question as i have say we will work constructively with the commission during its investigation in order to understand its concern well we be seek further clarity on what information we can share but until those conversation have end i will not be in a position to share any further information 
 the secretary of state of course make his comment to the department but the permanent secretary tell the committee that the term of reference have be publish and we welcome that because it will give we a clear sense of what the commission want to investigate we hope that a deep insight into that very complex machine will allay some of the concern that the right hon gentleman have rightly identify and if there have be breach or improvement can be make we will of course address that the department be constantly learn and work be be do to strengthen guidance and training through continuous improvement activity 
 the right hon gentleman mention confidence it be important that colleague and those with disablement feel confident that we have the necessary tool to help our most vulnerable claimant and of course we will take account of everything that the commission say 
 i be indebted to   the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows   for obtain today ’s urgent question and she be correct to say that policy should be base on fairness dignity and respect in deal with case i find that those with mental health condition include sporadic mental health condition be often unfairly sanction go through much deep stress and sometimes end up in desperate poverty as a result in advance of the inquiry could the minister tell we what the department be do to ensure that the sanction regime against people with disability particularly those with mental health condition operate in a much more respectful and inclusive manner that help they to deal with the horrible problem they be try to cope with 
 the right hon gentleman make an important point about fluctuate condition and need which he be absolutely correct to identify we have a grow number of visit officers—500 and a grow number of colleague with a trauma inform approach and there be close engagement with wide safeguarding have a trust relationship with ’s work coach job coach and disability employment adviser be so important and this be at the heart of our safeguarding protocol which be in place for healthcare professional who undertake assessment if they identify a new condition or concern they will ensure that the individual ’s healthcare team be aware and communicate directly with they again that be why we have the trauma inform approach i recently see it be use at the hastings service centre where decision be make on child maintenance and at jobcentre the approach be be roll out in order to be at the heart of what we do 
 in all the time i have be in this house it be quite a long time i have never pick on civil servant or the people who deliver policy on the ground because i be always remind that president harry truman have a sign on his desk that say the buck stop here the buck stop here with the government but let i reinforce a point that be make early my constituent tell i as chairman of the westminster commission on autism i be sympathetic towards this that the staff they meet be good about physical disability but be not good when it come to neurodiversity people on the autism spectrum and people with little know mental health challenge can we give more training to the people who carry out assessment to make they more effective and efficient 
 i agree with the hon gentleman that the nature of disability and need have change which be what i be try to draw out early different type of need be come our way we all know from our own constituency casework about the support that disabled people need in any realm and it be about understand the different need and appreciate that need change i can assure he that the department work closely with healthcare assessor and have put in a new process to allow personal independence payment to be pause when an appointment have already be schedule for example if we need to have additional information we be very aware that claimant need be different hence the buckland review of autism we know that a huge number of autistic people be very keen to work but not enough of they do and this be at the heart of our   understanding i think the hon gentleman and i share the same view on this issue the department will need to make change and develop its understanding and i want to reassure the house that we come in the spirit of learn 
 the minister be always compassionate and understand the issue as we can tell from the way she respond as i often say however the benefit system lead to incredible frustration when those who be disabled have their application refuse they go to appeal the big issue in my office be benefit include appeal we have staff member who do nothing else during the and a half day week that she work although we recognise that dwp staff do a good job there need to be a well understanding of how the system work when someone fill in their application there need to be a well understanding of what it mean to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease osteoarthritis diabetes blood pressure problem back pain chronic pain those be the issue when we win of appeal it indicate that perhaps the decision be not right 
 i thank the hon gentleman for the way he approach this matter it also give a chance for all of we to thank our casework team who do so much and indeed all the staff across dwp they know that our customer vary they know that at time in their life they need additional support that be why we have those specialist service role and procedure in place from the dwp visit service to the advanced customer support senior leader we have the serious case panel review and we have the customer experience survey we be always listen and learning and there be a continuous need to do that on fluctuate condition which other member have mention we have put a well understanding of need and diagnosis at the heart of our engagement on reform and that be what disabled people have tell i as well 
 minister have have year to reach a basic agreement to ensure that the service that the department provide be accessible and do not discriminate against disabled people be it laziness incompetence or the chaos endemic across government that have result in the absolute failure to reach a negotiation can the minister acknowledge that this failure have never be see in any other department before and represent under the equality act a further demonstration of discrimination against disabled people the failure of the negotiation itself represent the problem 
 i reiterate to the house and to the hon gentleman that we take our obligation under the equality act incredibly seriously i have speak about the change nature of condition understanding and learning and the public sector equality duty and we will continue to co operate and engage with the commission on its investigation as i say we do not believe that an investigation be necessary but we do take its concern seriously i undertake to the house that the department will be focus on those new term of reference so that we can work constructively with the commission in its investigation to well understand its concern interruption i understand the concern of   the hon member for east renfrewshire kirsten oswald who   be chuntere again but i reiterate to   the hon member for bermondsey and old southwark neil coyle   that we be very much determined to work with the commission as a way forward i agree that it be very disappointing that we have not be able to come to a mutually agreeable position i assure he that over the past year this very large department which deal with many different area and complex case have put at the heart of what we do of which i be extremely proud a dedicated understanding of the individual and their need 
 i congratulate my hon friend   the member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows   on secure this urgent question and continue her fantastic work in this parliament on the right of disabled people i also congratulate the equality and human rights commission on open this important investigation and on retain its a grade status as a national human right institution in the face of malicious attempt to undermine the work that it do for equality and human right for all 
 i work with many fantastic disability charity in my edinburgh south west constituency include health all round tiphereth and garvald but charity should not have to fill the huge gap leave by the government ’s dereliction of their duty discrimination against disabled people be a human right issue and that be something about which i care passionately as the elect chair of parliament ’s joint committee on human rights 
 as we be about to go into a general election period will the minister take the opportunity to give a cast iron guarantee on behalf of her party that she will end discrimination against disabled people in the benefit system and end her government ’s continue breach of disabled people ’s human right 
 i appreciate that there be a general election come but when it come to the most vulnerable people this be not a morning for politicking it be about be compassionate it be about understand disabled people ’s right and it be about listen and learning we be focus on individual by work with the domestic abuse commissioner and through workwell ’s universal support the national disability strategy the action plan and the trauma inform approach 
 vitally as the hon and learn lady say it be about hear not just from disabled charity but from disabled people across the country to understand their need it be incredibly important that we take this seriously and we be determined that if the investigation under the term of reference give we a deep insight into the concern i have speak to the select committee about how the department deal with the most complex case we will take every step to address any improvement identify by the commission i hope that give the hon and learn lady disabled people and those with health condition comfort that we take their need and want extremely seriously at the heart of government
