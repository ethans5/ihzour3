 uk export be increase use current price they be up by £ compare with the uk trade show be a pilot programme that do not yield the success we think it would so we have other scheme in place include the uk export academy international trade adviser help to grow and the   export support service focus on wales we will soon be appoint a new international trade adviser to help sme 
 that be an extraordinary statement because in the hon lady ’s constituency the great level of export be from professional and business service and those export be increase not only to the eu but to country outside the eu that be the reality on the ground so our strategy be work uk export be £ in a figure that have go up not down by £ the uk be the big service exporter in the world she should be proud of that because many such business be in her constituency those export have increase to from so there be good news but we be keen to do more

 uk export be increase use current price they be up by £ compare with 2023.[official report   march vol c. 5mc correction the uk trade show be a pilot programme that do not yield the success we think it would so we have other scheme in place include the uk export academy international trade adviser help to grow and the   export support service focus on wales we will soon be appoint a new international trade adviser to help sme 
 we be lucky that enfield north have quite a lot of small and medium sized business but they be suffer because of the cost of spiral bill and no government support do the minister think it be the lack of a government industrial strategy or the lack of individual support for exporter that be most hold our business back 
 that be an extraordinary statement because in the hon lady ’s constituency the great level of export be from professional and business service and those export be increase not only to the eu but to country outside the eu.[official report   march vol c. 5mc correction that be the reality on the ground so our strategy be work uk export be £ in a figure that have go up not down by £ the uk be the big service exporter in the world she should be proud of that because many such business be in her constituency those export have increase to from so there be good news but we be keen to do more

 there have not really be a loss in the market share i have talk about what be happen internationally we appreciate that small and medium sized enterprise may not have the resource they need to export into new market that be why we have the uk export academy international trade adviser help to grow and the export support service we be also look at what trade barrier we can break down and bust to make it even easy for sme to access new market through the trade deal secure by the secretary of state 
 what step she be take to help support the steel industry

 a number of the issue that the hon gentleman raise be fundamentally locally we work closely with mayor ben houchen who have do a remarkable amount of work for his part of the country the reality be that the steel sector be place in an area of uncertainty for some time we be able to provide support for tata which have ensure that the steelwork continue at port talbot we provide the large grant ever make available to steel and we be now in conversation with british steel that be what it mean to have a long- term steel strategy to ensure that steelmaking continue here in the uk

 i thank my hon friend for that question and his commitment to the commonwealth as a constituency mp with a huge commonwealth diaspora in chelsea and fulham i totally understand his sympathy and look forward to celebrate commonwealth day with he and other next week he know that the commonwealth do not make trade rule nor be it a trade agreement body like the gulf co operation council the european free trade association or the cptpp we think that the well course at present be to ratify our cptpp membership and continue to have reduce tariff under our develop country trading scheme however we be always open to new idea at the department for business and trade and i be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss this far 
 i thank the minister very much for a positive response the commonwealth be important for all of we the value of uk export to the commonwealth increase by in cash term between and while the value of import from the commonwealth increase by some we can clearly benefit each other how can we ensure that northern ireland company benefit fully from this enhance trading partnership

 as ever my hon friend be a great advocate for his cleethorpes constituency he be right that immingham be the no port in term of tonnage and be vital to our trade with the eu and the rest of the world if our diary allow i or of my ministers will be delighted to visit and see at hand the vital role immingham play in the transition to renewable energy 
 in december the british chambers of commerce find that a staggering of survey business continue to face difficulty use the trade and co operation agreement despite the tca be introduce over year ago business be still struggle to deal with the add headache that the regulation have create if of business still face difficulty after year how many year be it anticipate that it will take for these issue to be resolve 
 i thank the hon lady for her question many of the issue that business have be raise with we be specific not to the tca but to member country that be why ministers and i along with official go to all these country and we have remove many of the market access barrier which be not specific to the tca the hon lady will know that the tca will be up for review if she have specific thing she would like we to take to eu trade commissioners we be very happy to do so 
 this week the financial times report the most significant decline in uk trade volume since it be clear than ever that this government ’s hard brexit policy have exacerbate challenge for british business with a drop in trade since and export down by we be starkly lag behind our g7 peer can the secretary of state explain how year of conservative   rule have prepare british business for their despair around extra red tape and the chaos unleash by this tory hard brexit policy 
 i think the hon gentleman have just time travel from or it have be a long time since i have hear the phrase hard brexit he will of course know that we leave the european union with a deal so he need to catch up with what have actually happen it be also interesting that he talk about an ft report from i should let he know that we have not be in government since we have be in government since many of the thing he be point out be thing we have say will occur as trade flow move away from the european union to the indo pacific that be why we have leave that be why we be trade with the rest of the world the hon gentleman should also know that our economy be service so most of the thing he be talk about will not impact on the vast majority of the economy service export be boom and we be do well since leave the eu

 we have excellent relation with south korea as my right hon friend will know as the prime minister ’s trade envoy there bilateral trade total £ in the month to september negotiation to upgrade our fta with south korea be launch as part of president yoon ’s state visit in november round of the talk have already take place and round will take place later this month here in london

 my right hon friend be absolutely right in the uk of course we have our own superb rolls royce model of small modular reactor as well he be right about the importance of our grow trading relationship with korea as a former secretary of state for culture media and sport he will also know that of our service trade with korea last year be deliver digitally.[official report   march vol c. 2mc correction we need to upgrade the deal to make sure that it reflect modern digital trade as well both country be make good progress in the negotiation 
 what step she be take to increase trade with zimbabwe 
 the government be pleased that my hon friend who be the prime minister ’s trade envoy to angola zambia and ethiopia and member of the westminster africa   business group visit zimbabwe on the group ’s inaugural trade mission that be part of the government ’s work to promote opportunity for uk company particularly in critical mineral renewable energy and sustainable agriculture 
 i be grateful to the minister for that response on my visit to zimbabwe in january i meet the president and a number of other ministers they make it very clear that they want to draw a line under the past move forward and increase friendship and indeed trade link with this country what more can the government do to enlighten company and business in the uk about the many opportunity in zimbabwe 
 i thank my hon friend for his report and letter to i all about that i be pleased with the high level meeting he have on his recent visit and a lot of the medium coverage our embassy be follow up by prepare for the zimbabwe international trade fair in april and it be expect a strong uk presence my hon friend ’s return visit in april will be a perfect chance to progress the deal that we have and boost british investment for this year and beyond 
 what step she be take to ensure future trade agreement include environmental protection 
 the government be commit to pursue environmental provision in our trade agreement and to use our multilateral trade policy diplomatic effort and trade promotion activity all of which support our green objective 
 the government boast about the trade deal they have do and the environmental protection they have secure so presumably they have have the chance to analyse the impact will the minister tell the house whether the deal secure so far have improve or degrade our environment what lesson have be learn for negotiate future deal 
 the hon gentleman raise an interesting point many of the agreement have actually for the time include environmental provision if i recall correctly he do not like the australia trade deal but it be the time australia have commit in a trade agreement to the paris agreement and so on when it come to the impact of our trading policy over the last year he will also find for example that of uk import of palm oil a key interest for environmentalist be certify as sustainable up from in again we be see real result of uk trade policy move in a much more environmentally friendly direction 
 if she will make an assessment with the secretary of state for education on the potential merit of introduce a right to pay employment leave for kinship carer 
 some child   be in the care of close family member in england alone we recognise the vital role that kinship carer play in look after child who can not live with their parent last year the government publish the national kinship care strategy and announce a £ package of support for kinship carer in 
 the minister just reference the government ’s kinship strategy which be publish in december their own strategy have recognise that kinship carer in employment often report the need to give up work or reduce their hour to be able to care for the child they support it cite a survey reveal that of kinship carer give up work and a similar number have to reduce their hour permanently give the minister ’s desire to drive up employment and the fact that kinship carer step up overnight to look after child save the taxpayer a huge amount of money in comparison with when child go into local authority care why be the government not make pay employment leave a statutory right and only publish guidance 
 the hon lady raise a very important point we call on local authority to be considerate to people who be in employment when they take on a child to look after in a kinship care situation we think that employer be the right people to make sure that any provision we provide be a floor not a ceiling company such as john lewis take a very considerate approach to people in that situation we urge they to do so but we also encourage local authority which have budget allocate to this particular issue to provide support where they can 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of infrastructure on level of business investment 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of infrastructure on level of business investment 
 high quality infrastructure be crucial for deliver economic growth to quote a previous prime minister 
 you and i come by road and rail but economist travel on infrastructure 
 we know how important investment be the whole house will agree that the uk be the lead light when it come to offshore wind farm where we be already secure investment 
 let i point to a few example of further investment nissan be invest £ in new electric car model in the uk microsoft and google have announce data centre worth over £ and my secretary of state oversee the global investment summit unlock £ of investment in fact since we have secure more inward investment than any other country in europe over the last few year we have receive the high amount in the world after the united states and china i could go on mr speaker but i might test your patience 
 that be all very well but the government ’s decision to defer the banning of petrol and diesel vehicle until have lead to huge uncertainty among consumer and investor as the minister well know compare with other country it seem that the government lack ambition when it come to investment in electric vehicle infrastructure france for example will have something like installation by 2030—50 more than the uk what plan do the minister have to ensure that the uk ’s investment keep up with our competitor and meet the grow demand for electric vehicle 
 as the minister for the auto sector i be very keen to ensure that we be break bad meme around the electric vehicle sector we be do a huge amount of work in this space at the moment we have public charge point we have a rapid charging fund and a local electric vehicle infrastructure fund i be sure that the hon gentleman ’s local authority will want to tap into those the department for transport be work with local authority to ensure that they have charge strategy we have a £ local ev infrastructure fund which will deliver ten of thousand more charge point and support for on street residential charge point too it be really important that local authority be aware of the fund available and i suggest that the hon gentleman get in touch with the dft to support the installation of charge point in his constituency 
 i do not think that any hon or right hon member could disagree in general term with the minister ’s reply it would have be a more interesting reply if she have make an assessment of the reduction in investment since the cancellation of high speed because there be no doubt as she say that investment in rail infrastructure lead to business investment all along the route we can see that in birmingham and manchester and we can now see the lack of new investment because of the cancellation be it not a mistake to swap that investment which would have lead to many new high technology job for money to replace what have be take from local government to fill pothole 
 in my previous response i want to expose the opportunity and grant that be available to ensure that charge point be cris cross the country often parliamentarian be not aware of all the great work we be do 
 on hs2 just last week we announce the extra support that will be make available for local transport plan which cover everything include rail road and even bus and of course pothole network rail have receive £ from the government to improve transport in every region of the uk just last week we announce an extra £ of additional funding for local transport authority in the north and midland we want to make sure that decision on transport be make locally and that the infrastructure be need   and want by local community which be why we   be make sure that the fund from hs2 be be make available 
 if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of   regulatory cost on small and medium sized enterprise 
 we be hack through the red tape not least with our smart regulation programme we have announce reform to employment law and the recording requirement of the work time directive which will save uk business up to £ particularly benefit sme 
 i note that the minister welcome yesterday ’s budget as help small business particularly in the hospitality sector which be very hard hit in my constituency of the problem that many business tell we about be the business rate system more business have fail in the past and a half year than have be establish in scotland we often find that while the downside of this government ’s policy be happily pass on by the scottish government any benefit be not we would like to see complete reform of the rating system not tinker but reform can the minister tell we whether widespread reform be plan how would he plan to do it how could business in scotland also benefit 
 the hon lady be absolutely right to point to some of the difficulty in the hospitality sector i speak to hospitality entrepreneur in my constituency and across the country who be find it difficult which be why we step in with a package of about £ of business rate support and there be £ of business rate support last autumn we pass the equivalent money on to the scottish government to pass on to their hospitality venue but they pass on none of it 
 a typical pub in scotland be £ bad off than a typical pub in england and a typical guest house be £ bad off that be why scotland have a high failure rate than england similarly a typical pub in labour run wales be £ bad off and a typical guest house be £ bad off and there be a high failure rate it be critical that the benefit be pass on to those business and that we look for structural reform anyone who want to scrap business rate need to show where the £ of income will come from rather than simply say that they will scrap they without announce a replacement 
 what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of publicly name employer for the enforcement of the national minimum wage 
 since we have publish press release and name around employer that have in total repay over £ in arrear to over worker we have recently have round of the scheme 
 naming and sham serf as a deterrent but should we not go far against persistent offender pay the minimum wage be not an opt out it be a law that no company be above strong penalty   include fine proportionate to the severity of the violation to ensure that no employer can exploit its worker with impunity would level the balance between employer and employee will the minister commit to explore these measure to safeguard the right and the dignity of worker 
 the hon gentleman be right to point to this measure we know that name and sham be a significant deterrent against underpayment of the national minimum wage and we be very keen to ensure that naming continue alas in the most recent naming and sham round minimum wage investigation return more than £ in arrear to over worker his majesty ’s revenue and customs issue business with nearly fine total £ as the hon gentleman recognise name and sham alone be a significant deterrent and we intend to continue do it 
 i call the shadow minister 
 my hon friend   the member for bury south christian wakeford   be right that too many employer still think they can opt out of pay the minimum wage early this week the low pay commission publish its report which say that non compliance appear persistent in the social care sector i have hear a range of evidence cite problem with record keeping exploitation of migrant worker and worker routinely not be pay for travel time 
 it be clear that the social care sector have a real issue with the minimum wage but when browse through the late naming and sham list publish by the department a couple of week ago i find only employer class as be within the social care sector which be less than of the total number of employer in the sector what will the minister do to ensure that everyone work in the social care sector get at least the minimum wage 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise this issue on which we do much for example we make sure that people can anonymously report the underpayment of the national living wage through either his majesty ’s revenue and customs or acas it be really important that we do that we have labour market enforcement undertaking and order and we provide the tool for serious case as of april employer be on labour market enforcement undertaking and employer have be prosecute the message should be loud and clear to employer that if they do not comply with the law we will take action 
 when she plan to publish the smart datum road map 
 my official be co ordinating and lead on the drafting of the road map which will set out the government ’s ambition for future smart datum scheme development across different sector we will publish that very shortly 
 i be delighted to hear that the road map be come very shortly my hon friend will recall that i ask this question just before christmas and he say it would be out in january we be then hop it might be come out in yesterday ’s otherwise excellent budget but it do not other country be come up on the rail and try to overtake we the noise of the approach herd be grow in our ear so can we please move as fast as possible on this 
 my hon friend be right to hold our foot to the fire on this we be press forward and we be determined to get it right not just out quickly he rightly say that i set the ambition to get it out in january and that have put official foot to the fire as well in get it out i sign off the road map yesterday so it should be out very shortly i do not agree that other nation be hot on our heel on this issue as we be way ahead there be billion of call in open banking every month and million be use this every day without even know it we be go to extend those opportunity to energy telecom and crucially small and medium sized enterprise finance make the journey for sme to get business finance far easy 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 last week i travel to abu dhabi for the world trade organisation ministerial conference where i meet counterpart from many country include australia new zealand canada and south africa along with trade representative from the united states european union and the gulf co operation council alongside wto member we negotiate real outcome for the uk and important agreement with our trading partner we deliver for british business through the renewal of the e commerce moratorium a global agreement to avoid taxis on online transaction from email to movie and music build on the momentum from the ministerial conference we will continue to champion free fair open trade at every opportunity recognise its potential to lower cost and increase prosperity both here in the uk and around the world 
 i thank the minister for that statement 
 we be no long constrain by european competition law the german government be provide at least € in support for their steel industry give the very credible plan put forward by my union unite the union to protect job and expand production at the steel plant at port talbot why be the uk government not invest more to create a viable future for our steel 
 i be disappointed that the hon gentleman feel that we have not be invest as much as we should what we have do in port talbot be the big investment that government have ever make in steel we be turn port talbot around it be go to be regenerate we be replace high carbon emit blast furnace with electric arc furnace to help reduce emission which his party and all of we across the house sign up to when we make the commitment to net he may have specific thing he think we can do   on the transition so i can tell he that we have a transition board to help those whose job be not go to be there with electric arc furnace however we have do a significant amount for port talbot 
 may i commend to my right hon friend the recent paper on industrial policy by policy exchange and its conclusion that we should avoid enter a subsidy race and should instead concentrate on broad long term measure support investment right across all industry 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for highlight the policy exchange report and i agree that the uk should not enter a subsidy race with other industrial nation we already have our advanced manufacturing plan which obviously focus on advanced manufacturing and the chancellor be also look at green industry life science creative industry and digital technology those be all area in which we know we can grow as well i have speak about the record level of investment we get into the uk last autumn when the chancellor announce full expensing more than business leader and the cbi say that that be a game changer and the single most transformative thing we could do to fire up the british economy we will continue to be competitive and ensure that we continue to be the country after the usa and china in secure inward investment of course beat our european counterpart 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 last month the secretary of state say at the dispatch box that she could state explicitly that trade talk with canada have not break down however the canadian high commission have since contradict that in writing say that neither negotiation nor technical discussion with respect to any of the outstanding issue have occur since the uk unilaterally break they off on   january mr speaker i just want to know who be tell the truth 
 i be very happy to expand on what i say last time i be at the dispatch box on this topic i repeat that our engagement with canada on trade issue have be extensive across multiple departments cover the free trade agreement cheese quota and rule of origin on   january the uk confirm to canada that we would pause fta talk on the basis that cheese access have be remove and that canada have signal that rule of origin provision would not be extend that be how negotiation work 
 i can tell the hon member that there be a meeting on   february   between the foreign secretary and his canadian counterpart where the cheese issue be discuss and i raise cheese and rule of origin directly with the canadians in abu dhabi last week i must say to the hon member that chase headline base on thing he have be tell by the people with whom we be negotiate be not helpful to achieve the outcome that our business farmer and auto industry want to see 
 that be a lot of word for the secretary of state to use to say that she believe the canadian high commission be correct in the answer that it give 
 may i ask an important question about the propose uk carbon border adjustment mechanism labour very much support the introduction of a uk cbam but we be concerned that the government will do so a year after the eu result in the uk potentially be flood with carbon intensive product originally destine for europe include steel cement and fertiliser do the government recognise that danger if they do what be their plan 
 just on the point if the hon member still want to believe canada before the uk that be his business but we on the conservative benches know who we be work for and we be work for british business

 we thank the right hon gentleman for his work i have take a quick look at the report although it be only issue this morning all the recommendation he make in that report we have either fix or be fix with the assistance of the horizon compensation advisory board we agree with he that we need to bring the compensation scheme in house the glo group litigation order scheme be already be deliver by the department for business and trade we believe that further compensation will flow from our overturning of conviction we will be overturn hundred of conviction through legislation in this house very shortly as quickly as possible and that will provide a flow of hundred of million of pound in compensation for those individual that will be do by the department for business and trade

 the hon gentleman attend the transition board meeting so he know that his question be not really relevant to what he be try to get to the bottom of we provide £ to ensure that steel making continue in port talbot tata make it clear that it be uneconomic and unsustainable to continue with steel making so the support that we have give will ensure that north of job will continue in port talbot and it will support supply chain on top of that £ have be provide to the transition board so that its member include the hon gentleman the union and all the local representative can ensure that local people who need to go through transition get the support that they need without that support there would not be any future steel making at port talbot

 i recommend to the hon lady the report produce by my department on   january   about the benefit of brexit it explain exactly what be happen with the uk economy claim that gdp would have be high when we be outperform our g7 partner be simply not credible she want to take we back to square but that be exactly the reason why people need to stick with the conservative plan 
 i be very encouraged by the secretary of state ’s comment about the free trade deal with israel the uk be a friend of israel and israel be a friend of the uk so what more can we do to increase trade between we more importantly and very regionally how can the secretary of state ensure that northern ireland be very much part of that trade deal so that company in strangford and across northern ireland also feel the benefit

 this week the secretary of state for science innovation and technology make a grovel apology and retract baseless allegation she make against a member of her own advisory body on her personal twitter account allegation that be base on a dodgy dossier produce by a conservative think tank remarkably the damage pay out come from taxpayer money from her department this be a new low for ministerial standard so perhaps the leader of the house can clarify a few thing be the £ pay in damage the total cost bear by the department for science innovation and technology apparently the secretary of state be give appropriate advice but do she follow it or be her accusation against the advice she receive if they be surely she should personally pay the cost 
 will the leader of the house urgently ensure that the secretary of state be accountable to parliament the government can not have it both way if the money be pay by taxpayer because it relate to the secretary of state ’s ministerial responsibility she must come to parliament as a minister and account for that other ministers be tell that their twitter account be matter for they personally do the secretary of state still have the confidence of the leader of the house 
 all we get from yesterday ’s budget be old news brief and leak to the paper before it be give to parliament the next time that the leader of the house cry crocodile tear for the right of this place she could reflect on the government ’s failure to stand by the parliamentary convention that budgets be deliver in the chamber i be sure that she be relieve   that her marginal constituency do not get a namecheck because her colleague be all complain that their namecheck be the kiss of death 
 on the substance the verdict be now in the office for budget responsibility forecast that tax receipt as a proportion of gdp be set to rise to their high level since the world war the resolution foundation say that the big picture have not change taxis be head up and this will be the parliament in modern history in which living standard fall to be low at the end than they be at the start the institute for fiscal studies agree that household be bad off since the last election and no soon have the chancellor sit down than the under secretary of state for energy security and net   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie criticise a key plank of the energy plan on twitter 
 the public ’s verdict be also in a snap poll reveal that in voter think that the government ’s plan be not work the sky news panel of tory voter could not have be more damning voter say that the budget be absolutely farcical another say that the government have no plan and think that the budget be a great vote loser and a waste of time 
 time for they to go 
 say a that be because on the big issue this budget change nothing 
 on taxis for every 5p the government be give they be take 10p in tax rise million more middle income family be pay more and more tax on their earning as they be drag over high tax threshold taxis be go up to their high level in year the government hate it but that be the reality that be the truth of this conservative government on the public finance borrowing have be revise upwards with the chancellor ’s measure in the budget add £ to borrow and debt as a share of gdp at its high since the 1960 borrow to fund tax cut how irresponsible 
 on growth after everything the chancellor announce be take into account growth forecast be revise down from november growth figure would have be even bad be it not for high prediction of net migration the government hate that too but be the truth we be in a recession the economy be small than when the prime minister enter downing street there have be the big fall in living standard since record begin and real income be below what they be at the last election that be the conservative record and it have the prime minister ’s name write all over it 
 finally disgracefully the chancellor make no mention at all of infected blood compensation or horizon scandal redress the slowness in right these wrong be raise here most week the business and trade committee ’s highly critical report out this morning call for a legally bind timetable for deliver redress to sub postmaster and for that to be take completely out of the hand of the post office do the leader of the house agree give everything she have say on both these injustice do she understand the anger that no new money be allocate and no timetable be give for those compensation scheme in yesterday ’s budget be not that omission just another short term cynical act that will store up problem for the next government to sort out as ever it be party before country these be the final act of a desperate die government 
 i start by note that tomorrow be international women ’s day i point out that on most thursdays the primary player in this session be woman and sometimes there be a in the speaker ’s chair it be sometimes note that woman be often the last to speak in meeting that may be true but we be often the to set the right tone and approach politic need more of we and i hope that the spirit of tomorrow will carry into this important political year 
 i turn to what the hon lady say about a female colleague of ours the secretary of state for science innovation and technology the hon lady can no doubt obtain from the department detail of some of the issue that she raise however i remind the house because the hon lady be really probe the character of the secretary of state that when the latter be entitle to a redundancy payment of £ for have be a secretary of state she do not take it but hand it back to the department because that be the right thing to do that speak volume about my right hon friend ’s character and how much she value the fact that we be talk about taxpayer money 
 i see that the hon lady be channel elmer fudd this morning bug may not have be in the chancellor ’s hat but there be support for business large and small help for household tax cut for work people and help for single earner family also the price of fuel at the pump be be hold down through another fuel duty freeze we will ensure that the benefit of that be hand on to the consumer via pumpwatch 
 i will not take any lecture from the labour party on stewardship of public service and get growth into our economy i will take no lecture on tax cutting from a labour party that still have £ of unfunded spending commitment which can only be deliver through tax rise it be the labour party that leave office with a £ black hole in the defence budget and equipment programme it be labour that bring in the fuel duty escalator and be clobber the motorist in wales and london it be the labour party in wales that have cut the nhs budget not once but time that be in contrast to the increase that we have bring in and the further £ announce yesterday labour ’s nhs budget cut be reason why a quarter of the population in wales be on a waiting list 
 i will not take any lecture from labour on council tax which rise by under their administration again in wales it have nearly triple since labour have be in power we have reform welfare to make work pay double the personal allowance cut national insurance and protect livelihood and job through furlough but labour think it be a good use of taxpayer money to give asylum seeker £ a month i will not take any lecture on support those earn the least from a labour party that bring in the 10p rate 
 the hon lady ’s rhetoric on growth and modernise our nation do not match her party ’s agenda to unpick year of trade union reform or tie business in red tape and it do not sit well with its voting record on minimum service level for the british public i will not take any lecture from a party that do the square root of diddly squat for victim of infected blood and the post office on that precise point the hon lady clearly have not read the red book which on page commit we to pay full compensation to victim of the horizon scandal the estimate be in there but it also say that amount will be increase if need 
 this be a tough shift post pandemic and mid war but thank god it be our shift our country have turn a corner and we will get back to our inflation target soon as the new forecast indicate the plan be work and we will stay that course as we must otherwise we will end up back where labour leave we compare with today that be a more workless household more child and more pensioner in absolute poverty few in work youth unemployment at literacy rate trail rather than lead the world and a less spending on the nhs no thank you shadow leader of the house we will stick with the prime minister further business will be announce in the usual way 
 the mayor of greater manchester ’s vanity project of a square mile clean air zone have cost the taxpayer nearly £ it have be support by all labour council in greater manchester and bury will my right hon friend make time for a debate to ensure that the voice of conservative mp who have campaign against this ridiculous project can be hear again and that this tax on hard work people never see the light of day 
 i congratulate my hon friend on lead the charge on this matter there be a legal obligation to comply with emission in the short possible time but we be review that he will know that greater manchester authority have change their tune and be now propose an entirely different approach thank to the campaign that he have run and the support that he have galvanise among his community i congratulate he and encourage he to hold they to account 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 follow the frankly appal behaviour of the labour party leadership to disrupt the snp ’s opposition day debate on   february   interruption obviously they do not like the truth the leader of the house tell the house that she be sympathetic to the idea not only of the snp get another opposition day debate but of take it from the allocation give to the labour party could she update the house on how her thinking have develop on those point 
 far to that on the issue of ministerial responsibility yesterday it be reveal that neither the conservatives branch manager in holyrood nor their energy minister support the government ’s energy policy will the leader of the house confirm whether the principle of collective responsibility in government apply to junior minister if so what advice would she give to any minister who be unable to support such a key plank of government policy either publicly or in any budget vote ahead 
 finally the secretary of state for science innovation and technology have cost the taxpayer £ after falsely accuse an academic of support hamas could we have a debate on the limit of privilege specifically whether it be now the government ’s policy that ministers can say whatever they like outside parliament and be financially indemnify from the consequence by the taxpayer do she consider it the taxpayer ’s job to underwrite financially the conservative party ’s culture war whenever its member overstep the mark 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i have speak to the leader of his party in westminster regard future opposition day debate and he know that we will give more time to the snp i think snp members be badly treat and we will make that right as i have explain i also want to ensure that the procedure committee look at what happen because i do not want minority party to receive more time on the floor of this house and be in any doubt about how those debate will be conduct i understand that mr speaker have write to the procedure committee to ask it to do a quick piece of work and i will announce future opposition day debate for the snp i hope snp members will have confidence in what the procedure committee say 
 the hon gentleman raise particular budget measure we have a balanced budget that be why the chancellor make the decision that he make it be the government ’s budget and the government ’s plan it be rather cheeky of the hon gentleman to lecture we about use of public fund i refer he to what i say early about the secretary of state for science innovation and technology the snp be legendary in this respect indeed i have wrongly assume that the appalling willy wonka experience in glasgow have be lay on by the snp give its high cost poor return and the fact that the police be call however the presence of a bouncy castle put pay to that theory give that bouncy castle have be ban by snp local authority on health and safety ground
