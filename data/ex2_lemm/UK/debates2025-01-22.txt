we do need flexibility in our school if the leader of the opposition have hop off social medium for a while she would have see the amendment put down this morning to achieve that end she say that the bill be not about child protection we have a young child kill who be take out of school by an abuser the bill close that gap that be urgently need we have child who have not go back to school since covid the bill close that gap she can make her point on academy and we can debate academy but to vote against the bill be a disgrace on all conservative members 
 we be grateful to those service personnel not just the crew of the hms somerset who be as the hon gentleman rightly say mobilise on christmas day to respond to the estlink damage but the serviceman and woman who be deploy away from home at christmas for their service we know that they do it to keep the rest of we safe and we be very grateful 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to strengthen the union 
 i be sure everyone across the house would like to join i in pay tribute to the late great denis law a hero to many scot and particularly to football fan the lawman score international goal in appearance for scotland and be the only scot to win the ballon d’or we send our sincere condolence to his family friend and former colleague 
 i also want to wish everyone a very happy burns day for saturday we celebrate with fantastic event in the scotland office this week and i be pleased that so many member from across the house be able to join we i also want to register that it be holocaust memorial day next week on the anniversary we all reaffirm in this house that we will never ever forget 
 an economic plan for change will bring growth and economic opportunity to all part of the country i be proud that in the last month we have bring great british energy to scotland secure the commonwealth game in glasgow launch brand scotland deliver a pay rise for hundred of thousand of scottish worker and increase the state pension through our commitment to the triple lock we promise in our manifesto to end austerity and with £ extra for the scottish government that promise be deliver 
 i associate myself with my right hon friend ’s comment far to what he have just say will he assure i that after year of obstruction from the conservative party this uk labour government will work with our scottish and welsh colleague to deliver the change that the country vote for as part of a whole uk approach 
 unfortunately the previous government leave office with living standard at their low level since the 1950s in contrast we be determined to deliver economic growth and raise living standard in every part of the united kingdom so work people have more money in their pocket i meet the deputy minister regularly to go over joint issue for the government to deliver for the people of scotland 
 surely the good way for they to strengthen the union be for   the uk and scottish government to work together on issue that need press attention such as immigration and demography year ago there be a fresh start initiative today the minister will launch his plan to get graduate from all over the world to come to scotland will the secretary of state encourage the home office to work with the scottish government to achieve that 
 we have reset the relationship with the scottish government i think i spend more time with the deputy minister than the hon gentleman do i suspect he should spend more time with those on his own side discuss issue of interest to the scottish people we be determined to deliver and we will do that in partnership that be what reset the relationship be all about 
 i call the chair of the scottish affairs committee 
 may i thank my right hon friend the secretary of state for help to secure £ of level up fund for the area of drumchapel in my constituency of glasgow west do he agree that give the record settlement that the scottish government have receive from the uk government it be about time that they go ahead and sort out the problem of under provision and overcrowding in drumchapel health centre 
 my hon friend have be a doughty champion for drumchapel and be key at the heart of this labour government to get that funding across the line the health service in scotland be in crisis which be only make clear by the minister take personal control of it in of our fellow scot be on nhs waiting list the record settlement of £ to end austerity in scotland need to be spend on the frontline in place such as drumchapel health centre 
 the secretary of state have speak eloquently about his effort to strengthen the union between our nation what then be he do to fix the problem that the windsor framework and the protocol be cause with import seed and ware potato from scotland into northern ireland that be not strengthen our union 
 this government be fix the foundation of our economy and reset our relationship not just with the devolved administration but with our partner across the european union i would hope that all party would want to come together to make sure that happen 
 what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on support for the farming industry in scotland 
 the secretary of state meet the deputy minister on a regular basis and the inter ministerial group for environment food and rural affair convene regularly to discuss important issue include   agriculture i be personally look forward to speak at the national farmers union scotland conference in february alongside scottish government ministers 
 we have be work hard to positively reset relation with the scottish government the recent budget see scotland receive an above population share for agriculture and ringfencing of the budget be remove to respect the devolution settlement 
 i look forward to hear the minister at the nufs dinner what conversation have she have with the scottish government and the treasury on the agricultural property relief reform and their impact on tenant farmer my understanding from answer to the question i have ask be that they do not have the same opportunity to ameliorate the apr change as other do and it feel like that cohort have be completely forget by the government can we urgently review that if that be indeed the case 
 these reform still provide a very significant level of tax relief with the £ of combined business and agriculture asset continue to receive relief in most case additional asset will still receive relief at a rate of the budget be design to protect the payslip of work people while raise record funding for public service in scotland the hon lady should outline where she think that money should come from if she think that the wealthy landowner should not be pay more tax 
 inheritance tax be a necessary tax that view be tacitly share by conservative members give that they do not lift a finger to abolish it when they be in power do ministers agree that tax the most valuable farm estate at half the rate that other inheritance tax payer pay be an essential step to enable record spending on sustainable farming and to deliver record high budget settlement for scotland if opposition member disagree they should go back to their constituency this weekend and explain what they would cut rather than wait until halfway through the fiscal year as the scottish government be prone to do 
 i could not agree more with my hon friend opposition members have tell we about how they want to see the benefit of the budget but they be not prepared to support any of the tax raise measure in it this budget secure billion for scotland but the snp vote against that it deliver a pay rise for of the lowest pay scot but the snp vote against that it end tory austerity and the snp vote against that 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i associate myself and the official opposition with the secretary of state ’s comment regard denis law a proud son of aberdeen who never forget his home town indeed his legacy live on through the denis law trust which do such good work with young people in and around the city 
 this saturday the national farmers union of scotland be plan a national day of action in protest at the pernicious ill thought through and destructive change    to agricultural property relief and its threat to the future of family farm in scotland i will be attend the local rally in aberdeenshire to show my and my party ’s support of our farmer i notice that the edinburgh rally be take place but a few mile from the secretary of state ’s own constituency in ingliston do the minister know whether he will be attend the rally 
 we be in ongoing discussion with the national farmers union of scotland as i have say i be proactively attend its conference next month i be slightly surprised to hear the shadow secretary of state talk about the change in the budget and not welcome their announcement or indeed their implication such as the international monetary fund and the oecd both predict that britain will be europe ’s fast grow economy in the come year the uk be the only g7 economy apart from the us to have have its growth forecast upgrade by the imf for this year it have also go ahead of germany china and india to become the most attractive company for global investment trail only the us accord to pwc ’s annual survey if he want to talk about 
 minister please i call the shadow secretary of state 
 of course we do not agree with the policy in the budget the policy be purely wrong farmer be not consult on it indeed they be mislead by the labour party when they be tell that this would not happen it will lead to the demise of the family farm and undermine our food security as farmer will simply stop farm the concern worry and fear that these change have work on scotland ’s farmer be real and be on these ministers and their government if the secretary of state will not attend the rally this weekend will he and the minister at least use their position as scotland ’s man and woman at the cabinet table to urge their colleague to do as the nfu ask which be to stop reset reflect properly engage and consult on an alternative approach to stop this change 
 as the hon member be perfectly aware the majority of estate will not be affect we be in ongoing conversation with the national farmers union of scotland we have ask it to come forward with some work example of estate that may be impact it have not do so yet of course we will continue with our ongoing conversation but the majority of estate will not be affect 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help promote scotland internationally 
 promote scotland internationally be of my priority brand scotland be the scotland office ’s programme of international trade and investment promotion be about sell scotland to the world we have be to norway singapore and malaysia and we plan to be in the us in april this be an initiative for the whole of government we work closely with department for business and trade and foreign commonwealth   and development office colleague in particular additionally i have meet many foreign ambassador and high commissioner in the past few month this week i have host member of the diplomatic corps at dover house to discuss scotland ’s offer to the world 
 tech company such as calnex in my constituency export around the world include to the us and south east asia on his recent visit to south east asia in november what representation do the secretary of state make to promote brand scotland specifically in the tech sector and will he join i on a visit to calnex to hear about the vital work that it do to support digital infrastructure 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for consistently raise the interest of her constituent in this house and for the manner in which she do so technology be a key theme of my recent visit to malaysia and singapore i have productive meeting with ministers from both government and major company in the region to discuss how scotland can share its world lead technological expertise with both country i encourage calnex to engage with the scotland office and the national wealth fund if my hon friend write to i we can make the relevant introduction to the company 
 when president trump visit scotland during his presidency i be task with officially welcome he the detail of that will appear in my memoir but while we may disagree with president trump on many specific issue it be clear that he have a deep affection for scotland due to the birth of his mother on the isle of lewis and his huge investment in scottish golf at turnberry and in the north east so what will the secretary of state do to encourage economic benefit during the trump presidency 
 the president do have a deep affection for scotland i be sure that he also have a deep affection for the right hon gentleman which i hope will appear in his memoir i be sure that there will be some rare unsigned copy for people to buy when they be publish 
 the prime minister have be clear along with the foreign secretary who have meet president trump and have be work very closely with the transition team that scotland be a key marketplace for the usa it be not in anybody ’s interest here in the united kingdom or indeed in america for tariff to be put on scottish good we be work very closely with both the government here and the government in america to ensure that do not happen 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the make work pay initiative on worker in scotland 
 our plan for change will benefit worker in scotland more than most more than worker in scotland on hour contract could benefit from the employment rights bill the bill will have significant   benefit for worker in insecure and low pay job and central scotland be area where those worker will stand to benefit the most 
 in the low pay commission estimate that approximately employee who live in glasgow be pay at or below the relevant minimum wage—4.8 of all employee live in the city what assessment have the minister make of the impact of the government ’s make work pay initiative for those worker and other in scotland 
 the increase in the national minimum wage be deliver on our commitment from day in government that work should always pay modernise the uk labour market include through extra pay and secure job be at the heart of rebuild our economy and will help we to achieve our plan for long term national renewal and growth in addition to the more than worker in glasgow my hon friend mention national minimum wage increase will benefit worker across scotland with more than in dundee in the highland and in the scottish borders set to benefit to name just a few 
 the government ’s employment rights bill will increase cost on small and medium sized enterprise by £ a year it will make it easy to strike and easy for employee to sue their employer combine with the tax rise announce in the budget be it not inevitable that this labour government will increase unemployment 
 the hon gentleman might not be aware that unemployment actually come down in scotland this week we promise that there would be no return to austerity and worker payslip across scotland be indeed protect in the budget more than half of employee will see either a cut or no change in their national insurance bill the small business and charity be protect and our decision to increase employer national insurance will raise more than £ to help to rebuild britain 
 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for energy security and net on support for the green energy sector in scotland 
 i be in regular contact with ministerial colleague from the department for energy security and net on a range of issue relevant to clean energy production in scotland scotland be key to the uk government ’s clean power by mission which will deliver cheap bill energy security and future job and drive growth in the scottish economy 
 the roll out of offshore renewable in scotland should happen alongside the growth of supply chain there that be vital if the energy transition be to deliver job and investment in scotland ’s oil and gas community it be welcome that the government have allocate £ to a clean industry bonus but that fall short of the £ that labour pledge in its manifesto how do the government plan to strengthen the clean industry bonus to build thrive renewable manufacturing in the uk 
 it be a very good question because our clean power by mission will ensure that the government can deliver that gb energy have be set up to look at supply chain and all the other issue around how we do so i hope that gb energy will be able to look at some of those issue in the round but the key thing be to ensure that we have the supply chain infrastructure to be able to deliver that mission 
 order can member who be just roam around the chamber remember that there be other people here and have a little more courtesy 
 if the grangemouth refinery close in and the recommendation of project willow will not be ready for year to come thousand of job will be lose the very definition of an unjust transition how can the government possibly claim to have a credible industrial strategy for scotland if they allow that to happen 
 the closure of the grangemouth refinery be regrettable my hon friend need to reflect on the fact that the previous government and the scottish government have year combine to do something about grangemouth and do not lift a finger since we come into government in july we have get the £ falkirk and grangemouth growth deal over the line and deliver some short term help for the worker at grangemouth we continue to work with the company and the trade union on the grangemouth refinery we look forward to project willow come to fruition this month and the government be fully commit to ensure that we see that through 
 we come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s remark about denis law whom i have the pleasure of interview more than once in my previous career 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment to energy security as well as to green energy and net this week it have be report that the scottish government could fund up to £ to both mingyang to build a wind turbine factory in the highland and orient cable to provide the undersea cable and connection for offshore wind give that those be both chinese own company have the uk government and the secretary of state have any discussion with the scottish government to ensure that there be mitigate step such as ensure local control and not use cellular module and have the security service be consult 
 a key question and of the topic agenda item that we always have with the scottish government be how we can deliver clean power by because obviously it be a joint endeavour the chancellor be in china last month and we will work with china when it be in our national interest to do so of the key point be that great british energy will be look in the round at supply chain and at how we can deliver that mission by but the hon member will be as surprised as i be that the snp vote against gb energy and indeed the record budget settlement in scotland 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on scotland 
 gb energy be own by the public and headquarter in aberdeen because scotland will be at the forefront of the uk become the clean energy superpower that it want to be by gb energy ’s activity will support and enhance the delivery of priority supply chain and infrastructure development help to speed up the exist scottish offshore wind pipeline and other clean energy project 
 year ago nicola sturgeon promise a publicly own energy company but after spend £ on consultant the scottish government have now drop the plan do the secretary of state agree that while labour plough ahead with deliver gb energy own by the british people and headquarter in scotland it be the snp who be break their promise and let down scotland our union and the protection of our planet 
 i congratulate my hon friend on   be the new mission champion for clean energy he   be absolutely right while the snp make promise it break this labour government be determined to deliver for scotland maybe that be why snp mps in this house vote against gb energy we be deliver for scotland we promise gb energy that have be deliver we promise to end austerity that have be deliver we promise to make work pay that have be deliver while the snp only deliver manage decline for scotland we be get on with improve the economy 
 there be no clear plan for great british energy but there be very clear plan to end new licence for oil and gas in the north sea gary smith of the gmb have say that stop new licence be the employment equivalent of a grangemouth refinery close nearly every week from to when will the secretary of state stand up for scotland oppose the secretary of state for energy security and net protect job and ensure that we do not have more import with high emission 
 gb energy be there with the national wealth fund to deliver that just transition in clean power by oil and gas in the north sea will be here for decade to come and i ask the right hon gentleman to work with we to deliver that just transition rather than scaremongere the worker of the north east 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 despite mighty work by conservative members of the other place sadly the great british energy bill continue to make progress through the house of lords to remind you mr speaker the chairman of great british energy be base in manchester but lead a company headquarter in aberdeen in committee in october it be claim that gb energy would directly   employ people by november that have fall to people what be the figure what be those job where will they be base and what on earth will gb energy actually do 
 i be surprised that the shadow secretary of state be champion the line of the snp gb energy be headquarter in scotland in fact it be headquarter in the region that he represent in scotland it be capitalise with £ and it will bring valuable job to his constituency i suspect he might want to go back to   his constituent this weekend and explain why he do not want those new job and industry of the future in his constituency 
 what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for work and pensions on the adequacy of government support for woman pensioner in scotland 
 what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for work and pensions on the adequacy of government support for woman pensioner in scotland 
 the labour government ’s choice to protect the pension triple lock mean that million of woman pensioner will see their yearly pension rise by up to £ in april and by up to £ over this parliament that stand in stark contrast to the conservative party who cut the state pension of over scot the conservatives be still in chaos announce policy on the hoof that would mean a raid on pension pot meanwhile this labour government be take tough decision and action to clean up the tories economic mess 
 do the minister and the secretary of state agree with labour msp that waspi woman deserve compensation 
 i appreciate that campaigner be disappoint but the hon lady have get herself in a bit of a fankle and be elide separate issue a decision about the legality of the change and the question of compensation the ombudsman ’s finding show that the vast majority of waspi woman know that the state pension age be change it be therefore difficult to justify up to £ for a compensation scheme and conclude that that be a fair proportionate and good value for money use of public fund 
 will member please look at where the question be come from not do so be disrespectful and not the way we should be carry on i be talk about senior member who should know well here be a good example of a new member i call ann davy 
 thank you mr llefarydd in the then secretary of state call for a vote on redress for 1950 bear woman urge the uk government to get on the front foot and offer serious compensation to those affect but woman in scotland and wales have   see the same broken promise from labour the now minister of wales pledge in that a labour government would right that injustice with the secretary of state the welsh minister and labour politician across these isle turn their back on 1950s woman in scotland wales and elsewhere why should those woman ever again believe a word they say 
 i be afraid that another hon member be in a bit of a fankle the question about the legality of the change have be settle by the court the question that the hon lady and her ally must answer be why they think that up to £ of public money should be spend on compensation be that proportionate fair feasible and value for money the government ’s view be that it be not 
 do the minister agree that alongside the triple lock the most important thing for woman pensioner in scotland be fix our nhs and that the snp government must act urgently to ensure that vulnerable scot do not face what even the snp health secretary have describe as unacceptable wait for treatment 
 i could not agree more scotland ’s nhs be in crisis in scot be on a waiting list the uk government have provide a record investment to fix scotland ’s public service the scottish government lead by the snp should get on with it 
 the most common problem raise with i by woman pensioner be as my hon friend   the member for stirling and strathallan chris kane   say the enormous waiting list researcher from oxford university strathclyde university and edinburgh university have predict that by the time the snp leave office almost a scot will be on waiting list how can we ensure that the billion provide in the labour budget do not go down the same drain as everything else give to the snp 
 in scot be on a waiting list today and we face a housing emergency and a very stubborn attainment gap nobody could look around scotland and say that it be go in the right direction that be the choice that people will have to make in be scotland go in the right or wrong direction canny scots will i be sure make choice in the interest of their family and say that it be time to replace a fail snp government 
 rise 
 hurray 
 i welcome that welcome from the labour benches 
 the minister campaign on compensation for waspi woman as the secretary of state for scotland do so will she tell i if she will not listen to the woman and if she will not listen to the ombudsman will she listen to scottish labour msps who call for compensation 
 there be a member in a dreadful fankle we say at the election that we would wait for the ombudsman ’s report we would examine it and we would take a view we have a take view we have take a view that up to £ of public money should not be spend provide compensation on a decision that be legal and of which it have be conclude that the vast majority of 1950 bear woman be aware 
 the secretary of state recently react to labour ’s dip in the poll in scotland by say that the voter do n’t like honesty i wonder if it be more to do with labour not keep its commitment to woman pensioner or say that it would decrease fuel bill and they go up or say that it would tackle child poverty and then take on some of the most regressive tory policy on the child cap as we approach burns night i wonder if the bard be right when he say 
 dare to be honest and fear no labour 
 nowadays would he say dare to be honest and fear the voter 
 poll come poll go the fact remain that this labour government have provide record investment for scottish public service i suggest the hon member invest in a notepad so that he can keep track 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday january 
 the senseless barbaric murder of young girl in southport be devastating a measure of justice have be do but for the victim the injure and the affected we must see a fundamental change in how britain protect its citizen and its child as part of the public inquiry we will not let any institution deflect from its failure 
 next monday mark holocaust memorial day visit auschwitz last week only strengthen my resolve to build a national holocaust memorial and learn centre beside this parliament 
 the whole house will welcome the release of emily damari and other hostage from gaza we must now see the ceasefire deal implement in full the release of the remain hostage and a surge in aid into gaza for citizen 
 may i also welcome cheryl korbel whose young daughter olivia be murder in awful circumstance and her sister antonia to the chamber i have meet they twice and we will change the law so that the most serious offender attend their sentencing hearing 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in the house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 before christmas i receive nearly handwritten letter from pupil at st peter ’s secondary school in exeter each letter strongly advocate for great support to tackle the mental health challenge   face by young people with many share deeply unsettling personal story i be committed to improve local mental health service to help young people build the resilience they need to live happy and healthy life however i know these challenge be not unique to my constituency and be be face by child across our country so can the prime minister please outline what step his government be take to enhance mental health support for our child nationwide 
 i thank the hon member for raise an issue of huge concern in his constituency and in all constituency far too many young people be not receive the care that they need so we will provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school recruit an additional staff to deal with child ’s and adult mental health service and roll out our young futures hub in every community 
 my right hon and learn friend will understand the importance of farming to the economy of my constituency of penrith and solway and to cumbria as a whole with recent report of foot and mouth outbreak in germany and concern be express over transmission to the united kingdom will the prime minister assure the house that all departments be on high alert and vigilant in monitor the situation particularly at place of entry include airport where meat import control can be lax we must avoid the disaster that this would bring to uk farming 
 we will do whatever it take to protect farmer from the risk pose by foot and mouth that be why we act swiftly to ban import of cattle pig and sheep and their product from germany to protect farmer we will not hesitate to restrict import from additional country if the disease spread and we will keep the situation under close and careful review 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 may i take this opportunity to welcome the release of hostage include emily damari from barbaric captivity i also know that the thought of many will be with the victim of the southport killing there be important question to answer and i will return to those after the case be conclude 
 between and the oecd find that child in england rise up global league table in math reading and science conservative government action mean that english school now top the western world at math and reading but the prime minister ’s children ’s wellbeing and schools bill which will be vote on in committee this week reverse the improvement that make that happen the bill be an act of vandalism it be wreck a cross party consensus that last for decade why do the prime minister think that so many school leader be criticise the bill 
 it be labour that introduce academy in the place to drive up standard academy be here to stay and will continue to drive up standard that be what the bill be about also in that bill be important provision for protect child include a provision to stop abuser take child   out of school and a unique identifier to ensure that the whereabouts of all child be know what do the leader of the opposition do she instruct conservative members to vote against those measure 
 the right hon and learn gentleman do not even bother vote on that bill he talk about safeguard measure but that be not what the issue be this be about the reform that he be change we have an example of where those reform be not introduce wales which have be under labour control for decade welsh educational outcome have tumble down international league table and poor child in england now do well than wealthy child in wales the bill deny child the guarantee that their fail school will be turn into a well academy it be an attack on excellence it be an attack on high standard and it be an attack on aspiration the bill be the bad of socialism be it not deprive child in england who will pay the price 
 as i say we introduce academy we be committed to they and we be drive standard up the bill be important because it also set up breakfast club for the very child that the right hon lady claim to champion it limit the expense of school uniform and put in place vital protection for child she have to answer the question why do she instruct all of they to vote against child protection measure 
 the prime minister think that he can distract people from what be wrong with the bill this be not about breakfast club and school uniform teacher and parent will be horrify at just how bad this bill be even his own mps may not realise it but the bill will cut teacher pay it cut pay for teacher his education secretary say that there be not a ceiling for pay—[interruption labour member be all shake their head they clearly have not read the bill the education secretary have not read the bill either because clause mean that teacher pay will be cap do the prime minister know that the bill as it stand will cut teacher pay 
 we do need flexibility in our school if the leader of the opposition have hop off social medium for a while she would have see the amendment put down this morning to achieve that end.[official report   january vol c. 2wc correction she say that the bill be not about child protection we have a young child kill who be take out of school by an abuser the bill close that gap that be urgently need we have child who have not go back to school since covid the bill close that gap she can make her point on academy and we can debate academy but to vote against the bill be a disgrace on all conservative members 
 that be nonsense the amendment that the prime minister be talk about do not address the issue he raise academy and that be exactly what i be talk about like every parent i believe that all our child should have the good teacher apart from the issue of cut teacher pay the head of year at michaela the most successful school in the country come from the armed force the headmistress of that school have say that with labour ’s new rule she would 
 never have be able to hire he 
 those be the academy freedom that i be talk about the bill would have block that veteran from teach the bill imply that doctor be not sufficiently qualified to teach biology and that an olympic medallist can not teach pe why be the prime minister close down route into teaching when we should be open up more of they 
 the leader of the opposition know that that be not right interruption no it be not look at the provision in the bill to say that teacher in our school ought to be qualified should not be extraordinary or opposed under the conservatives watch we have far too many example of secondary school miss teacher when we need math teacher they champion math we do not have enough math teacher in our secondary school i want every single child to have the good possible education 
 the fact speak for themselves standard go up under conservative government what we need to know be who be benefit everyone be ask who be benefit from these change it be not teacher their pay be be cap it be not parent their choice be be restrict it be definitely not child their outcome will get bad so who be benefit it be the trade union the national education union send out a tick list prove that after a decade and a half it be finally get its way why be the education secretary allow trade union to run her department and ruin child ’s education 
 the bill benefit the child who need the nourishment of a breakfast club the bill benefit the family who can not afford uniform the bill benefit the child who be currently out of school and nobody know where they be the bill will benefit the child who could be take out of school by abuser be it not to go through the leader of the opposition should change her mind and support these vital provision 
 the prime minister need to get out more and speak to school i be at the harris academy just this month and what be it say the bill reverse decade of progress it be impose labour ’s new curriculum on every school tax the education of child with special need and exclude talented outsider the closed shop be back this be pure educational vandalism alongside those attack labour be remove single word ofsted judgment so that parent can not see standard slip it be the same old labour bad outcome for all child excellence for none 
 i know what it be like to go to a school that do not care about standard this be a tragedy in the making the key change in the bill be not in labour ’s election manifesto be that not because the prime minister know that parent and teacher would reject they 
 parent and teacher know that we introduce academy parent and teacher know that we be drive by standard we be commit to standard they be part of the future and we will continue to focus on they 
 the leader of the opposition talk about special need she have get a nerve i do n’t know conservative member know it they have ask i at prime minister ’s   question about the appalling situation of special need under their watch we be go to fix that mess like we be fix every other mess 
 parent should feel confident that when their child be sick they can take they to their local hospital to be treat as soon as possible but last year when my son be have difficulty breathe like many parent i could not take he to the alexandra hospital in redditch as paediatric service be temporarily close in and have never be reinstate as part of this government ’s record investment in our nhs will the prime minister meet i to explore way to enable local integrate care board to reinstate critical service for grow town like redditch 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue which i know he have campaign on for a very long time we be invest a record £ in the nhs as part of our plan for change build an nhs fit for the future mean that place like redditch will see low waiting list and service that reflect need while responsibility over service rest with the appropriate nhs commissioner i will ensure that he get a meeting with the relevant minister 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i echo the prime minister ’s opening remark about the southport killing and holocaust memorial day and i particularly join he in express our immense relief at the release of emily damari and in celebrate that she be back with her mum mandy and the rest of her family let we hope that all the hostage be release as soon as possible and that the ceasefire turn into a last peace 
 last week i urge the prime minister to speed up the social care commission to implement the change that people need this year the very next day it be announce that the chair of the social care commission be also go to chair another important inquiry into groom gang the prime minister say that the job of chair the commission be so enormous that it can not be complete within year yet he also say the chair of that commission baroness casey have enough free time over the next few month to chair another inquiry how can both those thing be true 
 baroness casey be well place   to conduct the audit into groom gang give her hard hit report on exploitation in rotherham that do not affect her work on the independent commission on adult social care which begin in april as the right hon gentleman know the part of that commission will report next year so that we can deliver recommendation as we receive they already we be introduce fair pay agreement provide more money for social care funding and put up the allowance we be already take step there will be a part report and we will act on the recommendation as they arrive but this need to be do properly

 across england student attend non academise form college of those college be currently on strike because the government do not settle the funding for they last summer can the prime minister tell i whether he intend to create a tier education system for form student who be victim of the covid crisis

 from stafford to eccleshall and loggerheads my constituent be sick and tired of have their property and business devastate   by flooding the last conservative government do not invest enough in flood prevention measure to stop this happening can the prime minister assure i and my constituent that he will prioritise flood prevention investment before the home and business on sandon road in stafford disappear completely into sandyford brook 
 my sympathy go to my hon friend ’s constituent far too many be experience terrible flooding i visit stafford last year and they talk i through the misery of their experience we inherit flood defence in their bad condition on record we be now invest £ in flood defence to well protect community and we have commit £ to support farmer impact by extreme weather 
 year mortgage have hit borrowing be billion of pound above forecast and retail sale have slump do the prime minister still believe that the chancellor be do a good job 
 i think the hon lady be just read out the last government ’s record 
 before the last election the conservatives baselessly promise a fully fund scheme to deliver a new watford hospital something they fail to achieve in year do the prime minister share my frustration and that of my constituent that the conservative unforgivably fail to budget for its construction watford will only get its new hospital build and pay for thank to the properly plan approach of this labour government 
 i be not surprised that my hon friend ’s constituent be frustrate there be never a plan the funding only ever exist in boris johnson ’s imagination it be pure fiction and the conservatives know it we have an affordable delivery plan to build these new hospital include watford general and we will be get on with it 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if he will make a statement on the position of the chairman of the competition and markets authority 
 follow the resignation of the chair of the competition and markets authority marcus bokkerink the secretary of state have appoint doug gurr as the interim chair for a period of up to month while our new permanent chair be appoint the secretary of state have express his gratitude for marcus ’s leadership of the board of the cma since his appointment in september and for the work of the cma in that time particularly in response to cost of living pressure 
 as the prime minister set out in his speech at the international investment summit this government will ensure that every regulator in the uk focus on growth give doug gurr ’s background and experience as an entrepreneur and business leader and his clear under standing of the importance of new and develop technology such as artificial intelligence he will bring the necessary strategic leadership to the cma to enable it to promote growth for the benefit of business and consumer as set out in the industrial strategy green paper the government will shortly be consult on a new growth focus strategic steer for the cma while respect the independence of the cma and the decision making of its panel member the steer will be clear about the government ’s expectation of the cma in support growth across the economy 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 thank you for grant this important urgent question mr speaker 
 what a desperate state we be in when the business secretary have to phone up the regulator to beg they for idea to fix the lack of growth that his own government ’s policy have create i hope that when the regulator attend the roundtable last week include the chairman of the cma they have the courage to put at the top of their list scrap the business secretary ’s page job destroy and trade union inspire employment rights bill or to point out the job tax in the chancellor ’s budget labour ’s socialist attack on inheritance and non dom and the family business death tax that be cause wealth creator to leave this country every minute or even to point out that of the good opportunity that this country have for growth would be to get on a plane to our close trading partner the united states and secure a trade deal rather than lob juvenile insult at president trump or fail to invite elon musk to the government ’s uk investment summit 
 it be certainly the case that while regulator have a role they generally depress growth and drive risk aversion bureaucracy and slow decision making ask regulator   to boost growth be a bit like ask the village speed watch to organise the next british grand prix i be a fan of speed watch 
 the conservative party be under new management and we be unafraid to back wealth creator and risk taker we be unashamed to say that we need few civil servant and arm ’s length regulator so that our business carry less dead weight in the global race to be competitive but dismiss the non executive part time chair of the cma seem a curious place to start he be not responsible for day to day decision making at the cma that be the job of the chief executive do they aim and miss can the minister confirm whether there be plan to change the government ’s view on the cma ’s remit to play the ball and not the man what evaluation have there be of all regulator as part of this process and when will the government publish it 
 i think there be a couple of question in there about the role of the cma chair of course he do not get sack he resign a new strategic steer for the cma will be come out in due course the hon gentleman ’s tirade of criticism of this government be a bit rich come from a man who be in the treasury when the last government crash the economy i would point out that pwc announce only this week that we be the most attractive country in the world to invest in and that the international monetary fund last week upgrade our growth prediction for this year we be go to be the highest grow major economy in europe this year and that show our determination to get the growth go which be something that his government fail completely on 
 get the right regulatory environment be vital to drive innovation in our economy and also to protect our consumer and market do the minister agree that this renew focus on the regulatory environment and get it right to drive our economy will make sure that this government deliver our no mission of growth 
 my hon friend be absolutely right growth be the no mission for this government and get the balance right between protect consumer and drive up growth in the economy mean that we all benefit that be something we be very clear about on this side of the house and something that the last government fail to deliver on 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the government be right to say that bold and ambitious step be need to get our economy grow again especially after the damage cause by the previous conservative government but we must also recognise that fair competition be the lifeblood of our market economy which help to drive innovation and ensure that economic benefit reach consumer do the minister agree that ensure proper competition in the economy be vital to achieve sustained growth i also note that the new interim chair ’s prior experience include run amazon ’s uk business will the minister guarantee that the digital market unit within the cma will be back to hold powerful tech giant accountable for the benefit of customer in wokingham and across the uk 
 we be absolutely clear that we need to protect consumer but we also need to drive growth the new interim chair ’s experience will be really important in help we to understand how the tech company will move forward and his chairmanship of the alan turing institute give he valuable experience to bring to the table in deliver on that 
 i should declare an interest have work for a competition regulator for a number of year before enter parliament i suggest that the minister do not take any competition policy lesson from the conservatives who oversee the re monopolisation of the broadband network the consolidation of power within tech network on an unprecedented scale and the rise of crony capitalism on a scale not see before some rumour around this appointment have suggest that it be a signal of a flight away from competition regulation can i urge he to quash those rumour and confirm that this government believe that competition drive investment innovation and growth and that this country be open for investment and new market entry by as many company as possible 
 we absolutely agree that competition be vital for drive investment and growth the cma will remain operationally independent as it always have be 
 the government seem fascinate by the price of oasis ticket meanwhile debt and the cost of debt be soar should the government definitely not maybe come up with some idea of their own for growth rather than try to copy the homework of regulator 
 we have our own idea for growth we have important planning reform come forward and the industrial strategy which drive forward the strength of the uk economy as for the hon gentleman ’s oasis pun i think he need to work a bit hard on that 
 have spend year deal with the cma in my campaign to end the abuse of the secondary ticketing market i have long feel that the cma be in desperate need of much strong and clear ministerial oversight can the minister confirm today which minister will have oversight of the cma and that it will be an active role not a role in name only 
 i thank my hon friend for her work on secondary ticketing a subject on which there be currently a consultation i be the minister responsible for the cma a new strategic steer for the cma will be issue later this year and of course it will remain independent from government 
 the clear issue here be why the previous chair resign and what remit the minister have give the interim chair to change the policy and direction of the cma can the minister outline that remit for the house he say he will do it later this year but he have manoeuvre a position in which the previous chair have resign we need to know what the cma will be do now to regulate the market 
 the cma ’s operational independence will remain intact we have clearly set out that there will be a new strategic steer which will be about boost growth after conversation we have decide that new leadership be need to deliver on that 
 i should declare that before enter the house i advise as a competition lawyer on various cma matter include investigation and panel some of the criticism from conservative members seem half a world away to channel oasis from both the topic in question and economic reality will the minister confirm that yesterday ’s announcement do not change the independence of the individual cma panel that deal with matter before the cma 
 i can confirm that the cma ’s operational independence remain intact 
 the power vest in large corporation be great than ever tech giant be exert monopolistic power over the market so i be become exasperate with the government ’s thatcherite like attitude towards deregulation do the government understand the risk involve in go for short term boost to growth over long term stability of the economic market 
 i would not accept the hon gentleman ’s characterisation at all and i be sure that conservative members would not either we announce only this morning that we will take action against amazon on knife sale so i do not think the characterisation that we be in the pocket of big tech be at all accurate 
 the cma take far too long to reach a decision on the vodafone and merger this slow down the roll out of g across all our constituency and be a drag on growth how can regulator be push to ensure that their decision lead to growth 
 my hon friend be right that we need to give the business community confidence that decision will be make quickly to provide certainty so that it can move forward with investment for the benefit of the whole economy 
 what will be the impact on growth of a record number of millionaire have leave the uk since the budget 
 that be a very interesting question i be not sure that the cma ’s role be to monitor the number of millionaire leave the country 
 in after the cma block a particular merger the last conservative chancellor   the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt say that it must understand their wide responsibility he also say 
 i do think it ’ important all our regulator understand their wide responsibility for economic growth 
 he be right be he not 
 yes he be right that be the message that the prime minister send out to the regulator at the investment summit and it be why they have be invite    in to give their idea on growth we do not think that ask regulator how they be go to stimulate growth be a problem that be the no mission of this government and everyone should be sign up to deliver on it 
 i call llinos medi 
 diolch llefarydd the government say that the cma ’s chair have fail to convince they that he be sufficiently focus on growth but at the same time report suggest that the government plan to freeze all rail spending except for on project in england a lack of transport funding be stifle growth in the welsh economy to prove his commitment to growth will the minister outline the transport fund that his government have commit to wales 
 i thank the hon lady for her question unfortunately transport funding particularly in wales be well outside the cma ’s remit 
 do my hon friend agree that the uk ’s economic regulator have a responsibility to ensure supersonic growth in our economy with a pro business approach and that this be part of what i would term a responsibility agenda we all have a responsibility to ensure the good for our economy and those regulator do as well 
 my hon friend be absolutely right we all need to be sign up to this agenda which be absolutely critical for deliver on our aim of get a well grow economy get more money into people ’s pocket deliver on the promise we have make and change the tune after the last year of decline 
 change personnel be thing but when we speak to business we hear that resolve dispute and the way in which the cma do so be key could i urge the minister to look at how dispute be resolve and whether litigation and an antagonistic approach to business be the good way for the cma to proceed 
 that be a very fair comment we need to give business certainty and clarity that thing will be resolve quickly so that they have the confidence to make investment decision 
 how do the department plan to appoint the permanent chair 
 the appointment of the permanent chair will take place in the normal manner as all other appointment do 
 an active regulator be essential to secure fair price for consumer resident of area such as mine be often at the forefront of rise in petrol price and resident of pontardawe be regularly leave wonder why they have to pay 8p more per litre than people in   nearby town will the government commit to launch the pumpwatch petrol price comparison platform as recommend by the competition and markets authority 
 that be a very important point consumer see the petrol price every time they leave their home in their motor vehicle there be a disparity there that sometimes need explanation and certainly need transparency so i will take that issue up on the hon gentleman ’s behalf and will come back to he on it 
 my constituent particularly those live in crookfur have terrible mobile phone signal how can the cma progress the merger between and vodafone so that we   get the investment in transmitter that we need to improve the mobile phone signal in crookfur and around the country 
 that be certainly something that the cma have be deal with and i be sure that we will be able to provide my hon friend with an update shortly 
 will the minister ask the competition and markets authority to investigate why we have the high energy price in the world particularly for electricity 
 i will certainly pass that request on that might be something that ofgem would also have an interest in 
 i thank the minister for his response so far do he agree that the duty of the competition and markets authority be to ensure that regulation be follow and to break up monopoly at a time when our small business be suffer the national insurance increase have not help if the cma take decision that just so happen to have the by product of stimulate economic growth that be well but the narrative that take away regulation will promote growth be wrong 
 it might be worth the hon member put in for an adjournment debate 
 i thank the hon member for her question it be important that consumer and small business operate on a level playing field it be also correct that we be very keen to see more growth deliver we think that will benefit everyone in the economy but i take the point that a balance have to be strike 
 rise 
 mr grady i think you have ask a question interruption i think the whip need to be advise you a bit more 
 i thank the minister for his answer the role of the cma chair be essential in the current economic climate as we watch how our ally in the usa approach their trading and their deal we need a message of strength we need to relay the fact that we be ready and open for international business   do the minister believe that this interim measure send that message and how quickly can we get the right person in place to promote our business stand 
 we be really serious about growth this be about send the message that we want to make sure that britain be open for investment and that we will work with partner across the world to encourage investment and get the growth that we want for the benefit of the entire economy this be just part of the plan 
 with permission i wish to make a statement on the uk ’s response to recent russian maritime activity interruption i be glad that the house wait for this statement 
 a foreign vessel yantar be in the north sea have pass through british water let i be clear it be a russian spy ship use for gather intelligence and map the uk ’s critical underwater infrastructure yantar enter the uk exclusive economic zone about mile off the british coast on monday for the past day the royal navy have deploy hms somerset and hms tyne to monitor the vessel every minute in our water and i have change the royal navy ’s rule of engagement so that our warship can get close and well track yantar 
 so far the ship have comply with international rule of navigation but this be the time that yantar have enter our water in recent month in november the ship be also closely watch and be detect loitering over uk critical undersea infrastructure to deter any potential threat i take measure step at that time as part of a clear direct response to the russian vessel royal air force maritime patrol aircraft alongside hms cattistock hms tyne and royal fleet auxiliary proteus be deploy to shadow yantar ’s every movement today i also confirm to the house that i authorise a royal navy submarine to surface close to yantar strictly as a deterrent measure to make it clear that we have be covertly monitor its every move the ship then leave uk water without further loitering and sail down to the mediterranean 
 as colleague will understand i will not comment far for reason of operational security however i thank all the personnel involve for their dedication and professionalism i also want president putin to hear this message we see you we know what you be do and we will not shy away from robust action to protect this country with our nato ally we be strengthen our response to ensure that russian ship and aircraft can not operate in secrecy near the uk or near nato territory 
 this activity be another example of grow russian aggression target our ally abroad and we at home the head of mi6 and the cia recently make a joint statement say that russia be wag a reckless campaign of sabotage across europe we be see periodic incursion of russian military aircraft into airspace for which we be responsible and on christmas day the estlink undersea cable between finland and estonia be damage many analyst believe that that be cause by a vessel in russia ’s shadow fleet 
 russia be dangerous but fundamentally weak in ukraine it have suffer devastatingly high rate of casualty over year in a war it think it would win in a week compound the humiliation putin have be force to turn to north korea to reinforce its frontline fighter while the strategic defeat in syria have expose russia ’s diminish power on the global stage at home the russian economy face crippling strain 
 nevertheless russia remain the most pressing and immediate threat to britain and i want to assure the house and the british people that any threat will be meet with strength and resolve we be deliver on the foundation of security in our plan for change by make britain secure at home yantar have now pass through the dover strait and be in dutch water in september raf typhoons scramble to intercept russian bear f aircraft operate near the uk the royal fleet auxiliary service be also play an indispensable role in safeguard offshore infrastructure with its multi role ocean surveillance ship rfa proteus 
 secondly we be make britain strong abroad work with nato and joint expeditionary force ally the uk activate nordic warden with jef partner after the estlink cable damage the operation be track potential threat to undersea infrastructure monitor the movement of the russian shadow fleet and send out real time warning of suspicious activity to jef ally and to nato today i can confirm that the raf will provide p-8 poseidon and rivet joint surveillance aircraft to join the new baltic sentry nato deployment to protect critical infrastructure in the baltic sea 
 thirdly with ally we be pile the pressure on putin this year the uk will provide more financial aid in military support to ukraine than at any time since the full scale invasion begin £ to deliver military support enhance training and strengthen industrial collaboration the uk be also lead the way in find way to put pressure on the russian economy include sanction more than ship in the russian shadow fleet which be more than any other nation work with other country to stop the russian military acquire the good equipment and technology it require to continue its fight and war against ukraine and with ally expose the activity of the russian intelligence service expel russian intelligence officer and sanction individual responsible for hostile activity against the uk 
 russian aggression will not be tolerate at home or in ukraine that be why of the act of this government be for the prime minister to launch the strategic defence review why the government have increase defence spending next year by almost £ and why we will set a path to increase defence spending to of gdp in the spring this new era of threat demand a new era for defence change be essential not optional and the government be determined to meet the challenge and determine to deliver for defence we will protect the homeland and our critical national infrastructure and we will make britain secure at home and strong abroad 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for early sight of his statement i be particularly grateful to he for the great level of transparency he have choose to show to the house on the grey zone threat from russia we welcome that transparency because it be critical for our war readiness as a nation that as far as we be able and without compromise our national and operational security   we tell the british public the truth about the serious nature of the russian threat and what that will inevitably mean for public expenditure on defence 
 i specifically welcome the change to the royal navy ’s rule of engagement that send a powerful signal to putin that we will not be intimidate and that if his aim be to keep push the boundary of malign activity in our water and those proximate to we we will respond i confirm that the government will have the full backing of his majesty ’s opposition in do so we stand shoulder to shoulder with the government on ukraine and we stand shoulder to shoulder with they on deter the wide russian threat that he have outline today 
 i appreciate that it be unusual to go into such operational detail include about the operational deployment of submarine equally we appreciate that this be about send the strong possible signal to our adversary about our clear intent to protect and defend our homeland if i may i have a number of specific question about the statement and its particular content 
 a key issue here be the safety and protection of critical undersea infrastructure beyond the operation the secretary of state mention in his speech such as nordic warden will he confirm whether he be look to widen the number of international partner proactively involve in address the threat to the north sea and the baltic what discussion be he have to drive an internationally co ordinated response include through nato 
 give our prominent role within nato we have a clear opportunity to lead the way in develop cutting edge underwater technology that address those threat directly will the secretary of state confirm that he be prioritise development of underwater capability such as uncrewed system through pillar of aukus and also with european ally and in particular that research and development investment into capability to protect critical infrastructure will be an urgent priority moreover will he commit to do everything possible to hinder the ability of gru operative include all possible action in concert with ally to restrict their ability to enter the united kingdom 
 i be very grateful to the personnel of our navy the royal fleet auxiliary and our air force involve in address the threat i sincerely thank they as well as the crew of ally vessel who assist in track the ship through their water i have particularly important point the secretary of state say that russia be dangerous but fundamentally weak do he nevertheless agree that russia ’s willingness to tolerate such enormous loss on the battlefield against ukraine underline that in conventional military term it remain a formidable foe before even consider its unconventional capability 
 in my view russia remain a critical threat to the united kingdom for that reason i very much welcome the secretary of state ’s clear decision to be more open with the country about the threat we face i urge he to ensure that from the heart of government we have a serious grip on communicating and planning for the fact that we face the most serious nation on nation military threat to our homeland for generation in turn that mean that the strategic defence review need to be fundamentally threat drive prioritise homeland defence and put the necessary resource in place 
 to conclude do the fact that we have see the rfa the royal navy submarine helicopter p-8 aircraft and other asset involve in track russian activity   not show the full extent of the work need to defend our island and deter our adversary and ultimately why we need to increase defence spending as soon as possible the secretary of state say in his statement as he do at oral question i welcome that that the sdr will report in the spring i urge he to ensure that that be in march at the very early opportunity and that we will achieve at least spending on defence this parliament 
 i thank the shadow defence secretary for welcome the statement and the government ’s great transparency he like i have confirm that he see russia as the most critical threat to the uk he have be a defence minister and he understand as he acknowledge the importance of send the strong possible signal to our adversary that be the underlying reason for the decision i have take to make this statement today 
 the shadow secretary of state argue that our response provide the uk with an opportunity to demonstrate leadership within nato i think we have already do that not by assert our argument but by our action launch and lead through the jef nation the nordic warden response to the attack on estlink and now by confirm that we will play a lead role in the new nato deployment in the baltic which be link to the work that we be do through nordic warden 
 the shadow secretary of state ask about the priority for our undersea cable for our homeland infrastructure these cable be not simply a technical network they be the infrastructure for the thing on which we depend for our daily life the operation of the internet the supply of energy and communication with other part of the world he will therefore have see and note in the term of reference of the strategic defence review launch by the prime minister within week of the government be elect in july that defend and reinforce the homeland defence of britain be foremost in those term of reference we will as i have say report on the strategic defence review in the spring 
 rise 
 member be bob who be not in the chamber at the start of the debate we have make a note of all their name and the time that they arrive and they will not be call to speak if they do not know whether that mean they they should speak to their whip i call the chair of the defence committee 
 i thank my right hon friend the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement it be very apt that he should be make this statement because during our defence committee visit to raf lossiemouth in scotland last week we discuss this very issue clearly there be great need for wide availability and capacity for royal navy and other maritime capability to meet the rise russian activity in water surround the uk i refer for example to the threat to critical undersea infrastructure 
 i have question for the secretary of state what lesson have the government learn from the finnish investigation into eagle s which be accuse   of damage the undersea infrastructure between finland and estonia secondly what measure be available to the government to stop vessel from traverse uk water to build on the recent insurance check that be put in place in october be sanction vessel our only option 
 i thank the chair and the member of the defence committee not just for the work that they be do but for the work that they be willing to do outside this house i thank they for the visit that they pay to lossiemouth to see for themselves some of the essential work that our force personnel and civilian be do in defend this country he ask about the finnish investigation into the estlink cable damage that be for the finns to complete and to confirm the finding of their investigation it will be at that point that we can draw out and discuss any lesson that there might be for the uk 
 we defend more fiercely than perhaps any other nation in the world the freedom of navigation in our sea ship of all state may navigate through our territorial water they be subject to the right of innocent passage and so some of the step that the chair of the defence committee might urge the government to take be simply not available to we under the united nations law of the open sea it be for that reason that we take the step and action that i have report to the house to make sure that we monitor we watch and we track so that those who might enter our water with malign intent or try to undertake any malign activity know that we see they and know that they will face the strong possible response 
 it be also important for front benchers to arrive on time to hear the opening statement i believe that the liberal democrat spokesperson be minute late and it be important for they to know that they may not be call in the future but on this occasion i do invite the hon lady to speak 
 thank you madam deputy speaker and apology for my lateness 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of the statement it go without say that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the government in our support for their action against the russian threat we also thank all the service personnel involve in deal with this threat 
 the liberal democrats believe that our defence policy and conventional force should be focus on defend british territory and play a lead role in our immediate european neighbourhood as such we welcome the government ’s announcement that the royal airforce will provide p-8 poseidon and rivet joint maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft to join baltic sentry under nato command 
 action to defend the realm be particularly press in light of recent escalation of hybrid threat from russia the suspect sabotage of undersea cable include the damage to estlink-2 on christmas day underscore the urgency of this moment such cable be the life blood of international connectivity and commerce and any attack on they be an attack on the collective stability of europe 
 the event involve the tanker eagle s and its link to sanction entity support putin ’s war machine be deeply alarming this be not an isolated incident but part of a broad pattern of aggression that demand robust and co ordinated action this government must rebuild trust with our european neighbour the uk ’s national interest and security have always be inextricably tie to that of europe from the world war through to the cold war and the current war in ukraine our share defence have be vital 
 to that end we urge the government to work hand in glove with nato country to support ukraine during the war and the rebuilding afterwards include find lawful way to use the $ of frozen russian state asset as reparation sign a comprehensive security treaty with the european union to strengthen collaborative defence and collaborate on develop cutting edge defence technology and ensure inter operability with nato ally to respond effectively in time of crisis 
 we also face serious national vulnerability the uk lack land base anti ballistic missile system to protect critical national infrastructure question remain about the ability to secure the greenland uk gap 
 we welcome the government ’s commitment to spend of gdp on defence but when will they outline a clear timeline for achieve that this be not the time for complacency the threat be clear and the response must be decisive 
 madam deputy speaker i have some sympathy with   the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire perhaps she like i think that there would be more interest in this house in the operation of the competition and markets authority than the length of the urgent question prove be the case it may just be that i can run a little fast than she 
 it give a whole new meaning to run to the defence 
 but madam deputy speaker i thank the liberal democrat spokesperson for her support for the uk contribution to the baltic sentry nato operation we play a lead role in nato and we will play a lead role in this operation in the baltic it reinforce our ally and by do that we reinforce our own defence and strengthen collectively the deterrence that we can as nato nation offer to any future aggression and aggressive intent from president putin
