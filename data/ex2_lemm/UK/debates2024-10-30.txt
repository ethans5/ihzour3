 what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for business and trade on the potential impact of the government ’s new industrial strategy on worker and business in scotland 
 the crisis that we inherit from the previous government be not just fiscal but industrial because neither the previous government nor the snp have any proper industrial strategy for scotland our industrial strategy will deliver certainty and stability which business need in order to invest in the high growth sector that will drive long term sustainable economic growth well pay job be at the heart of our modern industrial strategy which be complement by our plan to make work pay our strategy be clear as a government we be pro business and pro worker 
 the new industrial strategy   identify creative industry as a key sector for uk growth my constituency be a popular setting for film and tv production include the lockerbie film and outlander as well as host the pyramid studio as film and tv make an increasingly important contribution to my constituency ’s economy what step be the government take to support investment in the creative industry in my constituency 
 my hon friend mention outlander which be film in bathgate and linlithgow as well as the lockerbie bombing film star colin firth the film damage be in production there it star samuel l. jackson i hope he do a few leaflet for she while he be in her constituency the creative industry be a jewel in scotland and the uk ’s crown and there be the independent film tax credit announce early this week by my right hon friend the secretary of state for culture media and sport film with distinct homegrown content and talent meet the criterion for that new relief production eligible for the tax break must have a uk writer or director or be certify as an official uk co production that show that this government be determined to back our creative industry and to continue to grow our film and tv industry 
 do the secretary of state share my anger and disappointment that the snp scottish government dogmatically continue to block new nuclear development in scotland deprive my constituency of important job and economic prospect what can   he do through the industrial strategy to ensure that we at least take advantage of decommissioning and supply chain opportunity 
 i have never know the right hon gentleman to be angry or disappointed but i share his anger and disappointment this government back our industry nuclear will be a major part of the energy mix go forward and we need to ensure that we have the right balance gb energy have be set up and the relate bill pass reading yesterday i be disappointed that neither he nor the snp vote for it but that be the vehicle through which we will take these issue forward 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on support economic growth in scotland 
 i welcome my hon friend to his place the budget which will be announce by my right hon friend the chancellor shortly will herald a new era of investment and growth in scotland in our day we announce the headquarters of gb energy in aberdeen launch the national wealth fund and announce the big upgrade of worker right in a generation 
 newcastle under lyme be home to many people who leave scotland to build a life such as my constituent lee bernadette walford can the secretary of state outline how reset the relationship between the uk and scottish governments be important for economic growth up and down our united kingdom 
 we do not agree with the scottish government on everything or indeed very much at all but scot expect we to work together to produce result and that be what we have try to do yesterday i have my regular meeting with the deputy minister and this morning i speak to the finance secretary ahead of the budget economic growth be a key area and i be delighted to highlight share work on energy our bring the commonwealth game to glasgow and the jointly fund £ package for the falkirk and grangemouth growth deal our long- term economic strategy require the government to work together the prime minister and the minister have be clear that that be what we be determine   to do 
 the secretary of state boast of a £ investment fund only to contradict himself bizarrely and say that no such figure exist be this scottish schrödinger ’s funding be it perhaps the levelling up fund refer to by my hon friend   the member for dundee central chris law 
 i be surprised that the hon gentleman be keen to ask a question give that he do not apply for in the shuffle nor do any other snp member it be also surprising that he with all his experience in the   house want to spend his time in this new parliament defend the previous tory government ’s reckless gamble with the economy 
 order i do not know whether the chair of the select committee be stand or not do you want to come in on this question 
 yes thank you mr speaker do my right hon friend the secretary of state agree that the drumchapel levelling up fund bid and the project that would follow from that would be a good way to promote the economic and social growth of the area 
 my hon friend have be a doughty campaigner for the drumchapel project she will not have long to wait as the chancellor will come to the dispatch box shortly and announce the budget i be hopeful that all these project include some of the anti poverty project that my hon friend have champion for year in her constituency come to pass 
 when it come to promote economic growth in scotland it be clear that the good way to do that be from within this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland what be the minister do to make that happen and to convince my snp colleague sit in front of i of the good way forward 
 the good way to keep the united kingdom together be to make sure that this be a successful uk labour government and that be what we be determined to do may i point the hon gentleman to the row in front of he there be snp mp leave and we   have scottish labour mp that be how we protect the union 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the secretary of state say at the weekend that the labour budget 
 will herald an era of growth for scotland 
 but what be go to grow be it the tax burden on hard work scot the number of pensioner choose between heating and eat because they have not get their winter fuel payment or the number of labour break promise or will we get all this afternoon 
 the hon gentleman have a opportunity to apologise for the conservative party crash the economy and the dreadful £ black hole that we inherit which be hide from the office for budget responsibility i ask the shadow secretary of state to reflect on that before he ask his question of course he will not have long to wait to find out as the chancellor will be here shortly 
 there be no answer in that response not so long ago the secretary of state say that a national insurance rise would have an enormous impact on business he also say that 
 under labour national insurance would not go up 
 tax rise economic damage and broken promise be this labour government not just the same as the snp 
 i think the shadow secretary of state be just describe his previous government 
 what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for business and trade on support employment right in scotland 
 my hon friend will know that the house recently give the employment rights bill its reading shamefully the conservative party oppose the bill which be the big upgrade to worker right in a generation the government be take a join up and collaborative approach to the delivery of the plan to make work pay which have be develop with business and trade union we be committed to continue that approach through consultation on the plan ’s implementation to ensure that the change we be make work well for both employee and business 
 i be sure the whole house will join i in congratulate my hon friend   the member for high peak jon pearce   on the birth of his daughter connie hon member hear hear as my hon friend enjoy his paternity leave i be sure the minister will be familiar with the dad shift campaign which seek to increase paternity leave for more father will he support that campaign so that more father can enjoy paternity leave in addition to the ten of thousand the government have already open it up to and do he agree that that be a huge contrast with the conservative party ’s spend its time talk about get rid of maternity leave 
 i send our congratulation to my hon friend   the member for high peak jon pearce   on the birth of his daughter and i agree with what my hon friend   the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall   say that be why we be make immediate change to paternity leave through the employment rights bill we be make paternity leave available from day in a new job and enable it to be take after share parental leave i pay tribute to my hon friend for his vigorous campaigning on this issue i be sure that like i he be delighted to vote for the big upgrade to worker right in a generation which the conservative party shamefully oppose 
   of the criticism of the employment legislation that be be bring in be that it deliver we into the hand of the trade union baron do the secretary of state agree that we be indeed in the iron grip of the baron since he be unable to attend an event in his own office last night because he would not cross a picket line 
 we will take absolutely no lesson on employment right from the conservative party which leave we with a £ black hole in the public finance that we be have to pick up my right hon friend the chancellor will address that in a moment 
 i join   the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall   in congratulate   the hon member for high   peak jon pearce   on the birth of his daughter on the demographic challenge just before the election the scottish labour deputy leader say 
 there be something we can do to incentivise 
 more people to come to scotland in term of employment in scotland have the secretary of state and colleague sit down with the home office to discuss encourage more migration 
 the government will work closely with the migration advisory committee we welcome the contribution that migrant make to the economy but we will take no lesson from a party that have consistently say that the positive destination for people in scotland be a hour contract and whose member sit on their hand last night when we deal with the great british energy bill 
 let i try to challenge the hon member in a spirit of collegiality the uk government have commit to work with the scottish government   the hon member for na h eileanan an iar torcuil crichton who be in his place have say 
 when it come to immigration policy size do not fit all it should not be beyond we to devise way to attract more people to work and settle here 
 will the minister confirm that the scottish and uk government should work together and will he commit to a meeting between the government so that we can take forward the idea of more migration to scotland which the labour party commit to and we commit to and business be cry out for 
 we have commit to scottish representation on the migration advisory committee which would go a long way to deal with these issue but it be for the scottish government to do thing like build house in area where we need more migration in order to encourage people to come to live in scotland 
 whether he have have discussion with the scottish government on the criterion for assess the potential impact of planning application for offshore wind near unesco world heritage site 
 scotland be rightly proud of its world heritage site as the hon gentleman will appreciate responsibility for planning decision for large scale energy project   in scotland rest with scottish government ministers the uk government work closely with the scottish government to deliver for scotland while respect devolution i meet regularly with my scottish government counterpart on these issue 
 i call gregory campbell 
 i thank—[interruption i thank the secretary of state for his reply in any discussion he have will he take account of the fact that i have write to unesco about the potential for a huge offshore wind farm very close to the giant ’s causeway and the unesco world heritage site there the communities   minister in northern ireland have also meet unesco will the secretary of state make representation to ensure that all consideration be take account of so that people know the problem that may compromise that world heritage site 
 i be glad that the hon member have not lose any of his popularity in the house it would be inappropriate for i to comment on planning decision for large scale energy project in scotland as it be a devolved responsibility i recognise the importance of consider the protection of local asset when develop renewable project particularly at cherish world heritage site 
 i wish to remind the house that follow the horrendous terrible incident in southport on   july a suspect be await trial have be charge with multiple offence that mean that the house ’s sub judice resolution be engage and reference should not be make to the case i know that all hon member wish to see justice do in this case it be therefore paramount that nothing be say in this house that could potentially prejudice a proper trial or lead to it be abandon 
 i know it can be frustrating when we see report in the medium of matter that we be not free to discuss here but that arise from parliament ’s constitutional relationship with the court more importantly at the heart of this case be young girl we all want justice to be do for they and their family and for other injure in and affect by this appalling incident speculation about the case include comment make in this house could seriously risk prejudice proceeding i know that none of we would ever wish to do that therefore it would be wrong of i to exercise a waiver in this case member should not refer to it or risk prejudice it 
 i understand that member have legitimate question about the circumstance surround this case no doubt they will want ministers to commit to come to the house and answer those question once the legal proceeding have conclude i give my assurance that i will ensure ample opportunity to do so my understanding be that the trial be expect to start in january if member have question about the operation of and the decision on the sub judice resolution they can speak to the clerks and the speaker ’s counsel in the meantime our thought be with the family and friend of bebe elsie and alice and all those who be injure and affect on that horrendous day 
 the prime minister be ask 
 before i call the prime minister i would like to mark the fact that this be the last time that   the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak   will appear at the dispatch box during prime minister ’s question although he have a bit more to do afterwards he have speak at the dispatch boxes as chancellor of the exchequer prime minister and leader of the opposition after today we all look forward to his continued contribution from the back benches we wish he and his family well in their future endeavour i thank he personally for our work relationship

 as you just mention mr speaker this be our last exchange across the dispatch boxes so i want to take this opportunity to thank the leader of the opposition for his service we have have political disagreement and ideological difference and we have argue at some length but i want to thank he for his hard work commitment and decency in everything he have do i too wish he and his family the very good for whatever the future may hold for they 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i will have further such meeting later today 
 i would like to associate myself with the remark make by the prime minister cumbernauld in my constituency be promise an elective and diagnostic treatment centre by the scottish government in this have continue to be delay and be now allege to be mothball what assurance can the prime minister give i that any barnett consequential from today ’s budget will be use to benefit my constituent and not be hold on to by the scottish government 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i be sorry to hear about the delay affect her constituent the party opposite oversaw year of mismanagement and chaos and the impact on the scottish nhs be evident this labour government be    commit to deliver for the scottish people include make sure that we have an nhs fit for the future the chancellor will set out the detail in just a few moment 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 mr speaker thank you for your kind word and indeed i thank the prime minister for his kind word no prime minister look forward to pmq but i always do like this pre budget it be for a change nice not to be the main event but just the warm up act 
 as you say mr speaker today be my last appearance at pmq i be happy to confirm report that i will now be spend more time in the great place on earth where the scenery be worthy of a movie set and everyone be a character that ’ right mr speaker if anyone need i i will be in yorkshire as an adopt yorkshireman i be particularly look forward to do the coast to coast walk that run through my constituency and many other since we have make significant progress with the campaign to make it a national   trail and natural england be close to conclude its work can i ask the prime minister to ensure that the   coast to coast walk do indeed become britain ’s great national trail and in preparation for my return to the back benches will he meet with i to discuss it 
 mr speaker i think the right hon gentleman be about to ask i to join he on the walk laughter certainly i will meet he and that be an important point 
 that be very kind of the prime minister i know he be partial to the lake district but perhaps we can tempt he over to our end as well 
 yorkshire be famous not just for its walk but for be home to some of england ’s great cricketer sadly no be go to put i on that list but who know i now have a lot more time to practise cricket have the power to bring people from all community together and give they fantastic opportunity as   be show so powerfully by andrew flintoff ’s recent documentary we lead the world in female participation and that will stand we in good stead when we host the woman ’s world cup in and when cricket become an olympic sport in can i therefore ask the prime minister to continue government support for the england and wales cricket board ’s new initiative to get cricket into vastly more state school foster a whole new generation of cricketer for we all to cheer on at every level 
 yes be the answer to that question that point be a really important we celebrate cricket and it do bring community together but it be also really important for child and young people to enjoy lot of different sport it give they a confidence that they might not otherwise have and the ability to work in a team and it teach they about skill like leadership so i be fully supportive 
 our predecessor sir tony blair and lord hague have repeatedly come together and powerfully argue in their joint report that it be vital for the future prosperity of britain ’s economy society and   public service for we to be a world leader in technology and innovation the prime minister and i may not yet be at our joint report write stage but in a similar spirit of cross party agreement could i ask he to find his inner tech bro and continue to support emerge british tech business and establish our country as the home of ai growth and innovation 
 yes and that be a really important point last year the leader of the opposition hold a summit on ai which be very important we have be bring together the leader in ai we have a huge advantage in this country be rank in the top in the world ai will have huge potential for our growth and our public service and i think that the whole house should be fully supportive of it 
 the prime minister have the immense privilege of be prime minister of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland northern ireland be a special part of our union but that need particular care attention and respect have a strong function assembly at stormont be good for the people of northern ireland and good for our union which be why i be so pleased to see government restore there early this year and i be grateful to the prime minister for his support with that can he assure the house that he will continue to work to keep stormont open deliver for the northern irish people and strengthen northern ireland ’s place in our union 
 yes again that be a very important point and it be that matter to i personally i work for year in northern ireland on some of the proposal under the good friday agreement in particular the transformation of the royal ulster constabulary into the police service of northern ireland i work with both community there for those year that be very important to i and it have a huge impact on i so i care deeply about northern ireland i absolutely agree that the institution of government need to be up and run and i want to give all the support i can to further development in northern ireland 
 as prime minister the right hon and learn gentleman will be acutely aware of the threat that our united kingdom face from an axis of authoritarian state iran north korea russia and china in particular i be proud of the way in which this house have unite in stand up to russian aggression in ukraine and i know that we will never waver in our commitment to the ukrainian cause i will always be grateful for the support that the prime minister give i when we be the country to send ukraine western battle tank and long range missile and the to offer security assurance to kyiv in the light of the threat that we face may i urge he always to maintain the strength of the transatlantic alliance and to ensure that nato remain the bedrock of western security with the united kingdom play a lead role 
 yes nato be in my view as important today as it be on the day on which it be create in the light of the challenge that we face it be a labour government who be the proud co founder of nato and we repeatedly say that we support nato to the hilt 
 finally may i point out that tomorrow be diwali i become leader of my party during diwali and i now stand down during that same festival i be proud to have be the british asian prime minister but i be even proud that it be not that big a deal that speak volume about the value of the british people of our country and of this parliament will the prime minister join i in applaud the kindness decency and tolerance that have always be the british way 
 yes and i mean it when i say that we be all proud to see the right hon gentleman stand there as prime minister represent our diverse country we be all proud i think everyone in the house be i thank he for that and for his last question as leader of the opposition although give the speed with which his party go through leader he may be back here before too long in the meantime i be sure that he will be a great champion for the people of richmond 
 finally i be sure that the right hon gentleman will not mind my disclosing to the house the content of a letter that he write to i this week my answer to it be clear yes i will arrange for he to meet the relevant minister about the a66 which run through his constituency 
 in hackney nearly child who could fill primary school be in temporary accommodation in many case outside london that be bad for their future opportunity and it be rip our community apart i welcome the government ’s pledge to build new home but will the prime minister ensure that those who can not have a roof over their head be a top priority in that long queue for new housing 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue it be a source of national shame that there be just under household on a social housing waiting list include i think in hackney the good way to tackle overcrowding and meet housing need be to build the home this country need and that be why we will deliver home over this parliament the chancellor will set out further detail in just a moment 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 thank you mr speaker may i associate myself with your remark and those of the prime minister about   the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak and thank he for his service i wish he and the whole country a happy diwali despite our political difference i have always feel a certain kinship with he since the general election when he be the only other party leader to get as wet as i do laughter i be look forward to debate the budget with he and the chancellor shortly but may i wish he and his family all the good for the future 
 next month ’s summit in baku be a chance for the uk to regain world leadership on climate change a role disastrously lose under the conservative as this be the final summit before country must ratchet up their new   paris agreement target for will the prime minister take this opportunity to seize back world leadership on climate change by commit today to support the target set out this week by the independent climate change committee and publish a programme to deliver on they 
 we will seize that initiative we have reset on the international stage and climate be of the big challenge that we face i will be go to the conference this year just as i go last year as leader of the opposition to continue those discussion about how we reach the very important target that we must reach 
 i thank the prime minister for his reply i hope we really can take that world leadership back again 
 another issue on which the uk need to show urgent leadership be the escalate war in sudan ten of thousand of people have be kill and sudanese have have to flee from their home the report of mass killing and horrify sexual violence against woman be truly stomach churning when the uk take over the presidency of the un security council this friday will the prime minister make it a priority to secure a new resolution on prevent future atrocity include a no fly zone to stop the iranian drone

 madam deputy speaker on   july the country vote for change this government be give a mandate to restore stability to our economy and to begin a decade of national renewal to fix the foundation and deliver change through responsible leadership in the national interest that be our task and i know that we can achieve it

 this be not the time that it have fall to the labour party to rebuild britain in it be the labour party that rebuild our country out of the rubble of the world war in it be the labour party that rebuild britain with the white heat of technology and in it be the labour party that rebuild our school and our hospital today it fall to this labour party to this labour government to rebuild britain once again and while this be the budget in more than year to be deliver by a labour chancellor it be the budget in our country ’s history to be deliver by a woman i be deeply proud to be britain ’s ever female chancellor of the exchequer to girl and young woman everywhere i say let there be no ceiling on your ambition your hope and your dream along with the pride that i feel stand here today there be also a responsibility to pass on a fairer society and a strong economy to the next generation of woman 
 madam deputy speaker the conservative party fail our country its austerity break our national health service its brexit deal harm british business and its mini budget leave family pay the price with high mortgage the british people have inherit the conservative party ’s failure a black hole in the public finance public service on their knee a decade of low growth and the bad parliament on record for living standard 
 let i begin with the public finance in july i expose a £ black hole at the heart of the previous government ’s plan a series of promise that they make but have no money to deliver cover up from the british people and cover up from this house the treasury ’s reserve set aside for genuine emergency be spend time over just month into the financial year today on top of the detailed document that i provide to the house in july the government be publish a line by line breakdown of the £ black hole that we inherit which show hundred of unfunded pressure on the public finance this year and into the future too 
 the office for budget responsibility have publish its own review of the circumstance around the spring budget forecast it say that the previous government 
 do not provide the obr with all the information to they 
 and that have the obr know about these 
 undisclosed spending pressure that have since come to light 
 then its spring budget forecast for spending would have be materially different 
 let i be clear that mean that any comparison between today ’s forecast and the obr ’s march forecast be false because the previous government hide the reality of their public spending plan yet at the very same budget they make another £ worth of cut to national insurance it be the height of irresponsibility and they know it they have run out of road and they call an election to avoid make difficult choice so let i make this promise to the british people never again will we allow a government to play fast and loose with the public finance and never again will we allow a government to hide the true state of our public finance from our independent forecaster that be why i can   today confirm that we will implement in full the recommendation from the independent office for budget responsibility ’s review 
 the country have inherit not just break public finance but break public service the british people can see and feel that in their everyday life nhs waiting list at record level child in portacabin as school roof crumble train that do not arrive river fill with polluted waste prison overflow crime that be not investigate and criminal who be not punish that be the country ’s inheritance from the conservative government they have no plan to improve our public service and they have no plan to put our public finance on a sustainable footing quite the opposite 
 since there have be no detailed plan for departmental spending set out beyond this year and the previous government ’s plan rely on a baseline for spend this year which we now know be wrong because it do not take into account the £ black hole they also fail to budget for cost that they know would materialise include funding for vital compensation scheme for victim of terrible injustices—[interruption

 the leadership campaign for the conservative party have now be go on for over month but in all that time there have be not single apology for what they do to our country the conservative party have not change but this be a change labour party and we will restore stability to our country once again the scale and seriousness of the situation that we have inherit can not be underestimate together the hole in our public finance this year which recur every year the compensation scheme that the previous government do not fund and their failure to assess the scale of the challenge face our public service mean that this budget raise taxis by £ any chancellor stand here today would have to face this reality and any responsible chancellor would take action that be why today i be restore stability to our public finance and rebuild our public service

 before i come to tax it be vital that we be drive efficiency and reduce wasteful spending in july to begin deal with our inheritance i make £ of saving this year today we be set a productivity efficiency and saving target for all departments to meet next year by use technology more effectively and join up service across government as set out in our manifesto i will shortly be appoint our covid corruption commissioner they will lead our work to uncover those company that use a national emergency to line their own pocket because that money belong in our public service and taxpayer want it back i can confirm today that david goldstone have be appoint chair of the new office for value for money to help we realise the benefit from every pound of public spending 
 today i be also take step to ensure that welfare spending be more sustainable we inherit the last government ’s plan to reform the work capability assessment we will deliver those saving as part of our fundamental reform to the health and disability benefit system that my right hon friend the work and pensions secretary will bring forward

 before a government can consider any change to a tax rate or threshold they must ensure that people pay what they already owe we will invest to modernise his majesty ’s revenue and customs system use the very good technology and recruit additional hmrc compliance and debt staff we will clamp down on the umbrella company that exploit worker increase the interest rate on unpaid tax debt to ensure that people pay on time and go after the promoter of tax avoidance scheme those measure to reduce the tax gap raise £ by the end of the forecast and i thank the exchequer secretary to the treasury for his outstanding work on that agenda 
 i know that for work people up and down our country family finance be stretch and pay cheque do not go as far as they once do so today i be take step to support people with the cost of living it be the labour government who introduce the national minimum wage in that have a transformative impact on the life of work people as promise in our manifesto we ask the low pay commission to take account of the cost of live for the time i   can confirm that we will accept the commission ’s recommendation to increase the national living wage by to £ an hour worth up to £ a year for a full time worker and for the time we will move towards a single adult rate phase in over time by initially increase the national minimum wage for to year old by as recommend by the low pay commission take it to £ an hour a labour policy to protect work people be deliver by a labour government once again 
 secondly i have hear representation from colleague across this house include my hon friend the members for shipley anna dixon and for scarborough and whitby alison hume and   the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey about the carer ’s allowance and the impact of the current policy on carer who be look to increase the hour that they work carer ’s allowance currently provide up to £ per week to help those with additional caring responsibility today i can confirm that we be increase the weekly earning limit to the equivalent of hour at the national living wage per week the large increase in the carer ’s allowance since it be introduce in that mean that a carer can now earn over £ a year while receive carer ’s allowance allow they to increase their hour where they want to and keep more of their money i be also concerned about the cliff edge in the current system and the issue of overpayment my right hon friend the work and pensions secretary have announce an independent review to look at the issue of overpayment and we will work across the house to develop the right solution 
 thirdly we will provide £ from next year to extend the household support fund and discretionary housing payment to help those face financial hardship with the cost of essential fourthly have hear representation from the joseph rowntree foundation   the trussell trust and other i will reduce the level of debt repayment that can be take from a household ’s universal credit payment each month from to of their standard allowance that mean that of the poor household will keep more of their award each month lift child out of poverty and those who benefit will gain an average of £ a year 
 our plan to make work pay will also protect work people i know that conservative members be deeply interested in our plan have see their colleague repeatedly dismiss at short notice i know that they be worried about their future under   the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch they should rest easy know that our plan will protect work people from unfair dismissal it will safeguard they from bully in the workplace and it will improve their access to paternity and maternity leave i hope the new shadow cabinet will soon be grateful for those increase protection at work

 our manifesto commit to the triple lock mean that spending on the state pension be forecast to rise by over £ by to ensure our pensioner be protect in their retirement that commitment mean that while working age benefit will be uprate in line with cpi at the basic and new state pension will be uprate by in this mean that over pensioner will gain up to £ next year up to £ more than uprating by inflation the pension credit standard minimum guarantee will also rise by from around £ per year to around £ a year for a single pensioner 
 while i have seek to protect work people with measure to reduce the cost of living i have have to take some very difficult decision on tax i want to set out my approach to fuel duty bake into the number that i inherit from the previous government be an assumption that fuel duty will rise in line with the retail price index next year and that the temporary 5p cut will be reverse to retain the 5p cut and to freeze fuel duty again would cost over £ next year at a time when the fiscal position be so difficult i have to be frank with the house that that be a substantial commitment to make i have conclude that in these difficult circumstance while the cost of living remain high and with a backdrop of global uncertainty increase fuel duty next year would be the wrong choice for work people it would mean fuel duty rise by 7p per litre so i have decide today to freeze fuel duty next year and i will maintain the exist 5p cut for another year too there will be no high taxis at the petrol pump next year 
 the last government make cut of £ to employee and self employ national insurance in their final budget those tax cut be not   honest because we now know that they be base on a forecast that the obr say would have be materially different have it know the true extent of the last government ’s cover up since july i have be urge on multiple occasion to reconsider those cut to increase the taxis that work people pay and see in their payslip but i have make an important choice today to keep every single commitment that we make on tax in our manifesto i say to work people i will not increase your national insurance i will not increase your vat and i will not increase your income tax work people will not see high taxis in their payslip as a result of the choice i be make today that be a promise make and a promise fulfil 
 any responsible chancellor would need to make difficult decision today to raise the revenue require to fund our public service and restore economic stability so in today ’s budget i be announce an increase in employer national insurance contribution we will increase the rate of employer national insurance by percentage point to from april and we will reduce the secondary threshold the level at which employer start pay national insurance on each employee ’s salary from £ a year to £ this will raise £ per year by the end of the forecast period i know that this be a difficult choice i do not take this decision lightly we be ask business to contribute more and i know that there will be impact of this measure feel beyond business too as the obr have set out today interruption 
 order our constituent be watch they need to be able to hear the chancellor simmer down 
 in the circumstance i have inherit it be the right choice to make successful business depend on successful school healthy business depend on a healthy nhs and a strong economy depend on strong public finance if the conservative party choose to oppose this choice it be choose more austerity more chaos and more instability that be the choice our country face too 
 as i make this choice i know it be particularly important to protect our small company have hear representation from the federation of small businesses and other i be today increase the employment allowance from £ to £ this mean that employer will not pay any national insurance at all next year and over will pay the same or less than they do previously this will allow a small business to employ the equivalent of full time worker on the national living wage without pay any national insurance on their wage 
 let i now come to capital gain tax we need to drive growth promote entrepreneurship and support wealth creation while raise the revenue require to fund our public service and restore our public finance today we will increase the low rate of capital gain tax from to and the high rate from to while maintain the rate of capital gain tax on residential property at and this mean that the uk will still have the low capital gain tax rate of any european g7 economy 
 alongside these change to the headline rate of capital gain tax we be maintain the lifetime limit for business asset disposal relief at £ to encourage   entrepreneur to invest in their business business asset disposal relief will remain at this year before rise to in april and to from maintain a significant gap compare with the high rate of capital gain tax together the obr say that these measure will raise £ by the end of the forecast 
 in a sign of this government ’s commitment to support growth and entrepreneurship we have already extend the enterprise investment and venture capital trust scheme to and we will continue to work with lead entrepreneur and venture capital firm to ensure that our policy support a positive environment for entrepreneurship in the uk 
 next i turn to inheritance tax only of estate will pay inheritance tax this year i understand the strongly hold desire to pass down saving to child and grandchild so i be take a balanced approach in my package today the previous government freeze inheritance tax threshold until i will extend that freeze for a further year until that mean that the £ of any estate can be inherit tax free rise to £ if the estate include a residence pass to direct descendant and £ when a tax free allowance be pass to a surviving spouse or civil partner 
 secondly we will close the loophole create by the previous government make even big when the lifetime allowance be abolish by bring inherit pension into inheritance tax from april finally we will reform agricultural property relief and business property relief from april the £ of combined business and agricultural asset will continue to attract no inheritance tax at all but for asset over £ inheritance tax will apply with a relief at an effective rate of this will ensure that we continue to protect small family farm with quarter of claim unaffected by these change 
 i can also announce that we will apply a relief in all circumstance on inheritance tax for share on the alternative investment market and other similar market set the effective rate of tax at take together these measure raise over £ by the final year of the forecast 
 next i can confirm that the government will renew the tobacco duty escalator for the remainder of this parliament at rpi+2 increase duty by a further on hand roll tobacco this year and introduce a flat rate duty on all vape liquid from october alongside an additional off increase in tobacco duty to maintain the incentive to give up smoking we will increase the soft drink industry levy to account for inflation since it be introduce as well as increase the duty in line with cpi each year go forward these measure will raise nearly £ per year by the end of the forecast period

 let i update the house on our plan for air passenger duty and i can see the leader of the opposition ’s ear have prick up air passenger duty have not keep up with   inflation in recent year so we be introduce an adjustment mean an increase of no more than £ for an economy class short haul flight but i be take a different approach when it come to private jet increase the rate of air passenger duty by a further that be equivalent to £ per passenger for a private jet to say california laughter 
 let we now turn to our high street business i know that for they a major source of concern be business rate from we intend to introduce permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure property which make up the backbone of our high street across the country and it be our intention that it be pay for by a high multipli for the most valuable property the previous government create a cliff edge next year as temporary relief end so i will today provide relief on business rate for the retail hospitality and leisure industry in up to a cap of £ per business alongside this the small business tax multipli will be freeze next year 
 next i can confirm that alcohol duty rate on non draught product will increase in line with rpi from february next year however nearly third of alcoholic drink sell in pub be serve on draught so today instead of uprate these product in line with inflation i be cut draught duty by 1.7%—[hon member hear hear!”]—which mean a penny off the pint in the pub 
 alongside the change i be make today i be publish a corporate tax road map provide the business certainty call for by the cbi the british chambers of commerce and the institute of directors this confirm our commitment to cap the rate of corporation tax at 25%—the low in the g7 for the duration of this parliament while maintain full expensing and the £ annual investment allowance and keep the current rate of research and development relief to drive innovation
