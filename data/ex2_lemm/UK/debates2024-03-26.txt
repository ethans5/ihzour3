with permission mr deputy speaker i would like to make a statement on the continue work to fix building with unsafe clad across england and the government ’s increase determination to enforce against those who fail to take responsibility 
 since the beginning of there have be a step change in all aspect of remediation in england from a limited programme to full coverage of all residential building over metre from developer not take responsibility to their now be responsible for £ of remediation across more than building from just over building in remediation programme last year to over now from building have start or complete work in february to over now and from only have complete last february to now every month more building be identify and more be begin and complete work that mean that for some albeit not all the end be in sight 
 from the start we have prioritise the remediation of the high risk building per cent of high rise building with the most dangerous grenfell style aluminium composite material cladding have either start or complete work of the occupy building remain will start work this month and enforcement be be take against a further substantial progress can also be see for building over metre with over half of know building have either start or complete work the much more extensive work require for building between metre and metre be well under way since the full launch of the cladding safety scheme last july over building in the scheme have live application grant funding agreement have be complete or be be sign for building and work have start on site for the building a further building be be investigate and where necessary will be invite to apply to the scheme in the month ahead 
 further transparency be be bring to the social housing sector register provider report that work have start on building as of the end of november up from at the end of august a further have now be complete for the time last thursday we publish detailed information on a provider by provider basis which will be update quarterly to ensure that resident can track what their individual provider be do on remediation while many building be be fix or well still have complete remediation there remain a reduce core of building owner who continue to hold up remediation that be unacceptable the government continue to do whatever be necessary to change that 
 all building owner must step up do the right thing and fix their building without delay or face the consequence of their inaction the government be lead the way on enforcement with strategic intervention by our recovery strategy unit target the most egregious actor who be unwilling to make their building safe the rsu be key to force wallace estates to agree to remediation order ensure that leaseholder will be safe in their home our legal action force   grey gr a subsidiary of railpen to fix building safety defect at galbraith house within week the trial against grey gr for vista tower in stevenage be imminent remediation contribution order be take out against further organisation last week include developer to recover fund pay out by both taxpayer and leaseholder to fix building we will continue to take action against those who do not step up to their responsibility 
 colleague in the fire and rescue service and local council be critical to the fight to ensure that resident be safe and we be work with they to increase action many council and fire and rescue service be do a good job but some need to do more over the last year the additional funding that we have provide for council have mean that the pace of enforcement have step up markedly council be inform we of enforcement action at a rate of per week compare with per month in and we expect that to accelerate far to support that today we be publish our league table outline where enforcement be be take so that resident can see exactly what be happen and where we will regularly update the league table to ensure that the public remain sighted on their authority enforcement activity 
 our focus now be on more and more consistent enforcement last week i meet the building safety regulator and sector leader to discuss how we can build a share plan to increase the pace of remediation far today i be announce a number of initiative to boost enforcement a further £ to council enforcement team the development of a new regulatory protocol for great consistency and a new fund that partner can access for legal support in complex case 
 for a task as big as this remediation of building with issue be always go to take time there be no doubt that in some part of the sector it be still take far too long yet already almost homeowner have peace of mind that remediation be complete and a further dwelling be well on the way to the same every week that go by more be do there be more start and more completion and vitally more of those who be unwilling to do the right thing be be expose we will not stop until we have fix cladding issue today i hope the house can see the real and accelerate progress that be be make 
 order 
 that mr speaker do issue his warrant to the clerk of the crown to make out a new writ for the electing of a member to serve in this present parliament for the borough constituency of blackpool south in the room of scott lloyd benton who since his election for the say borough constituency have be appoint to the office of steward and bailiff of his majesty ’s manor of northstead in the county of york.—(simon hart 
 before we start question i should say that scott who have be work in my office since i become speaker be cross to another part of the house service he be not leave the house and on behalf of all member i thank he for his work and for ensure the efficiency of my office 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to increase sentence for dangerous offender 
 to govern be to choose choice we have make mean that the most dangerous offender the acid attacker the rapist the knife point robber who be sentence to year or more be require to spend long in custody the sentencing bill go far murder involve sexual or sadistic conduct will lead to a whole life order unless there be exceptional circumstance and those convict of the most serious sexual offence include rape will serve of their custodial term in prison 
 i welcome the measure that my right hon and learn friend have outline as will my east devon constituent rapist deserve the most severe possible custodial sentence will he update the house on how sentence length have be increase for that utterly vile crime since 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that rape be an appalling crime in the average custodial sentence for adult rape be and a half year and   prison governor be require to release offender at the halfway mark today the average sentence be over long and offender serve more than year must serve third of that sentence behind bar as i say we be go far still 
 for all the positive word from the secretary of state the reality in our prison be that people be be send out and the prison estate have not keep pace with the rhetoric that we hear from the government the government be constantly send criminal on to our street because they do not have the prison facility to house they be not the reality that we need few fine word and more action from the government to keep our street safe 
 that be not a fair characterisation the capacity in our estate be much great than when we inherit it that be point point be that we have kick start the large prison expansion since the victorian era £ have be allocate and we have open his majesty ’s prison fosse way and hmp wells hmp millsike will open next year we have plan permission for gartree and grendon springhill and we also have more space rapid deployment cell and so on come on at liverpool birmingham and norwich we believe that those who commit the most appalling crime should be lock up for long as i say it be wrong that in rapist would be automatically release at the halfway mark we be the government who be put that right 
 i commend my right hon and learn friend for build on the work that he and i do together to ensure that the most dangerous and serious offender spend long behind bar the consultation on sentencing in case of murder conclude a few week ago when can we reasonably expect a response on that sensitive and important issue 
 my right hon and learn friend be absolutely right to say that it be a sensitive issue as he know from practice those who commit the offence of murder outside use a knife that be bring to the scene can expect a starting point of year however as the gould and devey family have make so powerfully clear where the crime take place inside the home there be very difficult sentencing decision for judge the consultation have end and i pay tribute to the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend   the member for orpington gareth bacon who have speak to a number of people about it as indeed have i. we will respond in the come week but this matter require careful thought i pay tribute to my right hon and learn friend for his work on it 
 barnaby webber from taunton be describe by his family as an extraordinary ordinary person his killer be find guilty of manslaughter rather than murder on the basis of be subject to paranoid schizophrenia barnaby ’s mother emma webber say it be abhorrent that murder charge be not pursue against her son ’s killer will the secretary of state consider re categorise homicide law to introduce degree and degree murder 
 there be nothing i could say from this dispatch box that would put right the horror that the poor family of barnaby webber grace o’malley kumar and ian austin suffer in those appalling attack from valdo calocane the law of homicide have be consider greatly in fact as a back bencher i lead a debate on the issue of degree and degree murder it be of course something that we keep under careful consideration there be complexity to it but it be certainly a matter that we will consider 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of legislation on cremation 
 the law on cremation have be update when need for example the cremation regulation be currently be amend as part of the ongoing death certification reform however the primary legislation on cremation date back to and in the light of development since then i believe that a more comprehensive review be need that be why the law commission have agree to consider the law govern cremation as part of its project on burial cremation and new funerary method that project have commence and we await its finding with interest 
 i be grateful for the minister ’s answer obviously give what be go on in hull there be great concern i know that the minister can not speak directly about that issue because of the investigation but there be no formal regulation of funeral director on these issue joseph barsby the manage director at g. seller a much love local funeral director that be at the forefront of funeral facility in hinckley be very concerned because g. seller want to lead not be tarnish by be suck into problem in the industry will the minister meet with joseph to discuss way in which we can improve the system fail that will there be a way for funeral director to feed in information and idea on how to improve the system 
 my hon friend make a very good point the department have already start work on a call for evidence on where we go with the regulation of the funeral director sector that will be issue shortly i be more than happy to ensure that the view of any funeral director be feed in and of course to meet with the firm in his constituency 
 i thank the minister for the productive and supportive way that he have engage with i on the appalling situation with legacy funeral director in hull i be utterly committed to regulate this industry and never again allow that appalling heartbreaking situation to be repeat i have hear the minister ’s response to   the hon member for bosworth dr evans but could he speak a little bit more about timeframe do he agree that in the interval before statutory regulation come in we should encourage all funeral director to subject themselves to voluntary regulation by of the trade body and to do everything they can to reassure the public that not all funeral director be in a situation like the appalling situation that we have have in my constituency 
 if i may return the compliment the hon lady have handle this appalling incident in her constituency with a great deal of skill i be committed to work with she and the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend   the member for north dorset simon hoare who be lead on some of the initial response alongside the local authority the call for evidence on where we go on regulation will commence in the next few month the decision of course will have to wait for the public consultation this afternoon i be meet the major trade body to discuss how they can assist with voluntary inspection to ensure that after this terrible incident what have be happen be quite horrific which nobody think could occur we get this right so that people have confidence in the vast majority of funeral director who be entirely respectable and treat the deceased with the respect and care that we would expect 
 what step he be take to reduce reoffende 
 reduce reoffende be a core mission of this government that be why for example we roll out the genuinely transformational policy of week guarantee accommodation for offender on release and it be why we have invest heavily in employment there be prison employment lead in every resettlement prison the plan be work the reoffende rate have fall significantly since from to and in the year to march the proportion of prison leaver in employment month after release more than double 
 i be grateful to my right hon and learn friend for his answer he may be aware that the welsh affairs committee have recently hear from business such as timpson and williams homes about the work be do to train and recruit prisoner in wales while there be a lot of praise for the new futures network which broker partnership between employer and prison what be be do to expand the number of release on temporary licence scheme as we have hear they be really important for improve employability and give prisoner a well chance of hold down a job when they get out of the gate 
 i thank my right hon friend for the interest he be show in this issue he be absolutely right to pay tribute to the new futures network which do exceptional work in custody of course it be very often able to liaise with employment advisory board local business people in the area to ensure that prisoner be train in the skill that they need for job in that area when i go to hmp berwyn which be of course in wales of the thing that i be so impressed by be that its employment hub have a video suite so that prisoner can be interview by employer on the outside on my right hon friend ’s point about rotl that be something that prison governor keep under review certainly in the right case where rotl be safe for the public it can be a useful tool to ensure that prisoner be rehabilitate and get into work so that they can be law abide citizen in the future 
 the secretary of state will know that of the way to reduce reoffending be to break the cycle of drug misuse the problem of course be that in too many prison there be a high incidence of drug get in so what be he do to reduce the amount of drug in our prison 
 the hon member be right it be of course really important that we tackle drug come into prison we have roll out £ in prison gate security to ensure that there be airport style security there be scanner include body scanner with very high resolution so that people come into jail can be scan for illicit contraband that may be be transport internally that be important we be also roll out additional technology that can scan mail for psychoactive substance impregnate into the paper that be just of a suite of measure that we be take plus there be the drug abstinence wing 
 may i take this opportunity to say that i misspoke early ian coates be the victim of the nottingham attack 
 i call the chair of the justice committee sir robert neill kc 
 thank you mr speaker i welcome my right hon and learn friend ’s comment about the progress make on tackle reoffende but he will be aware that it remain stubbornly high we be in an unfortunate position we imprison more people than most of our neighbour in europe but still have high rate of reoffende do that not posit the fact that we need to make more intelligent use of prison and of alternative to custody as part of a join up system would he agree that the sentencing bill be particularly valuable in this regard and can we hope for its swift return to the house 
 i thank my hon and learn friend for his excellent point he say something with which i passionately agree strip out the emotion and follow the evidence the evidence show that there be tool available to this generation of politician that be not necessarily available or year ago i be talk not just about gps tag which we have double but alcohol tag with which there be a compliance rate the reoffende rate among those who live with the sword of damocles hang over they can be much low than for those who spend a short time in custody 
 as it be his birthday yesterday i call jim shannon 
 thank you mr speaker you be never go to let i forget about my birthday 
 i very much thank the secretary of state for his answer and for his very clear commitment to physical and skill training the other important issue be education if we keep people ’s mind and body active they will not wish to offend when they leave prison so what be be do to help educationally will the secretary of state share the idea he clearly have with the equivalent minister in northern ireland 
 absolutely importantly we be roll out a prison education service with a considerable sum of money about £ a year which be significant however it be critical to have tie up between the local employment advisory board liaise with the governor and the new futures network to ensure that the education provide be tailor to the job on the outside people be be assist with literacy for example so that they can do job in hospitality kitchen or horticulture education work when it be tailor to job opportunity on the outside that be how we get prisoner motivated and engage and yes i be happy to engage in the way that the hon member propose 
 what step he be take to prevent the potential abuse of last power of attorney agreement 
 when an lpa application be submit there be a statutory week waiting period before the lpa can be register during which objection can be lodge as for register lpa any concern about an attorney abuse can be report to the office of the public guardian which will investigate as part of the modernisation of lpa follow the passage of the powers of attorney act new identity verification process will be introduce to far strengthen the system 
 more than people in britain have last power of attorney agreement i have be inundate recently with so many harrowing story from across the country of abuser target elderly people and steal their estate from under their nose will the minister ensure that a proper medical assessment be carry out before an lpa be activate and that the digitisation of lpa do not lead to family lose their love ’s estate to unscrupulous abuser 
 the hon gentleman make a good point and i be more than happy to take that away and write to he about the step we take to ensure that that level of check be in place i reassure the house that people can check the use a last power of attorney service on gov.uk to see where lpa have be issue and whether have be issue without their knowledge 
 what step he be take to reduce violence in the secure youth estate 
 the number of child in custody have fall by nearly in the last decade but that mean that those in custody be more complex of they be detain for violent offence although the rate of prisoner on prisoner assault decline by between july and september compare with the same period in the rate of assault on staff increase that be why all site have a safety strategy reflect local driver of violence that include tackle the use of weapon   and training staff in conflict resolution much have be do but there continue to be more to do and we remain focused on do it 
 those strategy be clearly not work there be assault on staff between july and september of which be serious that be a increase year on year in assault in the child and young people ’s estate when will the minister put in place a proper plan to cut violence in the youth estate and keep staff safe 
 the plan we have put in place be work but there be more to do the hon gentleman highlight statistic that as he will accept i acknowledge from the dispatch box we believe that our approach to tackle violence and to conflict resolution in our youth estate be right and we will continue to press forward with it to reduce rate of assault on our hard work and dedicated prison officer and staff 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government have decide to change the use of cookham wood youth offender institution to an adult prison that follow a lack of progress in improve young people ’s access to education and increase violence on the prison estate the behaviour management method of keep young people in their cell have fail this decision put a spotlight on the wide crisis in adult prison when the young people be transfer how will the minister ensure that the practice of keep they in their cell and the cycle of violence will end 
 i be grateful to the shadow minister for her question about cookham wood as she will be aware a number of specific local factor at work in cookham wood lead to the urgent notification and the challenge in address that as for those young people and their transfer to other institution a number of they will be release before cookham wood close those still in custody will be assess individually and they and their family will be engage with to ensure that they be place in institution that be well suited to their need and that give they the great opportunity to progress and make positive life choice for when they be release 
 it be a shame that the minister do not address the violence specifically violence be a challenge across the youth estate not just at cookham wood recently a girl with challenging behaviour and complex need at wetherby yoi be restrain and then strip not once but twice by male officer in the context of rise violence and extreme self harm do the minister believe that be acceptable and what alternative provision do he have in mind other than the keppel unit in wetherby yoi 
 i do address the point about violence on the estate in response to the original question from   the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty the hon lady ask specifically about a case highlight by the chief inspector of prison in his recent report what happen there be clearly against policy it be clearly wrong and concerning but i do   have to correct she the individual involve be at no point strip search that be inaccurate reporting at all time the modesty of the individual be protect with a blanket so i be afraid that what be say in report that it be a strip search be not correct clothe be remove under a blanket in order to protect life where there be imminent risk to it those officer make a difficult decision in the circumstance to protect life it be right that we look into the specific of what happen as my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor and i have do i think we just need to be a little cautious at this point about accept everything that be report as fact 
 what recent assessment he have make of trend in the level of violence against prison officer 
 all assault on prison staff be utterly unacceptable that be why we have take step to protect our staff i put on record something that i suspect those on both side of the house share which be our gratitude to all those who work in our prison to protect staff we have roll out pava pelargonic acid vanillylamide spray in adult male prison and body wear video camera the maximum penalty for those who assault prison officer have be double and we have complete our £ security investment programme to clamp down on the illicit item that fuel prison violence the rate of assault on staff in the month to september be low than in the month to september before the pandemic but it be still far too high 
 i know the minister care about this issue and want to see solution for how we protect prison officer across the prison estate but accord to the prison officers association and the community union serious offence against prison officer be up on last year some of those assault be deem to be serious and attack be be record every day on the prison estate across england and wales there be huge concern about overcrowding the level of prison officer be low than in it be positive to hear the secretary of state talk about open new prison but if there be no prison officer to work there how will we resolve these issue more worryingly prison officer be take to the medium to say that they be frightened for their life to work on the prison estate i do not think the plan be work i believe the minister want to fix it but what be the next plan to resolve thing and ensure that prison officer remain safe on our prison estate 
 no in any walk of life should be in fear of assault at work and that obviously include dedicated prison officer i have already highlight the step we be take to tackle some of the root cause of that violence we have the £ security measure to tackle illicit drug and mobile phone the sort of thing that fuel the violence and the ability to deploy pava spray the hon gentleman rightly highlight the importance in this context of the number of prison officer that be why i be pleased that in the late statistic publish at the end of last year number be up by and retention rate be improve too 
 what step his department be take to help ensure that victim of domestic violence be protect throughout court proceeding 
 the domestic abuse act be transformative with the protection it give to domestic abuse victim through the justice system to give just a few example up front legal aid be available to all domestic abuse victim seek a protective order without have to establish evidence of abuse our upcoming legal aid mean test review will significantly increase eligibility and exclude dispute asset such as the marital home from consideration perpetrator be prohibit from cross examine their victim and victim be entitle to the support of an independent domestic violence adviser throughout the process 
 my office have recently assist with several case regard the use of court proceeding involve victim of domestic abuse in many case family issue be go straight to trial without any mediation which cause far more trauma for all party concern can the minister assure i that we will always place the victim at the forefront of court proceeding in these circumstance 
 it be specifically to address that issue that we commission our harm panel which conduct excellent work as a result of which the ministry of justice have conduct a pilot of pathfinder court in dorset and north wales focus on prevent exactly this issue those court have focus on create a less adversarial system where domestic abuse allegation be investigate and resolve at an early stage without be intensify through the court my hon friend will be glad to hear that so successful have the pilot be that it will now be roll out on a national basis start next month with court in south east wales and in birmingham 
 in rape be record by the police but there be just rape conviction it be well document that there be not enough support for rape victim through the court process the use of counselling note have a chilling effect and the long wait for their case to go to trial have an intense impact on survivor often cause they to withdraw what will the minister do to ensure that victim and survivor be support throughout the court process 
 it be not in dispute that rape be the most serious offence a person can experience that be not homicide it be as a result of the implementation of the end to end rape review that we start operation soteria through the police force that have not just improve rape prosecution some force be refer quadruple the volume of case to the crown prosecution service that they be once before and overall prosecution have more than double we have close to independent sexual violence adviser work in the system hold a victim ’s hand from the minute they go to the police to the conclusion of the process i meet some in hatfield last month who tell i that victim have tell they   they have only stay in the process because of that support it be night and day from where it be in we review the outcome of the rape review every quarter and the curve be go upwards so of course it be a crucial issue but on which significant improvement be be make on every single matrix 
 domestic abuse have no place in modern society or any society what work be happen to ensure that victim of domestic abuse be support throughout the entire process we have a fantastic organisation in watford call watford women ’s centre which help many abuse victim but what be the government do to ensure that victim be support throughout and that the perpetrator be take to court and justice be serve 
 i thank my hon friend for his excellent question i give he a similar answer to the i give   the hon member for rotherham sarah champion thing that have be transformative in victim support be the provision of not just independent sexual violence adviser but independent domestic abuse adviser again there be nearly adviser in the system help victim every step of the way thing that i be most excited about in this challenging area of the law be the pilot launch next month for domestic abuse protection order which will give police or victim the ability to go to the magistrate court or the family court to seek a blend of measure whether that be a non molestation order an occupation order or a stalk protection order and create positive obligation on the perpetrator whether that be on alcohol abuse or through the perpetrator programme there be a comprehensive package of support for domestic abuse victim 
 in scotland victim of rape and serious sexual assault be now able to access free court transcript the project will give victim free access to transcript that previously would have cost thousand of pound however the uk government refuse to match the scheme and be only commit to a year pilot scheme in which free copy of sentencing remark will be make available to victim of serious crime that be not good enough it fail victim like my constituent juliana terlizzi who be charge over £ to read the transcript of her rapist ’s trial ahead of report stage of the victims and prisoners bill in the other place next month will the justice secretary meet juliana and i to discuss match the scottish scheme which will help get victim the justice they deserve 
 i reassure the hon lady that the courts minister have say that he will meet she to discuss the matter she will know that the cost of transcription for a full trial can be as high as £ but the power and impact of any trial where there have be a conviction be in the judge ’s sentencing remark at the end in see everything and society ’s opprobrium be express through the voice of the judge that be why we be conduct a pilot for free sentencing remark in all those case 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of delay in the family court on child who have be take into care 
 delay in decision making during care proceeding can have a significant impact on child and we recognise that there be more to do to address that challenge that be why last year the government publish their response to the independent review of child ’s social care set out a programme of action to achieve well outcome the department for education be invest an extra £ on new initiative to address the long delay and meet the statutory requirement to resolve proceeding within week 
 datum from cafcass show that child who have be remove from their parent by the state have to wait an average of week to get a final decision on where they will live that be heartbreaking what assessment have the minister make of the impact of extend family proceeding on the mental health of the child involve and their ability to access support and child and adolescent mental health service 
 the hon lady raise a very serious point the impact on the child and the wide family be appreciate we have invest in capacity with more money for cafcass judge and recorder and more sitting day to ensure that we increase capacity so that hearing can be hear effectively we be also focus on the public law outline which set a maximum number of hearing and the time limit to ensure that proceeding be hear on time if the hon lady wish to raise any specific case i will be happy to meet she to get to the bottom of any specific problem 
 i call the shadow minister 
 despite the response give to my hon friend   the member for gower tonia antoniazzi the government be still a long way from solve the crisis in the family court we have hear of the week average but in of the designate family judge area in england and wales the wait be double the statutory target of week then there be the private family law case that can take week to be resolve and the number of new case be increase fast than disposal do the government have any concern or compassion for some of the most vulnerable child in the country who be be let down i invite the minister to try again and assure the house that the crisis will not get even bad 
 if there be a lever that i have not pull i invite the shadow minister to let i know what it be and i will address it this government be spend more money on attract more judge and recorder maximise sit day and invest in the public law outline and on the flip side of public family law on private family law as well as mediation we be invest an extra £ as announce in the budget to address productivity and the backlog every single lever that will increase capacity and productivity be be pull but i be more than happy for the hon member to share any insight with i and i be sure that we can work on a well solution 
 what step his department be take to reduce the backlog in the crown court 
 what step his department be take to reduce the backlog in the crown court 
 more than of all criminal case be resolve in the magistrate court which include burglary theft assault criminal damage and drug offence thank to magistrate exceptional effort the caseload have come down significantly from its post pandemic peak and case be be hear promptly to help bring down the caseload in the crown court the government have invest heavily to allow court to operate at full throttle we have recruit around judge and tribunal member across all jurisdiction this financial year we have keep open nightingale courtroom to boost capacity and we be on track to increase spending on criminal legal aid by more than £ a year 
 in yorkshire sheffield crown court have be force to shut twice in the last year due to flooding that be in addition to the already record break court backlog across the uk of case what measure have the government put in place to deal with unplanned court closure to ensure that people still have access to justice 
 of the thing i do when i take on this role be to extract from the treasury an additional £ to go into our court maintenance fund that be important because it allow we to plan not just reactively this year but proactively over time that will create more efficiency and get we more for our money and will mean that great court such as those in sheffield can continue to do the business 
 how do the backlog in criminal court case vary by region what discussion have the secretary of state have with local judicial team on prioritise and communicate those backlog 
 the senior preside judge will keep a close eye on regional discrepancy in certain case there be the power to transfer they from court to another but that will depend on the suitability for defendant and witness and victim who need to attend hearing it be important that we send the message from this chamber that more than of all criminal trial the case that people want resolve such as criminal damage drug matter and common assault be deal with in magistrate court and magistrate up and down our country be do an excellent job at get through those case 
 i absolutely endorse the lord chancellor ’s comment on magistrate work incredibly hard to clear backlog in court he will have see recent journalistic reporting relate to single justice procedure which be an important element of magistrate work the principle behind the single justice procedure be good and i have sit on case in sjp court but there be some concern in particular around vulnerable individual who may have mitigation that be not necessarily be address do he agree that perhaps he could remind member that magistrate can already use their discretion to refer case back to open court where prosecutor can review case to ensure   that individual who be vulnerable be not serve with un justice 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend and his colleague for the exceptional work they do to ensure that justice be do on the single justice procedure fairness be non negotiable so it be critical that every person who come before the court whether via the sjp or an open court get that fairness there be an issue about transparency some important point on that have be raise and echo by the chair of the justice committee my hon and learn friend   the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill it be something that we ought to consider recalibrate everyone accept that the sjp work well and be a useful addition we just need to see whether it ought to be refine in the interest of promote transparency 
 how many prisoner have be release early under the end of custody supervise licence scheme since october 
 end of custody supervise licence begin in october analysis of and statistic on its use will be base on year ’s worth of datum and publish on an annualise basis in line with other statistic such as death of offender in the community we consider that to be the appropriate approach 
 early this month the chair of the justice committee   the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill who be in his place say that prison be at bursting point while the prison governors association say that without the extension of the ecsl scheme our criminal justice system 
 may have grind to a halt 
 meanwhile the domestic abuse commissioner label the plan as 
 dangerous to domestic abuse victim 
 be the minister satisfied that the scheme manage the prison population while keep the victim of crime safe if so when will he release datum about which prisoner have be release 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman there be a number of point there the ecsl be a response to yes acute capacity challenge but it be a targeted scheme operate in prison as require and where necessary i gently say to he that a similar scheme run from to in that case it bear significant difference to what be happen now ecsl as operate now contain a range of important safeguard that be simply not in place between and the scheme release some people straight into the community without any supervision and lead to the early release of some prisoner convict of terror offence this scheme be totally different it play a role in manage the prison capacity challenge but it have those important safeguard in place to protect victim and society 
 our prison be full so much so that the government be sanction the early release of inmate to make space at what point will we prioritise the deportation of foreign criminal who be take up in of   our prison cell so that we can get back to tolerance policing and ensure that no crime be too small to go unpunished 
 i be grateful to my hon friend because she be quite right to highlight that a key element of tackle the prison capacity crisis be send back through deportation foreign national offender she will be reassure that have be deport in the past year and we continue to drive that target ever higher 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be tell that the minister be refuse to come clean with the public on how many prisoner be be release early under the scheme as we know the public be overwhelmingly in favour of an early release scheme if it be apply to his colleague in a general election laughter do he have any intention before that happy day of release the truth about how many prisoner be be let out early 
 it be always a pleasure to face the gentle barb of the hon gentleman whom i have know for a long time as i have make very clear on a previous occasion in the house and indeed just a few moment ago we consider that an annualise publication of these statistic be the most appropriate approach in line with the publication of similar statistic such as those relate to death of offender in the community 
 what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of legal aid for immigration case 
 the legal aid agency monitor the provision of immigration legal aid and take whatever action be operationally available to it to ensure a supply of provider 
 i be hop for an answer but do not get so let i try this while we all desperately want to see the tories asylum backlog clear this effort must be well fund and must ensure access to justice what we have instead be an under resource bureaucracy and a push to make rush asylum decision combine with severe difficulty in access immigration legal aid and as a result thousand of asylum seeker have effectively be deny the right to legal representation why do the uk government stand alone in not recognise the enormous crisis in immigration legal aid 
 in fact the government spend £ on immigration legal aid in we have increase the hourly rate for those undertake this kind of work and we be look at remote access and payment for travel all those step we have take to raise the level of funding in this important area i have to say however that i think it take a particular bit of brass neck for the snp to lecture we on the funding of legal aid i refer the hon gentleman to scottishlegal.com which have comment on how the snp have decimate legal aid in scotland 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 perhaps the minister can answer this question the bar council have repeatedly highlight the fact that asylum claimant who have otherwise meritorious case have often go through multiple appeal due to very poor or no legal representation that jack up the cost for the court the home office and local authority all the while trap vulnerable people in an agonising limbo if the government will not address the crisis in immigration legal aid because it be the right thing to do will they at least do so because it be the financially sound thing to do 
 as i have say we be already increase the fee for those who take on legal aid work in connection with the illegal migration act that be a increase on the increase that we have already see on top of that we be roll out remote access to the duty advice scheme and introduce payment for travel those be major step towards ensure the availability of legal aid i therefore do not accept the hon gentleman ’s description of the position if he want to start swap comment from the bar council i can quote the scottish bar council ’s view on the snp ’s record 
 what recent assessment his department have make of the impact of outcome datum from the justice data lab on the recommissioning of hm prison and probation service reoffende programme in the last month 
 reduce reoffende be a core mission of this government as my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor say in an early answer we act on the basis not of emotion but of evidence deploy a series of carefully research intervention from the prison employment lead to the provision of week of accommodation post release that be why the reoffende rate have decrease from to since the justice data lab make an important contribution by provide hmpps and external organisation with a robust assessment of whether their intervention work and we will continue to consider their work carefully 
 i welcome the adherence to an evidence base approach to work out whether or not these various programme work effectively but may i urge ministers to go even far by ensure that every programme we currently commission be reassess on the basis of outcome and then not recommissione unless those outcome measure up 
 i can confirm that the government will continue to base our investment decision to reduce reoffende on the well available evidence at the time we be continuously improve our evidence base for instance through the cross governmental better outcomes through linked data programme 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since the last session of justice question i have visit hmp liverpool a prison that receive a poor inspection report some year ago and i see how it have be transform prisoner be engage in constructive activity in the cycle repair workshop and elsewhere cell have be refurbish and there be a clear sense of pride among prison officer who be determined to deliver safety decency and rehabilitation prison as well as prisoner it seem can be redeem i have also visit liverpool crown court to see our intensive supervision court in action tackle the root cause of offend with treatment for addiction in coventry i see rapid deployment team of offender who have be sentence to carry out unpaid work clear up local neighbourhood visibly atone for their crime and do so within hour of the project be nominate by the public 
 i be pleased to support the important strategic litigation against public participation bill promote by   the hon member for caerphilly wayne david which be intend to tackle abusive and chilling lawsuit we have also bring forward legislation on litigation funding agreement to ensure that party can continue to fund court proceeding on behalf of individual or small business that support enable the sub postmaster to make their successful civil claim our legislation will bolster access to justice boost our legal sector and ensure that in our court david can still take on goliath 
 the government have achieve only of the promise new prison place result in they have to release prisoner up to day early to alleviate overcrowding thereby directly impact on public safety how do the secretary of state reconcile this with the conservative promise of be tough on crime especially when his end of custody supervise licensing scheme expansion significantly deviate from judicial sentencing 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question when i be in practice i have to listen to the then labour home secretary say that he be go to cancel the titan prison that he have boast he would open not be build we have open wells and fosse way and millsike be under construction we have more cell come online in birmingham liverpool and norwich we have rapid deployment cell and we have new houseblock in guys marsh rye hill and hatfield this be the party that be deliver we will be tough on crime 
 may i gently say that there a lot of people i need to get in if we could shorten the answer that would be helpful 
 i recently meet my constituent david winnett who be a family law solicitor and a member of resolution he tell i about resolution ’s vision for family justice i wonder whether my right hon and learn friend be familiar with that vision particularly the importance place on early legal advice in family dispute be there scope to add resolution ’s propose scheme to the mediation pilot that the government currently have plan 
 resolution do exceptionally important work and in the budget the chancellor announce an additional £ of support for separate parent include £ to deliver a new pilot we be work with resolution and other organisation to implement the pilot which we aim to launch in september this year 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 this conservative government promise prison place by but so far they have only deliver under the justice secretary be let violent offender out up to month early because as we find out from press briefing about dire warning to no he have literally nowhere to put they instead of focus on what happen year ago under the last labour government will he level with the public about the true scale of the prison capacity crisis that be unfold on his watch 
 i have be very candid in say that there be pressure in our prison but here be the thing capacity in our jail be significantly high than it be under labour ’s watch and secondly we have a record of delivery and there will be place by next year here be the really important point there be question that i pose in my statement would labour have let out up to people during covid yes or no we say no secondly would labour have get rid of jury trial we do not but the opposition would have if they have make the same decision that we do they would have face the same pressure this be opportunism it be silly and britain deserve well 
 bring on the general election and i will happily answer those question i be not surprised that the secretary of state do not want to acknowledge the truth probation officer have tell i that they genuinely fear not be able to keep the public safe because they be be force to rush through the early release of violent man in order to free up space he will have hear the same concern so what be he go to do about it 
 it be really important that the public be not inadvertently mislead early release do not apply to those on life sentence those on imprisonment for public protection sentence those on extended determinate sentence any sex offender any terrorism offender and any serious violent offender the difference between our scheme and the opposition ’s be that under their scheme governor have no discretion to block the release of prisoner under our they do that be the difference we prioritise public safety the opposition prioritise politic 
 my constituent cindy go through hell when her daughter victoria be brutally rap and attack by a serial offender donald andrews victoria take her life not long after this monster be a regular offender before and to add insult to injury his whole life sentence have be quash and he be now apply for parole police psychologist and other professional have deem this attacker to be a high risk to society so will my right hon friend make similar representation to the parole board that this monster should never be allow out 
 many people in this house will have hear about some appalling case but this case be truly of the most shocking and upsetting that any of we will have encounter i of course pass on my deep sympathy to cindy legg for the tragic loss of her daughter victoria i can indicate that i do enter an overarching view oppose release and i can announce that he will not be recommend for release i hope that will be of some comfort to the family in the victims and prisoners bill we be introduce an additional safeguard specifically a power for the lord chancellor to order a check on the release of the most serious offender to keep the public safe 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the government ’s plan to introduce employment tribunal fee suggest that user should pay towards run cost imply that only those use the system benefit from it however resolution foundation research show that tribunal be heavily rely upon to enforce worker right for all do the justice secretary not appreciate that any action to deter lower pay worker from bring forward case will be to the detriment of the system as a whole 
 we do not believe that a £ claim issue fee will be a deterrent the tribunal system cost the taxpayer £ a year and we do not think it be unreasonable that those who use it should pay a small contribution to answer the question we do not think it be a deterrent 
 the tragic reality be that when intimate partner murder woman be the victim in of case what progress have the government make since the wade review on ensure that justice be do in these case 
 we be increase sentence by introduce statutory aggravating factor for murder that be precede by coercive or control behaviour that involve overkill or that be connect with the end of a relationship for manslaughter involve sexual conduct we intend to target case where death occur in the context of abusive or degrading sexual conduct we have consult publicly on sentencing with starting point for murder precede by control or coercive behaviour and for murder commit with a knife or other weapon 
 people want access to justice the women ’s budget group have find that as a result of the disastrous legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act of vulnerable woman be unable to access civil legal aid and the majority of they be reach crisis point do the minister think it be right that these woman be be leave without basic access to justice 
 the hon lady raise an important   point and i would be happy to meet she and take representation on that specific point i will also discuss it with lord bellamy who alongside i deal with civil legal aid 
 i thank the lord chancellor for meet i and my hon friend the member for south leicestershire alberto costa to discuss the egregious case of colin pitchfork the double child rapist who have have problem bounce in and out through the parole board system i know that my right hon and learn friend can not change the law on this retrospectively but what can he do in upcoming legislation to ensure that we have the protection for our community to make sure they be safe and that reoffender be not release 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this incredibly important case and for take it up so powerfully on behalf of his constituent in the sentencing bill we have a proposal such that people who commit crime of murder involve sexual and sadistic conduct will not be release because they will be expect to serve a whole life order that be just on behalf of the british people and it also help to keep community such as that of my hon friend safe 
 the number of outstanding case before gwent magistrate court have rise by in the last year alone however the number of magistrate be now low in the whole of south wales we have hear today about the great work of the magistrate court and the fact that magistrate come from all walk of life what be the government do to ensure that hard to reach people be offer their service as magistrate include ethnic minority and in particular young people 
 the hon gentleman raise a good point i lead on diversity in the department and a piece of work be already under way on how we can increase the diversity of the magistracy and ensure that we recruit from those hard to reach group i be more than happy to meet he to swap idea and discuss how we can continue to change the face of our magistrate 
 do the secretary of state for justice agree that in england and across the united kingdom the ancient principle of innocent until prove guilty should be uphold and restore and that the punishment should never be the process 
 i thank my hon friend for his question i be ask about my priority when i be appoint to this role and i say that the guilty should be convict that the innocent should walk free and that the public should be protect it be very important that people who be accuse of an offence have confidence that   the process will be prompt and humane ultimately the british people be fair minded they want people to be rightfully convict but they also want the innocent to walk free 
 since february there have be sudden death at hmp parc in bridgend and it appear that at least of those tragic death be drug relate what be the government do to ensure that inmate at parc be keep safe and walk out of prison safe and well at the end of their sentence 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for highlight a serious and important issue i be happy to meet she to discuss it far if she wish 
 in line with establish protocol for death in custody we be not able to comment on individual case until the relevant investigation by the prison and probation ombudsman have conclude but hmp and yoi parc have mobilise a range of action to gather intelligence on drug entry point and on what have happen i be happy to meet the hon lady to discuss this matter privately 
 when the national crime agency brief member who be interested in the investigatory powers amendment bill it estimate that between and serious sexual offender be at large in this country what be the government do to identify they how many more prison will we have to build to accommodate they 
 i be proud that since the number of people prosecute for rape be up sentence be around long and the proportion of those sentence spend in custody have increase we be determined to do everything possible to send a clear message that address serious sexual offending be a priority for this government we will clamp down on it and those who perpetrate this vile crime can expect the punishment they deserve 
 the strategic litigation against public participation bill which be table by my hon friend the member for caerphilly wayne david and which the government now support be a great opportunity to tackle pernicious lawsuit that seek to silence journalist campaigner and even sexual assault survivor but key deficiency the overly subjective test and the narrow definition of public interest mean that anti slapp campaigner tell i that they simply can not support the bill in its current form ahead of the important committee stage will the lord chancellor commit to look at the amendment suggest by the news media association and meet i to address its concern so that the bill become fit for purpose 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for raise this important issue i be aware of the issue that have be raise there be plainly a delicate balance to strike it be incredibly important that individual can access the court to get a remedy in appropriate case and we want to make sure that the balance be properly strike we will consider the amendment with care as i have with the secretary of state for culture media and sport if the hon lady want to make representation to i i will listen to they very carefully 
 worksop witness the horrific murder of pauline quinn by a man who have be release after serve time for a double murder the probation service have since admit that mistake be make however the public still have many unanswered question do the minister agree that although it be understandable that all the information sometimes can not be put in the public domain the probation service should seek to be as transparent   as possible and give community that information where possible 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise this important issue he be right to highlight that there be occasion when it be not possible to make all the information public but it be important that there be as much transparency as possible if it would be helpful i be happy to meet he to discuss it far 
 selby be class by the law society as a legal advice desert for housing education and family legal aid what be the minister ’s plan to fix that 
 the legal aid agency keep the location of provider under constant review we have invest an additional £ over the last few month in those specific type of legal aid if the hon gentleman write to i i can give he the detail of where the spend be go in his local area 
 joshua rozenberg kc have present law in action on radio over the past year and it have frequently shed important light on area of our justice system that need attention do the secretary of state share my disappointment that today ’s broadcast will be the programme ’s last because it have not be recommissione will he also pay tribute to joshua rozenberg for his work 
 i be very grateful to my hon and learn friend for raise this point joshua rozenberg have make a profound and important contribution to our country indeed he be require reading and i read he most day i share my hon and learn friend ’s profound regret and i echo his sentiment i think the whole house will wish joshua rozenberg well 
 all through lent woman nationwide have face intimidation from the anti choice group day for life block their entrance to abortion clinic daily why be that happen give that mp vote by a ratio of 3:1 in for safe access zone with the under secretary of state for justice   the hon member for newbury laura farris   be of they 
 i concur with the hon lady that it be completely unacceptable that anyone should feel harass or intimidate when exercise their legal right to abortion service i hope she will be reassure to hear that it be anticipate that section of the public order act will be commence no later than this spring the consultation on the guidance publish by the home office close on   january   and the final response will be publish in due course i must just say thing however it be right that a balance will need to be strike where compete right be engage include under article and of the european convention on human right 
 our probation service be in crisis with staff overwork overstretch and undervalue the expansion of the early release scheme will put yet more pressure on they so what be the minister do this year to help our probation staff face that extra workload 
 probation officer do an exceptionally important job as i believe we all agree let i set out what we have do in respect of prison and probation staff we accept every penny of the prison service pay review body recommendation we have inject extra funding of more than £ a year into probation prison officer do a tough job as do probation officer but i be delighted to report that the retention of prison officer be improve with the staff resignation rate in prison drop from about to and their number have increase as for probation we have recruit about people in the past year that be positive and we will continue to support they every step of the way 
 do we have enough crematorium in the uk give that many family be now have to wait or week for a funeral slot why be there such a gap between the cheap crematorium in the country which charge £ and the most expensive in stevenage which charge £ last year 
 the challenge face crematorium and in fact the whole funeral sector be be review by the law commission this be about not just crematorium but burial space there be challenge across the whole death management landscape to use the technical term which be why the law commission be investigate and bring forward proposal 
 the fee for civil legal aid be half what they be in and the number of provider have fall by in the past year if the minister actually want to do something about civil legal aid why have he kick the civil legal aid review into the long grass 
 legal aid be always under constant review and i will always take advice from those close to it that be why i engage with for example the bar association the law society and the judiciary on what we need to do as for kick thing into the long grass all i can say be that i want to get this right and if that take time it will take time 
 for the final question i call debbie abrahams 
 thank you mr speaker the justice secretary do not quite answer my question on where the criminal case in the backlog be and how they be be prioritise and communicate i do not want another historical child sexual exploitation victim to be tell by a crown court that her case have be cancel twice because it be not a priority 
 the point i be endeavour to make although i perhaps do not do so well be that list be a judicial function we have see the senior preside judge make a decision that certain sex case and those most serious rape for example all of they be serious of course will be give an early listing as i say i do not have complete control over that but i do discuss it with the lady chief justice and i know that the senior preside judge be keen to get through those case at the early opportunity 
 with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement on israel and gaza as the house know the united kingdom have long be call for an immediate humanitarian pause to allow for the safe release of hostage and more aid to reach gaza lead to a sustainable ceasefire without a return to destruction fighting and loss of life 
 yesterday the international community take a significant step towards achieve that we welcome yesterday ’s united nations security council resolution which reflect widespread international support for britain ’s position and considerable effort by our diplomat to secure a consensus this be an issue that can polarise and divide but yesterday in new york there be a shared sense of purpose i be sure the whole house would agree that we must capitalise on this moment 
 we want to see an immediate sustained humanitarian pause which would allow for the safe release of hostage and more aid to reach gaza that be what yesterday ’s resolution call for why the united kingdom vote yes on that text and why the government be now focused on see the resolution implement as quickly as possible this resolution set out the urgent demand for the 
 unconditional release of all hostage 
 hamas must act on this now the kidnapping and violence on   october   be appalling it have be unconscionable to hold they in captivity for so long and it be dreadful to hold they any long we strongly support the intensive diplomatic effort by egypt qatar and the united states to secure their release 
 my right hon friend the prime minister and the foreign secretary lord ahmad and i have meet the family of hostage and reiterate to they personally our desire to see their love one free and their agony bring to an end we urge all side to seize the opportunity and continue negotiation to reach an agreement as soon as possible yesterday ’s resolution also send a clear message on the need for all party to the conflict to uphold international humanitarian law and for delivery of aid to be scale up urgently this require the lifting of all barrier impede its delivery 
 palestinian civilian face a devastating and grow humanitarian crisis in gaza his majesty ’s government continue to reiterate these message in their contact with the israeli government and the government be explore every avenue to deliver aid by land sea and air last week enough aid to feed over a quarter of a people be deliver by land from jordan britain be fully engage in the international effort to set up a maritime corridor for aid into gaza yesterday the airdrop of british aid by the royal air force with the support of jordan take place 
 we regret that this resolution do not condemn the abhorrent and brutal terrorist attack perpetrate by hamas on   october the uk condemn these attack unequivocally we have be forthright in speak up for israel ’s right to defend itself and ensure such an attack can never happen again we want israelis and palestinians to live in peace and security an immediate humanitarian pause lead to a sustainable ceasefire be the good way to achieve a last peace 
 we continue to work on the other core element require for such a process to succeed we have support the formation of a new palestinian government for the west bank and gaza under the leadership of prime minister mustafa an international support package be vital for building on prime minister mustafa ’s appointment we also want to see the removal of hamas ’s capacity to launch attack against israel hamas can no long remain in charge of gaza finally we need to offer a political horizon to the palestinians that provide a credible and irreversible pathway towards a state solution of israel and palestine live side by side in peace and security 
 the resolution pass by the security council yesterday do not guarantee this outcome but it be a significant step forward the government will spare no effort in build on this opportunity we want to create irreversible momentum towards a last peace mr speaker i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the minister for advance sight of his statement and echo his support for the formation of a new palestinian government which must be support internationally alongside the need for a state solution with israel and palestine live side by side in security and peace yesterday the un security council finally pass resolution call for an immediate ceasefire the immediate release of all hostage and full humanitarian access in gaza that be incredibly welcome and overdue it must now be a turning point 
 labour welcome too the fact that the government be able to support the resolution it represent a major shift in government policy which previously call only for an immediate pause rather than an immediate ceasefire why be the government not able to back labour ’s motion last month much more importantly what step be the government take to ensure that the un resolution be implement in full put pressure on hamas who reportedly reject the late compromise and israel to reach agreement on a ceasefire now that could not be more vital give the terrible human cost of the war with more than palestinians dead israeli hostage still in chain nearly month on from the   october   massacre and a man make and preventable famine imminent 
 aid need to get into gaza at scale and it also need to be distribute the united nations relief and works agency be unmatched in its ability to distribute aid with just a few week until the new financial year can the minister tell we whether the uk ’s funding to unrwa will resume 
 the un motion also say that all party must 
 comply with their obligation under international law 
 in that context i will raise a specific incident with the minister on   january an international rescue committee and medical aid for palestinians compound be strike in a near fatal airstrike by the israeli military the co ordinate be know to israel and formally de conflicted a british medical team and local staff be inside who since then have receive explanation for that shocking incident but the truth be still unclear will the government support a full and independent   investigation to deliver accountability and reiterate that attack on humanitarian worker be outrageous and must not happen 
 the foreign secretary be not require to come to this house but he be require to provide legal advice to the business secretary on arm export the law be clear that the government can not grant a licence if there be a clear risk that the item could be use in violation of international humanitarian law the war in gaza have see numerous allegation make of serious breach of humanitarian law by israeli force and the international criminal court be currently conduct an investigation into allege war crime commit by all party in gaza 
 on friday i write to the foreign secretary ask he to publish the most recent legal advice he have receive on this matter so i end by ask the minister simple question have the foreign secretary receive legal advice say that there be a clear risk that item license by the uk might be use to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law the answer be a simple yes or no 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his strong support for united nations security council resolution he ask what the government will do to ensure that it be implement in full just as that resolution show considerable success for british diplomatic work particularly in new york he and the house may rest assure that we will be do everything we can to ensure that it be indeed implement in full 
 the right hon gentleman suggest that that be a reflection of labour ’s position in the house i hope that by and large the labour position be supportive of the government but he should be quite clear that yesterday ’s resolution represent a tremendous success for british diplomacy it mean that the european union the united nations and the united states now take our position on the priority i remind the right hon member that what we say very clearly be that we need an immediate pause so that we could get aid in and the hostage out 
 lead to a sustainable ceasefire 
 he will see that british position fully reflect in what be decide yesterday in new york 
 the right hon member ask i about unrwa i can tell he that the interim report by the former french foreign minister catherine colonna the final report be not due until   april be now with the secretary general in new york and we hope to learn more about it today 
 the right hon member refer to a specific strike which the house have already hear about and i agree with he entirely that we expect a full total and definitive explanation for what happen from the israeli government he ask i about arm export licensing let i give he a very clear response to that we have a robust arm export licensing regime all export be regularly assess against clear criterion we regularly review israel ’s adherence to international humanitarian law and act in accordance with that as he indicate we advise the department for business and trade on the situation in country the dbt and its secretary of state be the decision make authority but i would   point out to he that uk export be very small amount to of israel ’s military import and we publish a comprehensive report on official statistic every quarter 
 finally the right hon member ask i to publish the legal advice i would point out to he that no government do that he will recall i think the highly contentious position take at the time of the iraq war not to publish the legal advice for a party that aspire possibly in the future to be in government i be sure that labour will see the merit of these convention 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 yesterday the un security council pass a resolution for a ramadan ceasefire in effect a pause intrinsic to that pause be the release of hostage can the deputy foreign secretary please update we on progress to get those hostage home to safety because the resolution be very clear that that should happen immediately who be enforce the immediate release of hostage can he also clarify whether the government agree with the us statement this morning that the un security council resolution be non binding how be we go to ensure that on both side the return of hostage and the ceasefire for ramadan be enact if they be not i fear that the un security council will face an existential crisis 
 my hon friend the chair of the foreign affairs committee set out with great eloquence what the international community now require to take place as a result of resolution be pass yesterday as i set out in my early remark we regret that the resolution have not condemn terrorist attack perpetrate by hamas on   october but i want to re emphasise that all the thing that britain have previously be call for be now accept and be record in that resolution we will as my hon friend suggest continue to do everything we can to ensure that the resolution be implement 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i thank the minister for prior sight of his statement 
 we very much welcome the un security council resolution which demand an immediate ceasefire for the month of ramadan this be an important step in achieve the permanent ceasefire that we on the snp benches have be urge for several month we also welcome the un demand for an immediate and unconditional release of all hostage we call on all party to adhere to their obligation under international law to protect civilian and to lift all barrier to humanitarian aid 
 that this motion specifically demand a ceasefire make it legally bind and it oblige all combatant to adhere to it yet already there be significant concern that israel do not intend to comply with the demand the israeli ambassador to the un and the foreign minister israel katz among other have indicate that they will not adhere to the demand of the ceasefire with mr katz state 
 the state of israel will not cease fire 
 israel as we know have form for ignore bind resolution of the united nations but rarely can it have do so in such a blatant manner and with such a complete disregard for the rule on which we all rely to keep we safe 
 give that israel have signal its intention to ignore the demand for a ceasefire and rather than wait for the inevitable to happen before acting can the minister assure the house that if and when israel launch its propose offensive on rafah the work will already have be do to impose immediate sanction include most importantly the banning of arm sale to israel and that tel aviv will be under no illusion as to the consequence of its action should it ignore this resolution 
 can the minister update the house on what discussion have be have or be be plan with our partner and ally to ensure that we take decisive international action should israel breach the term of this resolution finally can he confirm whether it be the opinion of the uk government that should israel not adhere to the un resolution it will be in violation of a bind resolution and thus stand in breach of international law 
 of all may i welcome the hon member ’s support for the government ’s position which have not always be the case in these statement in particular i welcome the consensual language from the snp on the ceasefire the release of hostage and get aid in that be very important it mean that the authority that the prime minister bring to this dispatch box which be now the essence of this new resolution get broad support from the house which be very welcome 
 on the remain part of what the hon member say the government want to try to bring people together we want to end the violence as soon as we can ensure that the hostage get out and aid get in and lift people ’s eye to a political track once this catastrophe be over that be what the government be try to do and the hon member will forgive i for not go down the rather more divisive line that he take 
 in respect of military action in rafah the hon member will have hear what the foreign secretary the prime minister and i have say about the importance of respect international humanitarian law and the position of civilian catch out in the open there and i hope that he will agree with that 
 the terrorist attack of   october   on israel have provoke widespread antisemitism in this country and around the world the late manifestation of that be at manchester airport yesterday when border force guard make it apparent that they do not want israeli jews to enter this country innocent victim of the music festival slaughter be berate and tell 
 we have to make sure that you be not go to do what you be do in gaza over here 
 that be to victim of the nova music festival slaughter blame all jews for the action of their country be obviously antisemitic these be people in uniform act for this country as border force officer it be a disgrace beyond all proportion the detention of those victim for several hour be clearly unlawful   they be be offer free legal representation which i would urge they to take up can the deputy foreign secretary confirm that jews and israelis be still welcome to enter this country 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for his extremely robust comment on an absolutely outrageous shocking and disgraceful incident which be now be personally investigate by the home secretary i think everyone will condemn without reservation the extraordinary event that appear to have take place at manchester which be make even bad by the detail that my right hon and learn friend give of the detention that take place 
 i call the chair of the international development committee 
 i feel very uncomfortable about the minister ’s comment about take credit for the un security council resolution when the uk abstain twice in the process there be not an immediate ceasefire and after month i dread to think how many gazans have be kill or will die of starvation give the rapidly deteriorate situation in gaza do he agree that it be vital that the cabinet minister responsible for overseas aid make himself available to this house for scrutiny surely it be not right that member be update on the foreign secretary ’s view via the medium rather than from his answer question in this place when will the government do we the courtesy of respond to the procedure committee ’s report 
 the hon lady know that i greatly respect she and the work that she do on the select committee i do not think she should feel uncomfortable because britain have take a principle position that be deliver by resolution which be pass yesterday i hope that she will join the general approval for the strong british diplomatic effort that help to deliver that 
 on the foreign secretary i believe that the government response to the procedure committee report be imminent she ask about the member of the cabinet responsible for british aid and development policy that be i both i and the foreign secretary speak with voice 
 a lot of point will be make today argue that responsibility for the ceasefire lie purely with israel but that be simply not true a ceasefire must take place on all side those who want israel to lay down its arm but do not insist on hamas lay down theirs be basically say that israel do not have the right to ensure that its security be in place until hamas dismantle their terrorist organisation which threaten the life of jewish people who they do not think should exist they do not think the state of israel should exist we must ensure that any ceasefire be observe by both side of this coin 
 my right hon friend make a good point i hope that he will have notice that i be try to take a balanced approach to these matter the reason britain do not call for an immediate ceasefire before as so many other country do be that it be perfectly clear that it be not go to happen he will recall that when ask about a ceasefire hamas make   it absolutely clear that their intention be not only to not have a ceasefire but to replicate once again the terrible event that take place on   october 
 the minister have say on numerous occasion that the uk have a robust export licensing regime many opposition members be not satisfied with that response will he finally tell we what the legal advice be on whether this country be in compliance with our obligation under international humanitarian law to ensure that those arm be not use to commit offence in gaza 
 the hon gentleman really should not expect i to make a different point from the dispatch box have already set out the government ’s position that be the position of the government and that be what i will reiterate on the arm export licensing and the application of international humanitarian law i set out the government ’s position clearly in my response to the shadow foreign secretary i have nothing furth to add to that at this time 
 the un resolution have undermine effort to secure the release of the hostage hold by hamas with a collapse in negotiation only today hamas have reiterate their hard line position which be previously criticise by the united kingdom do my right hon friend share my concern that the resolution will not only embolden hamas who hope to achieve a ceasefire without release the hostage but enable they to maintain their grip on the people of gaza 
 it certainly should not do that if i may i draw my hon friend ’s attention to the explanation of vote that be publish at the same time as britain support the resolution yesterday we say 
 we regret that this resolution have not condemn the terrorist attack perpetrate by hams on the of october the uk condemn these attack unequivocally 
 i hope that he will bear that in mind in reach his conclusion about resolution 
 what be the government ’s response to israel shut off north gaza to unrwa the only aid organisation with the ability to deliver aid at scale when will the government reinstate funding to unrwa to stop and alleviate the starvation of gazans 
 we have make it clear that we will look at the interim report from catherine colonna and the united nations report we hope that reform will be make in such a way that we can reinstate funding but i should emphasise to the hon lady that no funding be due from britain until the end of april in respect of her point about the spread of unrwa it be the only organisation that have the asset in place the warehouse the vehicle the logistical support so it be essential that those logistical element be available if aid be to be distribute effectively in gaza 
 constituent have be in touch to tell i that they feel badly let down by the vote at the un yesterday i just do not understand how the minister and the foreign secretary can say that nothing have change in policy term when the uk have just vote for a resolution that do not   condemn the hamas atrocity of   october and de link a ceasefire with the release of hostage as my hon friend   the member for hendon dr offord   point out do that not make it less likely that the hostage will be release 
 i do not agree with my right hon friend the resolution set out the urgent demand for the unconditional release of all hostage we welcome the ongoing diplomatic effort by egypt qatar and the united states to that end she will have see the report in the medium as i say we have set out clearly in our explanation of vote our regret that the resolution do not once again condemn the terrorist attack but she have hear we say repeatedly from the dispatch box that we do condemn it 
 over the past week we have see israel continue to commit atrocity across gaza with the al shifa hospital besiege for several day medical staff from inside the hospital report gun battle worker be beat patient die on the floor and even execution style killing that be yet another example of israel ’s merciless target of civilian will the minister unequivocally condemn israel for authorise and carry out such heinous attack and make clear that hospital and place of refuge must not be target 
 the house will not recognise all of the thing that the hon gentleman have just say let i make it absolutely clear once again israel do have the right of self defence but she must abide by international humanitarian law 
 it be a testament to how polarise and contest our world have become that the custodian of international security take month to agree un security council resolution which call for a ceasefire the release of hostage and access for aid do the deputy foreign secretary agree that it be concern that vital uk aid have to be airdrop into gaza by the royal air force effectively bypass israel should the new port be build off gaza to operate the new maritime corridor become a permanent operation with inspection allow the international community to ensure that the scale of aid require get into gaza 
 i be grateful to the former chair of the defence committee for what he say he be right that the good way to get aid into gaza be by truck by road and that be what britain have consistently press for we know that there be truck a day before the catastrophe of   october there have be an increase in march but we be now look at something like a day we be do everything we can to try to ensure that we get aid into gaza in the easy way possible but as my right hon friend say we be also look at all other option include the airdrop that take place yesterday on   march   in which the royal air force drop tonne of food we anticipate that further airdrop will be necessary because of the situation he have outline 
 can i set the record straight for conservative members that we on the liberal democrat benches have be call for   month for an immediate bilateral ceasefire and that we welcome yesterday ’s un security council resolution however the reality be that northern gaza be on the brink of famine with child die of malnutrition and ten of thousand of child be be kill or maim by israeli force bombardment do the minister believe that netanyahu ’s government be comply with the international court of justice ’s provisional order which state that israel must ensure with immediate effect that its force do not commit any of the act prohibit by the genocide convention if he do not think that the israeli government be comply with that order what be he do about it
