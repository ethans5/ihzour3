will the hon gentleman give way 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 if he will take step to ensure that compensation be not pay to people detain use interim custody order during the trouble in northern ireland 
 this issue arise follow the supreme court judgment in which find certain custody order to be unlawful the amendment to the legacy act to try to deal with that have also be find unlawful by the northern ireland court so the government be carefully explore how to lawfully address this complex issue alongside our commitment to implement legacy mechanism that be fully compliant with human right i will of course keep the house update 
 will the secretary of state withhold the remedial order until he be certain that he can deliver the prime minister ’s pledge to prevent gerry adams from receive compensation 
 the government be currently consider the report of the joint committee on human rights and the representation make to it 
 i be a veteran as many member know and lot of my colleague serve in northern ireland i be base in a barracks in germany that be attack by terrorist so i get it but the last government ’s legacy act offer a path to immunity for those who commit the most appalling terrorist crime do the secretary of state agree that it be no surprise that the legislation be so widely opposed and have be find to be unlawful 
 i thank my hon friend for his service in our armed force alongside all those who serve he be absolutely right about the flawed piece of legislation that this government inherit and we be work hard to put that right 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 in his opening remark the secretary of state leave out crucial detail the truth be that the last government do legislate with cross party support to prevent people like gerry adams from receive taxpayer fund compensation the high court in northern ireland rule that that be incompatible with the european convention on human right and the conservative government then appeal that judgment when the labour party come to power last summer it drop that appeal will the secretary of state please set out why the government decide to drop that appeal 
 as i tell the house a moment ago the court find that clause and be unlawful although the northern ireland court of appeal be not obviously ask to rule on that because we have withdraw the appeal it do comment unfavourably on those provision we support clause and at the time but they have not work and that be why we have to find an alternative way forward i just say to the house that the main issue here be the carltona principle which the last government argue mean it be lawful for junior ministers to sign ico the amendment to try to deal with that fail and we need to find another way of reaffirm that principle that be at the heart of this case 
 the whole house will have hear the secretary of state not give a reason why the government do not continue the appeal government lawyer tell the last government that there be ground for appeal policy exchange in a report in january write by professor richard ekins and sir stephen laws say that the high court have almost certainly be mistaken in its judgment and that there be strong ground for an appeal why do the government drop it and why have the government not yet bring forward their own legislation to clear this mess up once and for all 
 the supreme court judgment be in and the last government could not find a legal solution in almost year i be committed to find and i promise that i will update the house when we have find it 
 what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on fund for an addiction treatment centre in derry in the context of the new decade new approach agreement publish on january 
 with new decade new approach the uk government commit to make funding available for a range of project aim at support community and reconciliation initiative my official regularly discuss these commitment with their devolved counterpart on addiction service it be now for the northern ireland department of health to consider how good to use this funding and bring forward a business case to the government on that basis 
 the people of derry be make a promise during the ndna negotiation i remember because i negotiate that particular part of it they be promise that the northlands addiction treatment centre would be give £ for the development of a brand new addiction centre the northlands organisation have save countless life in derry but it have now be tell by the department of health in stormont that its core funding have be cut and that the promise money be not guarantee do the minister agree that the department of health be in no position to undermine an international agreement 
 the hon member be a powerful advocate for his constituent for the northlands centre and for the need for service to tackle the scourge of addiction i join he in recognise the need for support for people with addiction but give that this matter be devolve it be now up to the department for health to present a business plan base on its review of addiction service for the service that will provide the good support for the most people 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of economic growth in northern ireland 
 economic growth be this government ’s priority and our industrial strategy be central to that it will be publish in june and will support the executive ’s plan for growth the late figure from the northern ireland statistics and research agency show that northern ireland experience strong growth than the united kingdom as a whole last year 
 northern ireland have a long and proud history of advanced engineering industry what discussion have my right hon friend have with the ministry of defence to ensure that company such as spirit aerosystems have access to the government ’s increase investment in defence 
 i be sure that my hon friend and the whole house welcome the recently announce increase in defence expenditure northern ireland have a strong and significant defence sector and spirit be part of that the secretary of state for defence have make it very clear that he want the increase expenditure to result in more job and more order for british company 
 economic growth will be support by physical connectivity example be the new grand central station in belfast where there be some controversy over irish language signage the secretary of state have comment that there be 
 so many more important thing 
 in which to be involve but set that view to side can he confirm that if there be no executive at stormont he as secretary of state would be in a position to make decision on that and other equally important issue 
 the new grand central station be a magnificent piece of infrastructure and i recommend any member who have not yet have a chance to visit it to do so i be not contemplate for that there will not be an executive in place perhaps the single most important contribution that the executive can make to continue economic growth in northern ireland be to stay in place and give confidence to those whom we be all work hard to encourage to come and invest in northern ireland ’s economic future 
 i regularly receive representation from business some of our big employer who be frustrate by the apprenticeship levy they pay in like business in britain but can not access the fund to reinvest in skill and fix our break skill pipeline do the secretary of state agree that there be merit in devolve this to the assembly as part of a package of measure to encourage the executive to take responsibility and control to be ambitious for the local economy and to drive growth 
 there be a great deal that the executive can do to help promote economic growth i have just give example and invest in and support the development of skill be another northern ireland have the low unemployment in the united kingdom but it also have a high rate of worklessness and get more people back into work and give they the skill that will enable they to take part in the economy will help to boost growth 
 economic growth have be severely damage as a result of the northern ireland protocol and the windsor framework the new eu arrangement will enable animal and food to travel unfettere between northern ireland and the rest of the uk why be manufacture not include in that arrangement and when will the custom process be remove 
 the agreement on the application of sanitary and phytosanitary measure that be reach with the european union on monday be extremely significant as the hon member will know it have be widely welcome by business throughout northern ireland include supermarket retailer and farmer because of the assistance it will give in get rid of many of the element associate with the sps arrangement it be the fruition of this government ’s determination when we come into office to negotiate a close relationship with the eu which be exactly what we have do 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 as we have just hear since last we meet in this place for northern ireland question we have have the announcement of the uk eu sps agreement that come as a great reassurance to many northern irish agrifood retailer but the northern ireland chamber of commerce and industry have caution that key trade barrier remain particularly around broad regulatory divergence across supply chain and ongoing custom issue under the windsor framework in the secretary of state ’s opinion how will the late arrangement ease east west trade in practice what specific custom reform do he intend   to pursue to far cut red tape and unlock the full potential of dual market access and latent economic growth in northern ireland 
 on custom in addition to the sps deal the significantly reduce windsor framework custom arrangement introduce on   may will of course remain in place because the uk be not in the eu customs union and we have no intention of join it it be clear from the text of the agreement what will be remove and that custom information will remain for sps good but we be work hard to make life easy and introduce change on   may reduce the number of line of information that need to be provide from to be a very good example of how we be work with the eu to make it easy for good to flow 
 what step he be take to ensure adequate legal protection for veteran who serve in northern ireland during the trouble 
 the veteran who serve in operation banner do so with distinction in very difficult circumstance and ultimately help to bring about the peace that northern ireland now enjoy we owe they a huge debt of gratitude together with the defence secretary and minister for veterans i be currently consider measure for our legacy legislation to ensure well protection for elderly veteran 
 and of our soldier be kill by paramilitary murderer during the trouble not of those death will be revisit because of the current circumstance however hundred of brave man who as the secretary of state say serve their country with honour patriotism and integrity face a sword of damocles of politically motivate trial hang over they i can think of no well example of tier justice whatever the government do they have to take that away and do so in a way that can not be circumvent by clever politically motivated lawyer will he give the house an undertaking that he will do that 
 i agree with what the former defence secretary say in he say 
 the british army uphold british value which be the rule of law and that ’ what we stand for 
 i advise the right hon gentleman to be a little bit careful about use the phrase politically motivated prosecution i hope i have correctly quote he let we be clear decision about any prosecution in any case be take by the independent public prosecution service which be entirely separate from the executive 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i strongly support the petition bring forward by my right hon friend   the member for goole and pocklington david davis as of this morning it have more than signature show the strength of public feeling on this issue almost a year ago the labour party publish its manifesto say that it   would scrap the legacy act yet it have still present no alternative victim be in limbo and veteran be in limbo the last labour government hand out letter of comfort for terrorist but nothing for elderly veteran when will the secretary of state finally show the house his plan and how can veteran have confidence that they will get the protection they deserve 
 we have begin the process of repeal and replace the legacy act in the propose draft remedial order it will deal with the conditional immunity that be strike down by the court and which we come into office commit to remove because it do not command support across northern ireland as it would have give immunity to terrorist include those who kill the soldier to whom   the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis   refer early i intend to bring forward legislation to complete that process when parliamentary time allow because this government inherit a completely hopeless piece of legislation which have be find time and again to be incompatible with our international obligation 
 i call the leader of the dup 
 the secretary of state will know that as part of a northern ireland affairs committee inquiry we have be engage with victim across northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom to assist they in their quest for some personal closure truth and justice on legacy veteran like many other victim have indicate to we that while they be listen to they have not be hear will the secretary of state confirm that he intend to announce his proposal on legacy in parallel with the irish government before the summer recess 
 i will inform the house of proposal in due course i be in discussion with the irish government and that be well know publicly the reason the legacy act result in so much trouble and difficulty and produce so much incompatibility with our international obligation be that the last government have negotiate the stormont house agreement with the party and the irish government decide to perform a ° turn and put in legislation that do not command support in northern ireland i want to make progress on this as quickly as possible and i be continue to talk to all the party about do so 
 i caution the secretary of state that he should be adhere to the strand approach and where it be appropriate to talk to the irish government it should be within that context he should not be subjugate our responsibility on legacy but he should not be let the irish government get away with their obfuscation on this issue either 
 of the most startling thing the committee experience last week be a victim who ask we collectively whether we be aware of government plan to secure a ceasefire from dissident republican that in return would lead to the release of dissident republican prisoner can i ask the secretary of state in all good conscience to recognise that dissident republican be a cancer in northern ireland and more of they should be in jail will he rule out the suggestion that be bring to we as a committee 
 i can say directly to the right hon gentleman there be no such plan 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on lesson learn from the good friday agreement 
 the good friday agreement have bring peace security and a well life to the people of northern ireland it remain an unparalleled achievement almost year on from its signing and i pay tribute to all those involve in its creation for their political courage bravery and willingness to compromise 
 i recently visit the west bank and the occupied palestinian territories with   the hon member for st ives andrew george there we see a systematic process of community be take over by another with the israeli government building wall and fence to protect the settler community the secretary of state be of course aware of the great result mo mowlam achieve in secure peace in northern ireland follow a process of engagement with both side a process that result in wall and fence be break down and a mutual respect and a common peace be achieve will the government commit to use the lesson of mo mowlam and the northern ireland peace process to help secure a last peace in the middle east 
 i share with the hon member and the whole house a wish to see last peace in the middle east and what be happen at the moment be appalling and intolerable however i think the most important lesson from the good friday agreement be the courageous political leadership show by the party to the conflict people such as john hume and david trimble and i have to say that tragically that same courageous political leadership be absent in the middle east 
 what step he be take to support the northern ireland executive in tackle violence against woman and girl 
 rate of violence against woman and girl be high in northern ireland than anywhere else in the uk this government be commit to work with the executive to tackle this emergency and i have meet and support many politician and organisation across northern ireland that be do just that the under secretary of state for the home department my hon friend   the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips and i recently meet the northern ireland teo the executive office and justice ministers in belfast to discuss work closely together include on online safety and support for frontline organisation 
 the strategy for tackle violence against woman and girl must challenge the attitude that enable it what recent discussion have the minister have with stakeholder across northern ireland to support these campaign effort 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend about tackle attitude i have meet and i be support many group and i will highlight that i have visit the excellent foyle family justice centre in derry londonderry support victim and the st joseph ’s boys school in creggan be do fantastic work with the support of white ribbon ni through the shaping mindset programme which tackle toxic masculinity head on in the school 
 i thank the minister of state for all she do on her visit to encourage people across northern ireland especially woman lady and young girl what we really need in northern ireland be legislative change long sentence and more people convict what discussion have she have with the minister responsible for police and justice in northern ireland to ensure that legislatively we be move fast to try to stop violence against woman and lady in northern ireland 
 i thank the hon member for raise this issue and he be absolutely right that what we do need to be root in what happen on the ground i meet the executive unit work with the police to tackle perpetrator and they be see evidence of that the legislation for our jurisdiction can be join up that be absolutely right but what have come across to i on many visit be the need to tackle what happen online the online safety act be now be enact through ofcom which undertake a consultation in belfast recently on its draft guidance it propose practical step for online safety and step to tackle misogyny pile ons domestic abuse and other harm he be absolutely right about what we can do through our effort on the ground if we all work together 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the us uk economic prosperity deal on northern ireland 
 the trade deal with the usa together with the agreement with the eu and india be very significant northern ireland exporter include those export service technology and farming good will benefit in the same way as those in other part of the uk in particular the us deal be a major opportunity for northern ireland farmer to sell their high quality beef to a us market of over people 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for his answer but there seem to be wildly different interpretation of what the deal mean for northern ireland will he clarify what it mean for import and export in the light of the impact of eu tariff be that explicitly discuss at the eu uk summit 
 the hon gentleman be right to point out that eu retaliatory tariff direct at the usa would have an impact in northern ireland because of its dual market access i can write to he with further detail of how precisely that would work it depend partly on whether there be less or more than a difference between the tariff in the eu and the tariff that apply in the uk 
 what step he have take to strengthen the union between great britain and northern ireland 
 the union between great britain and northern ireland which we will discuss next month at the east west council remain strong the deal with the eu will enable the smooth flow of agrifood and plant within the uk ’s internal market that be why it have be overwhelmingly welcome by business 
 in refer to the deal with the eu what the secretary of state ignore of course be that northern ireland continue to be under a foreign custom code which mean that there be still custom check on all good include agriculture good move within the united kingdom ideologically and personally be he commit to the union i be not ask if he be committed to the consent principle any separatist can accept that be he personally and ideologically a unionist 
 the government and i support the union and i also support the good friday agreement i point out to the hon and learn gentleman that when it come to custom arrangement there be no mandatory check there be check that apply generally on the basis of risk and intelligence 
 what step he be take to replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 the government have begin the process of repeal and replace the previous government ’s legacy act the draft remedial order in parliament represent the step the government will address the other issue arise from several court finding of incompatibility in primary legislation 
 i listen carefully to the answer the secretary of state give just now to the shadow secretary of state my hon friend   the member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart and to my right hon friend   the member for goole and pocklington david davis the secretary of state must understand the severe anxiety particularly for our veteran cause by not have a timescale on this matter will he at least commit to put in place a deadline will he also take seriously the finding of the policy exchange report 
 i listen carefully to all the representation that be make to i include in that report which i have read i be committed to introduce legislation as soon as possible although that be subject to the availability of parliamentary time this government come into office absolutely committed to remedy the absolute failure of the legacy act pass by the previous government 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday may 
 my deep condolence and those of the whole house i be sure be with the family and friend of jennie martyn and david who be tragically kill in the fire in bicester last week 
 i welcome to the under gallery cheryl korbel the mother of olivia i be always humble by those with the courage to respond to appal heartbreak by campaign for change i know that the whole house will pay tribute to her extraordinary courage and extraordinary resolve 
 because of the action take by this government the uk be now the fast grow economy in the g7 interest rate have be cut time and we have secure our trade deal in week deal with india the us and the eu these deal be in the national interest and will improve the life of work people and business across the united kingdom 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 this labour government have be in power now for almost month when will the prime minister stop defy the will of the british people stop dance around the subject and stop all illegal immigration into the united kingdom which have be rise on his watch 
 it be the previous government who lose control of immigration they have record number for net migration and lose control of the border we be bring forward legislation to give law enforcement the great possible power what be the conservatives do they be vote against it 
 while the economy be show sign of improve many pensioner be still impact by the cost of living crisis people in luton who have work hard all their life be see their precious saving slip away will the prime minister tell we what measure he will take to help struggle pensioner in town like mine 
 we all know that the economy be leave in an absolute mess by the tories we have to stabilise the economy with tough decision but they be the right decision because of they the economy be begin to improve there be those growth figure last year we have the high growth in the g7 there be interest rate cut in a row and there have be trade deal however i recognise that people be still feel the pressure of the cost of living crisis include pensioner and as the economy improve we want to make sure that people feel those improvement each day as their life go forward that be why we want to ensure that more pensioner be eligible for winter   fuel payment as we go forward as you would expect mr speaker we will make only the decision that we can afford and that be why we will look at that as part of a fiscal event 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 it be extraordinary listen to that last answer from the prime minister inflation be when the conservatives leave office it be now nearly double that when will he recognise that it be labour ’s budget that be drive up inflation 
 what the right hon lady forget to say be that inflation rise to more than on the conservatives watch and she do not say a word i be confident that those number will come down the bank of england be confident that they will come down too which be why we have see interest rate cut in a row i notice that the right hon lady can not resist grab any opportunity to talk the country down she do not mention the growth figure the interest rate figure the record investment wage be up more than price the job create or the trade deal the reason be that the conservatives have not learn and they have not change as george osborne say the leader of the opposition do not have a credible economic plan 
 that be laughable from the prime minister he know that inflation be bring down by we to 2%—bang on target we be react to a war in ukraine that bring inflation up all over europe while he be do trade deal with country such as the us and india their inflation be go down but it be go up here why the office for national statistics say that the inflation figure be drive by significant increase in household bill we warn he repeatedly that this be exactly what would happen what his policy would do we call it awful april the prime minister come into office say that he would tackle the cost of living crisis he have fail he have not get a clue have he 
 the right hon lady talk of the conservatives record there be the disastrous liz truss mini budget inflation be through the roof there be a £ black hole living standard be at an all time low energy price go through the roof and mortgage go through the roof we be take measure to bring price down the eu deal will bring price down that be why supermarket have welcome it what do she do she oppose measure to bring price down 
 the prime minister need to stop whine about what the last government do and look at what he be do he be the prime minister look at the number this morning as if inflation figure be not bad enough we have also learn that the deputy prime minister be on manoeuvre the prime minister have lose control of the economy and he have lose control of his cabinet the deputy prime minister be sit there star at i she know exactly what she be do when she brief the paper she be demand new tax rise as if we have not suffer enough people out there be struggle business be struggle   people be lose their job we can not have more tax rise will the prime minister rule out new tax rise this year 
 the right hon lady have not learn or change the conservatives lose the election because of their appalling record on the nhs on health on prison you name it now she accuse everyone of whine about the impact that have on the country it have a huge impact on work people across the country and they be absolutely right to complain about it she want to talk about the deputy prime minister the deputy prime minister work with the chancellor be build new home reform our planning system put £ into our economy and bring forward an employment rights bill which will be the single big upgrade to worker right in a generation 
 that be desperate stuff the whole house will have hear the prime minister refuse to rule out new tax rise the whole house hear it he do not rule they out there be open warfare in his cabinet the deputy prime minister be clearly call the shot what have we learn we be head for new tax rise we know that inflation be up it be just more and more bad news from a prime minister who have lose control we hear the prime minister ’s early answer on winter fuel let we try to get some more information i shall ask he a simple question it require only word yes or no be he plan to u turn on winter fuel cut 
 i make it clear in my early answer that as the economy improve we want to take measure that will impact people ’s life so we will look at the threshold but that will have to be part of a fiscal event the conservatives lose control of every element of the economy of prison of border of the nhs you name it and now she have lose control of her party the conservatives be slide into oblivion they will have to trade on their past because that be all they have 
 i make it really easy for the prime minister it be a simple question yes or no and he could not answer it i wonder how the public feel about a man who can not give a straight answer to a simple question look at the mps behind he they be all cheer when this inevitable u turn on winter fuel come and it will from a desperate prime minister what will he say to the mp who go over the top and vote for the winter fuel cut last september just like the british public how can any of they ever trust he again 
 it be only because of the measure that we have take that the economy be improve with growth at the high rate in the g7 interest rate cut and trade deal because country want to trade with we those thing be because of the decision that we have make and all those decision be oppose by conservative members they have learn absolutely nothing and they be go absolutely nowhere 
 this be a prime minister who say he be take measure but the job tax be kill job inflation be up and business confidence be down everyone be worried he promise to cut bill but today we see that they be rise because of his policy he promise   not to raise taxis on work people but his job tax mean that people be lose their job every week we come here with a new company that say it be shed job and that be on his watch he promise to protect pensioner but his winter fuel cut have drive thousand into hardship his mp hate this he can not see they but they all look sick just hear what it he be go to do interruption they be laughing—[interruption 
 order i expect well from whip and to boyzone at the back i have my eye on you 
 mr speaker—[interruption 
 order which of you want to leave interruption there we be we have the volunteer be you go to behave i call the leader of the opposition to respond 
 his mp be laugh just as they laugh at the budget hand up who here want winter fuel cut not a single of they the fact be this prime minister be destroy they they need to look at what they be do to the country the truth be and we all know it that it be this prime minister this labour government and their policy that be shaft the country be it not 
 they look in pretty good form to i and there be lot of they the leader of the opposition talk about business confidence i do not have time yesterday to read out all the business that have come out in support of our eu deal and i do not have time today it be a long list i go immediately to lidl and speak to the staff there they be delighted with the deal we put forward yesterday business like the work we be do and it be give they confidence in the eu deal but the right hon lady be oppose to each and every measure 
 i recently visit barrow hill primary school in my constituency a school in receipt of a new free breakfast club the team there be do a fantastic job but challenge remain what more can we do as a government to support both they and local parent to give the child of barrow hill the start in life that they deserve 
 i thank my hon friend we be unite by a share focus on create well life chance for our child and i be delighted to hear that her constituent be already benefit from our change thank to our plan for change we will deliver free breakfast club in every primary school in england i be determined to support parent to give every child the good start in life that be why we be roll out free childcare expand the school base nursery and deliver more family hub 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 can i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark about the terrible fire in bicester last thursday i know from my hon friend   the member for bicester and woodstock calum miller   how deeply the close knit community   there have be affect by this tragedy the firefighter martyn sadler and jennie logan be true hero as be dave chester i hope that the prayer and thought of the house be with their love one and the firefighter still in hospital 
 the prime minister have rightly say that his new trade deal will give a much need boost to economic growth and thus the public finance but will he make sure that struggle family and pensioner see the benefit of this growth he tease the house in his answer to   the hon member for luton north sarah owen will he commit now to reverse his cut to the winter fuel payment in full 
 i thank the right hon member for his comment about the bicester tragedy it be important that in a moment like this the house come together we be take measure to help with the cost of living crisis the eu deal yesterday be so important because of the impact it will have on price particularly in supermarket that will directly benefit those who be affect by the cost of living crisis 
 what i say before be that the economy be begin to improve but people be still feel the pressure that be why we be take the measure we be take and strike the trade deal we be strike as it improve i want people to feel the benefit of the measure we be take that be why i want to ensure that more pensioner be eligible for the winter fuel allowance it be important as member would expect that we be clear that we can afford the decision we be make that be why this will now be look at in a fiscal event 
 i think that i welcome what the prime minister have say but we will look at the detail i hope that he will use some of these new proceed to help other like carer the government ’s change to the personal independence payment will have big consequence for family carer like ginny who care for her husband tim who have myotonic dystrophy ginny hold her husband ’s hand to keep he steady as he walk he fall frequently and choke on his food ginny be the sole earner in the family she work part time on top of care for tim but she have calculate that under the government ’s cut her family will lose £ a year will the prime minister tell ginny and many family carer like she what he expect they to do 
 we have approach this on the basis of the principle that we must support those who need support on the question of get people into work we should support people into work where they can work and of course where they can work they should but it be undeniable that the current arrangement do not work and need to be reform that be why we be bring forward necessary reform to ensure that the system work well 
 yesterday in this place i read the victim impact statement that cheryl korbel never get to say to her daughter ’s killer thomas cashman because he refuse to face she in court i be make up that olivia ’s law pass reading but until it get royal assent criminal can still not show up deny victim justice will the prime minister commit to make sure that olivia ’s law become law as fast as possible 
 i thank my hon friend for read that victim impact statement i know from talk to cheryl how hard it be for she to make that victim impact statement in the place it take a huge amount of courage and grief she want to read that statement to the perpetrator as she should have be able to do i know from the meeting that i have have with she how visceral the pain be to she of not have be able to do so i therefore thank my hon friend for read that impact statement out in the chamber allow it to be hear by the whole world 
 coward who commit these heinous crime should face the consequence of their action which have a huge impact on victim life that be why we will force offender to attend their sentencing hearing with long sentence unlimited fine and prison sanction for those who seek to avoid face justice i pay tribute again to cheryl who i will meet later this afternoon for have the incredible courage to push for that change notwithstanding the incredibly painful impact it have have on she and her family 
 the government assure we that northern ireland be still in the united kingdom ’s custom union if so how be it that british steel can be sell to the united states tariff free but that same british steel if sell into northern ireland be subject to eu tariff why on monday do the prime minister not even try to take back control over the trade law that govern northern ireland 
 it be important that we reduce tariff on steel into the us market and other market include the eu market for obvious reason it be also vital that we seek to ensure that we reduce any barrier in trade within the united kingdom as a whole yesterday be a step towards that there be further work to do but we do want to get to that place where we can trade without those barrier in the united kingdom we will continue to work on that 
 the prime minister will know that thrive high street be essential to local growth but in city such as mine people be increasingly concern by the uncontrolled growth of bet shop and vape store research show that that concern be not isolate nearly half of bet shop and gambling store be in the of place that be struggle the most such as peterborough will the prime minister ask his departments to meet i and campaigner so that we can discuss way that local community such as mine can take back control of our high street 
 my hon friend be an excellent champion for his constituent we be commit to support our nation ’s high street to adapt and thrive planning application be require for any new bet office to ensure that local have a say on individual case and that community can use the planning system to allow for a change of use of their property i will ensure that my hon friend get the meeting that he have ask for 
 on friday the environment food and rural affairs committee publish its report on the government ’s vision for agriculture the committee agree with the   government that land purchase be use to shelter wealth from inheritance tax be a problem that need to be tackle as a cross party committee with a government majority however we take the unanimous view that the government ’s current proposal for inheritance tax reform will catch too many family farm that will simply not be able to pay the bill we ask for the change to be pause and rework will the prime minister listen to the select committee and those on his own benches who want to tackle tax evasion and support the farmer who keep produce food for the nation ’s table 
 the right hon gentleman know the very limited impact of the inheritance tax only on farmer at a very high level he will also know the record amount of money in the budget that we put into farming and the measure take yesterday with the eu deal which will massively help farmer who sell their product into the eu market 
 the   wrexham shropshire and midlands railway be on track to link north wales and my shrewsbury constituency directly to london with train daily strengthen cross border travel and fuel this government ’s mission to drive economic growth with member from constituency along the route already on board will the prime minister support our journey and urge the office of rail and road to give wsmr ’s open access application the green signal 
 our plan for change will see the railway reform to deliver more reliable and well value service for passenger right across the country my hon friend have be a champion for well railway and easy journey for her constituent open access operator have huge potential to offer passenger more choice i will be delighted to ensure that she and other interested mps meet the rail minister to put their case forward 
 i think i be right in say that the prime minister might be a lawyer train to review evidence and reach judgment when he look at the effect of his decision cut the winter fuel payment and make pensioner poor damage business with the job tax decimate rural community with the family farm tax and risk our food security by sell off our fishing water surely he can review the evidence and see the verdict will the prime minister throw those damaging policy out of his court once and for all before they do any more harm 
 the evidence be certainly come in the high growth in the g7 interest rate cut in a row and trade deal with country across the world that want to do deal with this country because they can see the stability that this government have bring about instability with the conservatives stability and growth with this labour government 
 it be national epilepsy week and we be join in the public gallery by england rugby player tommy freeman who be diagnose with epilepsy at but who through effective treatment have go on to be   select for the british and irish lions i hope the prime minister will join i in congratulate he on that great achievement 
 for a of epilepsy sufferer however seizure can not be control by medication as in the case of my constituent ben lacey who suffer multiple seizure every single day ben will never be able to work yet he have be subject to the stress and uncertainty of multiple pip reassessment will the prime minister reaffirm his commitment to ensure that people such as ben who have lifelong condition and who can not work will be protect from those damaging reassessment and give the support they need to live with dignity 
 may i begin by congratulate tommy and everyone select to represent the british and irish lions it be an incredible achievement and we will be cheer they on 
 it be important that we protect those with severe disability or lifelong health condition who can not work pay they a premium and stop those reassessment which be part of the reform that we be bring about ultimately we also need to get back to face to face assessment by train assessor and health professional which fall to only in assessment under the previous government 
 this prime minister keep tell his gullible back benchers that he have deport people from this country since he come into power but he will not say who these people be it be my guess that they be people who come on work visa or student and that they be simply overstayer but i be willing to be prove wrong if he can answer simple question how many of these people that he have deport be fail asylum seeker that have come on small boat or on the back of lorry answer the question 
 i be very proud that we have remove over people the high record for nearly year we be take other measure to get back control of our border include the borders bill which give our law enforcement enhance power include terrorism like power what do the hon member ’s party do what do he do he vote against they and i will tell you why they do not want to fix this problem because it benefit they not to fix it party before country

 my hon friend rightly and powerfully raise the broken promise of the scottish national party on mental health service this be important and we will have positive discussion with the devolved government to work on address mental health waiting time the snp promise to invest in frontline mental health service then cut they by £ in real term this year with a record settlement in the budget and decade in power the snp be out of excuse and out of idea scotland deserve well than that 
 if the prime minister agree that the israeli government starve child to death be monstrous why do he think it be okay for the uk to continue to sell israel the equipment for the fighter jet to drop bomb on those starve child 
 what we contribute into a pot be part for fighter jet and if we be to stop that they could not be use by other country in other conflict include those in which we be involved—[interruption the hon member do not know the detail at all they be not sell directly they go into a pot if we be to stop that they would not then be available to other around the world who desperately need they in the conflict they be engage in and that be why we will not do it 
 the   dementia gateway in my constituency be recently at risk of closure follow £ worth of budget cut by the conservative run dudley council the gateway be a vital service for dementia patient and their carer provide daytime activity and advice and support from train adviser follow a well fight campaign with cross party support the dementia gateway have be save in this dementia action week will the prime minister join i in congratulate lisa and the campaigner do he agree that such service be essential and that they support the government ’s mission to provide quality care in our community close to home

 do the prime minister agree that imprison lucy connolly a young mother with a year old daughter for foolish social medium post that be soon delete be clearly not an efficient or fair use of prison 
 sentencing be a matter for our court and i celebrate the fact that we have independent court in this country i be strongly in favour of free speech we have have free speech in this country for a very long time and we protect it fiercely but i be equally against incitement to violence against other   people and i will always support the action take by our police and court to keep our street and people safe 
 i recently visit st catherine ’s hospice in lostock hall which serve wonderfully my constituent in south ribble those of ribble valley and some of your constituent in chorley mr speaker i discover that the hospice have to pay an excessive £ a year for medication which can only be source from the private sector not the nhs after some investigate i find that there be a postcode lottery for integrated care board some icb be fully fund and supply all medication some subsidise it and some do not supply it at all evidence show that there be a disparity between hospice in the more deprived area not be fund and those in the more affluent area be fund will the prime minister please speak with the health secretary as a matter of urgency and get free medication supply by all icb to all hospice across the country 
 we have put record amount into the nhs in the budget and we be begin to see the result of that i accept the point that my hon friend make and we will look again to ensure that the money be properly use in the most efficient way 
 a month ago i be deny entry into hong kong on a private visit in the absence of any explanation this seem to hint at a hide blacklist aim to silence any mp from any political party who speak up against human right abuse by the chinese government do the prime minister agree that this be an attack on all of we and will he personally seek reassurance from the hong kong authority that no british parliamentarian will be deny entry in that way again 
 the hon lady ’s experience be deeply concern and i know it must have affect she i think she be hop to see and later see her grandchild but it must have impact on she and it be deeply concern we need to recognise that minister include the foreign secretary have raise it on numerous occasion with their counterpart both in china and hong kong prevent uk citizen include member of parliament from enter hong kong without justification or for simply express their view be completely unacceptable it will only undermine hong kong ’s international reputation and the relationship we have with it and so we will continue to raise it 
 you will know mr speaker that i have raise on several occasion in the house the case of alaa abd el fattah the british egyptian human right campaigner who have be imprison in egypt for many year and whose mother laila go on a day hunger strike i thank   the prime minister for fulfil his promise to contact president sisi of egypt to secure alaa ’s release but unfortunately month on alaa remain in prison and this week laila start her hunger strike again could i appeal to the prime minister to again speak directly to president sisi to secure alaa ’s release 
 i thank the right hon member for raise this case not just today but on the many occasion that he have it be incredibly important that we do everything we can in this case i have meet laila and give she my commitment to do everything i possibly can i have have a number of contact myself but i will not stop do everything within my power to secure that release

 on behalf of the whole house i welcome teddy it be incredible that he have do so much already and he be in the gallery today many of we struggle for a whole lifetime to make an impact on government policy but teddy be already have an impact age i will make sure that he get to speak to the relevant minister 
 follow on from the question ask by my hon friend   the member for stourbridge cat eccles this week be national epilepsy week an important opportunity to raise awareness of a condition that affect so many but often remain invisible epilepsy come with fear and uncertainty the anxiety about have a seizure the impact of lose a drive licence and the worry about medication shortage in the uk in people live with epilepsy which work out as up to of we in the chamber include myself will the prime minister join i and the inspire campaigner watch from the gallery in mark national epilepsy week as we continue to raise awareness of seizure 
 i congratulate my hon friend on her tireless campaign on this issue alongside the campaigner who be with we today i know the impact that epilepsy have on people across the country include on over child and young people we be committed to improve care for people with neurological condition and we be set up the uk wide neuro forum to improve treatment and care for those with such condition 
 on a point of order mr speaker may i put on the record the sad passing yesterday of patrick o’flynn a political journalist who be well known to many hon member he die after a short battle with cancer he be a lobby journalist for some year spend many day week and month in the press gallery he will be much miss and i pass on the condolence of all hon member to his wife carole ann and his child

 i think the hon lady know exactly what she be go to do next but she have certainly put the matter on the record and i hope member on the treasury bench have hear i find it pretty appalling that government departments be not answer correspondence from all member from all political party on time in the end back benchers be answerable to their constituent and if departments can not provide a reply they be let down hon member i hope the relevant official be listen and answer as i speak 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require the secretary of state to publish an assessment of the effectiveness of current regulation of the debt collection and civil enforcement sector and to report to parliament on the potential merit of statutory regulation of those sector and for connected purpose 
 today i introduce the regulation of bailiffs assessment and report bill we be in this place to speak up when other can not and to put right what be clearly wrong this bill to get a grip on rogue bailiff do exactly that 
 i want to share some truly heartbreaking story story of vulnerable people leave petrified in their own home and disabled people terrify that vital equipment could be wrongfully take from they it be time that despicable practice in the enforcement sector come to an end for the thousand across the country who have suffer serious injustice at the hand of cold hearted rogue bailiff those who have bring shame to their own industry i come into politic to fight for social justice and that be why i be proud to be a labour mp but nothing have fuel that fight more than hear from those crush by the bad element of the enforcement sector their pain and their story have imprint themselves on i with lasting force and it be for they that i be absolutely determined to change the law 
 let i thank stepchange and particularly sophie morris who be in the gallery today i also want to give credit to the enforcement conduct board know as the ecb which voluntarily regulate of the sector in my view it should oversee this regulation at present it issue guideline for the enforcement sector but that of course be the issue these guideline lack legal heft 
 the statute of marlborough which pass in during the reign of henry iii be of england ’s old piece of legislation still partly in force today it show that even year ago people be think about the need for fair debt collection yet here we be today face with the same challenge 
 as a former regulator at the financial conduct authority i understand the importance of set clear standard the last change to enforcement law be make about a decade ago and introduce a stage process and strong protection for vulnerable people despite those change aggressive practice and inconsistent standard still exist that be why the independent ecb be create in to voluntarily oversee the sector accord to citizens advice in people who have have contact with a bailiff have experience behaviour that break ministry of justice expectation and even among the bailiff that be regulate under its current scope of visit be deem too aggressive by the ecb that equate to hundred if not thousand of visit a year that be why we need a fair and proportionate debt collection system 
 i want to tell members michael ’s story he be an inspirational chap who i welcome to parliament last week michael ’s story begin with an horrific motorbike accident that completely upend his life he sustain   injury that make he unable to walk or stand and after a lengthy spell in hospital get by on sick pay alone he lose his job during this time he receive a letter demand a full year ’s council tax to be pay at once by the way we must end that punitive rule that be trigger when someone miss just council tax payment i be grateful to martin lewis for campaign on that and i welcome the government ’s consultation too 
 return to michael ’s story bailiff be send to collect the council tax he be at home bedridden and unable to move the bailiff visit repeatedly but he could not hear their knock or get out of bed despite that they unfairly add extra charge to his debt for their visit he be leave without carpet and with a broken bed and a broken boiler on top of all this he be prepare to become a dad what should have be a proud and exciting moment in his life become of immense stress and fear fear that the bailiff give that they have nothing else leave to take might seize his baby daughter ’s toy her change table or even her cot as a father i could sense the deeply personal pain behind that fear the heartbreak of possibly fail she in the way he still feel he could provide 
 michael go from be a homeowner with a near perfect credit score to nearly lose everything i be pleased to say that he be back on his foot and although he be still pay the debt off he be hop to clear it soon he be do well i take he out on to the terrace last week in the sunshine and we reflect on how unfair bailiff practice have add to his hardship 
 i also recently meet adam who get into debt through fall behind on council tax and card repayment after lose an agency job and struggle to find new work his experience like many other begin with letter and end with visit to his home as be often the case with rogue bailiff the visit be aggressive and intimidating force his foot in the door threaten to come in which break virtually every rule in the book adam tell i it be like 
 someone be try to boot down the door 
 he immediately tell the bailiff that he have a disability and be class as vulnerable the bailiff say that he   do not care and would take away adam ’s belonging regardless a bailiff say that he do not care what cruelty 
 the enforcement system be break and punish those who be already struggle when rule allow such passive cruel indifference to people in crisis it be not about bailiff in moment it be about the sort of society we want to be adam have government fund equipment for his disability a specially adapt device but again the bailiff say that he do not care and would take it anyway adam contact stepchange its adviser help he to come up with a payment plan which the bailiff wrongfully refuse he become genuinely terrified of be at home on his own 
 adam have make progress with his debt and i welcome he to parliament last week alongside michael both case be litter with dozen of example of unregulated rogue bailiff activity the ecb do a good job but many bailiff be not in its perimeter statutory regulation would enable it to be even firm and to drive up standard so it be time for the government to fix the regulation in the enforcement sector 
 i do not want anyone in this country to have to worry about lose their disability equipment or their child ’s toy no should ever have to face the same hardship year of conservative government see only a few although welcome tweak to the law that have to change the labour party be build on principle of social justice equality and fairness that be why we need to bring bailiff regulation on to a statutory footing change the life of million of people in the process for michael and adam and in honour of all that they and countless other have endure let we bring in statutory regulation of the debt and civil enforcement sector once and for all 
 question put and agree to 
 order 
 that mr luke charters adam jogee david williams alex baker david burton sampson amanda martin callum anderson lee pitcher mike reader alison hume euan stainbank and dr allison gardner present the bill 
 mr luke charters accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday june and to be print bill 
 i inform the house that i have not select the amendment 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i beg to move 
 that this house regret that unemployment be rise and cause misery for young people in particular that this government have display a negligible understanding of business and that investor and entrepreneur be be drive overseas far regret that over business have close since labour take office as a result of the government ’s policy to raise employer national insurance contribution in breach of the labour party manifesto commitment to scrap business property relief to impose £ of additional cost on business through the employment rights bill and increase to business rate and call on the government to urgently change course to support jobseeker small and medium sized enterprise family business and entrepreneur who take risk to create wealth and job that benefit people across the country 
 allow i to paint a picture a small business owner navigate the early morning darkness to their high street shop they twist the key and lift the shutter they turn on the light the card machine the heater and the shop music they open the door in time for their customer of the day put to the back of their mind the question of how to meet the rise cost place on they by this government the taxis they have to pay before they open that door and the unreformed business rate with many more than double how will they pay the job tax on their staff how will they ever keep their business intact when they seek to pass it to their child after they have go not single person around the cabinet table truly understand those pressure yet this labour government have cross the road to start a fight with britain ’s business 
 when it come to business the government have break every of their promise member on the government benches look business owner in the eye at the election and tell they that they would be on their side but it take barely day for this labour government to revert to type at the autumn budget the chancellor slap a £ job tax on business mean that employer will have to pay an additional £ a year for an employee on the median wage accord to the institute for fiscal studies 
 only a few week later the business secretary table the now page trade union dictate employment rights bill drown employer in red tape helen dickinson the ceo of the british retail consortium say that business be 
 leave with little choice but to increase price 
 as we have see today—“or to reduce investment the ceo of ukhospitality kate nicholls say that these measure 
 will simply force business to cut job freeze recruitment cancel plan investment reduce trading hour and in the bad case scenario close their door for good 
 rise 
 i will give way 
 my hon friend be so popular i be interested by how he be start this debate because it chime with what i be hear in my constituency where venue such as pub restaurant and cafe which be such a vital part of the effort to regenerate our high street and local community space be see their margin slash because of the cost of labour and the increase in business rate do he agree that labour ’s job tax and the ending of business rate relief be put the regeneration of our town centre and community space at risk 
 how tragic be it that from gosport to gloucester and everywhere between business on our high street be close this government do not understand that if they do understand they do not care and if they care they have not act the message from this government to anyone willing to put their capital time and energy on the line by take risk to create wealth as a business owner be abundantly clear 
 exactly to that point be it not a shame that for the time ever since record begin in the number of new business register at companies house have fall the exact risk take behaviour that we need to grow the economy be not take place be that not a damn indictment of what this government be do 
 my hon friend make an incredibly important point i believe that all of we come to this house to try to do our good and to grow the economy but any government face with that terrible metric about the failure rate and formation rate of business would be act immediately with haste and reverse so many of the measure the choice this government have make have deliver precisely the outcome my hon friend describe 
 pub be the lifeblood of community particularly in rural constituency such as mine in broadland and fakenham people could perhaps make an argument for individual tax rise but it be the combination of in particular that be hit pub so badly it be the increase in the minimum wage the government be very good at increase price for everyone else but not themselves as well as the removal of business rate relief for hospitality and leisure and the rise in national insurance contribution for employer the latter point be not so much about the overall percentage rise but the reduction in the threshold from £ to £ which particularly impact those who employ part time staff and those on low wage it be a triple whammy on pub be that why so many be close across the country 
 my hon friend make exactly the right point about that triple whammy and about the cumulative effect of change and the consequence potentially unintended that manifest themselves most acutely in industry such as uk hospitality and retail which have the great virtue among many other of contribute to the character of the place in which we live and give so many young people their step on the ladder of opportunity and their experience of   work without those business it will be inexorably hard for young people that be reason that it be of such great concern that the number of people employ on payroll under this government have already fall by with a fast rate of decline in the quarter of this year this government be perfectly position to achieve the unbroken track record of every labour government in modern history of leave office with unemployment high than when they start 
 do my hon friend agree that another factor that will undermine job creation and employment under this government be their approach to international wealth come into this country when other country such as the us be grant golden visa we be close the door with these ideologically drive non dom reform which will not even raise any money if the government want to increase job opportunity they should take the chance at the next budget to reverse that foolhardy policy 
 my right hon friend be exactly right he will correct i if i be wrong but as i understand it millionaire be leave our wonderful country every minute that be to say nothing of a generation of young people who be yet to have their opportunity how tragic it would be to think that young people see great opportunity notwithstanding their birthright of be bear in this wonderful country in other part of the world than be present on their doorstep in their community and in the heart of their family 
 it have to be say that this government ’s combination of action be send a clear and regrettable message to those who seek to create wealth do not bother do not even try this socialist government do not want people to succeed there could be no well example of that than the vindictive family business and family farm death tax which will carve up successful business as and when they be hand down to the next generation 
 why do we think this vindictive policy exist of the more benign interpretation to be charitable be simply the dearth of business experience in the labour cabinet it have to be say though that the cabinet member be world class in their understanding of and potential avarice in relation to trade union perhaps that be why the secretary of state who have not deign to be here with we today be currently undertake the most expensive work experience placement in history at taxpayer expense at british steel in scunthorpe 
 it be not just that this government do not understand the mechanic of business they do not understand and value the principle of business run or invest in a business at its core be a profound act of human courage the triumph of optimism over inertia and a mindset of someone solve problem themselves rather than wait for permission from other it be about embrace risk know that there be no guarantee no bail out and that no be come to the rescue when enterprise succeed such people create the wealth that fund our public service 
 every time a minister dispense money and largesse in whitehall as this government be do at record velocity they can do so only because a founder an   entrepreneur or a businessman or businesswoman take that leap it should be the government ’s job to get out of their way and to help the business builder not the blocker but this labour government understand none of that instead of leave business to get on and flourish they have erect a blockade of bureaucracy and taxis that they promise would never come they have declare war on employer across this land from the rampart of westminster 
 my hon friend will know that business confidence have plummet since labour come to power do he agree that of the reason it have plummet be the loss of faith in this government business be promise that their plan be fully cost and fully fund in advance and there would be no increase business taxis but within day the government go back on that how can business ever trust this government again 
 my hon friend who be himself a very distinguished and successful businessman know exactly the importance of that intangible quality of confidence that the government have your back and you will not wake up in the morning and be hit with a £ job tax on which subject there be not word not syllable in the labour party manifesto we tour the studio joust with labour members and issue warning but we be meet with a repeat barrage of denial in respect of their £ job tax interruption the ministers be chuntere and there be probably a fair amount of chuntering to do if they have to explain an inability to balance the public finance along with an attempt to do so by mean of a set of vindictive and arithmetically incorrect taxis on business 
 we can move on from tax that be just of the many barrage face by business that be sap confidence and produce some of the very worrying statistic that we be see we could for instance move on to the unemployment rights bill which be an egregious example of red tape and state intervention and overreach at this point labour member be normally uncharacteristically quiet because they be aid and abet to the tune of £ by the trade union 
 the bill shackle the hand of employer in pub bar garden centre grocery store butcher hairdresser business root deep in our community with little clarity and no lead in time seasonal work could be make impossible by the bill it be certain that compliance cost will rocket there will be long delay for employment tribunal hearing in some part of the country the wait for a hearing be already approach month even accord to the government ’s own estimate on top of every other measure there will be a headwind cost for business of an unwanted £ a year 
 you have talk about the risk of seasonal job be lose as a consequence of the employment rights bill in my constituency it be a serious risk as a number of business have tell i would you say that the minister should withdraw the bill or at the very least conduct a proper assessment of its impact 
 order may i point out to prevent any further error that the term you be not use in the chamber because it refer to i in the chair hopefully no else will make the same mistake 
 no would believe madam deputy speaker that you would implement such terrible measure without a proper impact assessment more significant however be the fact that we have hear not just the voice of my hon friend   the member for bognor regis and littlehampton alison griffiths represent those important seasonal industry but the voice of employer across the country who have point out that it will no long be possible for seasonable and flexible work to deliver the economy that we need 
 the problem with the employment rights bill be not only its imply cost and the red tape it will introduce but the fact that it be a poor piece of legislation in the place the government ’s own regulatory independent commission have say that of the criterion be not fit for purpose do my hon friend not agree that if the bill be to proceed it should be rework 
 my hon friend be exactly right if labour members be honest enough to do so they would admit that the bill be a rush piece of legislation it be introduce because of an arbitrary promise to do so within day and it be introduce at half its current length which mean that of the word that it now contain the red tape that our business will have to implement and wrestle with for year to come do not even benefit from scrutiny in this place many of the power in the bill be not flesh out or clarify we will wreak great havoc and uncertainty on business if the government be determined to proceed it would be far well for they to shelve the bill to listen to learn and then to come back so that we could use the proper mechanism of this house to do our job for all our constituent to avoid the unintended consequence and the damage that i do not believe anyone would want 
 in that spirit of listening and learning i have be speak to business in my constituency this week and the chamber of commerce have signal that the trade deal be a new start for british business because it be reduce red tape give certainty to business and allow they to trade and do well in my constituency and elsewhere do you think they be wrong 
 order do you think they be wrong we have a long afternoon ahead of we even long for i in the chair 
 have to celebrate small mercy and i be delighted by the hon gentleman ’s conversion to the cause of free trade free trade be what have lift billion of people in the world out of poverty it have make we the great country that we be today the business in the hon gentleman ’s constituency that have form such a clear view have obviously benefit from considerably more detail than the house so perhaps he will share its name we would be very happy to hear about the detail of the trade agreement that have be reach 
 perhaps in have that conversation with his local business the hon gentleman would like to engage in a discussion about its view on the employment rights bill despite legion opportunity that i and other have give ministers to name a single business that be in favour of all the measure in the bill answer still come there none 
 may i tell my hon friend why i think   the hon member for peterborough andrew pakes   be wrong since the very inception of our negotiation to join what be then the common market now the european union it have attach huge importance to fishing we have just hand over the enormous leverage of an annual negotiation and for what absolutely nothing 
 andrew griffith match that passion 
 i hesitate to stray into the matter of fishing which i suspect we will debate many time in the future but i note that those on the other government benches next to we table an amendment which have not be select for debate but which seek to shackle our small business far by have we reverse across a much broad range of topic than the pass that the government already sell early this week so that we become a taker of rule from brussels and our small business entrepreneur and founder be crush by the red tape that would originate there 
 fishing be sector but there be a clause in the employment rights bill that affect all business at this point i should draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as a former entrepreneur who have employ well over people in my time the problem be that if day employment right be impose for any hire it will be a massive disincentive for business to take a chance and take on people who be more vulnerable the young and the less well qualified why would a business take that chance if it risk be haul up over day employment right 
 once again my hon friend have demonstrate his deep and real knowledge of business have himself in a past life employ more than people rather suspect that take that risk have that responsibility and shoulder that burden moral and financial be great than the entire aggregate responsibility of labour members for hire anyone my hon friend have make the right point about who will end up on the receive end of the high unemployment it will be the young look for their opportunity and it will be exclude and vulnerable group on whom a benign employer would today take a chance but not if that chance be likely to lead immediately to be at the back of an month long queue for an employment tribunal hearing 
 the point make by   the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew   be about day right but that right be to stop unfair dismissal from day be it now the policy of the conservative party to allow for unfair dismissal between the and day if   the shadow minister be unhappy with that be a right from day presumably he be unhappy for people to have that right at all 
 i be afraid that to make those point be to misconstrue wilfully what be actually in the bill we have a very settled and balanced position of employment right that date back to before previous labour government as well as the government in office before the election it strike what will always be a difficult balance between offer employee the chance to enter the workforce and the ability of business and of the public sector and other to hire and to operate in a way that be profitable it do nobody any favour to think that we can merely by pass word of statute change the outcome in a way that advantage the most vulnerable who be the young employee the failure to learn from that point will once again lead to exactly the same outcome which be why every labour government have leave office with unemployment high than where it start in his response the minister may wish to confirm that this time will be different and perhaps lay out exactly why it will be different but he have a job of work to convince we and more importantly every employer in the land that that be the case 
 the shadow minister take a casual swipe at the business acuman of ministers and i wonder whether i can encourage he to develop that point when i speak to business in angus and perthshire glens about the change that have be institute since july last year they be incredulous that anybody with even a pass knowledge of business enterprise or entrepreneurialism of any nature would put such roadblock in the way of business and wealth creation would he like to expand on that 
 i thank the hon gentleman for make that very perceptive observation i hate to say this but i be not make a casual point it be a consider point when we think about how this house continue to legislate and tax in a way that reduce economic growth that do not celebrate a culture of entrepreneurialism and founder and that be lead to high employment with few people on payroll than there be a year ago we should all look deep into our soul what be the endemic failure in parliament and of this government in particular that be lead so quickly to precisely those outcome 
 it be sad to say that sometimes there be a lack of voice for business although do not want every single sector to be represent in this place the compensatory mechanism for that involve consultation and diligent impact assessment in introduce legislation this government have be serially criticise for the way that they have casually discard such measure and the treasury math simply do not add up 
 i think it go wide than that across the top of government because member on both side of this house be grapple with what to do about people who be long term unemployed if we make it more likely that company will not take a risk on get someone back into work while increase unemployment   at the same time we will create a toxic concoction at a time that we be try to get people back into job because we know that that be well for the economy and well for they their health and their family do my hon friend agree 
 i do indeed agree we ought to confront how we have get here i acknowledge that it have happen over a period of time with so many young people unable to work get an education or be in productive training that be a headwind on the economy and a moral failure of we all the question that we should confront ourselves with be this what be we do each and every day in this place to give opportunity to young people and the other of work age who remain stubbornly on welfare while improve our public finance and make the maximum use of the wonderful resource education and skill of the british people so that we can grow our economy and be the prosperous nation that we once again deserve to be 
 my hon friend talk about the message of this government and just last week i speak to a generation immigrant who talk about the message for entrepreneur in this country she say if you can not hand on more to the next generation through your own hard work what ’s the point she be right be n’t she 
 she be right and that be of the chill headwind that anyone who want to grow the economy and anyone who serve in the wonderful department for business and trade or our treasury should confront we should be go back to official and challenge exactly that how can we achieve a culture vibe shift on growth and entrepreneurship that be the good contribution that we could all make 
 may i just take my hon friend back to what he be say a moment ago about opportunity for young people i recently meet hair and beauty salon in my constituency as he know they have historically be the most amazing employer of apprentice and have give such wonderful chance to young people i be worried to hear that the rate at which they be take on apprentice be drop off by there will be no apprentice leave in the sector it be not just hair and beauty say that other sector in my constituency such as adult social care and early year education be say the same be he as worried as i be about the lack of opportunity for our young generation 
 yes i be enormously worried we have to understand and make the connection that it be only the private sector that truly create sustainable job we need people to work in our wonderful public service but ultimately growth and opportunity come from the expansion of the private sector which be most encapsulate by female lead business such as those in the hair and beauty sector they often survive on small margin deal with lot of different piece of regulation and try to keep our high street and community alive as well as perform i suspect rather a well service for my hon friend than for i and some other colleague it be a valuable and vital industry 
 we ought to ram this point home so that the minister understand before he stand up he have plenty of time to think this through and provide we with a sensible answer rather than something that be off the cuff so here be a note of warning this morning i attend an event run by of the national clearing bank which be put a huge amount of effort into try to create and help its customer to create opportunity for young people the bank have come up with a raft of good idea but every single of they this point be make very clearly will hit the roadblock of the government ’s employment legislation where be the sense in that if my hon friend do not have the answer the minister no doubt will have 
 let we hope that the minister do indeed have an answer i be somebody who always travel optimistically and though we have spar on the important subject of the page word employment rights bill it be never too late that bill be undergo scrutiny in the other house as we speak and the opposition would welcome and support the government ’s shelve it until we have deal with the cacophony of headwind that my hon friend   the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew   talk about early include the change to the tax system and other change the damage that have already be inflict on the economy the headwind on cost that we see this morning with inflation high than the bank of england ’s target rate which will mean that interest rate be high for long and the failure to reform business rate there be an opportunity to revisit bring forward specific proposal on employment to enduringly reduce business rate if the government feel a burn desire to do so 
 my right hon friend   the member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale   be quite right would it not be good if the minister could use the ample time that we have this afternoon to consult and to bring forward some sensible answer that will give we all confidence that we be go to see a government who be properly on the side of business 
 do the shadow secretary of state agree that the cumulative effect of all the government ’s measure over the past month a £ job tax the £ burden of the employment rights bill the removal of business property relief which be reduce the incentive to be an entrepreneur will be to drive unemployment high 
 of course i agree with my hon friend but it do not actually matter what i or other think because the reality be that the data do not lie as of now we have few people on payroll than we do month ago so the data be already tell we about the cumulative chilling effect of those measure 
 that be perhaps unintended we learn today that the chancellor and the deputy prime minister be at odd and perhaps the business secretary be the leg on that stool with each of they bring forward measure that be enormously damaging to business they be perhaps not add up the sum and see eye to eye to understand the live experience of what it be like to be a business on the receive end of all of those change cumulatively and all at the same time 
 many business will from the start of april this year not only face a payroll increase of around 10%—in an economy without such a level of topline growth so that hit margin directly but because of the failure of the government to maintain business rate relief at anything like the same level for our retail hospitality and leisure have see their business rate double imagine that all hit a business on   april   this year 
 i be a little startled to be describe as sit on the other government bench but perhaps that be the shape of thing to come who know i do not have my crystal ball with i 
 there have be a predictably negative barrage from the opposition which do not surprise i because that be how we work in this place but thinking of business there be business that from this year will get well in my constituency and indeed in that of   the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan i be talk about the seed potato industry we have be cry out to get the good scottish seed potato into european market and i therefore do thank the government it mean a lot to farmer and i have have very positive comment about it i be be absolutely fair minded about that 
 i be enormously glad and we should be balance that we have find something that go the other way i be not sure if can subsist entirely on a seed potato it may have be try historically and not with enormous success but i congratulate the hon member on the success of his seed potato industry
