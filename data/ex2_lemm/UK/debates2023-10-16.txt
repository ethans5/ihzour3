 that lilian greenwood be discharge from the committee of selection and holly lynch be added.—(mr marcus jones 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what his policy be on the use of brownfield land for new development 
 the government strongly encourage the reuse of suitable brownfield land our national planning policy framework make it clear that local authority should give substantial weight to the value of use suitable brownfield land within settlement for home and other identify need the levelling up and regeneration bill will far empower local leader to regenerate urban centre by strengthen and add to exist measure 
 homes england propose to build up to house on greenfield site west of ifield in my constituency what directive have my right hon friend ’s department give to the executive agency homes england on the department ’s brownfield building policy 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for raise that question i can not go into individual planning case but homes england be lead a programme of urban regeneration the work that we be do in london ’s dockland and in leeds sheffield wolverhampton and other area demonstrate our commitment both to level up and to make sure that for environmental and economic reason we develop brownfield land 
 my i help out the secretary of state he be aware of the grove lane site on the sandwell birmingham border in which the west midlands combined authority and its mayor be also interested it be opposite the new midland metropolitan university hospital site and it be an ideal brownfield site for housing will his department get on with it 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman who refer to the mayor of the west midlands combined authority the only metro mayor to significantly exceed housing target in the delivery of new home he be that rare thing a labour mp who welcome house building in his own constituency of course i will support he 
 i call the father of the house 
 my right hon friend may know that in durrington in north west worthing more than new home have be build will he ask his inspector and the leader of the opposition to recognise that chatsmore farm and lansdowne nurseries should not be build on we must have some green field between habitation and another 
 the father of the house make a very important point of course his beautiful constituency situate as it be between the sea and area of outstanding natural beauty have already see significant development and we do need to ensure that settlement have the green belt around they protect 
 on develop brownfield site will the secretary of state consider give power to council such as westmorland and furness and to planning authority such as those in the yorkshire dale and the lake district to ensure exclusive provision for affordable and social rent housing so that we do not see community such as ours die out because all the house build end up be sell for home 
 from his perspective as an assiduous constituency member the hon gentleman make a very good point but may i commiserate with he at the recent liberal democrat conference i be afraid he be defeat and his party adopt a housing policy that he describe as thatcherite it be a source of sadness to i to be outflank on the right by the liberal democrats but may i welcome more defection to the thatcherite cause from those who once embrace my right hon friend   the member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss   as of their own 
 my constituent be frustrate with the planning system in that although site be allocate and protect in neighbourhood plan when application come in their concern about those site be not listen to by local planning committee and by the inspectorate will the secretary of state tell my constituent in witham what measure be in place in local neighbourhood plan and local development plan to protect these site from be build on so that the focus be on brownfield site and foremost 
 my right hon friend make a very important point if her local authority have an up to date plan that be the good protection against speculative development if however a local authority do not have a plan in place there can be a presumption in favour of sustainable development and that can be uphold by the planning inspectorate which could mean development on site where local community do not wish to see it that be why it be so important for local authority to adopt plan 
 the secretary of state be a very clever man and he must know that if there have be a large amount of brownfield land it would have be build on the fact of the matter be that we in this country must bite the bullet and build on land other than brownfield because there be not enough of it do he agree that courage along with intellect would help we solve the housing problem 
 the hon gentleman be a man of independent mind and he be stray from front bench policy by decree i a man of intelligence that be not the official labour party position on these issue but i should say that he be right it be not only brownfield land that can be develop but it must be brownfield and there be significant room for additional brownfield development if we invest in urban regeneration which we be do 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the government ’s levelling up policy in reduce regional inequality 
 what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on support coastal community 
 i welcome the minister to the dispatch box 
 thank you very much mr speaker may i use this opportunity to pay tribute to my predecessor my hon friend   the member for bishop auckland dehenna davison who bravely use this moment to raise the challenge face by people with chronic migraine i thank she for her work and wish she the good of health hon member hear hear 
 we have establish levelling up mission principally aim at tackle regional inequality and ensure that wherever someone live in city town island rural or coastal community their opportunity be the same progress on the mission will be formally report through an annual report as set out in our landmark levelling up and regeneration bill which return to the house of commons tomorrow 
 the secretary of state say that we must have infrastructure that allow we to move towards emission vehicle as quickly as possible but the big city in the north of england have few electric vehicle charge point than the city of westminster   alone how do the chasm between the number of charge point in london and those elsewhere demonstrate level up 
 the hon gentleman will know of the £ reserve for transport investment in the north and i be sure that some of that can be dedicate towards electric vehicle 
 a conservative think tank recently report that coastal community such as mine have low life expectancy inadequate transport link and people who be comparatively poor after repeat rejection for town and levelling up money be my constituent not right to blame the government of the last year for this deliberate levelling down 
 the hon lady like i represent a north east coastal community and she will be aware of our devolution agreement with the north east combined authority which hop to address some of the challenge in her area 
 i call sir jake berry

 order will   the hon member for stone sir william cash   sit down please 
 i congratulate my hon friend the minister on his new post may i remind he of the huge opportunity and pen up potential in former industrial mill town such as those in my constituency of the most gratifying thing about the government ’s levelling up programme have be how it have see the potential in town such as rossendale rawtenstall bacup and darwen and support that with real money with £ of town deal money for darwen and £ for rossendale do he think that this be the right government to drive forward the ambition of people who live in mill town 
 i completely agree with my right hon friend this morning i meet the leader of lancashire county council blackburn with darwen and blackpool and they all agree with i that a devolution agreement in lancashire will be fantastic i be sure that you agree as well mr speaker 
 i be sure that the minister should meet the district leader as well 
 i welcome the minister to his new job several month ago essex mp meet his predecessor to talk about the possibility of a combine authority for essex we be overwhelmingly against it the people of essex do not want this ridiculous white elephant there be no demand from they this be all be bring about by some highly ambitious essex county councillor and some officer who think they would do well out of it as most people in essex do not even know that it be go on will he and his boss meet i and other essex mps to hear our objection 
 i be happy to meet my right hon friend 
 give the prime minister ’s recent announcement on high speed when will local government leader and metro mayors in the midland and north of england get to know what additional resource they will get as a consequence 
 that question be well answer by the department for transport but i will write to the hon gentleman when i have further detail 
 i be absolutely delighted to hear that the minister meet the leader of lancashire county council and blackburn with darwen and blackpool council this morning to discuss the enormous opportunity that devolve transport and skill responsibility to lancashire present will he and the whole of the treasury bench look favourably upon this it be an opportunity that we be keen to take to deliver for people in lancashire and south ribble 
 maybe we could have a meeting with lancashire mps as well as district leader 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question and to you mr speaker for your point i hope to meet lancashire mps next week to discuss devolution i hope that we be able to announce a devolution deal in advance of lancashire day at the end of november 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the new minister to his place in the secretary of state ’s address to his party conference there be barely a mention of level up and no mention whatsoever of the government ’s mission which be central to the original white paper design to tackle regional inequality across england there now exist a gap chasm between a transformative change promise by the rhetoric of level up and the actual reality be the truth of the matter not that downing street have totally lose interest in that agenda while the department ’s leadership bumble on directionless and toothless its bold promise unfulfilled and in many case utterly disregard 
 i thank the hon lady for her kind word and her question though i completely disagree with she at the party conference we announce £ for our long term plan for town which will help we level up town right across the country i hope she welcome that 
 what step he be take to support time buyer 
 the government have a range of scheme available to time buyer include homes and share ownership the mortgage guarantee scheme help to increase the supply of loan to value mortgage we have also double the threshold at which stamp duty land tax become due to £ and expand time buyer relief 
 in west fenham recently mr and mrs joyce tell i how their daughter and prospective son in law have live with they for year while they try to realise their dream of home ownership even after save a deposit the failure of the minister ’s government to build house mean that they be constantly outbid on the few home available labour have set out plan to get britain build again will the minister match our ambition or be live with the in law the new tory dream 
 the hon lady ask whether we will match labour ’s ambition i have news for she from what i pick up from the labour party conference it announce the same target that we be get on with i draw her attention to the fact that more than household have be help to purchase a home since spring through government back scheme include help to buy right to buy and homes 
 i welcome the new young minister to his post i want to attach myself to tribute to his predecessor my hon friend   the member for bishop auckland dehenna davison who be sit next to i 
 last week a freedom of information request show that the lib dem labour control greater cambridge partnership which handle city deal money in my constituency spend £ develop plan for a congestion charge that be then drop because it be oppose basically by everyone it also spend £ on the cambridge south east transport bus route also now drop and £ on new car park none of which be actually open that be a total so far of £ on transport project and virtually none of they function it be now ask the government for £ more it be no wonder that in cambridge and south cambridgeshire people think that the greater cambridge partnership be unelecte unaccountable and a waste of public money do the minister agree that we have to ensure public value for money will he meet i to talk about the detail 
 order that question be too long and i be not quite sure how it fit in with time buyer 
 i will ask the minister later 
 i do not think you will 
 what step his department be take to protect green space 
 what step his department be take to protect green space 
 what step his department be take to protect green space 
 through the levelling up parks fund we have make available £ for local authority in area of high deprivation   to create or significantly refurbish green space the fund also include the planting and maintaining of tree and encourage project to work towards green flag award status 
 i thank the minister for that answer what step be she take to ensure that propose site for housing that be completely unsuitable for reason of biodiversity or lack of access or proximity to a site of special scientific interest be not take forward and build upon although this be a national not local question i be think particularly of a contentious application on water lane in knaresborough which have previously be refuse 
 my hon friend will i hope understand that i can not comment on that specific case or situation but it be really important that local authority make decision accord to their local plan as my right hon friend the secretary of state set out early if local authority have a plan in place it allow they to set out where they would like to see development that benefit their natural environment take place 
 in england we have also set out that from january biodiversity net gain will apply to mitigate the impact of major development that require developer to deliver biodiversity net gain 
 in day time bradford council be likely to give the green light to yet more house to be build in silsden on valuable green space if approve the additional house will follow many hundred of house currently be build in silsden and many more be await planning approval silsden ’s infrastructure simply can not cope do the minister agree that bradford council should prioritise silsden ’s infrastructure rather than see the area as a quick win for achieve its housing target 
 my hon friend be completely right as ever he champion his constituent over the action of labour run bradford council which obviously have a detrimental impact on his constituent ’s life local authority have an obligation to spend section receipt in line with the purpose for which they be agree for exactly the reason he give we be committed to introduce new measure through the levelling up and regeneration bill that will give great certainty to local community about the infrastructure that will be deliver in their area 
 newcastle under lyme be go through its local plan process at the moment i welcome the fact that the conservative lead administration have reduce the overall number of new home to from the in the previous labour lead local plan which would have carpet over our green space as the leader of the opposition seemingly want to do everywhere nevertheless some people be unhappy would the minister join i in urge the council in its next draft to far prioritise brownfield development which be the key to regeneration 
 i can assure my hon friend that it be the government ’s policy to strongly encourage local authority to make the most of brownfield land especially for new home it be right that if local authority   want to alter a green belt boundary they have show exceptional circumstance we conservative believe in preserve our green space and it be interesting to hear the proclamation from the opposition i will be very interested to see whether they propose concrete over the green space surround their own constituency 
 i chair the all party parliamentary group for healthy home and building we have undertake an inquiry and send the report through to ministers the recommendation from that be clear while it be good to have healthy energy efficient home it be really important to have green space around those house have the minister have an opportunity to read the report from the appg if not i will ensure that she get a copy and i hope that she will then come back to i on the recommendation 
 i thank the hon gentleman so much for his comment and i would be delighted to read the report from his appg and respond to he i fully agree with his broad point that green space be vital for mental health and wellbeing as well as physical health 
 what step he be take to help ensure the delivery of project support by the towns fund 
 we be support town through our £ town fund help to level up across the country i thank my hon friend for all his effort locally in ensure that the £ dewsbury town deal deliver the positive outcome that we all wish to see for his constituents.[official report   october vol c. 8mc my department proactively engage with local authority through our monitoring and evaluation process to determine the delivery support they require include specialist support from the department where need 
 on behalf of the people of dewsbury i thank my hon friend for the additional £ announce for our town centre on top of the £ i secure after be elect in light of labour run kirklees council ’s financial mismanagement and failure to deliver regeneration project in the past how can we ensure that the town fund monie be use to transform the town centre and not squander because of the council ’s inability to deliver anything on time or within budget 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for be such a fantastic champion for dewsbury my official be monitor the town deal and work closely with kirklees council and the town deal board to ensure that project be deliver quickly like my hon friend i be pleased to see that there be an extra £ for dewsbury as part of our long term plan for town and i look forward to hear more about dewsbury and its ambition soon 
 town receive support from the town fund in england scotland and wales but none in northern ireland do the excuse have be give that the executive be not form although that be as much the responsibility of the government as that of people in northern ireland but give that the   criterion have already be set why have it not be possible to select town in northern ireland to benefit from the town fund 
 we want to see the northern ireland executive up and run as soon as possible and i think that that be an ambition share across the house i hope that when it be up and run we will be able to help it with the fund that the right hon gentleman have mention 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we all know that this government claim a lot but now they be claim that they have a long term plan for town while continue to build they without any of the infrastructure that people want and need resident of mid bedfordshire know that all too well like many other they struggle to see a gp or get a dentist and the council ’s budget be half what it be in the tories have gutte the element that make a town a home can the minister please explain why they persist in prioritise developer in our town over the people live in they 
 i thank the hon lady for her question but i completely disagree with she member need only look at the measure that we be introduce in the levelling up and regeneration bill which will come to the house tomorrow to see the huge change that we intend to make to high street to allow they to work well for local people 
 what step he be take to help increase the number of new home 
 we have announce £ of investment in housing supply since the start of this parliament and we be also invest £ in the late affordable home programme to provide thousand of new home across the country for people to rent or of course to buy in july we set out our long term plan for housing with regeneration programme in cambridge london and leeds 
 when the department try to change the nutrient neutrality rule the labour party fall at the hurdle show that it have change since its claim to be the party of house building it block that so will minister commit themselves to push through these essential change afresh 
 absolutely we have just hear from   the hon member for luton north sarah owen   a crude nimbyist appeal to the voter of mid bedfordshire a week after the leader of the labour party say he be in favour of 
 the builder not the blocker 
 but who could be surprised give that as my hon friend have rightly point out when we put forward legislation for new home labour block it it be unbelievable that the crew of gangster over there be peddle the same nonsense week in week out 
 order i think we be go to moderate our language a little bit 
 rise 
 so sit down and we will move on 
 for all the sound and fury from the secretary of state he know that the math do not lie and that the government have fail on their target they have downgrade their affordable housing target and have still fail on those when will the secretary of state bite the bullet and provide more properly affordable social housing for people in my constituency and other who simply can not afford to buy their own home 
 i withdraw the word gangster mr speaker i should have say huckster 
 i will tell the hon lady who have downgrade their social housing target it be the hon lady herself when she be run for the deputy leadership of her party she say that she want new social home every year what be the target now 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be essential that we boost the number of new home build each year for private sale but just as important be the need to significantly increase the supply of new affordable home to buy and rent the national audit office have confirm that the government ’s target for its flagship to affordable home programme be start by march can the secretary of state explain how on earth the public can trust this government to address the housing affordability crisis when recent figure reveal that they have fail to deliver on their share of that target outside london 
 the significant increase in the affordable home programme that i outline early be the mean for that to be do but the difference between we be that we have a target for social and affordable home while labour have none 
 what recent progress he have make on support leaseholder with a cladding and b non cladding remediation to residential building 
 what recent progress he have make on support leaseholder with a cladding and b non cladding remediation to residential building 
 the government expect those who have cause defect to step up to solve they as the house be aware developer have now sign contract to resolve cladding and non cladding defect in more than building for other property the government be make extensive   taxpayer subsidy available to support clad remediation along with other mechanism to pursue those who be responsible 
 help for people live in under-11 metre building that have fire safety defect do not go far enough because of the huge amount of money involve of my constituent have describe her experience as a never end nightmare will the minister bring that nightmare to an end for constituent such as mine who be force to pay to fix the mistake of other 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for raise a specific question about under-11 metre property every property be it over or under metre need a fire risk assessment and i encourage her constituent to ensure that a fire risk appraisal of external wall be undertake against that property if the fraew indicate that extensive work be necessary i would be happy to receive a copy of it and look into it personally in order to deal with this 
 i have write to the minister about a constituent of mine who be a leaseholder live in an under-11 metre property and so be not protect by the building safety act the cladding cost alone will be well over £ and any non cladding cost will be substantial that be completely unaffordable for my constituent and it will bankrupt he so when will the minister provide a full update which be promise to i back on   august 
 as i say if the hon lady wish to raise the case of this individual building once again with i or talk to i separately outside i will be happy to enable that for every under-11 metre building we be make aware of as require additional remediation we be go through and check thing and compile audit where necessary to get to the bottom of it the government strongly believe that under-11 metre building do not need extensive remediation and we will be happy to talk more about any building where these issue have be raise 
 do the necessity for the government to take that sort of action show the danger that leaseholder be under from the abuse of freeholder power may i through he gently remind the secretary of state of an assurance he give i when talk about leasehold he say 
 we need to end this feudal form of tenure and ensure individual have the right to enjoy their own property fully ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 be that still intend to be in the king ’s speech 
 my right hon friend know that i be not able to anticipate what will be in the king ’s speech we be clear that particularly with regard to remediation some freeholder have step up and should be credit for do so but other have absolutely not do so the secretary of state and i will not hesitate to call out that activity where it occur 
 i congratulate my hon friend on the action he and the secretary of state be take against developer that refuse to remediate tall building what action will he now propose to take   against developer that deliberately do not carry out this work and leave leaseholder with their life in peril and potentially not able to sell or even insure their property 
 as my hon friend be aware we be ensure that developer uphold the promise they have make through the developer contract and through the responsible actor scheme which make sure that if they fail to do so they could in extremis be ban from build in this country again if there be any indication what he describe be occur we will be happy to take action and i will be happy to receive any information from he or other in the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 more than year on from the grenfell disaster where people lose their life sam a disabled resident in a galliard homes building be of the hundred of thousand of people still trap in building that have not be remediate be this the new do nothing approach from the department to build safety that be highlight in the guardian today an approach that force the resignation of a senior civil servant from the department 
 i think that question be somewhat beneath the hon gentleman but let i state clearly what the government be do they have recognise that there be an issue and have legislate to resolve that they be work extremely hard to ensure that developer be hold to account for that and over the past few month they have have success in ensure that that process take place where developer be no long around they be also step up and make sure that the clad defect be cover hundred of building have conclude their remediation over recent month which demonstrate the progress that be be make 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to support levelling up policy across the uk 
 what step he be take to level up across the whole of the united kingdom 
 levelling up be a uk wide project that be why we have deliver city and growth deal across scotland wales and northern ireland why we have launch our investment zone programme include zone in the north east of scotland and glasgow and why we be invest £ through the levelling up fund in project range from the transformation of burnley ’s historic mill to the development of a cultural quarter in peterhead 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer however as he develop these policy far will he remember that even in apparently affluent area there be pocket that would benefit significantly from levelling up investment especially across basildon   and thurrock will he therefore tell the house what plan he have to include those area in the next round of investment 
 my hon friend make a very important point and in particular it be vital to make sure that we level up that community in thurrock our plan to extend the economic development of docklands east to make the thames estuary a powerhouse for economic growth have be inspire by my hon friend ’s work and that of my hon friend   the member for thurrock jackie doyle price 
 it be a pleasure to welcome the prime minister to burnley week ago when he announce that burnley be of the many town get money as part of the long term plan for town on top of more than £ from the levelling up fund i be particularly pleased to see that a key part of the long term plan for town be community engagement will the secretary of state set out what that community engagement will look like in particular will it be a off or can community expect to be consult throughout the decade for which the £ be allocate 
 my hon friend be right to point out that this be a decade long investment in town across the united kingdom we will work with people in burnley with its excellent member of parliament and with other representative to ensure that we can tackle antisocial behaviour revive high street and make sure that the pride that people have in burnley be reflect in investment from government 
 of the economic sector that provide level up across the whole of the united kingdom be the creative industry whether that be film production theatre the art video game or modern high tech will the secretary of state have conversation with her majesty ’s revenue and customs and the treasury about the proposal to change business rate which may have a dramatic effect and curtail the opportunity for the creative industry 
 absolutely the vital role that our creative industry play across the united kingdom in level up be we need to not just protect but enhance 
 the delivery of local service be so important to level up all area of britain the secretary of state will be aware that in rural area the cost of deliver public service be much high than in their urban counterpart in rural county such as shropshire for example the cost of provide social care be much high and the proportion of people who need that care be high because there be old resident will the secretary of state consider take into account the cost of provide those service when determine the local government settlement in the future 
 it be a very fair point and absolutely on the government side of the house we understand that rural community need additional investment not least when it come to the cost of adult social care 
 as my hon friend   the member for south basildon and east thurrock stephen metcalfe   have say there be pocket of deprivation even in wealthy area include lichfield will the secretary of state give some indication of what sort of timescale there be for the next round of application 
 i simply can not believe that there be any pocket of deprivation in lichfield give who have be represent that constituency since the idea that there be any home unvisite by its member of parliament or that there be any hearth where there be a chill seem to be inconceivable but nevertheless we will make sure that levelling up fund round be bring forward just in advance of the autumn statement and staffordshire i hope will have its voice hear 
 we understand that the secretary of state be plan some rush back of a cigarette packet devolution deal with hull and the east riding can i urge caution after year of deliberate sustained and savage cut to our city the last thing we need now be a botched deal ahead of the general election the very least i expect the secretary of state to guarantee be proper consultation so that the people of hull who have be badly let down by this tory government get the opportunity to understand the implication and to speak on the issue will he guarantee that 
 i have a lot of respect for the hon gentleman but we be not rush or embark on any botched process we be talk to representative from both the east riding and kingston upon hull council in order to ensure that we can get a devolution deal that work we have devolution in york and north yorkshire west yorkshire and south yorkshire as far as we be concern east yorkshire should not be leave out in that progress but it be important that we get that right in the meantime we be develop a levelling up partnership with hull in order to ensure that vital investment not least in transport match the investment that we have already secure on the south bank of the humber 
 i call the spokesperson for the scottish national party 
 prior to scotland ’s be drag out of the european union against its will eu regional development policy allocate up to £ from to crucially the scottish government play a key role in direct the funding in stark contrast to the department for levelling up housing and communities which bypass scotland ’s parliament and undermine devolution will the secretary of state and his cabinet colleague stop play politic and devolve level up to holyrood 
 we be devolve level up we be devolve it to local government that be why our recent town fund announcement be welcome by all council include snp lead council i say to the hon lady with respect that the snp conference meet in aberdeen today have decide that if the snp get mp that be a mandate for independence give the rate at which the snp be lose mps to defection and by election it will be at by christmas so let we discuss it then 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the government ’s voter identification policy on the turnout of minority group at election 
 as we commit to do in legislation we be conduct an evaluation of the impact of voter identification at the may poll we will publish that evaluation no later than november this year 
 the electoral commission ’s report into voter id be utterly damning it find that awareness of the new rule be low among black and minority ethnic community and take up of voter authority certificate be minimal even the government ’s own mps can see the reality of this fail experiment   the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg   say 
 party that try and gerrymander end up find their clever scheme come back to bite they 
 do the minister agree with her own conservative colleague 
 i remind the hon lady that of the electorate be able to vote successfully i also remind she that it be the electoral commission that call for voter identification it have exist in northern ireland for decade and be introduce under a labour government and it exist in most european country 
 on the hon lady ’s point about ethnic minority everyone deserve fair and free election and it have be ethnic minority in area such as tower hamlets and birmingham who have be the victim of electoral fraud 
 whether his department be take step to help ensure that social housing provider be accountable to tenant 
 we be take action to improve the quality of social housing the social housing regulation act which receive royal assent in july will deliver transformative change across the sector introduce proactive consumer regulation and rebalance the relationship between landlord and tenant ensure that landlord be properly hold to account for their performance 
 i welcome the step the government be take to support people live in social housing but many people in carshalton and wallington who live in social housing be still concerned about the level of service they receive from their provider i have receive complaint about a number of housing association include liberal democrat run sutton council ’s housing arm sutton housing partnership and metropolitan thames valley which provide housing in roundshaw will the secretary of state assure those resident that they have somewhere to go when thing go wrong 
 yes those resident absolutely do have somewhere to go my hon friend the excellent member of parliament for carshalton and wallington stand up not just for his constituent but for the most vulnerable in society with clarity and moral authority our legislation will make sure that metropolitan thames valley housing and indeed liberal democrat lead sutton council be hold to account for any failure 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 last thursday i be privileged to be invite to join a meeting chair by the prime minister and the home secretary at which we hear from the community security trust about the deeply unfortunate rise in antisemitic incident follow the terrorist attack that we mark at the start of today ’s sitting the increase in antisemitic incident record by the community security trust and its partner tell mama be it be a melancholy trend and i know that everyone in this house will join i in do everything we can to defeat antisemitism and to promote peace and justice 
 i welcome the comment that the secretary of state have just make but may i take he to task about some of the comment that he make early he talk about have conversation with hull city council about transport this come after the government ’s decade long refusal to back the electrification of a line to hull it also come after the exclusion of the northern mayors in the decision to scrap the northern leg of hs2 why should any of the people in hull and east riding 
 order topical should be short and sweet the right hon lady should just finish her question very quickly 
 why should the people of hull and east yorkshire trust what this government ever say 
 i be a huge fan of the right hon lady the proof of the pudding will be in the continued engagement that we have with the people of hull and indeed with their liberal democrat council 
 i have be run a fair deal for new estate campaign in my constituency to ensure that new estate be complete in a timely manner i be talk about not just the housing but the play area the planting the drainage and the pavement will my hon friend meet i to discuss this campaign which be important locally and be achieve progress for resident in harrogate and knaresborough 
 my hon friend be do an excellent job in raise the concern of his constituent on the floor of the house i know   that those concern be also raise with many other colleague that be why in the levelling up and regeneration bill we be strengthen planning enforcement power include power to tackle uncompleted development i hope his constituent will welcome that and i would be pleased to meet he and discuss it in more detail

 it be a pleasure to face the right hon gentleman for our question i hope he enjoy his party conference cancel a meat tax that nobody have plan abolish bin that do not exist and announce that they would build a series of transport link that already do exist not so much conference season as panto season i shall keep my question to a problem that definitely do exist family be wait for social housing how can he justify hand back to the treasury billion of pound that be desperately need to tackle the housing crisis 
 it be because we spend our money effectively the affordable home programme the £ investment that we be make will lead and have lead to investment in social and affordable housing across the country the right hon lady have a challenge when it come to credibility on social housing she secure the deputy leadership of her party by say that the labour party should be build social home every year and yet its current target be why do she retreat 
 the right hon gentleman just come out with flannel i think he be audition for panto season this afternoon he can dress it up however he like but the truth be that he could not spend this vital funding quickly enough in the middle of a housing crisis it be clear that the prime minister share his disregard for struggle family in his hour long speech in manchester the prime minister do not mention housing a single time not once but the housing minister do tell conference that renter be not all weed smoke gangster which i be sure the right hon gentleman know all about as he mention gangster early today can the secretary of state assure we that despite the tone of those remark the renters reform bill will not be scrap before the king ’s speech 
 yes we be bring reform to the rental market but i note that at her own party conference the right hon lady share with the public not just her policy but her recipe for a cocktail call venom which apparently contain a bottle of vodka a bottle of southern comfort blue wkd and a litre of orange juice we know what the real lethal cocktail from the labour party be a mix of unfunded spending commitment massive borrowing greenbelt development and hypocrisy on housing

 the scourge of damp and mould particularly but not exclusively in the social and private rented sector be an issue that the government recognise that we need to tackle that be why we be provide additional support to local government and to housing association in order to deal with that issue i look forward in particular to deal with the hon gentleman to assess the situation in tiverton and honiton 
 i thank the secretary of state for the tremendous support he have provide to blackpool with more than £ in levelling up money allocate so far be he able to provide an update on the plan for further housing lead regeneration in the bond street and revoe area of my constituency

 the secretary of state in our consideration of his levelling up and regeneration bill tomorrow intend to remove reduce child poverty as a levelling up mission do he think it be possible to level up without reduce child poverty or be it just the case that the government do not care 
 that be a fair question of course we care about reduce child poverty that be why the step we be take across levelling up mission include on education and welfare be design to reduce poverty across the united kingdom 
 berkeley town council have create a much need regeneration plan that will make the town worthy of the tourist attraction nearby such as berkeley castle and the dr jenner ’s house museum but we have little faith that the green and labour lead district council will get the levelling up bid over the line it fail before and its local plan have also be withdraw will the minister meet i to discuss the issue

 that be a good question i like it even well when   the hon member for westminster north ms buck   ask it as i explain we will be bring forward our legislation shortly 
 as he be reform the national planning policy framework and introduce a new infrastructure levy how will my right hon friend ensure that our constituent get the doctor and dentist capacity that must go with new home 
 the infrastructure levy that we be bring forward will ensure through the levelling up and regeneration bill that the money be there to provide service when new development take place we will work with the nhs to ensure that gp and dental provision be part of that we have a plan for an infrastructure levy labour have no plan 
 the attack in israel last weekend shock the world over people murder by over wound almost take hostage the elderly man woman child and babe in arm murder mutilate burn alive we should call it by its name it be a pogrom the family of some of the missing be in the public gallery today we call for the immediate release of all hostage and i say to they we stand with you we stand with israel 
 the murder and the miss come from over country include the united kingdom the terrible nature of these attack mean it be prove difficult to identify many of the deceased but with a heavy heart i can inform the house that at least british citizen be kill a further be miss some of whom be fear to be among the dead 
 we be work with israel to establish the fact as quickly as possible and we be support the family who be suffer unimaginable pain we be also help british citizen who want to leave israel we have organise flight so far bring out more than people with more flight leave today we be work with neighbouring country on land evacuation for our citizen in gaza and the west bank i have speak specifically to president sisi about support civilian to leave gaza by the rafah border crossing which remain closed at present and we have a border force team in egypt work with our embassy to help citizen when they be able to cross 
 i will come back to the grave humanitarian situation in gaza in a moment but i want to address the british jewish community directly as i say at finchley united synagogue last week and at the jewish school i visit this morning we stand with you now and always this atrocity be an existential strike at the very idea of israel as a safe homeland for the jewish people i understand why it have shake you to your core i be sickened that antisemitic incident have increase since the attack we be do everything we can to protect you we be provide an additional £ for the community security trust to protect school synagogue and other jewish community building and we be work with the police to ensure that hate crime and the glorification of terror be meet with the full force of the law i know that the whole house will support that and join i in say unequivocally that we stand with the jewish community 
 i also recognise that this be a moment of great anguish for british muslim community who be also appal by the action of hamas but be fearful of the response we must listen to those concern with the same attentiveness hamas be use innocent palestinian people as human shield with the tragic loss of more than palestinian life include many child we mourn the loss of every innocent life of the civilian of every faith and every nationality who have be kill so let we say it plainly we stand with british muslim community too 
 israel be found not just as a homeland for the jewish people but as a guarantor of their security to ensure that what happen in the holocaust could never happen again through its strength and resilience israel   gradually achieve some of that long for security despite the strategic threat on its border include hezbollah in the north with iran at its back israel normalise relation with the united arab emirates and bahrain through the abraham accord and move towards normalising tie with saudi arabia step that be consider unthinkable not long ago 
 reason this attack be so shocking be that it be a fundamental challenge to any idea of co existence which be an essential precursor to peace and stability in the region the question be how should we respond i believe that we must support absolutely israel ’s right to defend itself to go after hamas and take back the hostage to deter further incursion and to strengthen its security for the long term that must be do in line with international humanitarian law while recognise that israel face a vicious enemy who embe themselves behind civilian 
 as a friend we will continue to call on israel to take every possible precaution to avoid harm civilian i repeat president biden ’s word as democracy we be 
 strong and more secure when we act accord to the rule of law 
 humanity law decency respect for human life that be what set we apart from the mindless violence of the terrorist 
 there be specific area in which the united kingdom be help to shape event we be work to prevent escalation and further threat against israel on friday raf surveillance aircraft begin patrol to track threat to regional security i have deploy a royal navy task group to the eastern mediterranean include rfa lyme bay and rfa argus merlin helicopter and a company of royal marines ready both to interdict arm and to support the humanitarian response and we be bolster our force in cyprus and across the region let i be clear we be not engage in fighting or in an offensive in gaza but we be increase our presence to prevent broad regional instability at this dangerous moment 
 secondly i be proud that we be a long stand and significant provider of humanitarian aid to the palestinian people i can announce today that we be increase our aid by a with an additional £ of support an acute humanitarian crisis be unfold to which we must respond we must support the palestinian people because they be victim of hamas too like our ally we believe that 
 hamas do not represent the palestinian people or their legitimate aspiration to live with equal measure of security freedom justice opportunity and dignity 
 hamas simply do not stand for the future that palestinians want and they seek to put the palestinian people in harm ’s way we must ensure that humanitarian support urgently reach civilian in gaza that require egypt and israel to allow in the aid that be so badly need 
 we also need to keep the situation in the west bank at the forefront of our mind at this moment of heightened sensitivity early today i speak to mahmoud abbas the leader of the palestinian authority to express our support for his effort to provide stability 
 thirdly we will use all the tool of british diplomacy to sustain the prospect of peace and stability in the region ultimately that require security for israelis and palestinians and a state solution so we be increase   our regional engagement i have speak to prime minister netanyahu twice in the last week along with the us france germany italy and other my right hon friend the foreign secretary be the to visit israel after the attack i meet his majesty the king of jordan yesterday a long time voice of reason and moderation i have speak today with the leader of turkey and previously egypt and i will speak to other in the come day our partner in the region have ask we to play a role in prevent further escalation and that be what we will do however hard it be we need to ask the tough question about how we can revive the long term prospect for a state solution for normalisation and for regional stability not least because that be precisely what hamas have be try to kill 
 in conclusion unequivocally back israel ’s right to defend itself step forward with humanitarian support work to protect civilian from harm and strain every sinew to keep the flame of peace and stability alive that be our objective it be the right approach for the region and it be the right approach for britain i commend this statement to the house 
 i thank the prime minister for the advance copy of his statement and for the update the government have provide to labour front benchers over the past few day 
 last saturday israel be the victim of terrorism on an unimaginable scale the senseless murder of man woman child and even baby the horror of hostage taking music festival turn to kill field innocent jews slaughter within their own kibbutz an attack with no cause other than bloodshed i be sure that over the last few day every member of the house have see image from this crisis that will never be unseen tiny body wrap in bundle in israel and now in gaza mother and father grieve israeli palestinian muslim jew the innocent dead 
 as in any time of grave crisis it be crucial that this house speak with voice in condemnation of terror in support for israel in its time of agony and for the dignity of all human life because hamas do not wish to see peace in the middle east they just want to see israel wipe off the map but hamas be not the palestinian people and the palestinian people be not hamas 
 labour stand with israel britain stand with israel the attack be ongoing terrorist be at large and hostage be still be hold some of they british citizen israel have the right to bring her people home to defend herself and to keep her people safe while hamas have the capability to carry out attack on israeli territory there can be no safety as secretary of state blinken say last week 
 we democracy distinguish ourselves from terrorist by strive for a different standard even when it ’ difficult 
 he be right 
 as the prime minister have say there be an acute humanitarian crisis unfolding israel ’s defence must be conduct in accordance with international law civilian must not be target and innocent life must be protect there must be humanitarian corridor and humanitarian access include for food water electricity and medicine so that hospital can keep people alive and so that   innocent people do not needlessly die and there must be proper protection for all those who work selflessly so that aid can be deliver to victim 
 there can be no doubt that responsibility for this crisis lie with hamas they have no interest in palestinian right and no interest in the security of the people of gaza they unleash terror and then hide among they woman and child use as human shield hostage hold who should be release hamas be destroyer of life of hope and of peace and we can not give they what they want 
 we must keep strive for a state solution a palestinian state alongside a safe and secure israel we can not give up on that hope we can not let hamas brutality be a catalyst for conflict in the wide region engagement between israel and arab nation must be strengthen not abandon international co operation the rule of law and a political road to peace hamas want we to abandon all in defiance we must be resolute on all of they 
 these attack be have a huge impact on community across the united kingdom many in this house will have hear devastating story from people who have lose friend and family and from people who be deeply worried about the future of those they know in israel or palestine include the minister of scotland who i speak to at the weekend we stand with all of they we stand against the worrying rise in islamophobia and against the antisemitic abuse threat and assault that we have see on british street because we must never underestimate the burden of history that jewish people carry with they 
 i do not want britain to be a place where jewish school be close where jewish child stay at home out of fear and where jewish family feel compel to hide their identity i do not want britain to be a place where british muslims feel they have to apologise for the action of people who do not act in their name we can not allow community cohesion in our country to be destroy we all bear a responsibility to do all we can to stamp out hate and we fully support police action to provide extra assistance for our community 
 the event of the past week have see horror beyond our imagination so let we send a strong message that westminster be united and britain be unite with israel against terror for international law and for the protection of innocent life there be difficult day ahead but our value can not be compromise terror can not win 
 i thank the leader of the opposition for his remark let i say at the outset that this be an unprecedented and extraordinarily difficult situation it be likely to remain difficult for all of we in the day and week ahead but we must always have at the forefront of our mind that responsibility for this crisis lie with hamas and with hamas alone it be a barbaric act of terrorism that have inflict untold suffering and misery on so many people and we have feel that acutely here at home 
 we have see the impact on our street over the past week and it have sicken all of we we stand united in say that antisemitism have no place in our society let i be unequivocal that those who incite racial or religious hatred on our street or who inflict violence and cause untold suffering to people will be meet with the full force   of the law i know the whole house will join i in make sure that happen that the police have all the tool resource and power they need to bring that about 
 in conclusion let i say that the right hon and learn gentleman be absolutely right that this house stand united unite in condemn unequivocally this terrorist attack by hamas and unite in say that we will be steadfast in our support for israel and steadfast in our support for the jewish people not just today not just tomorrow but always 
 i call the father of the house 
 the house will be grateful to both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition for the lead that they have give in today ’s statement this be not the time to point out the fault of benjamin netanyahu what we have to say be that the inexcusable terror attack on israelis be intend to bring awful harm to the palestinians 
 rather than quote international leader i want to quote a senior constituent who say this be a very harrowing time for jews all over the world there be about of we worldwide why can not they leave we alone 
 if we pray for the peace of jerusalem we want to try to bring security both to the people of israel and to the palestinians in gaza do the prime minister know that he will have our support as he try to do that 
 i thank the father of the house for what he have say and i simply agree with his constituent in say that all of we will pray for peace in the region but especially for peace for those family who have be so tragically affect by what have happen over the past week 
 i call the snp leader 
 rabbie burns once poignantly write that 
 man ’s inhumanity to man make countless thousand mourn 
 it be with those word echo in all our heart that we send our thought and prayer to all those suffering in the middle east the abhorrent terrorist attack by hamas on the jewish people and the israeli state be a crime against our common humanity and it must be condemn unequivocally what more powerful response can we have than to seek to protect the share innocence and share humanity of both israeli and palestinian civilian 
 that will require a lot it will require the defeat of hamas it will require the safe return of all those hostage who have be take it will require the opening of humanitarian corridor so that people can escape gaza and aid can get in and it will require medicine water and electricity for hospital so that people who be injure can be treat it will require no collective punishment make all of that happen will require international leadership and diplomacy on these isle that responsibility will fall to the uk prime minister and i very much wish he well in make that happen 
 right across this chamber we all need to be very conscious that history will judge we on our response not just to these abhorrent attack but to the humanitarian crisis that be undoubtedly unfold in gaza let we not be on the wrong side of history 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his remark and i agree that this crisis demand that the united kingdom step up diplomatically to make a difference to bring about peace and stability that be what we have do over the past week as i allude to in my statement the foreign secretary be the person to visit israel and have speak to multiple counterpart in the same vein i myself have be work with ally across the region to make sure that we can work together to bring about a successful and peaceful resolution we also recognise the scale of the humanitarian situation that be unfold and be play a lead role in help to alleviate it not least with our announcement today of considerably more aid for the palestinian territory build on our strong track record as of the lead provider of aid to the region that will continue 
 the attack on israel by hamas terrorist be barbaric terrorist must be defeat whoever they be and wherever they be i commend my right hon friend the prime minister and the foreign secretary for the stance that the government have take in support of the jewish community here in the uk and in support of israel and its right to defend itself i welcome the prime minister ’s statement that action must be take in line with international humanitarian law but will he give a commitment today that the government will leave no stone unturned in their effort to prevent regional escalation of the conflict in do so will he reflect on the role of iran 
 i can give my right hon friend that reassurance it be not only something that we have discuss extensively with partner in the region but why last week i deploy surveillance aircraft and asset to the mediterranean and they be already engage in ensure that arm shipment do not find their way to people such as those in hezbollah and that iran do not see this as an opportunity to escalate the conflict the support that we have put into the region have already be welcome by our partner who share our aim to ensure that action be constrain to deal with hamas and what they have do no want to see any escalation again that be something that prime minister netanyahu and i discuss and he very much agree that his objective be to deal with hamas and not to see the conflict spread more widely 
 the scale of hamas ’s terrorist attack have be utterly horrifying and the atrocity they have commit be truly sicken we stand with the people of israel and with the jewish community who be grieve and afraid we call for the unconditional release of all hostage and urge the government finally to proscribe as a terrorist organisation the funder of hamas iran ’s revolutionary guard 
 israel unquestionably have the right to defend itself and its citizen that mean target hamas not innocent civilian in line with international law i be concern about the force evacuation of hospital in gaza which mean death for innocent palestinians who will not   survive be take off life support the world health organisation have say that this may be a breach of international humanitarian law so will the prime minister set out what advice he have receive on the matter 
 unlike hamas the israeli president have say that the israeli armed force will operate in accordance with international law israel ’s attempt to minimise civilian casualty by warn people to leave northern gaza have be far complicate by hamas terrorist tell the local population not to leave and instead use they as human shield we will continue to urge israel as i have do when i have speak to prime minister netanyahu that while it exercise its absolute right to defend itself and ensure that such attack can never happen again it should take every possible precaution to minimise the impact on civilian 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 saturday ’s terror attack on israel constitute crime against humanity crime so heinous that they violate our understanding of the depth of human depravity that depravity continue today as innocent remain held hostage by hamas terrorist and their patron the state of iran 
 israel have a legitimate right to self defence and to defeat hamas we can support israel and grieve with its people while recognise that how a counter terrorism operation be conduct matter it matter because israel ’s action as a rule of law nation and our word as its friend shape our ability to be a legitimate arbiter in future conflict and to have the right to call out abuser such as russia it matter because although there be an imperative to defeat hamas in the immediate term in order to secure israel ’s future how they be defeat will shape the region ’s future and because the people of gaza be not hamas—1.2 child bear no collective guilt for hamas ’s terror 
 so today i repeat my call for the creation of a special envoy for the middle east peace process will my right hon friend tell the house more about what action be be take to prevent conflict and loss of life on the west bank and in east jerusalem when will we finally proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps 
 with regard specifically to the west bank this be something about which i speak to mahmoud abbas the president of the palestinian authority this morning i also speak yesterday to his majesty the king of jordan we discuss the measure that be necessary and the support the uk can provide to ensure the strong stability of the west bank no want to see the situation escalate i assure my hon friend that we be in active dialogue with both partner to see how we can help bring that stability to the west bank indeed it be something i will also continue to discuss with prime minister netanyahu it be important that the west bank remain calm and that be what we will help to bring about 
 on saturday i go to shul and sit next to a constituent whose cousin be of the hostage my thought and prayer go out not only to he but to all family and hostage currently detain 
 while conflict escalate in the middle east we see the effect on the street here in britain i welcome the prime minister and the leader of the opposition stand behind israel ’s right to defend itself and the £ increase in funding for the community security trust however unfortunately in the past week we have see an increase of around in antisemitic incident and an increase in suspicious behaviour and even this weekend glorification of hamas and genocidal chant on the street of our city in some case mere foot away from police officer will the prime minister join i in applaud the effort of the cst in keep the jewish community safe but also commit to ensure that anyone find to be preach this hate speech on our street face the full extent of the law 
 i can give the hon gentleman that assurance i meet the cst and police chief last week in downing street not just to provide extra funding but to reiterate that there be tolerance in the united kingdom for antisemitism it be tragic that we have see a significant increase in incident over the past week but those who perpetrate these crime will be meet with the full force of the law 
 i want to add my voice to all those who stand with israel and her inalienable right to defend herself against an unspeakable crime as someone bear in the middle east as a father and as a human it be too painful to watch israel have to take the necessary step to root out this evil virus of fundamentalism that have so clearly infest those in hamas and of course destroy it just as we stand together against isis we will stand together again my request to my right hon friend be that when this have be do the uk encourage israel to set out for all to see the positive action it will take to change the reality in gaza once and for all gaza and the world will need israel to show her good self after this war 
 i thank my right hon friend for his powerful statement and also agree with he we must think about the future and in spite of this awful tragedy we can not lose sight of the well future that we all want to strive for indeed in my conversation with leader we have already be think about that and it be something i raise with the prime minister of israel as well we all want that well future for the israeli and palestinian people and hopefully out of this tragedy we will find a way to move close towards it 
 the massacre of israeli civilian be a heinous act of terrorism that we all utterly condemn and the hostage must be release immediately in the word of the united nations secretary general 
 the horrific act by hamas do not justify respond with collective punishment of the palestinian people 
 but that be what we be see in gaza with civilian area bomb and food electricity water and medicine all cut off such collective punishment be a war crime under the geneva convention so will the prime minister take this opportunity to make it clear to the israeli government that this collective punishment of palestinian civilian must end immediately 
 i would say gently to the hon gentleman that i actually believe that we should support absolutely israel ’s right to defend itself and to go after hamas recognise that it face a vicious enemy that embed itself behind civilian of course israel will act within international humanitarian law and as a friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution in avoid harm citizen but we must acknowledge always that the responsibility for what be happen here be with hamas and hamas alone 
 may i thank you mr speaker for the step that you take at the beginning of last week in light up this palace in the colour of blue and white as an act of solidarity with the israeli victim of hamas terrorism i know that it be appreciate by those british family mourn love one who be slay in that action as well as by family live with unimaginable fear right now because they have family member who have be take hostage in gaza some of those family member be with we in the gallery 
 do the prime minister agree that after the act of barbarism by hamas there be no go back to the situation before where right under the nose of the international community hamas be allow to rearm time and again they be allow to misappropriate aid into terrorist infrastructure build those tunnel amass armament and hide they behind civilian family do he agree that the international community must take a stand and not allow the gaza strip to go back to become a terrorist statelet 
 i thank my right hon friend for everything he do to support the jewish community here and overseas i agree that no country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizen and simply return to the condition that allow that to take place israel have the right indeed the obligation to defend itself and to ensure that this never happen again 
 mr speaker 
 no stone can remain unturned in find a political solution 
 those be not my word but those of the israeli and arab mother collective woman wage peace echo in recent day by survivor from kibbutz be’eri the family of those murder at netiv ha’asara organisation such as b’tselem omdim ben yachad and thousand of peace activist and ordinary israelis who be desperately pray for the cycle of violence to end and a last peace to be secure what will the government be do to heed that call and mobilise international actor to find the political solution however far away it feel right now so that there may be a way out of the nightmare that hamas have unleash for all in israel palestine and the wide region for good 
 we must provide an alternative to the vision of violence fear and terror present by hamas and that be what the united kingdom will do stand with israel but also work together with its people and our ally across the region all of those who remain committed to a vision of a more peaceful more integrated more secure and more prosperous middle east that be what we will work towards 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s statement i welcome in particular his urging of the state of israel to act in line with international humanitarian law and his call for israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian may i ask he to press upon our israeli friend the principle of distinction and proportionality in their action to avoid any sense in which it look like a collective punishment be be mete out on the palestinians in gaza as well as ensure that we do nothing that will leave the democracy bad off at the end of this which be not in line with the principle all of we would wish to hold 
 as i say we support israel ’s right to defend itself but as a friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian that be something that i specifically discuss with prime minister netanyahu and we will continue to do so 
 a year old palestinian child be murder in chicago because of his muslim faith and as a response to the war between israel and hamas in the last week we have see a sharp rise in islamophobic rhetoric and the dehumanisation of palestinians tragically yesterday we see the consequence in the murder of that little boy will the prime minister review his statement about the conflict and ensure that he do not add to the further vilification of palestinians and muslims when condemn the action of hamas 
 i gently urge the hon gentleman to examine what i say early from the dispatch box particularly about stand with the british muslim community at this difficult time we will not tolerate anti muslim hatred in any form and we will seek to stamp it out wherever it occur i be pleased to say that in june the security minister confirm additional funding of £ available this financial year to provide protective security at mosque and muslim faith school as a demonstration of our intent to deliver on what i say but i say to he please see what i say early from the dispatch box we stand with all community at this difficult time 
 in the long litany of attack against jews around the world this be the single most murderous since the end of the holocaust in the prime minister ’s support for the jewish community in this country and for israel have be heroic this be an historic moment and the response of his majesty ’s government have be all anyone could have ask do the prime minister agree that israel have act entirely in accordance with international law despite hamas use human shield and every type of horrific provocation israel have not only a right to defend itself but a duty to defend its people from sadistic and vicious murderer 
 my right hon and learn friend make an excellent point that israel have not just the right but the duty only need to imagine if a similar incident have occur in our country what we would do to secure the safety and security of our citizen that be what israel be do it have every right and duty to do so and it will have our support as   it do 
 i condemn unreservedly the action of hamas and the horror that have unfold in the region and i ask that the hostage be return safely as soon as possible however from speak to aid worker base in gaza the reality on the ground be that despite the evacuation order people who be ill frail in hospital or just get old can not get out this morning i speak to aid worker who tell i people be return from southern gaza to northern gaza because they have no water and there be nowhere to go they can not escape will the prime minister urge the israeli government to bear in mind the reality for ordinary palestinian people live in the nightmare that be unfold around they through no fault of their own 
 as i say i have speak to president sisi about the importance of the rafah crossing be open for humanitarian purpose and i will continue to do so and about the importance of allow humanitarian aid to flow into gaza today ’s announcement of more support will hopefully make a difference again i contrast israel ’s attempt to minimise civilian casualty by warn people to leave gaza with hamas who be urge the local population to stay to use they as human shield it be unacceptable and we should call it out for what it be 
 every tragic loss of life in gaza be the responsibility of hamas alone some people in this place would do well to remember that fact a week on from the pogrom what do we have on the street of britain we have some people attend pro palestinian march hold up banner in support of terrorist whether it be hang glider chant anti jewish chant support the racist boycott divestment and sanction movement or in the case of a protest in glasgow remind jews where they be in jews need no reminder of where they be in those scene be deeply distress to british jews many of whom do not believe that the police will take action could i urge the prime minister to look at what some of our european partner be do and to take strong action against some of those march 
 i thank my hon friend for everything he do to support the jewish community in our country i join he in say that these act be appalling i want to make sure that we provide security and relieve the anxiety in the jewish community here in the united kingdom which be why i quickly take step last week to provide that reassurance i be clear that where people incite racial or religious hatred or where people ’s conduct be threaten abusive or disorderly or cause distress to other we expect the police to take action and those commit such crime should face the full force of the law 
 i join this house in its condemnation of the bloodshed in israel and palestine the palestinians in the open air prison of gaza face a dire humanitarian emergency long before today yet indiscriminate airstrike and siege tactic have turn what be a critical emergency into a devastating catastrophe will the prime minister make it clear to the israeli government that lay siege to civilian in gaza by cut off food water power and   medical supply and through indiscriminate airstrike kill civilian be in clear violation of international law just what be the international community do to stop the horrific and inhuman treatment of palestinians 
 i again point out gently to the hon gentleman that hamas be the entity responsible for the suffering we be see and hamas alone of course we in the international community will do our good to alleviate the impact on innocent people which be why we have today announce further aid to the region we will make sure that we provide as much humanitarian support as we can and indeed in all our conversation with leader around the region we be discuss the humanitarian situation and find way to work together to alleviate the impact on innocent life and that be what we will continue to do 
 do the prime minister accept that what hamas do be not terrorism for its own sake but an act of calculated barbarism with a strategy behind it the present war will not feature egypt and jordan as enemy of israel as be the case in previous war so do he agree that that strategy be to try and prevent similar peace agreement with country such as saudi arabia do he accept that hamas be a creature of a client state of russia and while we be talk about this we must remember that russia be still at war in ukraine 
 i thank my right hon friend and he be right to point to the broad situation and welcome the progress that have be make on normalisation between israel and other country in the region which speak to the bright future that we all hope we will see day let i reassure he on our support for ukraine we remain committed to that and just this friday i be at the joint expeditionary force summit in sweden talk with our northern european scandinavian and baltic partner and hear directly from president zelensky about how we in the jef will continue to support ukraine in the come year my right hon friend can rest assure that we be able to do both 
 noam sagi his wife michal and their son be here today to watch you give your statement prime minister 
 ada sagi noam ’s mum be take hostage from her home by hamas on   saturday october and be currently be hold hostage in gaza ada book a ticket to the uk to celebrate her birthday noam have write to the prime minister to ask for his immediate intervention and assistance joe biden have make personal call to his citizen i ask the prime minister if he will please remember the family be watch spare just minute to have a quick conversation with they 
 of course i be happy to have a quick conversation but i be also engage actively with our partner in the region to try to ensure the safe release of our hostage which i be sure the house will support i in do any which way we can we will use all the tool at our disposal to ensure their safe return not just for the hon lady ’s constituent but all those british national and other who be take by hamas in that appalling act they should know that we be do absolutely everything we can to try to bring they back home as quickly and safely as possible 
 we in this house be all absolutely horrify by the terrorist atrocity in israel and the appalling way in which the hamas terrorist have murder torture and kidnap man woman and child i thank the prime minister for his important and significant statement today and for the way in which as he have just say we be give all the support to the grieve family right now that be paramount can he explain from his conversation with president sisi how the opening of the border crossing between gaza and egypt on humanitarian ground will be undertake in a way that prevent hamas terrorist from leave and potentially create further atrocity in the region 
 my right hon friend have make an excellent point    that be why there be complexity to open the rafah border crossing but she should be reassure that we be engage in those conversation with the egyptians and with other partner include the americans to find a safe way to open the crossing ideally for the evacuation of british national who may be in gaza but also to send humanitarian support into gaza which i know we would all like to see happen 
 the international committee of the red cross have state that 
 hospital in gaza risk turn into morgue without electricity 
 the commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east have say that the agency ’s colleague in gaza be no long able to provide humanitarian assistance and the number of people seek shelter in unrwa facility in the south be absolutely overwhelming some civilian have no choice but to stay in the north of gaza and must be protect at all time what conversation have the prime minister have with his israeli counterpart about create safe zone and humanitarian corridor in gaza have the prime minister raise the urgent need to prevent the perpetration of atrocity on all civilian will he increase financial support for unrwa and the surround host nation give that the increase need of refugee from palestine will only sadly increase far for many year 
 i be proud that over the past few year we have be of the lead donor to unrwa account for about of all its support for the region today we announce an increase of about a in our humanitarian support and we will work with the relevant partner to see how good to ensure that those fund can make a difference in the region as quickly as possible 
 thank you mr speaker for allow we a minute silence to reflect on the victim of what have take place in the middle east 
 there can be no great contrast between the action of the israel defence force which attempt to prevent the loss of civilian life and the sheer brutality of the terrorist who kill and maim as many people as they possibly can there can be no comparison between those aspect of what be happen this operation by the terrorist group hamas be clearly well plan well resource and well equip and have clearly be plan for many month it be beyond belief that the   islamic revolutionary guard corps which fund and support hamas be not behind this whole operation will my right hon friend now take the action that the whole house have ask he to take and proscribe the irgc in its entirety 
 we have already take strong action against the iranian regime include the sanctioning of individual and entity include the irgc in its entirety furthermore the national security act implement new measure to protect the british public include new offence of espionage and foreign interference and tough power to arrest and detain people suspect of involvement in state threat as the house know the government have a long stand policy of not comment on whether specific organisation be be consider for proscription and our approach as currently state be completely in line with that of our ally
