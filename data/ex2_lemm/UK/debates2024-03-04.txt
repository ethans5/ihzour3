 george galloway for rochdale 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to support rough sleeper and homeless people to move into accommodation 
 what step he be take to help reduce the number of family in temporary accommodation 
 we be invest almost £ over year to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping which be an unprecedented amount that include over £ through the homelessness prevention grant which council can use flexibly to prevent homelessness and help family to move out of temporary accommodation last week an additional £ be allocate to council through the single homelessness accommodation programme provide home for people sleep rough 
 i thank my hon friend for that answer but the number of people in temporary accommodation have rise by over the past year and the number of rough sleeper have rise by across the country clearly the money be very much need all london council report that they be spend more than the temporary accommodation money that have be allocate equally the pilot for housing have be outstandingly successful so can we ensure that housing be introduce across the country and more investment be make in order to take people off the street and provide they with a permanent home as they deserve 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for everything he have do in the homelessness space the other day i be look at the figure from the homelessness reduction act we have support family courtesy of that act in order to prevent homelessness my hon friend be absolutely right that we have see an uptick in rough sleeping and homelessness   which be disappointing however with rough sleeping we be still below pre pandemic level and below the high in i agree with he about the success of housing we have invest £ in those pilot and we be invest a furth £ through the rough sleep initiative 
 there be child live in temporary accommodation a record high that be costly to taxpayer but devastating to the life of child and family and the government ’s own datum show that they have utterly fail on their manifesto commitment to end rough sleeping by as   the hon member for harrow east bob blackman   have just say rough sleeping have rise by in the past year and i remind the minister that it be high than in be she happy for child and family to be pay the price for year of tory failure on housing 
 this government have make a concerted effort to tackle homelessness and eliminate rough sleeping i be not happy with the number in temporary accommodation which be why the last autumn statement contain a series of measure to address the issue include an additional £ for the local authority housing fund take that to £ in order to improve the quality of temporary accommodation we have also uprate the local housing allowance to the percentile which be worth £ per family 
 southend have an abundance of accommodation that be deem inexpensive by local authority and our city be pick up the tab for social care education and long term housing when other local authority be not inform our city council that they be place people in the city under section of the housing act all local authority should give prior notice when place people for homelessness within day will my hon friend assist i and southend on sea city council in deal with this issue 
 my hon friend be absolutely correct if a local authority place people into temporary accommodation outside the borough it should notify the relevant local authority i be very happy to assist in get that message across 
 analysis by london councils show that on average the equivalent of child in every classroom be homeless and that london local authority be now spend a staggering £ a month on temporary accommodation for those who be homeless what conversation have the minister have with colleague in the department for work and pensions and the treasury about raise the cap on the housing benefit subsidy for temporary accommodation and also support local authority to buy up property as richmond borough council be do so they can rehouse people locally in decent accommodation 
 as the hon lady will understand i can not talk about any discussion that we may have have with the treasury but clearly the budget be on wednesday however i would point to the increase in the local housing allowance rate which will take effect in april and the local authority housing fund be intend specifically to help local authority to buy property for temporary accommodation 
 i call shadow secretary of state 
 i hear what the minister say about the housing fund for temporary accommodation but what we need to be do be reduce the number of family in temporary accommodation year have pass since the government promise to end section eviction and now child be come home from school each night to sleep in temporary accommodation for a child be bring up in a hotel room do their homework on the bathroom floor and eat their dinner perch on the bed the opportunity to make the most of their life be out of their control so i ask the minister how many more child must face eviction before she meet the promise 
 we be absolutely committed to repeal section there be no question about that as i have say the number for those in temporary accommodation be disappointing but we do have a very holistic approach build more housing build more affordable home and enable local authority to go out and build and purchase temporary accommodation 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the levelling up fund on local community 
 we be transform community the length and breadth of our united kingdom through our £ levelling up fund improve transport regenerate high street and rebuild pride in place 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer and i be delighted that we have recently be able to bring £ of investment to clacton freeport will be a major contributor towards level up and in my view level up also mean well transport infrastructure but not enough be get through to bus service in my patch will he support my campaign outline that freeport east in essex need to show its social value in clacton by help to improve connectivity for everyone across the tendring district include for bus 
 i be more than happy to meet my hon friend to discuss his campaign bus be the most popular form of public transport in our country they be an essential element of our national transport system play a vital part in level up i be grateful to my hon friend for acknowledge the huge amount of levelling up funding go into clacton and be keen to work with he to see how we can help people in jaywick as well 
 my borough hackney be successful in its bid for levelling up funding but there be a delay to the bid be put in because the government change the timetable and a delay to the final decision again because the government delay the timetable which have contribute it be not the only factor to a month   delay in the programme and get the funding will the minister look at that give that it be a government flagship programme be he not a bit disappointed that the timescale problem be down to his own department 
 i absolutely commit to look at that we have introduce the project adjustment request process and i be more than happy to talk to the hon lady and her local authority about how they can utilise that to meet the change that she outline 
 do my hon friend agree that the great strength of levelling up funding be that it support project that be generate by local community rather than by officialdom when the borders levelling up partnership be consider project the project in my constituency at the crook inn at tweedsmuir and the george hotel in walkerburn be ideal for such funding opportunity 
 i be grateful to meet my right hon friend recently to discuss those exact priority we be hop to invest £ into the levelling up partnership he mention i be sure that those priority will be part of our consideration as we design the partnership 
 community in northern ireland experience no benefit from the last round of levelling up funding because of the government ’s flimsy excuse that the assembly be not sit now that the assembly be sit can the minister tell we what discussion he have have with the community minister to ensure that the million of pound that he say be set aside will be available for project in northern ireland 
 i can absolutely commit to have those discussion and i offer to meet the right hon gentleman follow question time 
 i be proud that morley have receive £ in funding from the conservative government i be sure that my hon friend agree that transparency and care with taxpayer money be vital will he look into the concern that a number of constituent have raise about morley town council include the controversial plan to install £ worth of tv screen in a conservation area whether it follow the correct tendering process and whether any vested interest among those involve be fully declare 
 i will absolutely look into those concern and ensure that my official can meet my hon friend to discuss they far 
 the success or otherwise of level up will be test by whether people in community feel well off and whether inequality in those community be remove what assessment have the minister make of an area such as tameside which have have successful levelling up bid but feel poor because its council be £ bad off 
 across the north west we be invest £ through our different levelling up fund stream we be work closely with the mayor of greater manchester give he more power and more funding to help deal with the exact issue the hon gentleman mention 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government talk about level up but local council and community be on the brink due to policy make in downing street that affect every single local authority in the country funding have be slash the fair funding review delay and the business rate reset postpone while reserve be deplete community asset have be sell account go unsubmitted and more and more council be line up for emergency support be it not time to end the sticking plaster politic and have a long term plan for all our community sake or be the government do what the country be do wait for a labour government 
 i be sorry that the hon gentleman fail to mention the long term plan for oldham which be in his constituency and where we be invest £ over the next year since we have invest £ of levelling up funding across the country we be commit to level up right across the country 
 if he will make a comparative assessment of trend in a the level of local government financial settlement and b the number of car damage as a result of pothole in the last year 
 we have make available up to £ for local authority through the local government finance settlement local authority can decide how to spend the majority of that funding the government be also invest more than £ into local highway maintenance in this parliament in october we announce a furth £ to fix our road 
 gocompare ’s recent pothole report describe the pothole in tory run derbyshire as the very bad in england the conservative council leader be clear in his view that it be fund decision from central government that have force the county to adopt what he call the totally ineffective stick plaster and patch approach he say that the funding from the government 
 do not touch the side of the issue for county 
 across the country why should derbyshire motorist pay a tory pothole tax with tyre spring and suspension all constantly need repair as a result of the state of our road 
 for the hon gentleman ’s benefit let i repeat those figure of £ for local highway maintenance and the additional £ announce in october that will fill hole include in derbyshire and his constituency to support motorist the economy and people go about their business 
 it be normal in these circumstance to invite a minister to visit a constituency the minister be welcome to visit my constituency the wrekin in shropshire and the telford and wrekin borough but if he visit the telford and wrekin borough bit could he bring a spare tyre the pothole there be enormous i thank he for allow £ to be release over the next year to ensure that those pothole be fill rather than a pothole tax may i thank he for the pothole fund finally—[interruption i will not give a finally but he be very welcome to visit bring a spare tyre 
 as i struggle with my lenten observation i need no lesson about spare tyre it be all about try to get rid of spare tyre as far as i be concern i be grateful for my right hon friend ’s comment the wrekin be a part of shropshire that i know well those sum can and should be use by upper tier authority which be the highway authority to ensure that their network be work well smoothly and safely that benefit all and the government be put up the money to allow they to do that 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 public service worker and local leader across the country be work incredibly hard to improve their local area and provide vital service so rather than the beg bowl culture that make they bid for money will the minister take forward labour ’s commitment for a long term more secure funding settlement to allow they to plan for the future 
 i be intrigue by what the right hon lady proffer to the house only a few week ago in the debate on the local government finance settlement none of her colleague apart from   the hon member for york central rachael maskell   the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts who chair the levelling up housing and communities committee and those on the front bench could be bother to turn up and speak on it the hon member for blaydon liz twist who be sit next to she on the front bench say 
 as i will come on to say shortly we will have a review to look at the long term plan we understand the problem that local government be face ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 may i say to the right hon lady that part of the job of be in opposition be to work out the policy that she may want to deliver in government 
 what step he be take to tackle islamophobia 
 we have be clear that anti muslim hatred have absolutely no place in our community i feel that strongly as i represent of the most diverse constituency in the country we have provide over £ to the anti muslim hatred monitoring and support service tell mama and just shy of £ to scheme protect   mosque and faith school funding for both measure have be uplifted in response to increase reporting since october 
 an extreme right wing conservative mp be allow to go on an extreme right wing conservative funding tv station and make a series of vile islamophobic remark the mp be not suspend for islamophobia he be suspend for refuse to obey an order from his party leader do the minister understand why it be that not only among muslim community but across a much wide range of believer and non believer people be become increasingly concerned that in the eye of this government islamophobia be see as somehow less abhorrent than other form of racism 
 the government be absolutely clear that those be not appropriate comment that be completely clear any form of religious hatred be not acceptable in our society 
 the recent rise in anti muslim hate incident and crime be really worry will the government do everything they can to improve education so as to improve multi faith understanding and tackle this scourge 
 my right hon friend make a good point education be critical and we need to bring our community together last weekend i be delighted to attend an inter faith event in my constituency that include holland park synagogue where it be host and al manaar mosque that inter faith work and community work together be critical 
 i call the shadow minister 
 for almost year this tory government have fail to appoint an independent adviser on islamophobia the former adviser have criticise the government for their failure to engage and reveal that he could not even get they to provide term of reference for his role do the minister agree that this government lack the political will to tackle this pernicious hatred or even to call it out 
 i strongly disagree we plan to appoint a new independent adviser on anti muslim hatred and we will update the house shortly 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 like so many i be fearful of the inability to call out islamophobia become a scaremongere tactic to stoke fear and division and garner support for the extreme far right it make life difficult or even dangerous for muslims across all nation more can and should be do on a cross party basis to tackle that hatred that start with be able to call out islamophobia when it occur could the minister clarify the line between be wrong and be islamophobic 
 there be no question but that those comment be wrong i face the mayor of london in opposition all the time and i could criticise he for many thing housing policing fire or transport but i would never accuse he of be in any way under the influence of islamists 
 that response will give people little comfort let i paint a picture for the minister of what life be like for many muslims grow up and live across these nation a month after the attack in my local mosque in carfin be petrol bomb the man be sentence to year and month respectively if ask most muslims will have their own story muslims be not ask for special treatment they work pay taxis send their kid to the same school and support the same football team the government have have ample opportunity over the past few week to commit to tackle this stain on society but there have be no substantial change in policy next   friday march   mark the un ’s international day to combat islamophobia will the government use that opportunity to commit to adopt the definition of the all party parliamentary group 
 i want to make it clear that this government will not tolerate religious hatred towards muslims or any other faith group that be a red line this government be aware very sadly of incident of anti muslim hatred which be why we put in place an extra £ of protective security funding for muslim mosque faith school and community we be behind our muslim community 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of section eviction on level of homelessness 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of section eviction on level of homelessness 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of section eviction on level of homelessness 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of section eviction on level of homelessness 
 the department publish official statistic on homelessness duty owe include the number of household threaten with homelessness follow service of a valid section notice we be commit to the abolition of section through our landmark renters reform bill which will deliver a fair private rent sector for both tenant and landlord 
 in the government promise to abolish section no fault eviction but the bill that they finally publish year later which the minister mention do not actually abolish section no fault eviction meanwhile child be live in costly temporary accommodation in my constituency we get or case every week the problem be pile up when will this government do what they promise stop delaying stop dither and abolish no fault eviction 
 as i have already say we be absolutely committed to abolish section the renters reform bill be go through parliament and i look forward to debate it with the hon lady when it return to this house 
 my borough of enfield top london ’s league for section eviction last year set a grim record and result in a dramatic rise in homeless family approach the council for help at its peak the borough have family approach the council for help in month yet minister be unwilling to stand up to their own back benchers the minister say the government be commit to abolish section eviction can i please ask he when when will he bring the bill back so we can bring an end to no fault eviction 
 i pay tribute to the hon lady who i have hear campaign on this issue a number of time i be well aware of her concern for her constituent as i say we be absolutely committed to abolish section we will bring forward the bill as soon as we be able to do so i would also say to she that the mayor of london be not build enough home he be not build enough home to meet the government assess need for london he be not even build home to his own target so i encourage she to have a conversation with he as well 
 in salford from april to november last year approximately individual present to salford city council in crisis because of section notice salford ’s social housing waiting list be currently in the thousand private market rent be outstrip income and local housing allowance rate at a frighteningly exponential rate there be no affordable home to go to once someone be evict from a property so homelessness be now at acute level in salford this be not just a housing crisis this be a homelessness crisis in salford when be the government go to bring back the renters reform bill with robust amendment finally ban section eviction what action will the minister take to ensure that my constituent urgently have long term secure tenancy 
 again i have hear the hon lady talk about this issue a number of time we be absolutely committed to the abolition of section i be personally committed to that we will bring back the bill as soon as we be able to do so 
 i call the shadow minister 
 in resist labour ’s effort to strengthen the renters reform bill ministers have repeatedly argue that the legislation as draft strike precisely the right balance between the interest of tenant and those of landlord yet by water down protection for renter and far delay the long overdue abolition of section eviction the package of draft government amendment to the bill that we see last week will tilt the play field decisively back towards the landlord interest be we to believe that the government have honestly decide at the hour that it be landlord who need more right and power or be this not simply a crude attempt to manage an increasingly fractious tory party at a shameful cost to hard press private tenant 
 the hon gentleman like various member who have speak be a committed campaigner on this issue i enjoy our time together in the public bill   committee we need to strike the balance he have just speak about that be why we be discuss the bill with both landlord group and tenant group we be meet colleague on the government benches and the labour benches and those in the small party too we be ensure that when we bring the bill back it be in the good possible shape so that it afford protection and security for tenant but protection in fairness for landlord too 
 what his planned timescale be for review the flood recovery framework 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question i be pleased to report that the review of the flood recovery framework have already begin and i expect the work to be complete by autumn this year we will of course update parliament in the usual way when that review be complete 
 my constituent lucy own ride leisure event on wyboston lakes which flood again during storm henk she can not get insurance and her business be not entitle to compensation under the flood recovery framework because of the government ’s arbitrary decision to expect cash strap council to cover the cost if few than property be impact it be very unfair that my constituent have fall through the safety net she will not be the only with property in kempston regularly affect by flooding will the minister crack that anomaly in the framework and help my constituent save her business 
 i be sorry to hear about that case and if the hon gentleman wish to write to i give detail of the business i will of course look into it as for storm henk property have be identify as eligible for grant support that cover upper tier local authority and to date payment of £ have be report by authority to impact householder and business there always have to be a rubric in these case and this issue will be consider during the flood recovery framework review on which as i have say we will report back to the house however the offer be there if the hon gentleman wish to write to i i will happily look at what he have to say 
 whiston have be flood repeatedly over the past decade and there be a huge ongoing issue but rotherham council recently approve the building of new home there whiston parish council which be independently align and thus not party political call a special public meeting about the plan which show water run uphill which i believe it do not do and floodwater drain into a non existent stream this surely demonstrate that rotherham council do not understand the issue of flooding do my right hon friend agree that all council include rotherham have a responsibility not to build on floodplain 
 my hon friend have raise an important issue between they the local planning authority and the environment agency should always find the most appropriate site for development and take hydrology and water management into consideration the minister for housing planning and building safety my hon friend   the member for north east derbyshire lee rowley will have hear what my hon friend have say and may contact he in due course 
 whether he have have recent discussion with local authority on adopt private road on new estate 
 the adoption of road be largely an issue for my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport who lead on that policy but i know because we have speak about this in the committee consider the leasehold and freehold reform bill that the hon gentleman have a significant interest in this matter we understand the strength of feeling about it and we be consider it far 
 across the country homeowner in a state of adoption limbo be be leave expose to exploitative and often unaccountable management company despite their warm word sadly the government do not take any of the action that the competition and markets authority urge they to take in order to end the issue of fleecehold once and for all give that the secretary of state be rumour to be on the lookout for legacy accomplishment will the minister urge his colleague to finally act on this issue during the current parliament or will fleecehold be yet another issue leave for the next government to tackle 
 with the good will in the world the cma report be publish a few day ago and the leasehold and freehold reform bill have be progress through the house for a number of month before that as for the hon gentleman ’s specific point i hope he will accept as other member include his colleague have do that the bill be a significant improvement for estate management provide the right of redress to a tribunal further information and the right to absolute clarity on service charge all those change have be rightly demand by resident and we be consider carefully whether there be anything furth than we can do 
 what step his department be take to support the delivery of town deal 
 my department be engage with all town deal recipient to support delivery through our performance monitoring process and we have a particular interest in progress in ipswich follow the allocation of £ secure by the hon gentleman for project there 
 i be very grateful for that investment as the secretary of state will know my hon friend   the member for bishop auckland dehenna davison   have to intervene because of the slow production of the business case we get over that hurdle but sadly year later we be still desperately wait for delivery on the ground when body other than the labour lead council be responsible for project they be deliver no problem but when the council be in the driving seat what we see be no delivery whether it be cock up or conspiracy it be not good enough will the secretary of state please intervene to let the council know that it be not right to put politic before the delivery that the people of ipswich so desperately need 
 my hon friend be a bonnie fechter for ipswich and he be absolutely right about for instance the local shopping parade project and the former r&w paul silo building i be afraid that we have not see the progress that we would expect it be indeed the case that the labour council in ipswich be not deliver for the people of ipswich in the way that my hon friend so brilliantly do 
 i think that the secretary of state ’s government be introduce all these deal in order to help the part of the country that be struggle and where more people on low earning live like he i have be look carefully at who be get the money why do so much of it go to tory marginal seat be that fair 
 ipswich be an area that deserve investment an area that have be overlook and undervalue under labour government secondly on friday i be proud to be able to announce additional investment in a mass transit system which will enable the hon gentleman ’s constituent in huddersfield to travel more quickly across west yorkshire to leeds and bradford sadly it be the case at the moment that we do not have conservative mp in leeds or bradford but we know that the labour marginal seat in leeds and bradford and of course the marginal seat of huddersfield will very soon have conservative representation 
 what the eligibility criterion for the community ownership fund be 
 what the eligibility criterion for the community ownership fund be 
 the £ community ownership fund be open to voluntary and community organisation or parish town and community council from all part of the united kingdom that have a viable plan for take ownership of a community asset at risk and run it sustainably for community benefit so far we have award £ to community project include £ to gigg lane the home of bury fc detailed guidance on the criterion be available in the prospectus on gov.uk 
 silsden methodist church in my constituency have not be use for worship for some time but it be a really important community space where a wide range of community group meet regularly sadly i understand that the methodist church may now sell the building threaten the future of these group but silsden parish council have manage to have the building list as an asset of community value could my hon friend tell i whether the community ownership fund might be a suitable source of funding to secure the future of the building or which other fund the parish council should be look at 
 it sound as though the church be eligible but i be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss eligibility far applicant can bid for up to £ in capital funding from the community ownership fund with additional revenue funding available but in the instance i would recommend that interested applicant read the prospectus on gov.uk as this will cover all they need to know regard eligibility requirement funding available and the application process 
 would my hon friend consider amend the criterion for community ownership fund application to include the potential community purchase of redundant council asset it would bring back to life many publicly own building and space that be currently serve no purpose or be underuse 
 i thank my hon friend for his advocacy for the fund and for his constituent in bury the community ownership fund work alongside exist community asset transfer and support they by fund the cost of renovation and refurbishment we can not fund the cost of purchase publicly own asset where the public authority would credit a capital receipt except in the case of parish town and community council but i be happy to meet he to discuss this issue far 
 in many community in westmorland the pub be the centre of the community and be often under threat in some case the local pub such as the ship inn in sandside have close down altogether the community ownership fund be clearly a very good way of allow the community to bring such business back into public use but do the fund allow community to go through the process of compulsory purchase so that a building can be take from an owner who be unwilling to sell and make useful again for the local community 
 i think the cpo process be probably a bit too lengthy for the fund itself but i be happy to meet the hon gentleman to discuss the project directly we be very happy to help fund community pub through the community ownership fund 
 the citizens theatre in glasgow be a much beloved institution and have be undergo refurbishment for several year it have have a range of funding from glasgow city council the scottish government and historic environment scotland but due to inflation and various measure it still require additional funding to make up the balance    and complete its really significant refurbishment programme be the community ownership fund something that the citizens theatre might be able to avail itself of 
 once again it sound as though the theatre may be eligible i can not comment on its eligibility today but i be happy to meet the hon lady to discuss whether the fund be appropriate for the citizens theatre 
 what step his department be take to help ensure the financial sustainability of local authority 
 we have make available up to £ for local authority through the local government finance settlement for an above inflation increase of up to £ or in cash term on of course that include an additional £ of funding which be announce by my hon friend the minister for local government on   january 
 aside from pothole the issue that have cause the most angst for derbyshire county council be the significant rise in the cost of residential placement for look after child the council believe that the market for this be now completely out of control and that price be excessive be there more that the government can do to help council financially to pay these bill or to find a well way to structure that market so that the bill be not so high 
 my hon friend make an important point we be spend £ additionally on adult and child ’s social care but he be right to say that the cost of residential home for look after child be excessive and a number of private equity firm be operate like bandit in this area i have talk to the minister responsible the under secretary of state for education my hon friend   the member for wantage david johnston and action will be forthcoming 
 i call the chair of the select committee clive betts 
 the select committee recently produce a report on local government finance in which we say that the government must act now if local authority be to survive this severe crisis what have the secretary of state do he have ask every local authority to produce a productivity plan that sound a bit like advise council how to spend well the money they have not get he have ask local authority to identify 
 way to reduce wasteful spend 
 what do he think they have be do for the last year in particular he have ask they to identify waste on 
 discredit staff equality diversity and inclusion programme 
 how much do he think that will save when it come to avoid section notice 
 the chairman of the select committee be right to say that local government be face challenge but there be outstanding council north lincolnshire and south norfolk for example that be continue to ensure that they can build up surplus and deliver effective service that be because they put productivity there be some local authority lamentably that be not put productivity they include south cambridgeshire with its plan for a day week and st albans which be still spend money on discredit form of training that only increase division rather than bring community together it be no coincidence that both those local authority be liberal democrat 
 whether his department be take step to ensure that there be appropriate recourse for renter if property repair and safety concern be not adequately deal with by landlord 
 where landlord fail to keep their property in an acceptable condition local authority can issue improvement notice and impose penalty for non compliance social tenant can already access the housing ombudsman service and the renters reform bill will establish a new landlord ombudsman service so that private tenant can also seek free redress 
 while these change in legislation be welcome it be clear that more must be do too many rental and leasehold resident in my constituency face ongoing issue in ensure that landlord and freeholder face up to their responsibility will the minister work with i to ensure that my resident in precarious situation with unresponsive landlord or leaseholder be able to access the correct course of remedial action in a timely and effective manner 
 i will indeed work with my hon friend to ensure that his resident who he be such a brilliant champion for can access redress we be committed to protect tenant from the minority of landlord and agent who provide a poor service where a property be manage by an agent resident can seek redress through the property ombudsman or the property redress scheme as well as the housing ombudsman for social tenant and the new ombudsman for private tenant the leasehold and freehold reform bill will require freeholder who manage their property to join a redress scheme too 
 too many child across the country be still be hospitalise because there be mould in their private rent home repair and concern especially about mould be the subject of awaab ’s law which be be bring in but private landlord be be let off the hook will the minister consider support my private member ’s bill to extend awaab ’s law and ensure that private landlord fulfil their responsibility to fix mould 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for the time we have spend together discuss her private member ’s bill through the renters reform bill we be introduce   a new decent home standard for the private rented sector which i believe cover the majority of her bill but i would be happy to continue those discussion with she far 
 what step he be take to implement the norfolk devolution deal 
 my department be support the implementation of the norfolk devolution deal which be progress well norfolk county council under its brilliant leader intend to vote to change its governance in july lead to the election of a directly elect leader in may 
 the budget in a couple of day time could do thing for norfolk it could announce the county deal to give norfolk control of its future even more importantly it could provide the vehicle for my sheringham roundabout which the secretary of state know all about the roundabout will be wonderful for my north norfolk constituency so have he convince the chancellor to announce it yet 
 i can not reveal the nature of any discussion i have have with the chancellor but sheringham roundabout be of the single most important infrastructure investment in norfolk my hon friend   the member for north norfolk duncan baker   have convincingly make the case to i and i hope we will be able to get motor on it before too long 
 what step he be take to increase the provision of social rent housing 
 our £ affordable housing programme will deliver thousand of affordable home for both rent and purchase right across the country the levelling up white paper commit to increase the supply of social rent home and a large number of the new home deliver through our affordable home programme will be for social rent 
 in bolton people be on a housing waiting list there be an month wait for a bedroom house and on average to people apply for each home that come up family be often refer to the private rent sector which they be not able to afford we know that rent be sky high after year of this tory government fail to build affordable home will the minister now apologise to my constituent who be stick in temporary accommodation 
 the hon lady mention the last year well since we have deliver over new affordable home include over affordable home for rent of which be for social rent we be commit to build more home for people like her constituent 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 on friday at the convention of the north i be delighted to confirm enhanced devolution deal for the liverpool city region west yorkshire and south yorkshire and additional investment in blackpool sheffield and blackburn that include £ for tony ’s empress ballroom which as you know mr speaker be an iconic northern soul dance hall i look forward to visit it with you and the shadow secretary of state soon 
 on the dancefloor tonight 
 a constituent recently come to my surgery with her year old son to show some appalling photograph of the private rent accommodation in which they live the little boy ask i whether he be go to die because of the thick mould in his bedroom give the housing ombudsman ’s recent remark particularly emphasise the link between housing condition and health what urgent action will the secretary of state take to address the appalling situation in the private rent sector 
 we will shortly say more about the decent home standard and the extension of the ombudsman ’s power to deal with precisely the sort of situation that the hon lady raise 
 my local housing association flagship newtide have sell off more home in aldeburgh at auction since the last levelling up housing and communities question however it be fail to take action on the antisocial behaviour that be affect several of my constituent in saxmundham what power can we apply to make sure that people who do the right thing and want to live peacefully in their home be not surround by people who deal drug breed illegal pet and make other people ’s live a misery

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the home office if he will make a statement on the publication of report by the former independent chief inspector of border and immigration on   february   and how the inspectorate will now operate in the absence of a chief inspector or deputy 
 we recognise that independent scrutiny such as that provide by the independent chief inspector of border and immigration play an important role in ensure that we have an effective immigration system in january the home secretary make a promise to the former chief inspector to publish all overdue report as soon as possible which i repeat in the house last month in response to an early urgent question last thursday we deliver on that promise by publish all report that be outside the week commitment to review and respond we take icibi report seriously and we do not wait until publication to act on its finding indeed some of the report recommendation have now be implement and work be ongoing across the department to implement other that include action to strengthen border security and improve the system for process asylum claim 
 the final report from the former chief inspector will be publish in the established week period there be no requirement for a chief inspector to be in place for that to happen but the process of appoint his replacement be under way with the advert go live the day after the former chief inspector have his appointment terminate an appointment will be make follow robust competition in accordance with the governance code on public appointment in addition we be look at option to appoint an interim chief inspector we will of course update the house on the outcome of the appointment process we will also continue work with the right hon lady ’s home affairs committee in relation to these matter 
 the security and effectiveness of the uk border be of paramount importance the government recognise that which be why we have take wide range action to tackle illegal migration and reform our asylum system our effort be pay off but there be more to do we will never compromise on this we will always put the safety and interest of the british people 
 i agree with the minister that the role of the independent chief inspector of border and immigration provide indispensable scrutiny of vital home office function on   tuesday february the home secretary sack david neal day later the home office publish of the report that the chief inspector have submit during his tenure none of which have be publish within the agree week deadline follow receipt 
 the report raise multiple serious concern about the home office ’s handling of border security and immigration operation will the minister confirm what action be be take to address the report finding that the protection   of border at airport be neither effective nor efficient with border post be leave unstaffed what step will the minister take to remedy the serious failure identify in attempt to discover illegal good at airport do the minister accept the conclusion that attempt to clear the legacy backlog at all cost 
 have lead to perverse outcome for claimant and staff 
 with quality assurance sacrifice for increase productivity with the new chief inspector not expect to be in post for to month and with no deputy to step up and exercise statutory responsibility will the minister explain exactly how the inspectorate will operate during that period be all inspection work now on hold and what happen to the inspectorate ’s plus member of staff 
 last week david neal tell the select committee of his concern regard wethersfield asylum accommodation centre relate to suicide violence and the lack of expertise to manage the situation will the minister now agree to the committee ’s request to visit wethersfield 
 the committee last week publish the change that david neal think need to be make to improve the effectiveness of the inspectorate include the power to publish its own report create a deputy position and provide access to commercial contract enter into by the home office do the minister have any plan to implement any of those recommendation finally will he comment on the joint letter send by national home affair editor complain about the decision to publish a slew of home office report on the same day as the sarah everard report 
 i be grateful to the chair of the home affairs committee not only for ask those various question but for the opportunity to respond to today ’s urgent question 
 it be rather surprising that minister be be criticise for do precisely what they say they would do i be press a couple of time on when the report would be publish i say that it would happen soon i subsequently say that it would happen very soon and that commitment be fulfil i give the right hon lady this undertaking because this issue be important and i care about it as i know she do the outstanding report will be respond to in full and in the proper way within the week window i refer back to the commitment that my late friend james brokenshire make to the house she will appreciate that i come back to the department in december i would argue that we have make progress in publish the report i assure the house that the exist report that have not yet be respond to will be deal with within the week window we will return to that approach in deal with these matter which be the right thing to do 
 on the recommendation in the various report we have obviously respond to those report a number of recommendation have be accept a number have be progress and a number have be complete the report speak for themselves and give an indication of the direction of travel that we intend to take we also want to engage with the next inspector regard that performance to ensure that they have an important role in oversee the delivery of the commitment that we have make in response to the issue that be understandably raise in the report 
 general aviation fall within the report that be still to be respond to as i say that will happen within the week window i undertake to fulfil that commitment on the asylum backlog it be fair to say that there have be pressure from this house to get on and process asylum claim i would argue that the team have do remarkable work in deliver on the commitment to get on and process the legacy backlog there have be much learn along the way which we will take forward into future processing there will be increase sampling in the way that the inspector recommend as well as improvement to it 
 arrangement for the icibi function in this period be under consideration the minister for counter illegal migration be the lead on that aspect of the department ’s work i know that ministers will update the house accordingly i be happy to consider the request from the home affairs committee to visit wethersfield 
 of the most frustrating thing about all of this be that if mr neal have not go to the medium in the way that he do and put that information into the public domain in a way that be in breach of the term of the agreement that he have with the department to take on this capacity he would still be in post and would be able to engage in the dialogue this week 
 to follow up on some specific question from the chair of the home affairs committee that the minister do not pick up on be it not the case that david neal be dismiss by team call by a civil servant why be he not afford the courtesy of see a minister be it not also the case that despite the recruitment process have start last november no suitable candidate come forward and the post have to be readvertise at a high salary 
 thirdly the minister have not mention anything about how the inspectorate actually operate be it not the case that the civil servant be unable to carry on their work on the report they be currently work on unable to carry out any inspection unable to pick up the schedule of report that have be program and unable to comment on any response to the report 
 finally can the minister assure i that there be no redaction and nothing be remove from the report publish en masse last week because there be no inspector or deputy inspector to challenge the content of the report that have be put into the public domain 
 on my hon friend ’s final point i will go away and check and i will write to he this be clearly an important function the recruitment process be restart the day after mr neal leave the role we be keen to make progress in appoint a new independent chief inspector of border and immigration and i encourage people to put themselves forward it be an important role and the government value it the relationship with the icibi will be in the term that i set out it will get on and publish report within the week framework for the exist workload we will continue to work constructively with it when mr neal ’s successor be appoint the permanent secretary be engage with the administrative team at the icibi and we be look at what can be do in the interim to bridge the gap between mr neal leave and the new inspector take post 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 we think of the family and friend of the year old who lose her life in the channel this weekend it matter more than ever that we stop the criminal gang and dangerous crossing that be undermine border security and put so many life at risk 
 the tory home secretary have shamefully try to bury or hide inspectorate report and national audit office report with damn revelation about britain ’s border and now he have go into hiding himself he should be do a statement on those report which show shocking border security failure include border and custom post not staff in airport the inspectorate be tell 
 custom be shut down for the summer 
 it find that equipment be 
 either break not available or untrusted 
 and that there be 
 a lack of anti smuggling capability 
 mr neal say that 
 protection of the border be neither effective nor efficient 
 will the minister tell we how many time custom and border post have go unstaffed this year do he even know how many high risk private flight be not check in person how long will there be no inspector in post 
 more finding only people have be remove under the inadmissibility process that the government claim would cover ten of thousand and unaccompanied child who go missing have still not be find on rwanda £ of taxpayer money will have be spend even if no be send if people go it will be £ that be over half a pound on a scheme that will cover less than of uk asylum arrival nearly £ per person i say to the minister do not give we any garbage about the tories have a plan that be not a plan it be a farce why do they not stop waste that money and instead put it into rebuild border security and stop the criminal gang that be labour ’s plan 
 finally there be the revelation that the home office have go a shocking £ over budget this year because it fail on the backlog on return on hotel and on rwanda—14 year of tory government waste taxpayer money weaken britain ’s security they have bust the home office budget and break britain ’s border instead of hide and run away why do they not just get out of the way and let someone else do the job properly 
 that be a contribution to the house full of soundbite as ever but light on policy substance we hear time and again from the right hon lady and her colleague a lot of criticism of what the government be do and absolutely no credible policy alternative in response it be incredibly frustrating it just will not do and the british people see straight through it 
 i share the right hon lady ’s sentiment about the terrible incident at the weekend when that young girl lose her life in the last few week we have yet again see life lose in the channel and that be a source of regret for all of we that be why the government be absolutely   determined to put an end to these channel crossing we be make progress that be why the number of crossing last year be down by over a compare with the year before and albanian arrival be down by over 90%—but there be more work to do and we will continue to see through the plan that be deliver those result 
 the right hon lady mention rwanda we have a fundamental point of difference in that the government believe that the rwanda policy be an important part of the answer in put those evil criminal gang out of business it be not acceptable to spend £ a day in the asylum system however it do not take many spend of £ a day to get to the figure that have be provide to the nao in a transparent manner we will continue to publish those through the annual report and account we think that advance that policy and put those criminal gang out of action be the right thing to do recognise that the policy be novel and have be challenge she will of course have the opportunity to vote for the rwanda legislation when it come back from the other place and i certainly encourage she and her colleague to be in the lobby with we because it just will not do to have no credible plan 
 the right hon lady refer to of the comment make in the report we do not accept it the inspection cover only a small part of our border operation at a specific location and over a limited time period it be a snapshot and it be inappropriate to draw unsubstantiated wide conclusion through sweeping statement base on a day inspection ultimately border force facilitate passenger arrival last year process over of passenger within service standard significant progress have be make since the report be commission to increase the number of officer train in vulnerability and behavioural detection and that be set to continue we treat the inspector ’s recommendation with the utmost seriousness we get on and deliver on those recommendation and as i have consistently set out to the house we now have a commitment to respond to those report within week 
 follow on from that point there be clearly an issue with publication within week bear in mind that the public purse be fund civil servant and a chief inspector of immigration have my hon friend consider a statutory basis for the week requirement or whatever requirement be necessary or proportionate for the publication of such report to ensure efficiency in the system 
 in his usual way my hon friend come to the house with constructive suggestion for how the government can go about their work i be happy to put that suggestion to the minister who lead on these matter in the department i can absolutely assure my hon friend that there be a commitment to engage with the report within that week window which i would argue be within both the letter and the spirit of what the late great james brokenshire say a few year ago 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i thank david neal for his work nobody can doubt that he be an independent chief inspector of border and immigration   and his report bear testament to that work he call out the home office for be particularly poor at communication and for its datum be inexcusably awful in relation to border force he highlight 
 basic stuff not be do 
 he shine a bright light on the shoddy treatment of unaccompanied child in hotel some of whom be still miss to this day and have not be find by the home office he highlight the 
 lack of grip and poor leadership 
 that result in those child become lose he also highlight the chaos and the secret policy be operate as part of the afghan citizen resettlement scheme utterly unacceptable 
 what happen now to the plan inspection that be stick in limbo those inspection include adult at risk which be crucial as people have commit suicide in asylum accommodation small boat be all the more critical give the tragic loss of a year old wee girl just this week on high performance visa on rwanda on georgia and on age assessment what will happen to the work plan that the chief inspector set out and to the staff expert inspector who be in place to deliver it will david neal ’s recommendation be take on by whoever follow he in that post what will the department do for future report next time a report be publish will the minister make a statement to the house rather than be bring here by an urgent question 
 i be very grateful to the snp spokesman for that variety of question i too actually want to place on record my thank to mr neal for the work that he did—[interruption there be chuntere from opposition members but it be perfectly right and proper to thank he for his work 
 there be recommendation that the government have accept and be take forward we treat the outcome of those report with the seriousness that they warrant we will continue to work through those recommendation even in the absence of an icibi we will continue to make progress against our commitment obviously we want to get on and appoint a replacement for mr neal and that process be under way we want to do that as quickly as possible while also make sure that we properly engage the home affairs committee in that process and we will do so in the way that that committee would rightly expect 
 it be welcome that we no long have any unaccompanied asylum seek child hotel under the auspex of the home office but the recommendation that be make within the report still stand and again we treat they seriously as i say at an early home affairs committee appearance i treat trace miss asylum seek child with the utmost seriousness and with well relationship with the police improve guidance and other step we have manage to track down more of those child since we meet at the home affairs committee 
 we continue to see afghans arrive under the acr that be welcome and we will continue to evolve that scheme and make improvement where we can we have make commitment around the scheme and it be of real importance to i fulfil our promise to those who work with the british government and to other be a responsibility that i take incredibly seriously 
 i want to make sure that we go about this recruitment process in the proper way involve the home affairs committee the permanent secretary be leading engagement with the secretariat at the icibi and we will get on and appoint a successor 
 i pay tribute to david neal it be fair to say that when we do his pre appointment scrutiny at the home affairs committee we have doubt but he have prove himself to be a diligent and dog public servant in some of the most difficult circumstance notwithstanding the fact that he have not be reappointe the report that have be publish raise significant issue whether that be the border at london city airport afghan resettlement or child asylum seeker even though those report have only just be publish what assurance can the minister give that work have be undertake on they will he also give i his thought on the excellent suggestion that the post should be make independent so that the chief inspector can publish report when they be ready rather than drop they into the home office memory hole and hop for the good 
 my hon friend be a diligent member of the home affairs committee it be fair to say that where recommendation be make we engage with they constructively and progress will quite often be make against those recommendation even in advance of report be publish he can absolutely have an assurance from i that we will continue to work through the commitment that we have make in respond to various recommendation in those report and have make this promise to this house that future report will be publish within an week window 
 my hon friend have raise a point about procedure i be happy to take that point away and raise it with ministerial colleague who have direct responsibility for the icibi relationship 
 as colleague have say the home affairs committee find mr neal to be a very diligent and commit public servant do the minister share the chief inspector ’s concern about unaccompanied child migrant he report on they play very unsuitable game try to bet which of they would be the to go into foster care and on their age be overestimated result in child share bedroom with much old adult do the minister propose to follow up on any of the issue that the chief inspector raise 
 the right hon lady should know that that be an area we have be very concerned about the issue of unaccompanied asylum seek child should never ever be the subject of a game i think all of we be horrified to hear about that incident and follow those inspection finding the department launch an immediate investigation into the inappropriate behaviour of the support worker who be remove from site immediately and do not return as i have say all hotel use to accommodate unaccompanied asylum seek child have since close the department have take the recommendation seriously and there be a lot of learn there for the future as we take forward our work include our wide work with local authority on safeguard the most vulnerable child 
 i welcome the minister ’s early assurance about afghans who fight with or otherwise support our troop against the taliban can he explain for the benefit of those of we not au fait with the detail of this dispute for what reason these report be not publish early and at what level the decision not to publish be take have they be publish soon would the inspector have be out of a job and would we have be look for a replacement 
 we have go into the termination of the inspector ’s appointment before in this house he lose the confidence of the home secretary and information be share in the medium that ought not to have be share it be confidential and outside the appropriate publication process on the publication of report i can not speak to early decision make under previous minister but i say very clearly on a number of occasion that we would get on and respond to the report and that be precisely what we have do i also reassure the house today i think this be important and that the house be interested in this point that we will respond to the report within week that arguably live up to both the letter and spirit of the commitment that james brokenshire make all those year ago when he hold this role 
 these report be cumulatively a remarkable catalogue of past failing but may i invite the minister to look ahead he have refer to the rwanda scheme do he agree that the incoming independent inspector must be allow to examine the working of that scheme and that it should not be implement unless and until the next inspector have give it a satisfactory bill of health 
 it will of course be for the next inspector to decide on their programme of work but i disagree with the right hon gentleman on his latter point i would argue that life be at stake and that every day that people lose their life in the channel be day too many we be make progress on see through our commitment to put an end to these channel crossing but the rwanda policy be absolutely front and centre it be the next piece of the jigsaw when it come to put these evil criminal gang out of business and we should not wait any long than be absolutely necessary to get on and deliver on that work 
 the rwanda policy have cost over £ an approximate cost of £ for each individual the government be seek to transport to rwanda will the bill ever be implement and be it good value for the taxpayer 
 i hear a lot of criticism there but no constructive suggestion on what the hon gentleman would do in the absence of the rwanda policy as i have say we engage properly and thoroughly with the national audit office on the figure and we continue to be commit to provide transparency around those figure through the annual report and account the rwanda policy be an important part of our answer when it come to put an end to these criminal gang and the terrible criminality that they oversee crucially this be about save life and we will get on and deliver the policy   he will no doubt have the opportunity in the next few week to vote for that bill and so help we to operationalise that policy and put those evil criminal gang out of business 
 the border inspectorate find that staff work in a home office run hotel make unaccompanied asylum seek child play a disgraceful game to find out which child be next to be place in foster care a practice certain to cause more distress to already traumatise child the same report find that agency worker employ to look after child as young as have insufficient background check and training what have the minister do to ensure that he understand the full extent of the risk to child in the asylum system and what step be he take to end such disgraceful practice and to guarantee that everyone work with child be properly vet and train 
 the hon lady be right to say that everybody work with child have to be properly vet we have take seriously the recommendation that mr neal make in response to that issue as i say to   the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott this be a terrible situation there be accountability in relation to the individual who think it appropriate to play that game which be to any member of this house and any right minded person abhorrent   the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes   be right to say that we be talk about child in difficult circumstance who have be through an awful lot all those individual i would use the word professionals”—have a responsibility to care for those child and to behave in an appropriate way befit their role there be no long any unaccompanied asylum seek child in hotel open under the home office ’s remit but there be value in the recommendation which should carry through into the work that we do with local authority 
 the independent anti slavery commissioner dame sara thornton raise concern about government policy on trafficking and slavery her contract be not renew and that crucial post be vacant for month david neal as the icibi raise concern about immigration and he be sack that post will be vacant for month the minister have say that independent scrutiny play an important role but do he not agree that under this government independent scrutiny be not only not value but become a sackable offence 
 i have be clear with the house about the basis on which mr neal ’s contract be terminate i do not think it be appropriate for he to share confidential information in the way he do it be outside the process for publication however as i have say repeatedly we want to get on and appoint a successor the chief inspector of border and immigration have an important role and remit the house and the government see value in it we be look at what can be do to bridge the gap in the absence of a full time permanent chief inspector we will no doubt say more once that work have be conclude 
 as chair of the all party parliamentary group for africa i meet david neal a number of time he be incredibly impressive robust well inform all over the detail and entirely independent it beggar belief that the government ignore his report for so long publication be essential for scrutiny sack he over teams and dump all the report out at once do the minister believe that the home office be so perfect and that everything be go so well that it should be above scrutiny or be it more the case that everything be go so badly include on rwanda the asylum backlog and our border security that there be no hope of improvement until we have a change of government 
 that be an interesting observation but what sit behind it i be afraid be a lack of policy and a lack of an alternative credible approach to border and immigration mr neal say this in response to the report be lay before parliament last week 
 i think it ’ a real positive that these report have be publish i think it bode well that the home secretary have grip his official in get these report publish so quickly 
 i agree with he i promise that we would lay those report before parliament we have get on and do it and we will table the outstanding report within the week window move forward 
 last week ’s figure show people still in asylum hotel david neal ’s report say 
 there be no evidence of a home office strategy to end hotel use as recommend by icibi in 
 he be right be he not 
 i be afraid that what be right be that the hon lady consistently vote against the strategy to end the use of hotel as do her colleague on the opposition front bench and back benches the way to address the issue of hotel be to diversify the accommodation offer to ensure that local authority area engage properly with dispersed accommodation i encourage all member of this house to take an interest in the performance of their local authority and to bring into be large site such as those that we have bring forward crucially we have to reduce the flow of people come across the channel and arrive in our country illegally every time opposition member have the chance to do something about the flow of people arrive which undoubtedly lead to the pressure that she touch on they refuse to do so that be where the scandal really lie 
 be the government ’s failure to tackle the asylum backlog the minister ’s inability to grapple with the asylum hotel issue or the staggering cost of the rwanda deal at £ per person take out of this country the reason why the minister have break the home office budget and will come to parliament cap in hand next week ask for an extra £ of funding for the home office 
 i be afraid that the hon member be yet another opposition member with no credible alternative to speak of just lot of complaint about the work that the government be do we be make progress   as i have say last year the number of people who arrive via the channel be down by a compare to the year before the population accommodate in hotel be go down and the number of hotel open be reduce 
 pound 
 the government be make progress we be live up to the commitment 
 pound 
 the hon member can keep parrot figure and chuntere from the back benches but i would rather he come forward with a credible alternative plan perhaps then we could have a conversation 
 the shamble that be the ongoing mismanagement of our border and the government mismanagement of the huge asylum backlog which be just refer to be now enhance by the additional shamble of an unnecessary interregnum in answer to my right hon friend   the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael the minister seem to imply that independent oversight would not be necessary in the next few week and month while there be an interregnum over the rwanda deal if the government be right in the good case scenario from their perspective—1 of all asylum seeker will go to rwanda apparently that be so important that independent oversight be not necessary during this period will the minister confirm that until a new inspector be formally and fully appoint and in post there will be no further progress in deport anybody to rwanda 
 it be rather ironic that the hon gentleman argue for due process on the hand and say that we should dispense with it on the other the contract of the chief inspector of border be terminate because of respect in which his action be not in accordance    with the agreement around the post that be not an acceptable situation the home secretary lose confidence in he and that be why step be take 
 i welcome oversight and accountability there will be opportunity for scrutiny of the work on rwanda on the point that the hon gentleman seek to suggest that i have make i be clear in say that we should not waste any time when life be at risk in the channel we should not waste a moment in get on and operationalise that rwanda policy but there will of course be plenty of opportunity for scrutiny of that work 
 may i put on record my thank to the minister for all the work that he do for of my constituent last week and for ensure that of the ukrainian baby get back to northern ireland 
 we should bear in mind the gap that have be leave in this vital component of our immigration response on the role of civil servant and the importance of ministerial oversight most recently the difficulty in northern ireland where there be an absence of ministers in situ be that although senior civil servant could make decision they be loth to do so and those who make decision do not provide the usual accountability or explanation of decision how will the minister ensure that that do not remain the case until a replacement for the independent chief inspector of border and immigration be in place 
 the hon member always go about his business in the house diligently and he speak with great passion about northern ireland i be delighted that we now have ministers back in government there i look forward to engage with counterpart in northern ireland on these issue i reassure he that that engagement will be the cornerstone of the work that we do there be a commitment to engage thoroughly and extensively as i say we want to get on and appoint a replacement inspector it be an important role for everybody in the united kingdom the function that the inspector oversee matter to everybody the length and breadth of this country and we will make that appointment as soon as we can 
 on a point of order mr speaker i extend my thank to your office and to the clerks for prepare for this point of order 
 on   friday march during the debate on the conversion practices prohibition bill   the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns   speak of the need for lgbt member and staff to feel safe come to work in this place in response i ask she 
 in fact people in the lgb community be often refer to as bigot transphobe and other slur just because we have concern about legislation such as this and want to make sure that young lgb people be protect and tran people do the hon lady agree that that rule must apply to all side of any debate not just to the side that she favours?”the hon member respond 
 the hon gentleman be entirely right but there be letter miss in his lgb the letter t. we do not divide the lgbt community in this place member can say that they have concern about what we be do but by remove the t the hon gentleman be suggest that transgender people do not exist he be suggest that they be less than other lgb people and i will not stand for that because it be trans people who stand with gay people at stonewall it be trans people who fight alongside they for lgb right i will happily discuss the intricacy of legislation with the hon gentleman but when he choose to eradicate that be wrong 
 later in the debate she make the follow comment about the uk ’s only gay right charity 
 that include the lgb alliance who have also remove the t official report   march vol c. 
 that raise the follow serious concern despite specifically mention the safety of trans people immediately prior to ask my question the member launch into what feel like a target attack on my character furthermore it feel like that be aggravate by my protect characteristic of same sex attraction and gender critical belief in addition the member a heterosexual woman feel it appropriate to lecture i a homosexual male on the boundary under which she believe i should be permit to exercise my right and protection specifically she demand that this should centre the need of the completely separate protect characteristic of gender reassignment commonly know as force teaming the member then give an inaccurate account of the stonewall riot which have be correct repeatedly by eyewitness testimony 
 as a direct consequence various news outlet have wrongly accuse i of drop the t and have ignore the context of a straight woman lecture a gay man about what right he be permit to use give the sensitivity of these matter that be deeply concern i have have year of abuse include murderous threat mainly from heterosexual who claim to be ally but they be ally of queer theory not lesbian gay man bisexual or transsexual people that outburst feel deliberate and target i consider these behaviour emblematic of the modern day homophobia that have   be insinuate into our culture by organisation such as stonewall and mermaids in response to the clip on social medium 
 order i hope the member will be come to an end very quickly 
 mr speaker this be the text that be agree with the clerks 
 in response to the video clip on social medium prominent transexual campaigner dr debbie hayton say 
 we tran people value the right to organise separately from the lgb as trans people my lgb friend need and deserve the same right to organise separately from we we can still organise together when it serve both group nobody be less 
 a statement issue by the gay men ’s network note that the hon member for rutland and melton ’s comment be 
 not characteristic of an otherwise civilised debate we urge she to reflect on these comment and consider apologise 
 i agree at the very least the member should apologise not just to i but to other who may feel threaten by her remark any further consideration will be contingent on that
