 for too long university have be treat as political battleground this labour government will treat they as engine of opportunity and growth on   july i publish the report of the independent review of the office for students and appoint sir david behan who lead the review as the interim chair under new leadership and with a sharpen remit the office for student will concentrate on secure the future of university and put student 
 i welcome the secretary of state to her position last year the house of lords industry and regulators committee present its report which be very critical of the ofs we do not need to read between the line to understand just how poorly the committee think of it it feel that it be serve neither the student nor the provider what plan do she have to reset the relationship with the ofs so that it give renew focus to the student that it be suppose to represent 
 i thank my hon friend for all his work in this important area to ensure that our university be recognise as a crucial part of how we drive growth in our country sir david ’s review which we publish in july be a platform for improvement and i welcome and accept its core finding the government will support the ofs in refocus on few key priority to do what be most important for student and university and to do it well we will take the necessary action to support that work 
 young people in weston super mare and across our country deserve the very good opportunity since university centre weston have transform access to high education in our town mean that more can study close to home improve access how will the labour government seek to strengthen the strategic objective of the office for student to widen participation in community such as mine 
 i strongly agree with my hon friend about the importance of widen participation and he set out clearly how university be a key part of town and city right across our country the last government want to use our world lead sector as a political football talk down institution and watch on as the situation become even more desperate i have appoint the new interim chair to sharpen the focus of the office for students focus far more on the financial sustainability of the sector and return university to be the engine of growth and opportunity that we want to see after waste year 
 i be delighted to hear the right hon lady talk about engine of growth and opportunity because that be exactly what university be when they be well run in my county we have a new university the new model institute for technology and engineering which be do exactly that and offer incredible opportunity for young people to do a master programme in year and then as we be see with the new cohort to go into company as good as bae systems kier balfour beatty the atomic weapons establishment and other that work have be assist by the office for students which grant new degree award power do the right hon lady share my view that this be a deeply worthwhile enterprise that could be replicate around the country and will she come and visit herself

 i call the shadow minister 
 we have see attempt by hostile state to influence our high education sector which the last conservative government take action to counter do the secretary of state therefore share the concern about report that peking university hsbc business school in oxford may be partly operate under chinese communist party rule and do she expect the office for student to investigate that 
 the shadow minister will know that the office for students be independent but i will ensure that it look very carefully at the concern that he have set out and address they accordingly 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of level of academic freedom in the high education sector 
 the government fully support academic freedom high education must be a space for robust discussion and intellectual rigour and it be a labour government that enshrine freedom of expression into law our recent decision to pause the implementation of further part of the higher education freedom of speech act be precisely because we believe in academic freedom it be therefore crucial that the legal framework be workable baroness smith in the other place and official be speak with a range of stakeholder their view will form part of our consideration of all option for protect academic freedom into the future no option be off the table 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer and welcome she to her new position can she give the house a cast iron guarantee that when she decide to reverse the higher education freedom of speech act she give no consideration to the consequence of the new freedom of speech duty that the act would impose on university in term of their financial relationship with authoritarian regime such as the people ’s republic of china 
 yes i can give the right hon gentleman that reassurance we look very carefully and very closely at the way in which the legislation be go to operate i want to ensure that we have good strong workable legislation i be concerned about what i have hear from jewish group and other minority community about the unintended consequence that might follow from the legislation that be why i pause commencement with a view to get this right ensure that we protect academic freedom while avoid a situation where hate speech be allow to flourish on campus 
 i congratulate the secretary of state on take the hard decision that be need in government and i be very pleased to hear that no option be off the table what reassurance can she give i and other woman that she will protect female academic such as jo phoenix kathleen stock and selina todd from be bully and hound out of successful university career 
 like my hon friend i take have strong freedom of expression in our university and student be expose to a range of view some of which they might find difficult or disagree with extremely seriously that be why it be so important to have a wide range education official will ensure that we engage with a wide range of view in this important area as we look at next step and i would be more than happy to discuss that in more detail with she 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the secretary of state to her place the higher education freedom of speech act would have ensure that university in england have the tool they need to deal with interference and threat to freedom of speech and academic freedom wherever they originate now that the government will no long implement that act will she clarify her alternative plan to protect academic freedom in the high education sector 
 the hon gentleman will know that freedom of expression and academic freedom be incredibly important the office for students set out duty and many of those principle be already enshrine in law however i want to ensure that we get this right i be confident that he would not have want to be in a position where the act open up the potential for hate speech include holocaust denial to be spread on campus something that the minister in the previous government be unable to rule out 
 what information her department hold on the number of private school that close in england between may and july 
 exclude private special school around private school close each year there be a range of reason for closure include financial viability and departmental action where school be not meet require standard some private school close between   may   and   july it be also worth note that the number of pupil in private school increase in and that there have be a net increase of private school over that period 
 st joseph ’s preparatory school a small fee pay independent school in stoke on trent announce that it be close its door at the end of this year after a period of financial viability question what support will the department offer the city council and parent in stoke on trent to ensure that those child can still access class education

 malvern college malvern st james girl school bredon school and other school in west worcestershire that offer place to child with special educational need not only play an important role in our education system but support the local economy will the minister state that he do not want to see the closure of any of those important independent school in west worcestershire 
 this government ’s ambition be that all child and young people with send receive the right support to succeed in their education as they move into adult life we be committed to take a community wide approach improve inclusivity and expertise in mainstream school and ensure that special school cater to those with the most complex need child whose place in private school have be deem necessary by the local authority will not be affect by the tax change 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 at the start of the new term we all wish everybody well for the academic year ahead what will minister say next september to parent who because of labour ’s education tax find that class size be big and more school be full and that few child be able to get a place in their choice school in bristol bury salford or surrey 
 i welcome the right hon member to his place and i very much look forward to work with he to ensure that every child get the good start in life the number of child in private school have remain steady despite a real term increase in average private school fee since and an increase of since we can not predict closure but we will use indicator such as occupancy to monitor that my department work with local authority to help they to fulfil their duty to secure place

 the conservatives leave a trail of devastation across education and nowhere be that clear than in our current special educational need and disability system we know that for too many child and family the system be just not work but i give my personal commitment to hon member across the house that the government will listen to and work with family to deliver reform improve inclusivity in mainstream school and ensure that special school be able to help those with the most complex need 
 last week i visit expert citizens in stoke on trent where people with live experience of use public service help to inform system redesign many of my constituent across different council have report issue with send transport which highlight the importance of listen to people with live experience in example a single work mother may need to give up her job because she do not have a car she do not get send transport because she be mile outside and therefore she can not get her child to school do the secretary of state agree that send transport need a service rethink centre and build on the live experience of the parent and child who use that service 
 my hon friend be right to stress the need to listen to child family and all those work in the system in order to deliver reform if she can share some more detail with i i will happily take a look 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for her answer and to the minister for school standards for her response to last week ’s westminster hall debate lead by my hon friend   the member for hitchin alistair strathern on send provision in hertfordshire as the minister will recall there be many heartbreaking experience face by child and young people in stevenage and across hertfordshire where waiting time be much high than the national average will the secretary of state therefore consider a fair funding settlement for send provision in hertfordshire when she be next able to do so 
 my hon friend be right to draw attention to the significant interest in the westminster hall debate and the level of interest today demonstrate the importance of get this issue right i know from speak to he that he be concerned about the issue   i agree that it be important that there be a fair education funding system that direct funding where it be most need aspect of that be the national funding formula and allocate high need funding we will take our time to look carefully at whether any change be require include in hertfordshire 
 may i ask my right hon friend to detail the department ’s plan to help to solve the recruitment problem for send professional to enable school to deal with education health and care plan in constituency such as mine north somerset 
 it be certainly the case that there be a big workforce challenge and make sure that we have specialist in critical area be a central part of make sure child and young people can access the support they need our school support staff will play a crucial role in that which be why labour will reinstate the school support staff negotiate body we will make sure that teacher have more training alongside support staff in order to deliver well support and education for our young people and this year we be invest over £ to train more educational psychologists.[official report   october vol c. 2wc correction 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s answer on doorstep in surgery and over email family across basingstoke have tell i countless story of the obstacle they have to go through just to have the bare acknowledgement of their child ’s need only to go through a similar obstacle course for their child to be assess and yet again for they to get the help they be legally entitle to can the secretary of state offer family in basingstoke with experience of this fail system some hope that they can expect well in future 
 i join my hon friend in basingstoke during the general election campaign so i know that many family in basingstoke and right across our country be concern about this issue and i can give he that commitment member on the conservative benches may recall that the previous education secretary describe the system that she leave behind as that be lose lose lose i agree we be determined to turn that around which be why we have already restructure the department for education with much more focus on support for child with send as part of our school provision 
 speech and language support for child with special educational need and disability be clearly not a priority for the previous government i have see the damage that that have do to family in my constituency of ealing southall at a recent surgery mum tell i that she just want her young son to be able to tell she when he be in pain what step will the secretary of state take to ensure that child like those in my constituency receive the speech and language support that they need 
 my hon friend be right to highlight how important it be that all of our child have strong speech and language skill that be why this government will roll out early language intervention to make sure that all of our child get support at the early possible point include extend the nuffield early language intervention for this academic year because it be so important that we make a difference when our child be young 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer so far people in my constituency of hexham of the large constituency in the country routinely tell i of the struggle they face in enable their child to access the support they need and the education they be entitle to will the secretary of state or of her ministers meet with i to discuss the challenge of access send education in such a rural constituency 
 as the ever labour mp for hexham my hon friend will be a champion of rural community across the country i would be more than happy to meet with he or my hon friend the minister for school standards will meet with he to discuss this important concern which i know many member wish to discuss 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer and for her personal commitment to create a fairer funding system for child with special educational need in that light she will forgive i if i mention that the east riding have the low high need block allocation of any local authority in england so many people have be genuinely commit to a fair system in the past will the secretary of state set out how she will achieve that it be easy to support it in principle but it be very hard to find a way of deliver it in practice 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question and will make sure that official engage with he on that point if there be anything far he would like to share i will happily look at it he be right this be a difficult area and we need to make sure we get it right i be determined to deliver a system where all child and young people have every chance and opportunity particularly when it come to send support we will have to work across the house to get to a much strong and well position for our child and family 
 what be the secretary of state go to do about the capacity crisis that be rapidly emerge as ten of thousand of child be be force out of independent school by this government ’s deeply misguided vat policy i have a list of school in buckinghamshire with no place whatsoever and bristol city council be consider buy place from an independent school to put back in that school at taxpayer expense a child who recently leave that school at the parent expense 
 we be elect on a manifesto of drive high and rise standard in our state school the public back our policy we think it be right that we prioritise investment in our state school where the vast majority of our child go to school include the vast majority of child in the hon gentleman ’s constituency i suggest that he spend a bit more time think about their interest 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s commitment to improve the provision of send service in school but do she recognise that many ordinary hard work family make extraordinary effort to find provision ahead of a formal assessment in independent school as well will she commit to   make an assessment of what level of provision currently exist within the independent sector to satisfy special educational need because it will be material to the solution she will need to develop 
 as the under secretary of state for education my hon friend   the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan have set out we will make sure that where child have an education health and care plan the vat on fee policy change will not affect those child i recognise the point the right hon member make and i believe that parent have a right to choose where their child go to school but the vast majority of parent in our country who send their child to state school be also ambitious and aspirational for their child 
 maria in my constituency have a son who be in a specialist placement and in october last year that school say it could no long meet his need since then he have not be back in full time education while another headteacher keep tell i that special need provision in shropshire be decade behind elsewhere in the country if the secretary of state aspire for all child in the country to have their special need meet how be she go to ensure that happen in place that be struggle so much with funding such as shropshire 
 i recognise the challenge the hon lady set out and part of it be make sure that our mainstream school be well able to cater for child with a wide range of need i be very sorry to hear about the experience of her constituent and i be sure my hon friend the minister for school standards will be happy to meet she or to look into that far to see if any action can be take to support the family 
 in leicestershire special educational need have be a real problem that i have see in my constituency the last government make it of the trailblazer to come together and trial some of the new thing that could be do in special educational need and we start to see some progress in that will the secretary of state meet i and the other leicestershire mps to discuss how we can take that forward so we can get well provision for hinckley and bosworth and for leicestershire 
 the hon gentleman be right to draw attention to any emerge evidence that show new way of do thing as a new government we be keen to do precisely what he describe to make sure particularly when it come to a well join up between health and education that we see fast improvement i would be happy to meet he and leicestershire colleague although my hon friend the minister might be able to step in 
 too many eastbourne parent my mum include be force to relentlessly fight to get their child into the school that can well meet their child ’s special educational need that be so often down to a lack of funding so will the secretary of state commit to meet eastbourne family eastbourne school leader and i to hear   about the send landscape locally and provide the funding that local child with special educational need need and deserve 
 the hon member be right in his characterisation of a system that be adversarial and where so many parent have to fight to get a good education and support for their child i would be happy to do so or perhaps my hon friend the minister might take that meeting 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be in response to grow demand that the last conservative government increase the high need budget to £ and put in place a statutory override so that send relate deficit do not overwhelm council budget with that set to expire in what be the secretary of state ’s message to local authority be she push the chancellor to extend that protection or for deficit to be write off 
 i be genuinely surprised that the hon gentleman think that question be a source of strength it represent significant failure over year that we have end up in such a desperate position face our council we will of course look closely at all of this but after year when he will have hear that family have be terribly let down by the last government a period of reflection on his part might be in hand 
 what step her department be take to support the mental health and wellbeing of student 
 this government be break down barrier to opportunity by provide young people with the mental health support they need the office for students be provide university with £ this year to improve their mental health and wellbeing support our further education student support champion polly harrow be drive a strategic approach to support mental health for further education student 
 i thank the minister for her answer the children ’s society have find that british year old be the unhappy in europe and school absence be at record level often due to poor mental health or inadequate support for special educational need early intervention be key to tackle mental health issue among our child do the minister agree that by put a mental health professional into every primary and secondary school we could help end the youth mental health crisis 
 i thank the hon member for her question and sincere concern about the mental health of child and young people this government be commit to improve mental health and wellbeing support for all child and young people it be vital that the right support be available to every young person who need it that be why we will provide access to specialist mental health provision professional in every school 
 as i have already mention in the house a number of time i be a former teacher i be married to a current teacher and most of my friend be teachers—[hon member hear hear she ’ll be pleased with that the mental health of teacher after the last year be at rock bottom what step will the department take to support not just the mental health and wellbeing of our student which be really important but the mental health and wellbeing of our teacher 
 i thank my hon friend for make it extremely clear that he be a teacher and have teacher within his network he be right to mention the welfare and wellbeing of professional and of teacher i would like to offer he a meeting with an education minister to discuss that far 
 every year in the uk hundred of teenager take their own life child as young as like riley townsend in the constituency of ashfield who take his own life just a few week ago because of mental health problem what more can we do to support our young people through the social care and education system to stop this epidemic 
 i thank the hon member for highlight that very serious concern student suicide be serious and a concern matter in the academic year end the suicide rate for high education student in england and wales be low than in the general population of the same age group however every suicide be tragic and suicide expert sir louis appleby be oversee the national review of high education suicide to learn more to prevent suicide it have see excellent engagement from the sector and will report on that 
 last year there be a increase in the number of camhs referral in birmingham while also a sharp fall in the number of young people see within month of a referral do the minister agree that we need much more preventive support in school and close work between education and health body 
 my hon friend be right this government have commit to recruit additional staff across child and adult nhs mental health service that will help to reduce delay provide fast treatment and ease pressure on busy mental health service family hub be also crucial to provide that 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the previous conservative government introduce mental health support team in school and the impact of the covid-19 pandemic be still be feel by student particularly regard mental health will the secretary of state commit to continue those mental health support team to ensure that student can access the mental health care that they need 
 i thank the shadow minister for his question as i have already outline this government be commit to improve the mental health and wellbee   of child and young people and we will provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school 
 what step she be take to recruit more teacher 
 what step she be take to recruit more teacher 
 as a step in our mission to break down barrier to opportunity we will recruit additional teacher we have kickstarte the recruitment campaign and make a pay award reset the relationship with the education workforce we will re establish teaching as an attractive expert profession after year of damage under the previous government 
 this government have promise change in education and make a commitment to raise school standard and increase teacher number after year of tory neglect the scottish national party ’s year in power have lead to fall standard under resource school and a grow attainment gap between the rich and the rest do the minister agree that it be time for change give the scottish national party ’s dismal record on education in scotland 
 break down barrier to opportunity be a key mission for this government and the scottish labour party the snp have see attainment gap widen and child poverty soar but we will transform our education system so that all young people get the opportunity that they deserve by drive high and rise standard across our education system that be the change that this labour government will deliver 
 many teacher in my constituency welcome the drive to recruit more teacher but they also want the government to recognise the pressure on those already in the profession what step will the department take to improve teacher retention in constituency such as penrith and solway 
 i want teacher to not only remain in the profession but to thrive in it that be why we be listen and act on feedback the department alongside school leader have develop a workload reduction toolkit and the education staff wellbee charter we will deliver a range of measure to make teach a well value and respected profession 
 i recently visit herefordshire ludlow and north shropshire college which provide excellent further education opportunity for student in my constituency however there be not parity of funding for teacher in the fe sector and those in the school sector mean that post-16 education be now well fund for those pursue academic course than for those pursue vocational course will the secretary of state roll out the   pay rise to teacher in the fe sector also so that there be no increase in inequality between academic and vocational opportunity 
 we accept the school teachers review body ’s recommendation of a award for teacher and leader in maintain school in england from september it be a substantial award that recognise the hard work of those in our teaching profession we recognise the challenge in the fe sector also and the issue that the hon lady outline we will continue to keep the matter under review because we want to ensure that every child have the good opportunity whether that be in our school system or in our fe sector 
 the new government ’s focus on the serious recruitment and retention crisis be welcome however as we have hear the recent pay announcement overlook teacher who work in college who already face a pay gap of more than £ we have twice the proportion of student from disadvantaged background in our college as in school form so the recruitment issue be even more pressing in our college why be it that teacher of year old in school deserve a pay rise but teacher of year old in college do not 
 we recognise the challenge that the hon lady set out we be face an incredibly challenging fiscal position from the previous government we inherit a £ black hole to make up this be about the opportunity of young people in this country and we take the issue that she outline incredibly seriously we will continue to do what we can within the fiscal envelope that we have and within the system that we have inherit that be why we honour the recommendation of the strb review and we will continue to do what we can in fe 
 what step she be take to help improve educational outcome for a child in social care and b other care experience young people 
 i thank my hon friend for all the work that she have do in stand up for child in social care in recent year we will champion the ambition of all child and ensure that background be no barrier to success in our child ’s wellbee bill we will set out our plan to raise standard for all child in social care and will ensure that they be support to thrive 
 the drop out rate from university for care experience student be compare with just for non care experienced young people as thousand of student be arrive at university for the time this week what step be the minister take to ensure that there be a consistent package of support for care experience student at every university to help they overcome the barrier that they too often face and to ensure that university be a place where they feel welcome and can thrive 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and the passion with which it be deliver i recently speak to member of a child and young people ’s advisory group who tell i about some of the challenge they face at university in some case they have not even be inform about the option of university which be quite shocking we be commit to provide the good university experience for care leaver access to high education should be base on ability and attainment not background but too many child across our country do not get the chance to succeed the previous government could have do much more 
 we will act to address the persistent gap when it come to access and positive outcome for care experience young people we have issue guidance to university on support care experience young people and introduce statutory financial support include a £ bursary but after the last year there be still so much more to do 
 when she plan to bring forward the child ’s wellbee bill 
 the child ’s wellbee bill will be introduce as soon as parliamentary time allow the bill aim to put child and their wellbeing at the centre of the education and child ’s social care system and to ensure that every child have a fulfil childhood enable they to succeed and thrive 
 i know from visit school in my walton constituency that some of the most difficult challenge that teacher face often come from the difficult socioeconomic challenge of the area spill over into school so i welcome the government ’s focus on child ’s wellbee most important to my constituent will be the roll out of free breakfast club could the minister tell i a little bit about how and when they will be roll out 
 i thank my hon friend for his question breakfast club be about more than just food they provide opportunity for child to play to learn and to socialise at the start of the school day the government be give parent more choice in childcare and be support family with the cost of living crisis our plan for breakfast club will remove barrier to opportunity by ensure that every child of primary school age no matter their circumstance be well prepared for school 
 we be move on to topical the question will be short and the ministerial response will be snappy 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 as we start the new academic year i want to say thank you to all staff work across education and to wish all learner the good for the year ahead it will be the mission of this new government to break down barrier to opportunity so that where a person be from do not determine what they can go on to achieve and so that   every child have the good start in life we launch our mission against a backdrop of many inherit challenge a childcare pledge without a plan for delivery a crumble school estate a school attendance crisis large attainment gap and fall apprenticeship start and training opportunity i be determined to turn this around we will drive high and rise standard across education from early year right through to adult learning 
 across the macclesfield area we have fantastic school but the legacy of year of conservative mismanagement mean that they have some of the low funding in the country will ministers meet i to discuss how we can turn the situation about and fund our school properly 
 i know that my hon friend care deeply about the life chance of child in macclesfield and across cheshire east i would be happy to meet he to discuss the matter far 
 the opposition share the secretary of state ’s good wish to all for the new term and the new year but do she recall that last time labour be in office not only do england tumble down the world education ranking but we end up as the only country in the developed world where the literacy and numeracy of recent school leaver be bad than that of the generation who be about to retire if she continue to follow the same fail labour approach do she expect a different result this time 
 the right hon gentleman as a former minister in the department know all too well that he and other be caution about how they should be use datum when we look at the raw number we see that under the last conservative government read standard be go down as be standard in math and science in child do not reach the require standard at the end of primary school and in young people be persistently absent from our school we will drive high and rise standard right across academic subject but we will also ensure that all our child and young people have a range of opportunity in music sport art and drama not just those with parent who can afford it 
 as the new school year begin far too many student in my constituency have not yet be able to secure a school place of their choice do my hon friend agree that the school allocation policy need a desperate overhaul many people believe that it be not fit for purpose could she tell the house what step the government be take to address this extremely important issue 
 we recognise the challenge that my hon friend raise which be why the government will introduce change so that state fund school can be ask to co operate with local authority on admission and place planning local authority have a responsibility to allocate all applicant a school place on national offer day if child in his area be still without place i would be happy to meet he and to support he in resolve those issue 
 disadvantaged pupil between and be likely to be up to grade behind their more affluent peer we know that funding drop by about a at yet to-19 tuition be ax in july and the pupil premium have never apply to that age group if the secretary of state be serious about smash the glass ceiling will she consider increase funding target at this group 
 i share the hon lady ’s concern about make sure that we target funding in the most effective way that be why i have say that my no priority be ensure that we support child and young people at the early possible point and give a real commitment around early education and childcare because that be the single big way to ensure that our child arrive at school really well prepared and to stop those gap open up as child progress through education 
 the early year sector face significant challenge in deliver the roll out of the expand childcare offer promise by the last government the sector consistently cite the inability to recruit and retain staff as the big difficulty can the minister confirm when the government plan to publish the promise workforce strategy for the early year and what opportunity there will be for the sector to have its say 
 i thank my hon friend for all her hard work while in opposition on these important issue this government see early education as more than just childcare it be central to our mission to give every child the good start in life we recognise the inherit workforce challenge in both recruitment and retention in the come week and month this government will set out plan for reform begin with a complete reset with the sector so that the workforce feel support and value 
 as be allude to by my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart child with special educational need and disability in some urban local authority receive time more funding than they do in the east riding of yorkshire will the secretary of state or her minister meet i and east riding colleague so that we can secure a fairer future for our local child 
 the secretary of state have set out extensive response to extensive question on the inherit challenge in the send system we recognise the issue that the hon gentleman raise and will be happy to meet he and his colleague around his local authority area to discuss this far 
 will the secretary of state join i in congratulate the shrewsbury colleges group in my constituency on yet another excellent round of result this summer with a level pass rate at over and vocational student achieve a triple distinction it be a superb institution in our rural area work to drive up engagement and standard for vocational qualification which be the bedrock of our industrial strategy and central to the   government ’s mission to break down the barrier to opportunity will she join i in celebrate its success and assure it that it have parity of esteem with its academic school counterpart and will she perhaps book a visit 
 further education be front and centre of unlock opportunity i join my hon friend in congratulate the shrewsbury colleges group on its excellent result 
 school in devon be miss out on £ a year due to the national funding formula the equivalent of full time teacher across the county will the minister meet i to discuss how devon ’s school child be miss out particularly those live in the most deprive area 
 i recognise the concern the hon lady raise the government intend to take time to consider the various funding formula the department and local authority currently use to allocate funding for school it be really important that we have a fair education funding system that direct funding to where it be need and i would be happy to meet she to discuss the particular challenge in her area 
 the steiner school in my constituency with its nurturing and therapeutic pedagogy be most challenge by the vat policy yet it enable many child who have anxiety or who would otherwise not be in education to access school will the secretary of state meet i to discuss my report on the impact of the vat policy and find way to keep this school open and the child in education 
 we expect that private school will want to continue to demonstrate wide public benefit through the provision of mean test bursary and partnership with state fund school after the change be make as this be a taxation matter his majesty ’s treasury be lead the implementation of the policy it publish a technical note about the propose change on   july   and will confirm its plan at budget i encourage all private school to engage with that process and i would happily meet my hon friend to discuss her report 
 i draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as i be still a south gloucestershire councillor as last thursday ’s pack debate show child with send be be let down many local authority be currently lock into safety valve agreement with the department for education which be put into place pre pandemic and contain unrealistic target that no long reflect the situation on the ground will the secretary of state review those agreement and meet i and local leader to discuss the situation in south gloucestershire 
 the hon lady raise a concern that many have raise she will have see the level of concern at the special educational need inheritance that this government have take on current safety   valve agreement will continue to operate as they be agree but we will look at their use go forward i would be happy to meet she to discuss the particular challenge in her area 
 may i take this opportunity to welcome my right hon friend to her place and to welcome student across stratford and bow back to school as they start their new term the secretary of state understand as well as i do the struggle some parent have in get their child back to school especially those with mental health and special educational need will she outline what step she be take to ensure that school really be the good place for every child 
 i recognise the important point that my hon friend raise many parent be do everything they can often in very challenging circumstance to support their child into school for my part i can assure she that this government will do everything we can to make sure child find welcoming safe environment at school with well mental health support breakfast club in our primary school a broad rich curriculum and more support around send in mainstream setting 
 there be report in the press a couple of week ago that the secretary of state take meeting with teach union who make the argument that multiplication time table should be take off the national curriculum give our stratospheric success in pisa programme for international student assessment numeracy rating thank to change introduce by the conservative government can she give we a cast iron guarantee that she will not dumb down the curriculum in this country and will not take time table off the national curriculum 
 i would caution the hon gentleman about believe everything he read in the press time table be an important part of our system we will drive high and rise standard from government rather than pick pointless fight and avoidable industrial action what he will see from this government be a different relationship as we work in partnership with teacher school leader and support staff to deliver well life chance for all of our child 
 the last set of pisa result under the conservative government show standard in england ’s school go backwards backwards in read maybe conservative members should listen backwards in math and backwards in science do my right hon friend agree that that be far from a record to be proud of 
 my hon friend be absolutely right conservative members do not like it but it be absolutely true i would add that when it come to the concern my hon friend raise we see stark attainment gap in the difference between what our poor and more affluent child be able to achieve that blight the life   chance of child in his constituency of gateshead we be determined to make progress on that unlike the previous government 
 i congratulate the secretary of state and her team and welcome they to their place 
 in my constituency child be be unenrolle after day of absence even when there be a valid and compassionate reason for their leave will the secretary of state commit herself to review this harmful and punitive rule which be leave child in my constituency without a school for many month and will she take step to make the necessary change to protect those child and their right to an education 
 i be happy to meet the hon member to discuss the point that he have raise attendance and off rolling be issue that the government take very seriously and we will set out more policy on they in due course 
 the last government promise to publish a register of child who be not in school i welcome the measure take by this government but can the minister update i on the next step towards publication of the register 
 this government have no time to waste if we be to fix the foundation of our country after year of decline we will legislate for the register through the child ’s wellbee bill which will be introduce as soon as parliamentary time allow and which will support the government ’s work to ensure that every child have the good start in life 
 can the minister confirm that the funding announce on   may   by the conservative government for a brand new send school in the county of buckinghamshire be in no way shape or form under review and that we will get that new school 
 ensure that school and college have the resource and building that they need be a key part of our mission to break down barrier to opportunity and give every young person the good start in life we be committed to improve the condition of the estate through the department ’s annual funding continue the school rebuilding programme and fix the problem cause by reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete 
 at the start of the new school year may i wish all teacher school staff and child in my constituency the very good for the year ahead 
 do my hon friend agree that as part of the curriculum review which i warmly welcome and look forward to we need an education system and curriculum particularly in primary school with much more focus on learn through play on oracy and on multisensory movement and the recording of learning that would benefit not just child with send but all pupil 
 the curriculum assessment review lead by expert will focus on the evidence what we know from here and abroad about how we can well help child of all age and ability to learn and that   include child with special educational need i be sure that those conduct the review will want to investigate different approach to the primary curriculum include those mention by my hon friend but i would not want to pre empt the review ’s conclusion and recommendation 
 rise 
 order that conclude education question i be sorry that i could not fit everyone in well luck next time 
 it be always nice to see the right hon gentleman but i be expect to see the actual secretary of state respond to this question perhaps he be at a business meeting with health firm 
 order may i ask the shadow secretary of state just to pose the question the minister will respond and then the shadow secretary of state will get she minute after that 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make a statement on the involvement of people with no formal appointment in the development of government policy on health 
 i apologise to the house madam deputy speaker i be more used to answer but believe you i i be look forward to the question 
 and i be committed to make sure that the right hon lady be there ask the question for a very very long time 
 unlike our predecessor this government can not get enough of expert we work with a wide range of stakeholder in develop policy because that go to the heart of our approach to mission drive government but i think the shadow secretary of state be refer specifically to the right honourable alan milburn so let i address he specifically i walk into the department of health and social care on   july   to be confront with the bad crisis in the history of the national health service waiting list at more than a patient a month wait week for a gp appointment if they could get at all the junior doctor still in dispute and on strike and dental desert across huge part of our country where people can not get an nhs dentist for love nor money 
 this government be honest about the scale of the crisis and serious about fix it which mean that we need the good available advice it be all hand on deck to fix the mess that the previous government leave if a single patient wait long for treatment than they need because i have fail to ask for the most expert advice around i would consider that a betrayal of patient interest i decide whom i hear from in meeting i decide whose advice i seek and i decide what to share with they i also welcome challenge alternative perspective and experience 
 the right honourable alan milburn be a former member of this house a member of the privy council and a former health secretary he do not have a pass to the department and at every departmental meeting he have attend he have be present at the request of ministers during alan ’s time in office he give patient the choice over where they be treat and who treat they as well as make sure that the nhs be properly transparent so that all patient be able to make an informed choice a basic right that we expect in all other walk of life but which only the wealthy and well connect be able to exercise in healthcare until alan change it   he give patient access to the fast most effective treatment available on nhs term so that fast treatment be no long just for those who could afford private healthcare he make the tough reform that drive well performance across the nhs and along with every other labour health secretary deliver the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in the history of the nhs that be his record and labour ’s record and it be the kind of experience that i want around the table as we write the reform agenda that will lift the nhs out of the bad crisis in its history get it back on its foot and make it fit for the future once again 
 i fear that the right hon gentleman be betray his inexperience it be a shame that he need all that help and experience the rest of we have just get on with the job 
 the department of health and social care manage incredibly sensitive information range from the development of healthcare policy to the handling of market sensitive information concern vaccine and medication and the rule regard patient confidentiality it have emerge that mr milburn a former labour politician have receive more than £ from his personal consultancy firm since he advise of the large provider of residential care for old people and be apparently a senior adviser on health for a major consultancy firm interruption a member sit opposite say so what give the risk of conflict of interest that rather than the right hon gentleman ’s inexperience be the point of this uq have mr milburn declare his business interest to the department can the right hon gentleman reassure the house on how such conflict be be manage so that we can get a sense of the scale of this open door policy and mr milburn ’s access 
 could the right hon gentleman tell we how many meeting mr milburn have attend how many be with nhs england how many be conduct without ministerial presence what sensitive information have mr milburn be give access to do it include information concern the sale of patient information to pharmaceutical company have mr milburn see internal dhsc or nhse document regard the pricing of medicine and vaccination and other market sensitive information this be all information that come across the right hon gentleman ’s desk and there be no formal record for understand what mr milburn have see 
 if the right hon gentleman use as he have do just now the excuse that this be all okay because mr milburn be a former secretary of state and a privy counsellor could the right hon gentleman set out where in the ministerial code or the civil service code such an exemption exist for unrecorded access to information by member of the public i hope the secretary of state will also confirm his list of other adviser their commercial interest and any other member of the public attend meeting that be of a deeply sensitive nature so that we get a sense of just how far this go 
 this be just more evidence of cronyism at the heart of this new labour government follow recent press report that a labour party worker have be parachute into a civil service role in the department through a closed recruitment process will the secretary of state   finally come clean to the house and be transparent about who be run his department and shape policy for he 
 the right hon lady want to compare experience it take i week to agree a deal with junior doctor she have not even meet they since march and in the and a half year that i be the shadow secretary of state for health and social care she be the and among the bad do it not just tell we everything we need to know about the conservatives priority she do not ask i what we be do to cut waiting list she do not ask about the action we take to end strike she do not ask about the action that have be take to hire a gps who she leave to graduate into unemployment she have not ask i about the news on the front page of the daily telegraph that on their watch year of health progress be in decline and funnily enough there be nothing on the news from the observer this weekend that the nhs be hit hard than any other health service by the pandemic because it be uniquely expose by a decade of conservative neglect have break the nhs all they be interested in now be try to tie this government ’s hand behand our back to stop we clean up their mess 
 what the right hon lady be imply in this question be that as health secretary she never seek the advice of people who do not work in her department which would explain quite a lot actually i feel sorry for she because when i need advice i can call on any number of labour health secretaries who help deliver the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in history but she never have that luxury because every single of her conservative predecessor leave nhs waiting list high than where they find they except of course for thérèse coffey who be outlast by a lettuce 
 in fact it say a lot about the modern conservative party ’s anti reform instinct that the right hon lady be so opposed to alan milburn they use to hug he close when they be cosplaye as new labour andrew lansley even ask whether alan milburn would chair the new clinical commissioning board that his top down reorganisation create although alan sensibly turn he down and label the reorganisation the big car crash in the history of the nhs which just go to prove that alan milburn have sound judgment and be worth listen to 
 but if the right hon lady want to lead with her chin and talk cronyism let we talk cronyism why do we not talk about owen paterson lobby health ministers on behalf of randox the conservative care so much about cronyism that they welcome lord cameron back with open arm follow his pay lobbying for greensill for reason of ongoing court case let we not even get into baroness mone and the £ contract for personal protective equipment where be the right hon lady during those sorry episode cheer on that government and preside over a record of abysmal failure that have put they on the other side of the chamber 
 this government be have to rebuild not only the public service that the conservatives break and the public finance they raid but the trust in politic that   they destroy we will put politic back into the service of work people and rebuild all clearly we will have to do it without the support of the conservative party ’s one- nation tradition who be not even run and have abandon their flag it be clear that the conservatives have not learn a thing from the defeat they be subject to on   july and we will get on with the business of clear up their mess
