let i begin by express thank to all those who have contribute to this debate   so far i be sure that there will be many more after i and to   the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister he have set out his view to the house with the same ardour as he do a fortnight ago although at great length than he be allow to in westminster hall and he make his case during his time in stormont as well 
 it be important to restate to he what my right hon friend the secretary of state for northern ireland say to this house a fortnight ago which be that the government want northern ireland to prosper and flourish as an important part of the union on that many of we will find agreement we be here to do what be good for the people of northern ireland i also reiterate the government ’s commitment to both the windsor framework and to the uk internal market it be on that point that the secretary of state respectfully disagree with the hon and learn member for north antrim in this house a fortnight ago 
 i will set out the government ’s objection to this bill which be not compatible with international law do not account for northern ireland ’s unique circumstance and would take away power that be give to the northern ireland assembly to make decision about northern ireland it would result in a regulatory black hole that would be very bad for business job growth the northern ireland economy and the rest of the united kingdom 
 i will start by outline some of the good news for the northern ireland economy news that show what the windsor framework the prospect of stability the executive return and the stability of a new labour government be do for the economic outlook in northern ireland the northern ireland composite economic index indicate that economic output increase by over the quarter to june and by over the year ulster university ’s economic policy centre show that northern ireland have a forecast growth rate of in and in the region ’s economy be perform well than be expect at the start of the year this have be drive by strong growth in employment particularly in the transport construction and health sector 
 the northern ireland statistics and research agency ’s interdepartmental business register show that the number of business register for vat or pay as you earn operating in northern ireland in be estimate to have rise by since to and be continue to increase i could go on and on i have a long list of the good news story for northern ireland the economy be work but all the business i speak to talk about the need for stability and the underlying premise of this bill would change that stability we would go into uncertainty and chaos which would not be good for the northern ireland economy

 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no 
 the house divide ayes noes 
 question accordingly negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 i begin by thank my co sponsor for their help and support with the bill the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for belfast east gavin robinson and for east antrim sammy wilson and the hon member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer for clacton nigel farage for south antrim robin swann for boston and skegness richard tice for upper bann carla lockhart for north down alex easton for strangford jim shannon and for east londonderry mr campbell i also wish to thank my own staff for their assistance during recent week particularly dr dan boucher who have work tirelessly on these matter i record my appreciation of international lawyer mr barney reynolds for his help and guidance on many of the technical issue 
 since i come to this house in july i have lose count of the number of time i have hear affirmation from the government benches about fix the foundation well there be foundation that most assuredly need fix and that be the foundation that flow from the inequitable post brexit arrangement as they affect my part of the united kingdom northern ireland the foundation of this united kingdom have be disturb and dislodge by those arrangement the primary purpose of this bill be yes to fix those foundation to restore equilibrium to northern ireland ’s place within the united kingdom and to our relationship as a nation with the eu 
 in fix the foundation we need to reflect on the most basic tenet of democracy namely that a people should be govern by law make by those they elect to make those law that be so fundamental that we all presumably almost take it for grant yet tragically and with great constitutional detriment that be no long the position in respect of northern ireland there be area of law where the right to make law be not exercise in this house or in the devolved assembly but have be surrender to the european parliament that be such a momentous thing that it should cause anyone who value the fundamental of democracy who cling to the principle that a people be entitle to elect those who govern they and make their law to be ashamed that this situation have evolve it be not just a democratic deficit but undemocratic plundering of the northern ireland statute book by the eu 
 these be not incidental matter or trifling issue they be the law that deal with custom general trade good motor vehicle cosmetic toy electrical equipment textile medical device pesticide waste and food hygiene ingredient and marketing they cover different area of law deal with food alone they be the law that deal with disease and with animal with the breeding welfare and identification of animal different diktat of the eu govern all of that 
 i appreciate the hon and learn gentleman ’s passion he also need to be honest with this chamber that the   law he be talk about include human right law and the basic equal treatment of everybody in northern ireland his legislation would rip up the very foundation of democracy which be that everybody be equal do he not need to be honest with this chamber that the law he be talk about include equal human right 
 i will be absolutely honest with this chamber and to be absolutely honest with this chamber the hon lady be not address the issue as it emerge i will deal with the impact of article of the protocol i want nothing more for my constituent than the same right that the hon lady ’s constituent have be they human right the right to make the law of our land or any other right i ask for no privilege but i certainly do not accept any detriment that be the point here 
 the hon and learn gentleman and i share a common concern then my constituent in walthamstow do benefit from the protection of their human right because we be still member of the european court of human rights indeed equal access to those human right be what the good friday agreement be base on the effect that his legislation would have on article of the windsor framework would breach those principle so if it go through would there not be less of a connection between constituent here in england and constituent in northern ireland 
 i respectfully and utterly disagree as part of the united kingdom we be all subject to the human rights act the human rights act be what fundamentally give the hon lady ’s constituent the right that they have in that sphere and she would lose nothing by lose the control of the foreign court of the european court of justice 
 i be list example of the area of law that have be purloin by the eu in its sovereignty grab over northern ireland i mention the different diktat on animal we have even reach the point in northern ireland where under these arrangement our cattle can no long bear a uk ear tag they now have to have a specified european union ear tag that be but an illustration of how absurd and utterly wrong and offensive it be that the right to make the law in our own country have be surrender to a foreign power 
 all those area be set forth in annex of the protocol or as it be now more kindly call the windsor framework look at annex look at the hundred of laws—289 of they which now have be remove from the ambit of the lawmaking of this house or the lawmaking of the northern ireland assembly 
 it be amazing to look at the volume of law there be page contain not the detail of the law but simply the heading of the law that show the extent to which the eu have its foot in the door in northern ireland 
 absolutely i print they off a couple of month ago and i be stagger by how voluminous just the title be it be not just law it be area of law which have be surrender 
 i have a challenge for every member of this house who come from a different part of the united kingdom from northern ireland those who represent gb constituency my challenge to they today be how would you feel if in area of law affect your constituent you have no input you could not change you could not move an amendment because those law be make colonial like in a foreign parliament by those elect not by your constituent but by the constituent of other country how i ask this house could any democrat any representative mp say that be right and correct 
 i thank the hon and learn gentleman for introduce this debate he be talk about the democratic deficit be it not right that the northern ireland assembly will be debate consent to the procedure on   december and be we not pre empte that debate by hold this debate here now 
 i will be deal with that but the hon member invite we to think that it be appropriate that those elect to the northern ireland assembly should turn up on tuesday of next week and vote to disenfranchise their own constituent to say you our constituent in northern ireland who send we to the northern ireland assembly we be not worthy to make your law we must bow to the superiority of a foreign parliament and we must surrender to that foreign parliament the right to make these law in hundred of area of law the hon member might think that be admirable and be the very epitome of democracy but i happen to think it be the very opposite 
 the bill would create a democratic deficit that the hon and learn member have already refer to and the windsor framework have address that with the stormont brake which allow the northern ireland assembly to review all law apply 
 i respectfully suggest that the hon member read a little deep she will discover that the stormont brake be farcical the previous member for north antrim in this house aptly say it be like someone sit in the back seat of a car and say to the driver would you ever be so kind as to pull the brake that be what the stormont brake be a request to the british government to pause the imposition of an eu law the british government do not have to do it there have be request to date and nothing have happen about it so it really be a fiction and an insult to the democratic mandate of the people of northern ireland 
 to continue the analogy the stormont brake have be describe to i as rusty and not attach to anything 
 and if we can pull it nothing happen that be the value of it the most limp excuse that i hear for this plundering of the northern ireland statute book by the eu be oh international law require this sorry what sort of international law say that a state must self harm by disenfranchise its own voter there be no such international law i will deal later with the fundamental basic of international law and how they have be distort in justification of these arrangement 
 i commend the hon and learn gentleman for bring forward the bill it be important for we in northern ireland and for this whole great united kingdom to look at this our constituent must not lose their place in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland without consent by stealth but that be what be happen brexit be a vote for all of we to leave europe not for northern ireland to leave the uk and this outstanding matter be detrimental to our economy peace and stability do he agree that the bill must be support by all in the house if there be to be justice for all in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland 
 the hon member touch on a fundamental in june we all have the opportunity to vote on brexit some like it and some do not but the question on the ballot paper be do you want the united kingdom to leave the eu the question be not would you like gb to leave the eu and leave northern ireland behind but that be what we get that be a fundamental denial of brexit to my constituent in northern ireland that be the source of the disparity and undemocratic consequence have flow from that 
 i mention the area of law they be all recite in annex of the protocol it be no surprise that the area of law cover in annex be custom and that the law put on the people of northern ireland be the eu ’s customs code eu regulation what do the customs code do it operate on the basis that gb those who get brexit be no long a part of the eu it be in the word of the custom code a country or in common parlance a foreign country whereas northern ireland be treat as eu territory therefore we have this absurd insult under the custom code that good come to northern ireland a suppose part of the united kingdom from gb must be subject to all the rigour of declaration check and reporting of datum recording why because gb be treat as a foreign country when it send its good particularly its raw material to my part of the united kingdom 
 that be the iniquitous effect of the union partition and divide the custom code and protocol some member seem to find that amusing if hon member believe at all in the united kingdom maybe some do not they should be as offend as i be by the fact that move good from part of the united kingdom to another involve an international custom border under the control of foreign law how could any mp amuse or otherwise think that be right and equitable 
 perhaps the hon and learn member would like to reflect on a proposal that i support a veterinary agreement with the eu to reduce the check on good move between great britain and northern ireland that would have to honour our commitment under the windsor framework if it be to come into effect 
 the hon member may wish to see the whole of the united kingdom suck back into the eu i want to see my part of the united kingdom enable to follow the rest of the united kingdom properly out of the eu 
 all this be for an international border over which the trade flow be infinitesimally small we have have diversion of trade since but in of all the good   go into and trade with the eu pass from northern ireland to the republic of ireland yet for that we be build border post at the cost of ten of million of pound in the constituency of   the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson in larne belfast and warrenpoint as i will set out there be another way 
 the hon and learn gentleman be talk with great passion about an issue that be really important to he and that he have raise many time in this house he will accept that be not a representative year because of the pandemic also although it might be a small part of trade within the eu that trade with the wide eu be probably very important to trader in northern ireland include those in his constituency many business in my constituency be still struggle to come to term with brexit and they envy the trading relationship that northern ireland have with the eu he must recognise that 
 i will deal with that more fully but for now i will say that the trade that matter the most to northern ireland be with our big partner great britain that be the source of the overwhelming majority of our raw material that keep our manufacturing industry go but as a result of this pernicious irish sea border that trade be fetter all raw material have to pass through the full ambit of an international custom border if the hon member ’s constituent envy the position of my constituent they really need to reassess the situation as do he it be nothing to envy 
 i thank the hon and learn member for introduce the bill at prime minister ’s question i ask the prime minister about the general product safety regulation that will come into effect next friday which will force supplier in constituency across england scotland and wales to increase bureaucracy and cost if they still want to supply northern ireland consumer and producer do he agree that it be absurd that we be put additional cost on our internal uk market to facilitate the requirement of the european union 
 i agree absolutely we already see the consequence interruption again this seem to be a matter of humour to some on the government benches increasingly we see that gb supplier simply stop supply because they will not put themselves through the rigour of the custom code documentary declaration and everything else it be very difficult for anyone try to do business in northern ireland in the main small and medium sized business do not have the resource to employ the extra staff that a big business might to meet the requirement of cross the irish sea border small supplier do not have the necessary resource so they simply stop supply northern ireland that feed the continue diversion of trade 
 a report come out day ago suggest that northern ireland ’s economy be go to be strong than that of the rest of the uk do that not have something to do with the windsor framework which be allow business to invest in northern ireland surely that be a good thing 
 the hon member might be interested to know that the growth area of the northern ireland economy be the service sector which be the sector not include by the protocol it be outside all that the sector that be outside the protocol be increase there be a clear message in that 
 i have not intend to intervene on the hon and learn gentleman but on that point invest northern ireland the body charge with encourage foreign direct investment into northern ireland and with grow our economy can not point to example of business investing in northern ireland as a direct result of the windsor framework 
 absolutely i will return to that 
 will the hon and learn gentleman give way 
 i will make some progress i will be as generous as i can with intervention because i know that government member want to talk this bill out and because they be not shame face enough some of they want to vote against the principle of the bill but there we go 
 the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson   make an important point the reason why that point have traction be find in eu regulation from it determine that northern ireland be accord to our court for these purpose eu territory we have have several legal case in northern ireland such as the rooney case the judgment in that case establish that the eu official control on food and feed law animal health plant health and so on have to be in place because our high court have rule that under that applicable eu law for regulatory and custom purpose the entry point to the eu be the northern ireland port could it be any more union dismantle than that under eu law to which we be subject the entry point to the eu be the port of northern ireland 
 mr justice colton say that eu regulation must be interpret accord to eu law as a result of article of the withdrawal agreement and article of the protocol which he go on to say have domestic effect in the united kingdom under section 7a the european union withdrawal act he say that under the withdrawal agreement it be at northern ireland port that eu territory be enter he go on 
 the uk be not to be treat as a unitary state for the purpose of ocr check come from gb into ni 
 could it be any more stark that northern ireland have be colonise by the eu 
 what be a colony it be a territory govern by someone else ’s law from a foreign jurisdiction when area of law include custom and include the very definition of northern ireland ’s territory in trading term be govern by foreign eu law we have create a situation in which in that context northern ireland be a veritable colony there be many people in the house the government benches opposite be populate by many of they who boast of their anti colonialism they constantly pride themselves on their anti colonial heritage yet here we have a part of this united kingdom colonise   by eu law to the point that we be tell that when someone enter the port of northern ireland they enter eu territory 
 i believe the european union be our ally it be democracy and i be concern about some of the language i be hear the hon and learn gentleman talk of colonisation and surrender be that the message we want to send to our friend and ally in the european union 
 maybe the hon member could help i what would he call take a territory and subject it to someone else ’s law what would he call it other than colonisation be that not the very essence of what he and his colleague wear as a badge of pride in their anti colonialism be that not what it be in name and in truth 
 do the hon and learn gentleman remember that in the brexit negotiation those so call ally make it clear that the price of brexit would be northern ireland ’s removal from the united kingdom far from be ally they declare themselves to want to be coloniser 
 yes that be the boast of mr barnier and his staff that the price of brexit would be northern ireland and so it have prove to be that may be something of indifference or indeed pride for some people in this house but it should be a badge of shame that we allow a part of the united kingdom to be colonise by the eu and that we have surrender our right to make our own law 
 for the record be it the hon and learn gentleman ’s view that the member state of the european union be not our ally at least member have make that point as have another next to he it be important to have this on the record for the house do the hon and learn gentleman believe the member state of the european union be ally of the united kingdom or not i certainly do 
 the eu have behave not as a friend to northern ireland the eu have behave as a sovereignty grabber in respect of northern ireland that be where it cause and continue to cause the offence if hon member think it be a good thing to back that up and endorse it they obviously do not think very much of the territory of northern ireland 
 we be move slightly into the ridiculous may i bring we back to the main point the purpose of the bill that the hon and learn gentleman have draft be simply to provide a solution for what be currently an unworkable position i say to government members that it be not about nation hat the uk ultimately it be about function sir jonathan faull who be the director general of the eu internal market service directorate end up as director general of the taskforce for strategic issue relate to the uk referendum and he and his team come to a simple conclusion the only way to make the situation workable be to have in essence what be in the bill he have put out a statement   today to say exactly that it be a practical issue and those who know and understand the difficulty at the time say there be a way to do this but they be ignore 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right those of we who be look for a solution be supporter of this bill because we can not go on as we be those who think that it be okay to subjugate part of their own territory be oppose to this bill they be quite content with the colonisation of part of our territory in constitutional term where we have end up be that northern ireland be no long a full part of the united kingdom why it be because we be not our own master in area of law and that a foreign jurisdiction make those law what do that create it create what be call in constitutional term a condominium northern ireland be rule in part by uk law and in part by foreign law interruption   the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy   find that hilarious sorry it be not hilarious to be subject to that 
 i find myself surprised to agree to an extent with the former leader of the conservative party   the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith we need to move away from some of the ridiculous extreme language there be no reason why the european union would want to colonise northern ireland be we not talk about a sensible agreement that do not seek to impose sovereignty but instead seek simply to avoid a hard border on the island of ireland to safeguard the good friday agreement in all its dimension and at the same time protect northern ireland ’s place in the uk and in the uk internal market should we not recognise that and stop use extreme language that do nothing to take the debate sensibly forward 
 the whole purpose of this bill be to restore equilibrium and to get we to a point at which we have a sensible relationship base upon mutual respect not on the grabbing of the sovereignty from the other that be where we have get to the hon member may not like to face up to it but a whole raft of jurisprudence and lawmaking have be remove from within the reach of this united kingdom and place within the control of a foreign body and that be not the basis for a sustainable solution 
 will the hon and learn gentleman give way 
 i have give way quite often so i be go to make some progress 
 that be why what i regard as the liberation clause in my bill clause and exist they be the clause that will free the whole united kingdom and northern ireland in particular from this malevolent situation in which a huge portion of our law be make not by ourselves but by other that be very important i have spend a lot of time in this debate talk about the constitutional import of all this and that be very important because it be that which give certainty and assurance to any part of this united kingdom however before i leave that issue i remind the house that because of the protocol arrangement our supreme   court have to rule that article vi of our act of union which guarantee unfettered trade access between and within all part of the united kingdom stand in suspension there can not be a high authority than the supreme court to demonstrate that a key component of the very act of union that make this union be in suspension and if the cause of suspension be the protocol or the windsor framework then no who believe in that union should be sanguine or at ease with that 
 there be also economic consequence before brexit northern ireland have an economy that be very integrated with the rest of the united kingdom it have the free unfettered flow of good way and the other as we have and would still have from birmingham to london or edinburgh we have exactly that 
 the hon and learn member mention certainty and he have just mention the impact on the economy of northern ireland do he agree that bring in a bill such as this which would see regulation in northern ireland change in potentially just month would have a massive impact on business in northern ireland it would have a huge impact on the economy of northern ireland and it be not what business need right now 
 i can tell the hon member that it be exactly what business need my constituency office be choke from time to time with business say why be it that i can not get the good i need without all this paperwork and bureaucracy there be many small business in my constituency and elsewhere such as small engineering business which rely for their raw material not on huge container come in but on parcel of bolt and everyday material or of which come a week come early next year the irish sea border be go to extend to a parcel border and we be go to have a situation in which those business that rely on the daily arrival of a parcel of some raw material from gb will be put through the red lane of this full blow international custom border the hon lady may think that that be good for business it be a death knell for business that be the problem that we have 
 the economic consequence be severe even with the windsor framework all our raw material that feed all our manufacturing industry and that come from gb now have to pass through the red lane in a full international custom border think of that think of the effect on a business that be what be stifle not grow business in consequence we have have trade diversion of course we have we have veterinary medicine in the main our veterinary medicine come from gb and always have do but now we face a cliff edge where accord to eu diktat they can no long come because we be subject to the veterinary requirement of the eu not the united kingdom medicine that we have use safely and with no problem for decade be suddenly to be stop 
 the government say that they will get a deal well let we see it even the very thought that we have to go cap in hand to a foreign power to say please could we have an arrangement where from within our own country we could bring our own medicine to another part of our own country please could we do that be so humiliating at a national level and so prejudicial to our farming community 
 i thank the hon and learn member for give way again he continue to speak with passion the issue about medicine be really interesting i know that he have speak at some length already but it would be useful if he could outline some of the medicine that will be prohibit and what the alternative to they will be 
 there be human medicine and there be veterinary medicine the vast swathe of veterinary medicine currently stand to be prohibit as for human medicine there be some for diabetic that be still subject to difficulty 
 rise 
 the hon member be the health minister in northern ireland and know all about that so i will gladly give way to he 
 on that point i see that member be smile i be quite concerned about the attitude to the issue of some of those on the other benches a serious piece of work have be do with the european union on the subject of continue the supply of human medicine to northern ireland the challenge be not in the legislation but in the fact that producer and supplier must meet eu requirement for specific northern ireland labelling which make it not worth their while to supply item to northern ireland with the result that some manufacturer be still not do so 
 the hon member know that from experience 
 i want to make some progress and to make point very strongly the economic consequence be dire for northern ireland we have hear much talk about the fantasy of a dual access bonanza we have be tell that northern ireland will become the singapore of the west that we now have unrivalle access to the uk market and to the eu market consist of people and that everyone should be overwhelm by the fantastic opportunity that this provide how wrong that have turn out to be and for very simple reason already allude to by the right hon member for belfast east 
 we have hear the suggestion that inward investment will flow into northern ireland because of this dual market access but it have not do so invest northern ireland have have to admit that there have be no upturn and why be that because any benefit if there be be countermand by the fettering of the trade from great britain a manufacturer wish to set up a business in northern ireland in order to have access to the eu market be bind to say to himself because investor be intelligent people—“where will i get my raw material oh i will get they as most do from great britain 
 but then he will discover that those raw material will have to pass through an international custom border with all the regulation all the delay and all the inspection and the shine soon go off that idea far from be a bonanza this have turn out to be anything but 
 i have already point out that the sector that be flourish be the service sector that do not just happen to be the case it be able to flourish because it be outside the protocol and thing will get bad next   friday when the general product safety regulation come into force many small supplier will simply stop supply because of the bureaucratic burden that will be place on they already in so many case when someone want to buy an item online this will pop up not available in northern ireland why be that because the small supplier from great britain find it impossible to handle the burden of bureaucracy so they be simply say we be not supply to northern ireland that be hugely frustrating for so many people in northern ireland include i might say mrs allister who like many a woman want to order thing and then find that they be not available in northern ireland how would hon member from great britain feel if not available in scotland not available in wales and not available in england constantly pop up would they not be ask why and when they hear the answer it be something call the protocol why would they continue to be enthusiast for the very thing that be block their consumer from get the supply they need this be a practical issue 
 i commend the hon and learn gentleman ’s passion but his problem be not unique anywhere in the highland and island of scotland or even in peripheral part of england have the same delivery problem as he do 
 ours be not a delivery problem ours be a bar on send ours be not just that it be too difficult our be that it be too difficult because of the international custom requirement that be the difference between we and the highland and island i be sure the highland and island do have that delivery problem and i be sure that small business do shirk the desire to serve they but in northern ireland it be for a more fundamental and compelling reason 
 the frustration that the hon and learn member be talk about be surely a good argument for what the government be try to do in reset the relationship between the uk and the eu therefore this bill would only undermine the uk ’s credibility in do that with our international partner do he agree that we need to remain focused on the issue go forward rather than go over these point again 
 this bill be prospective in its tone and purpose it be about go forward it be about solve the problem that have be put upon we the hon member say oh let ’s reset for some of course that mean let ’s rejoin that be a matter for those who be advocate for it but it be certainly not where i would like to see this united kingdom go 
 yes we need to reset but we need to reset on the basis that brexit be for all not just for some when we reset on that basis the government will not have i constantly raise these issue because i will have the equal citizenship that have be deny to i and my constituent by these arrangement fundamentally this be an equal citizenship issue the thought that they be be treat differently by be deny the equal citizenship of the rest of the united kingdom be quite appalling and insulting to many people in northern ireland 
 article of the protocol have be mention in an intervention the government say a couple of night ago that they will appeal the finding in of the case in northern ireland although listen to the secretary of state for northern ireland i think it be a pretty half hearted appeal article show we that it be not just about trade that be the initial selling point of the protocol oh it be only about trade but now we have discover through article that it have a most pervasive effect on all sort of thing 
 legislation in the last parliament have be overturn in its application in northern ireland why because of article now whether we like or dislike the rwanda bill be not the point the point be that our high court and court of appeal have rule that the provision of the rwanda bill can not be operate in northern ireland why because of article 
 why be that because article subject northern ireland to the eu ’s human right provision not the uk ’s human right provision protection that exist for asylum seeker under eu law therefore prevent the measure from operate it be not about the debate of the merit or de merit it be about the constitutional fact that a bill of this house the sovereign will of that time of this supposedly sovereign parliament could not be implement in a part of the united kingdom because of the supremacy of eu law 
 will the hon and learn gentleman give way 
 no i will finish my point that be the fundamental issue here we also have it on the legacy bill again it be not about the merit or the de merit of the legacy bill much of which i abhor it be about the principle that our court in this united kingdom rule the provision of this parliament the sovereign will of this parliament be overridden by the law of a foreign jurisdiction that be the fundamental issue of sovereignty at stake here that be why clause will address the import of article by make it something that can not be give effect in domestic law 
 i thank the hon and learn gentleman for give way i hope he will recognise that it be not laughter on the government benches but bemusement at the inconsistency he opine about his anger that a party can make law in northern ireland many of we try to untangle the inconsistency in the rwanda legislation   the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson   and i try in vain to raise it with the previous government the critical issue be the right to remedy and the right it give people in northern ireland to petition a party if they think their government be overbear on their own basic right the hon and learn gentleman have himself use those right he have choose to go to the supreme court and that be why we be here today he have not choose to go to the court in strasbourg that would be his right and i would support he in do so but why would he deny the right to remedy to the rest of his fellow resident of northern ireland as the bill would when he say he think it be wrong for that right to be protect by the european court of human rights in the place 
 order i remind member that it be up to the member who be on their foot whether they want to accept an intervention 
 i have be very generous in give way in a way i be not assist my cause because i know government members want to talk the bill out i would rather see they take a stand on whether they be for or against the subjugation of sovereignty within the united kingdom i be go to move on and deal with these issue 
 the hon member for walthamstow refer to my take a case to the supreme court why would i not it be the supreme court of my united kingdom why would i not take a case to the supreme court and test the law that relate i remind the house again that what the supreme court have to hold be that because of the protocol so enthusiastically support by labour members northern ireland ’s place in the united kingdom have be subjugate the supreme court hold that the fundamental building block of article of the act of union be in suspension because of the import of the protocol 
 some tell we well we do not want to face these issue there be no option we be tell because of the belfast agreement i have even read and hear people say the belfast agreement prohibit a border on the island of ireland i hold the agreement in my hand i have read it many time perhaps someone could direct i where in this document do it say that there can not be a customs border on the island of ireland where be it it be not there we already have a currency border a vat border a tax border nowhere in the belfast agreement do it say that you can not have a customs border at the international boundary of the united kingdom nor should it and then i be tell this would breach international law if you do not have the protocol that be not correct either a fundamental premise of international law be respect for territorial integrity what have i be talk about for the last hour if it have not be about respect territorial integrity that be the fundamental premise of international law 
 it all go back to the general assembly of the united nations declaration on principle of international law what do it say it say that territorial integrity be key and that the declaration constitute the basic principle of international law it say 
 every state shall refrain from any action aim at disruption of the national unity or territorial integrity of any other state 
 if only that have be adhere to the declaration say 
 where obligation under international agreement be in conflict with the obligation of this charter the obligation of this charter shall prevail 
 so the fundamental principle be respect for territorial integrity that be the govern principle of international law so when an agreement come into play that defy the fundamental requirement to respect territorial integrity that agreement fall not international law 
 will the hon and learn gentleman give way 
 no i be go to make some progress 
 i strongly refute the fallacy that to depart from the windsor framework be to breach international law on the contrary to perpetuate the infringement of our territorial integrity be to breach international law itself and indeed the belfast agreement which be build on consent of which there have be none in respect of the   current arrangement the correct application of international law be to the effect that agreement that contradict the regulating principle include respect for territorial integrity be themselves the villain of the piece 
 have set out everything that be wrong let i come to the solution the government have always tell we that we can not conduct sanitary and phytosanitary check away from the border it can not be do so we must have a border in our case in the irish sea but this week a statutory instrument be lay before this house that do exactly that it do it for good that come from the eu via northern ireland to gb it say that the good can be check wherever they arrive such as at factory or other premise they do not have to be check at the border if we can do that for good come through northern ireland to gb why can we not do it in reverse of course we could check good without tamper with sovereignty we could do so anywhere within the territory of the united kingdom it be not the impracticability of carry out the necessary check that be the problem it be the fact that under the surrender of sovereignty it have be insist that they be carry out in the irish sea border 
 that bring i to clause to and the concept they would permit of mutual enforcement i readily accept that the clause draw heavily on the northern ireland protocol bill which find the approval of the previous parliament but they be none the bad for that what they do be simple they say that respect neighbour that be what i hope the united kingdom and the eu be with the necessary trust between each other can operate a system where they mutually check the good flow through their territory to ensure they meet the standard of the recipient territory that be a fundamental tenet of much of international trade it be something that can be build upon in respect of this matter that the united kingdom say yes we know the eu want to protect it tell we its single market and yes we want to protect our single market so we will undertake by virtue of criminal sanction for those who do not to check that good flow from our factory to your consumer from our territory to your territory meet the standard you set and we expect you to do the same that can be do without any of the paraphernalia that we presently have 
 on this particular point it be worth point out that the eu already do it in its agreement with new zealand for example it trust that specific veterinary practice to check lamb and other product arrive in the eu be do at the point of departure by the time they get to rotterdam they be clear straight through on the basis that they respect the check do by those veterinary company they already do it for year with uk company where any subsequent check have to be do all this be already be do the question be why be it not be do for the arrangement we have at the moment 
 i absolutely agree the fascinating point be the very concept be articulate from and originate within the eu itself 
 during the early stage of the negotiation sir jonathan faull and academic daniel sarmiento and joseph weiler come up with that proposition it be not my proposition it be not a united kingdom proposition it be an eu proposition they say the answer be mutual enforcement today we have a statement from those gentleman which have be make public it say on friday of this week the house of commons will be debate a bill which attempt to address some of the difficulty result from the brexit divorce agreement between the eu and the uk which might be of interest to reader in we propose a solution which would have obviate any need for these complicated and divisive legal manoeuvre the uk and the eu could have respect each other ’s position and save everyone a great deal of time and effort the financial times characterise the proposal as a win win solution regrettably it be not follow i echo that regrettably it be not follow why be it not follow because the politic take over instead of look for a workable practical border solution the politic of make the united kingdom pay for leave the eu take over that be how we get into this morass of a pernicious imposition through the border 
 during the early stage of the negotiation the permanent secretary of the then brexit department tell the select committee that the irish government before leo varadkar take over be actually explore those kind of solution the politic of the changeover in the irish republic and the willingness of leo varadkar to become the puppet of the eu in these negotiation stop that method of look at the border 
 i fear that there be a lot of truth in that as i say the politic take over a further truth be that for some not all but some enthusiast of the protocol arrangement of a nationalist or irish republican persuasion there be a political gain that subsume all doubt that they might have as democrat for year and more the ira terrorise through bomb and bullet to try to push the border to the irish sea brit out push the border to the irish sea that be precisely what the protocol have do it have push the border to the irish sea 
 shame on you 
 the hon member may object from a sedentary position but the challenge for she be whether her nationalism be more important to she than her democratic credential 
 rise 
 i will give way to the hon member in a moment because i have mention she 
 how can the hon member who call herself a social democratic and labour member look her constituent in the eye and say i believe you be not worthy to have your law make by those you elect i would rather they be make by those you do not elect be it because the nationalist reach of the protocol be more important than the democratic detriment of the protocol 
 if the hon and learn member want to talk about constitutional change perhaps he might set out for the chamber the number and the level of support for the union before and after he begin his brexit adventure he will know that i as a democrat constitutionally compromise every single day because i be a democrat i be an adult and i live in a constitutional reality that be not of my choosing i be an irish person live work and uphold democracy in the united kingdom 
 the hon and learn member will also know that none of his argument about democratic deficit stand in any way when his campaign suppress the northern ireland assembly the legitimate expression and place of primary lawmaking for northern ireland and when he create an enormous health sea border in the irish sea his adventure his hobby horse have create a scenario in which of the population of northern ireland be on a health waiting list 
 i and other who do not like exactly the way our constitutional arrangement be make stand up every day and work to solve those problem all he want to do be create they it be his action in fact that be insert the dynamism in the question about constitutional change every time he pull a stunt like this he drive more people to seek to get out of the control of man like he i as a democrat uphold democracy i accept the constitutional reality i accept that we be member of the united kingdom i be seek to change that democratically so he will never again question my commitment to democracy in northern ireland 
 i acknowledge the hon member ’s speech but let i say this it be no stunt to ask on behalf of my constituent for what every other part of this united kingdom have the right to be rule by law we make ourselves it be no stunt to ask for equal citizenship it be no stunt to say that this united kingdom the clue be in the title should not be partition by an international custom border 
 will the hon and learn member give way 
 i will when i have deal with some other point 
 that be an assault upon the sincerity and efficacy of those who dare to say if we be part of the united kingdom we need to be treat as part of the united kingdom   the hon member for belfast south and mid down claire hanna   do not explain why she think it right to disenfranchise her constituent and to reject a workable and practical solution those who reject a workable and practical solution be those who do not want such a solution in respect of the irish border that be very clear from her intervention 
 several year ago former prime minister boris johnson tell we that there be an oven ready deal that be clearly not the case because we be still discuss this the hon and learn member have mention mutual enforcement but nowhere in the world do mutual enforcement happen wholesale under trading regulation between country the only workable deal that have be strike be reach not by politic but   through a pragmatic work out and that be the windsor framework be he sell something that can not actually work the mutual enforcement idea have be describe by the eu commission as magical thinking 
 i remind the minister that the magical thinking come from the eu itself through jonathan faull and his colleague who make that very suggestion and why would what i suggest not work if the eu be our friend if we trust it and it trust we why would it not trust we to keep our word on impose its standard on our good enter its territory if that do not work then it be time to talk about alternative but that proposal should be the starting point there be the whimsical dismissal that it would not work even though it have never be try the really chilling thing about the minister ’s intervention be its subtext suck it up northern ireland you ’re no long a full part of the united kingdom you will just live like a colony of the eu under its law in area we have no empathy and no desire to fix it we will just leave you in that position that be the chilling import of her intervention 
 it may be helpful to remind the minister that the eu ’s own expert mr lars karlsson say in his smart border report that with technology and good will all these issue could be overcome however the politic of mr varadkar and the eu overrode that 
 that be absolutely right and in northern ireland we suffer the consequence of those aggressive political agenda every day 
 if the government be say this be fine there be nothing to see here we do not need to fix anything then they be not just insult the intelligence of those of we who introduce the bill but say to my constituent you can carry on be class citizen the government can not say to my constituent you be equal citizen but you will not be govern by british law that be what the government be say to my constituent in north antrim and to people across northern ireland you have equal citizenship but some be more equal than other some will be rule by the law that this parliament make or by those that the devolve assembly make but you will be rule by law that someone else make for you and be grateful for it that be where we have get to on this issue it be not just insulting but frankly unacceptable for the people of northern ireland to be treat in this way 
 give the government ’s enthusiasm to maintain the unworkable status quo they should reflect on the fact that there be about to be a new president of the united states who have make it very plain that he be in tariff mode if he carry through his tariff this united kingdom government will need a trade deal why would a president of the united states do a trade deal with the united kingdom if the uk have a back door that be open to the eu that be the consequence of this protocol we do not have a secure international trade border the border with the eu be porous and by all report mr trump be pretty adverse to the eu why would he ever do a deal with the united kingdom with that back door open 
 should this government not take the opportunity present by this bill to say we will fix this arrangement and then we can convince the americans that we be a   safe and secure partner in a trade deal so long as the protocol exist we can not give the united states of america that certainty it be in the national interest the government ’s interest and our trading interest to fix this arrangement so that we can pursue a trade deal with the americans who at the end of the day be our good friend in all this on the good possible term 
 the hon and learn gentleman have already outline that there be tightly bind area where the eu influence northern irish legislation but it sound very much as if he be now suggest that the united kingdom should operate under whatever remit the president elect of the united states choose to set for we policy be make here in parliament not in dc 
 i only wish that the law for northern ireland be make in this parliament or in our devolved institution if the hon member have be listen at all surely he have understand that there be vast area they be not self contain they be expand and have already be expand on which law be make in a foreign parliament that be the fundamental point if we want a trade deal with the united states we have to show that it will be a bona fide trade deal with the united kingdom not with a surrogate of the eu through a back door that be wide open 
 i note that the hon and learn gentleman fail to answer the question from my hon friend   the member for belfast south and mid down claire hanna he talk about do a deal with the united states of america on trade how could we possibly be take seriously as a trade partner by any country in the world in future if we break the deal that we already have on the table 
 if the deal be reach under false pretence if it be reach in breach of international law because it breach respect for territorial integrity yes the thing this government should do be reverse that arrangement they should not continue with a deal that do not respect the territorial integrity of this united kingdom that be the fundamental principle of international law and if international law have be disregard to get this arrangement the arrangement be disreputable and not worthy of continuation that would be of more interest to our american friend than our saying we will make a deal that will sell out some of our own people that will create circumstance where any trade deal we do will benefit the eu through the back door but please mr president make a deal with we that will not happen and the government need to realise that 
 let i try to draw my remark to a conclusion by turn to clause it seek to reinstate the fundamental operating principle of the belfast agreement which be that every key decision in northern ireland because of our divide and troubled past should and must be make on a cross community basis it be there in black and white in the agreement yet next tuesday the most key decision that the northern ireland assembly have ever take will come before it without a need for it to have cross community consent that decision will be on whether northern ireland should continue in area   of law to surrender its lawmaking power to a foreign parliament there be nothing more fundamental either to northern ireland ’s constitutional status or to the governance of the people of northern ireland than that however to ensure the desire outcome of that vote a move be make to remove especially for that vote the cross community requirement so that for the time in over year we will have a majoritarian decision of considerable import take in northern ireland that be a rigging of the arrangement of the belfast agreement 
 strange as it might be through this bill i be the champion the requirement of the belfast agreement by ask if the modus operandi be to ensure cross community support why have the vote be rig to remove cross community support might have think that the hon member for belfast south and mid down would be the champion of the belfast agreement and would want to ensure that its fundamental operating principle of cross community support be respect but no she and her party be cheerlead for the vote they bring the matter to the assembly when the executive fail to 
 it be an important point a point that cut to the heart of the operation and stability of the belfast agreement that for the time a key decision be to be take not on the prescribed cross community basis but on a majoritarian basis what do that say to i and my community it say you do not really matter it be more important that we get this vote through cross community ah that be about protect nationalism it be never about protect unionism well sorry but we be call that in today we say if it be good enough for nationalism it should be good enough for unionism why be this government and this house try to say to unionism in northern ireland you do not matter on this issue we will railroad you that be the fundamental point 
 be it not the hon and learn member ’s position that brexit do not require cross community consent in the election since brexit the people of northern ireland have reject brexit however he say that the protection require cross community consent it be a case of consent for thee but not for i will he confirm that the inclusion of this provision mean that he now support the good friday agreement year after repudiate the will of of the people 
 brexit be a national vote decide for well or for bad on a national basis the people of london do not vote for brexit but no be say they should now be rule by law from brussels the people of northern ireland by a small majority do not vote for brexit but member be say that we should be rule by law from brussels that do not stack up i be simply call in aid what the belfast agreement say the belfast agreement say key decision be cross community be anyone deny this be a key decision if so why be it not a cross community vote 
 i thank the hon and learn gentleman for introduce this bill and i acknowledge his recognition of the strength of those protection in the belfast agreement which be build in by my party and especially by lord trimble the former leader of the ulster unionist party and the crafter and political deliverer of unionism in support of the belfast agreement at that time he say 
 i feel betray personally by the northern ireland protocol and it be also why the unionist population be so incensed at its imposition 
 the protocol rip the very heart out of the agreement which i and they believe safeguard northern ireland as part of the united kingdom and ensure that democracy not violence threat of violence or outside interference would or could ever change that 
 make no mistake about it the protocol do not safeguard the good friday agreement it demolish its central premise by remove the assurance that democratic consent be need to make any change to the status of northern ireland it embody a number of constitutional change that relate to northern ireland 
 the late lord trimble be absolutely right about that what be happen on tuesday be an invitation to the assembly courtesy of the government ’s directive to tear up the key central portion of the belfast agreement on cross community consent there be another point 
 the hon and learn member talk about the good friday agreement why do his bill not guarantee that the institution of the agreement have power and why be he happy to put those with uk government ministers unlike the exist arrangement under the windsor framework 
 my bill be about seek to restore democracy to the arrangement that be why i want to take back from brussels control over our law my bill be a charter for democratic progress the present arrangement be the antithesis of democratic operation 
 the hon and learn member might not have support the good friday agreement but do he not acknowledge that the agreement recognise the sovereignty of the united kingdom in northern ireland it involve a changing of the constitution in the republic to recognise the sovereignty of the uk in northern ireland for the time it also recognise the reality and the existence of a border on the island of ireland what he be do be reinforce the principle of the good friday agreement which he himself might have oppose back in the day 
 the core operate principle of the devolved institution of northern ireland be that key issue have cross community consent that be what have be rip out for tuesday i have yet to hear a rational convincing explanation for that maybe the minister have why have we rip out of the heart of the belfast agreement the very thing that be suppose to give comfort to both side that neither side would get over on they why have we rip that out of this agreement if the minister wish to tell i i will gladly give way on that point 
 there be even a further point about this vote on tuesday article of the protocol say that the consent vote be to be 
 reach strictly in accordance with the unilateral declaration make by the united kingdom 
 government of october i repeat strictly in accordance with that unilateral declaration of october promise a public consultation before this vote it be there in black and white in the word of the declaration there have be no consultation so why be the government invite the assembly to conduct a vote which breach   the guideline lay down by the protocol itself that the consent vote should be strictly in accordance with that declaration that declaration include the promise of a public consultation of which there have be none that be another question 
 will the hon and learn member give way 
 i would rather give way to the minister on that issue but i hear no answer 
 the house have be patient as i have lay out the argument for the bill i see the bill as an opportunity to restore the equilibrium which i hope to have demonstrate have be destroy in these arrangement that be the democratic equilibrium the equilibrium of equal citizenship the equilibrium of northern ireland ’s place in the united kingdom and the equilibrium of our relation with the eu all those be positive all those be in the national interest and all those be that which i believe should recommend themselves to the house i trust that the house will give favour to the bill 
 may i say that it be a delight to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker i thank   the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister   for give the house the opportunity to debate the content of his bill as set out in its clause and the issue that surround it which have clearly be the subject of consternation to say the least in some quarter 
 i listen carefully to the many point and assertion that the hon and learn gentleman make no doubt everybody in the chamber listen to they i do not underestimate the significance of the concern perceive real or otherwise that he and many other have in relation to the operation of the windsor framework which in effect be a successfully negotiate recalibration of the northern ireland protocol there be no doubt that all side work hard to achieve an agreement give the obvious complexity nuance and tension that be bind to arise when the implementation of the decision to leave the european union be make in the light of the referendum 
 the detailed statement make by the most recent former prime minister the response to it and the question about it on   february   set the tone in my view i think that be also the view of many other hon member for a genuine attempt on all side of the negotiation to be as flexible as possible give the circumstance 
 i want to quote a few point from that debate the prime minister at the time say 
 today ’s agreement have equally important objective allow trade to flow freely within our uk internal market secondly protect northern ireland ’s place in our union 
 we all agree with and recognise that 
 and thirdly safeguard sovereignty and close the democratic deficit ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 he go on to take each of those in turn in more detail he later say 
 today ’s agreement scrap page of eu law official report   february vol c. 
 that have be refer to in the debate i will return to that in due course he go on to say 
 the eu have also explicitly accept an important principle in the political declaration it be there in black and white that the treaty be subject to the vienna convention this mean that unequivocally the legal basis for the windsor framework be in international law official report   february vol c. 
 it be important to move on to the current prime minister who be then the leader of the opposition he say 
 this agreement will allow we to move forward as a country rather than be lock in endless dispute with our ally ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 who would not agree with that statement we do not want to continue to be lock in endless battle and argument with our ally 
 it be worthwhile refer to   the hon member for north dorset simon hoare who say at the time 
 my right hon friend the prime minister and his ministerial colleague have strain every sinew these last week and month to arrive at today ’s position they be to be congratulate ”—[official report   february vol c. 
 that be important from the conservative benches the current secretary of state for northern ireland say 
 i congratulate the negotiator on this very significant achievement 
 and it be an achievement even   the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis   say 
 i start by unreservedly congratulate my right hon friend on what seem to be a spectacular negotiating success official report   february vol c. 
 i be listen to my hon friend ’s speech with interest do he agree that his contribution show that there be space for fulsome debate and important democratic scrutiny of these thing that affect our family of nation 
 my hon friend be right many of we here today want to discuss this issue because it be crucial to our constituent not just in the short term but in the long term the former member for clwyd west say 
 the command paper tell we that the framework narrow the range of eu rule applicable in northern ireland to less than overall by the eu ’s own calculations’”.—[official report   february vol c. 
 the hon member have recite what some might have think be erudite contribution in support of these arrangement apparently with the insinuation towards the end that we have consider this whole matter have his friend not spend since july try to undo the very thing that the previous government do on so many other matter because they think that they be wrong they be wrong on this so should they not be try to undo it 
 i do not quite understand the hon and learn member ’s point today we be try to tease out many of the issue and concern that he quite understandably have raise to try to understand they and maybe to reflect on they and in future give consideration to they through the process it be important that we be all here today listen to what he and other member have to say 
 importantly this house be charge along with the irish government to uphold the good friday agreement in any legislation that come along it be right and proper that we ask how to do that alongside our colleague across in ireland this legislation touch on so many element of that agreement so today ’s debate be also about we do the important job that we pledge to do all those year ago to improve and maintain peace and stability in northern ireland 
 my hon friend be absolutely right i would be the to admit that we do not always get these thing right whoever do what we have to do be try try and try again and attempt to do our good in good faith i will come back to that in a moment 
 the hon member have quote some of the comment that be make in this house but do he accept that of the people who negotiate the very thing that he be refer to and to whom those comment refer think that he have sign up to an agreement for no paperwork he say that if there be any paperwork people should simply tear it up as it do not matter do he accept that the other negotiate an agreement whose eu version be totally different from the version that he give to this house and the people of northern ireland let we not fall back too much on the comment make about either of the agreement of the time because many be make either with a lack of knowledge or with hope that be not fully found 
 i understand the right hon gentleman ’s comment and i be not go to challenge the integrity of the people who be part of that negotiation it be not for i to challenge their integrity they be hon member and i believe that they do what they do with the good intention during the statement on   february i believe that on the whole most comment be supportive but i acknowledge and accept that some be not such as those from the right hon gentleman himself he make his view know as do other 
 i acknowledge that some of the member who speak during that statement be in the chamber today and express disquiet i welcome the fact that they have take their place on the benches but their disquiet and the disquiet of other must be set in the context of the following namely that the agreement accord to the command paper which be important and which i refer to early 
 narrow the range of eu rule applicable in northern ireland to less than overall by the eu ’s own calculation 
 in any negotiation in the circumstance come away with that figure be not necessarily unreasonable would a figure of be the acid test maybe it would but i do not think so give the circumstance in practical term that be unlikely that be the nature of negotiation otherwise it would be call imposition we must recognise that those on the other side who have their view passion and commitment to their community as well as their history have also be fraught with other people 
 i will finish with this i do not accept the idea that some of our partner in the european union some of those eastern bloc european country that be under the yoke of the soviet union as a coloniser would   take the different view that they in turn be part of a group or cabal try to impose a colonialist approach to another country 
 how else would the hon member describe a scenario in which a huge quota of law be make in a foreign jurisdiction how else would he classify that than as colonialism 
 i will touch on that a little later 
 i wish i could understand perhaps my hon friend can help i out with this if on the hand the european union be a source of colonisation that have this disrespect towards the united kingdom and northern ireland but on the other hand as part of a trade agreement we would simply trust each other to mutually enforce each other ’s rule without any level of oversight at what point do we start trust these coloniser as oppose to recognise that as part of an international trade treaty we both have to stick to the same set of rule and see they uphold 
 my hon friend make a good point at the end of the day whether the hon and learn member for north antrim and i like it or not and i do they be ally in virtually the big trading area in fact it be the large in the world but i accept that member have concern i be not try to deny that and i be not try to demean they or push they under the carpet 
 i also do not want to revisit the pre referendum process it be unavaile at this stage to rehash or regurgitate the argument warning finger pointing claim vilification passion and tension that at time dominate the debate in the lead up to and during the last week of the referendum campaign but the situation we face be a direct result and consequence of that decision of that in my view there be no doubt i believe it be fair to say that personality rather than policy often dominate the discussion and debate at the time i also believe that at time high politic issue around sovereignty self determination and other factor come into play however such matter be really symmetrical that be the nature of the democratic debate and of the democratic debate that we have in this country for well or bad 
 do the hon gentleman accept that consequence be that we have a united kingdom in part of which people have a class citizenship compare with the rest of the united kingdom do he have any solution other than the solution put forward by   the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister   in his brilliant bill as he bring intellectual rigour to try to address this intractable problem 
 i think the fact that the hon gentleman use the word intractable give we a clue about how challenging it actually be when a country decide for well or for bad to withdraw from a treaty to which it have be a signatory for more than year issue be bind to arise 
 do my hon friend agree that the bill undermine not only the uk ’s adherence to the windsor framework but the   security architecture that the belfast agreement underpin the belfast agreement be not just a peace settlement but a cornerstone of our national security strategy by jeopardise our reputation as a trustworthy international partner the bill would weaken our ability to collaborate with ally on global security challenge do he not agree that by maintain the integrity of the agreement we be safeguard our national security and international standing 
 my hon friend make an excellent point we have to be very careful of the law of unintended consequence when we go down a particular path 
 issue be bind to arise that either no think about or think would have significance outside of an abstract environment but subsequently become significant or that be park so that we could come back to they at a later date the reality as we find throughout the whole post referendum period oven ready this and oven ready that be that lot of thing that be park be come back to bite the problem with that as i say be the law of unseen and ignore consequence those thing be wait around the corner and turn up like an uninvited and unwelcome guest in our house 
 please bear with i madam deputy speaker on the potential unintended consequence of come out of a treaty imagine what would happen if we decide to abrogate the north atlantic treaty which of course no would dream of do we know there would certainly be huge consequence to such an action i suspect member understand there would be pretty immediate and most probably predictable consequence to that however it be sometimes the unpredictability of take action that come back to haunt we 
 the same could be say for other treaty which may appear to be of little significance and consequence in the short term but which might take on a whole new persona down the line i be not sure that many people would initially grasp the consequence of say breach the antarctic treaty but there would be consequence in due course if we abrogate a treaty or part of a treaty it be unlikely that we can then somehow revisit it change domestic law and expect other country to accept that 
 i will finish on this point because it be important there be other treaty that we have to look to i could go into detail on they but i will not what about interruption well if member insist how about the nuclear test ban treaty what would happen if we decide to tweak that a little bit through domestic law 
 it would be dangerous 
 precisely my hon friend on the front bench say it would be dangerous and it would be what about the key provision of the outer space treaty what about the agreement establish the european bank for reconstruction and redevelopment on and on it go 
 be the belfast agreement not an international treaty subject to international law be it okay to breach that agreement when it come to its provision of every key decision be take on a cross community basis i suppose that be okay because it affect only unionists 
 the bottom line in my view and that of many other people be that it have not be breach i completely accept that the hon and learn gentleman take a different view but i do not believe that it have be breach and there be well legal brain than i who agree 
 the windsor framework be in turn realign through the safeguard the union paper of january which the hon and learn gentleman refer to and the stormont brake mechanism and the provision contain therein for the northern ireland assembly to approach the uk government in relation to the application of eu law i read the windsor framework time and time and time again as i suspect all member in this chamber do 
 north south co operation between institution in northern ireland be a vital component of the good friday agreement so i thank my hon friend for make his point about treaty because the bill which i have read in clause make it possible to disapply protection in the windsor framework for north south co operation would my hon friend reflect on why disapplye the role of north south co operation would be consistent with the intent of uphold the good friday agreement that be a relevant point for he to reflect on 
 that be a really good point and i be pleased we be have this debate because these be the point we need to consider carefully when we look at these issue and figure they out it be an excellent point i think we will all reflect on that and i hope the hon and learn member for north antrim and hon gentleman across the chamber reflect on it it be important to note that the protection of the belfast agreement be paramount and that be there to reassure the community of northern ireland i hope that this debate continue notwithstanding some of the point that the hon and learn member for north antrim make so that people understand that we be here to reassure as much as we can 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 i will but i want to make a point about the hon and learn member for north antrim i know that he hold view that be bear out of real belief in and commitment to his constituent and the wide community across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and that be exactly the view that i take i hold view bear out of a real belief in and commitment to my constituent and every member in this chamber take that approach who be i to challenge their integrity on that i be not in any way go to attempt that either from my side or to cast aspersion on the other side 
 the hon gentleman mention the of eu law that we have to obey would the hon member like his constituent to be unable to get drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and diabetes as be the case in northern ireland would his constituent like that the hon gentleman can get veterinary drug in his constituency that we can not get would he like that situation for his constituency let we say that the   hon gentleman have a dog and want to take it to his neighbouring constituency would he like it if he need to get a passport to come back do he not think that this situation be unfair on we in northern ireland as we be mean to be part of the united kingdom 
 the framework attempt to do that and there be nothing i suspect that prevent those issue be tease out in more detail as time go by but at the end of the day i do not live in a perfect world i do not know about anybody else i have constituent for example who have be unable to get access to drug and that be nothing to do with this issue it be to do with a whole range of matter that have develop over the past year in relation to government policy but i do not want to go there i and other hon member be try to do the good we possibly can give the circumstance we have inherit i know that might be cold comfort for some member across the chamber but it be say with the good intent and with sincerity it be not to brush this matter aside it be a recognition that there be challenge but those challenge be bind to crop up give some of the point i raise early 
 rise 
 rise 
 i will give way to   the hon member for south antrim robin swann   and then to   the hon member for strangford jim shannon 
 i thank the hon member for make that point it look like i will not get to make a speech but i want to put on the record that the ulster unionist party actually campaign to remain in the european union we think it well at that point because we foresaw exactly what be happen now we respect the referendum of this united kingdom but we be now see the enabling of what we be concern about because of the lack of interest in this house with regard to some of the regulation that be come through and how they be apply to northern ireland the hon member mention medicine yes we have supply issue which be global issue but we also have additional supply issue because of regulation from the european union 
 as far as i be aware the framework attempt to tackle some of those issue i completely accept that the hon member maybe do not accept that or do not want to accept it i do not know i be not cast aspersion at all on the integrity or belief of member at no time do i say anything that deny the right of people to hold the view that they hold which be clearly deeply and obviously feel in a way i actually celebrate those difference 
 i thank the hon member for his contribution i want to give the point of view of my constituent who run a business she say i currently supply material to a lady in devon who then produce good for sale within the united kingdom only i ’m at a complete loss as to what to do regard the gpsr rule come in the united kingdom vote to leave the eu successive parliaments have do what they can to make this nation as dysfunctional as possible and   return we to eu subjugation what would the hon member tell my constituent ’s business which must close as part of the price to pay to far the aim of have an all ireland irish republic that be what my constituent say and it be very much contrary to what the hon gentleman say 
 as i understand it that issue be be negotiate i understand what the hon gentleman say but i do not accept the point he make about subjugation i do not think it be subjugation and i will come to that i understand what the hon gentleman be say i respect the point he make and i respect the view of his constituent just as i respect the view of my constituent but it do not alter the fact that the negotiation be take place as i say before i will repeat it again these thing be never ever symmetrical 
 i know that the hon member and other on the government benches have try to make light of the use of the word subjugation colonisation and everything else but almost every week in this place member complain that minister do not come to this house to explain and elucidate on their policy and that they be not prepared to be question on those policy and quite rightly so if ministers be able to do that continuously in this place would labour members not be claim that we do not have accountable government that we do not have a government who respect democracy and that they be subjugate the people who be affect by those law i guarantee that no member present would accept that from ministers in this place but they accept it in northern ireland 
 in this place we be enable to ask these question in a whole variety of different way include oral question write question and meeting with ministers they be still available right across the piece and the right hon gentleman know that over a number year in this place i have sometimes feel that i have not be listen to by the government of the day that be what i believe interruption i be often listen to by   the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart who be on the opposition front bench and i completely accept that there be honourable exception but at the end of the day we live in a democracy in which we can challenge time after time and we have to be persistent i repeat that there be difference of opinion but i respect they i hope that today ’s debate be be conduct in an as open and transparent way as possible 
 this be not the end of the matter even if the bill do not go through the matter be not over nobody be go to pretend that somehow we be all go to go our separate way and no be ever go to ask a question or challenge a minister in the future this issue will come back time after time i know emotion have its place but so do hard fact statistic and evidence and they have to be balance against another however passion can sometimes lead to a febrile atmosphere that dominate and we have to guard against that 
 my hon friend be make a powerful speech especially on the language we use in my maiden speech i say that when i agree with a member on the other side i would say so in this house i call out   the right hon member for richmond and northallerton   rishi sunak who i believe do a good thing with the windsor framework after nearly year of move away from the european union he take a practical step that lead to a serious improvement i want to put that on the record because i think it be important 
 this house often debate the most challenging and sensitive matter in this chamber last friday we see how a sensitive and intense debate base on conviction rather than dogma bring out the good in the house that be why i have be look forward to this debate and to listen to the view of colleague of all political persuasion and i hope i have do that 
 the hon and learn member for north antrim give the house a head up on this bill with his previous action for example the putative incompatibility of article of the act of union with the belfast agreement be rule out on all count by the supreme court as far as i be aware i be sure member on both side of the chamber will recognise that engagement with this debate be do in good faith even where there be difference of opinion 
 i thank the hon and learn gentleman for his explanatory note on the bill i read they with interest particularly paragraph 
 the purpose of the bill be to provide ministers with the power to make change to the operation of the windsor framework in domestic law restore the cross community imperative of the belfast good friday agreement in respect of continuance of the windsor framework and to safeguard democracy peace and stability in northern ireland 
 in my view this be effectively a reincarnation of the northern ireland protocol bill which cause concern in so many quarter domain and jurisdiction the government of the time acknowledge that there would be non performance of their international obligation out of necessity they say that they seek to reach a negotiate settlement with the european union to forestall the need to invoke the concept of necessity 
 the previous government subsequently withdraw the bill because they believe they have secure the necessary condition they seek as set out in the uk eu withdrawal agreement therefore the assertion on the use of the concept of necessity be never put to the test i for be pleased that it be not if it have be in my view and in the view of many other we would have be on the road to perdition there be no doubt about that 
 as i have say this bill be another iteration of the northern ireland protocol bill that would take we back to june and once again put the country in danger of breach its obligation under international law notwithstanding what the hon and learn member for north antrim say the idea that the bill can invoke the concept of necessity as a reason for a breach be beguiling but illusory 
 do the hon member not accept that a fundamental element of the jurisprudence of international law in this area be the requirement that any such agreement must not infringe the territorial integrity of either state that patently have happen be this not the fundamental flaw in the international law argument it fall at the prerequisite that the territorial integrity of the state with which the agreement be be make must not be infringe 
 i do not want to go down that particular rabbit hole but i will say this we have the sovereign base in akrotiri in cyprus we negotiate that be it a breach of the sovereign territory of cyprus be it somehow wrong we negotiate it we agree it it exist and it be use so i do not believe that it be a breach it be possible to negotiate a range of matter it could be say that an element of sovereignty be give away for a well or a more comprehensive capacity in another area 
 what the hon member seem to be say be that if the united kingdom decide to acquiesce in indeed support the infringement of its own territorial integrity that be all right if that be the basis be it not all the more reason why the government a new government of the united kingdom ought to address this humiliating concession 
 i do not think it be a humiliating concession but if it be a concession at all i think it be an attempt give the circumstance that we face to reach an agreement with trading partner in the light of the decision of the british people we live in a world where we do not get everything we want we live in a world where there be a little bit of give and a little bit of take and sometimes we be able to give more than we take and vice versa as i have say however i do not want to go down that rabbit hole because i do not think it be necessarily the subject of today ’s debate we touch on it and it be pertinent but i do not think it should dominate the whole debate
