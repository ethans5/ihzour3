i thank the minister for her reply and for the excellent work she have do in put together the procurement strategy it have be a passion of mine for many year that we do not use procurement just to get extra social value but extra economic value which will help local firm and local growth that be what this statement do and i hugely welcome it may i ask the minister whether she intend to issue guidance to local authority so that they know how good they can achieve economic value for example they could proactively tell small firm what contract be come up or train they in how to tender which be very difficult for they they could also encourage small firm to break procurement into lot so that they have a well chance of bidding finally they could stop require an unreasonable number of year of account to be show before small firm be permit to bid 
 the minister for the cabinet office be ask 
 what recent progress he have make on the infected blood compensation scheme 
 what recent progress he have make on establish an infected blood compensation scheme 
 the infected blood scandal be the bad medical scandal in the history of our nhs and the infected blood compensation scheme be set up to provide some small measure of justice to victim and their family we have set aside £ for victim and since the scheme become law on   march the infected blood compensation authority have the power it need to press ahead and make payment to those eligible for compensation the compensation payment begin last december and people have accept their offer total more than £ 
 my constituent who be year old be a victim of the infected blood scandal he be worried that haemophilia patient infect with hepatitis be be sideline by the compensation scheme he tell i that he be tell those on the special category mechanism with hepatitis c would be upgrade to the same level as those with cirrhosis but that position have now be reverse will the minister look into my constituent ’s concern about disparity for haemophiliac infect with hepatitis 
 i will certainly write to my hon friend on the issue of the special category mechanism i reassure she that the government ’s objective be for all victim of the infected blood scandal to be able to achieve the compensation that they deserve 
 my constituent mr alan kirkham have be badly affect by the infected blood scandal he be infect with hepatitis c from a blood transfusion   in i meet alan recently and he have be campaign for justice for year will the minister welcome and pay tribute to the work of campaigner like alan can he provide assurance that we be work at pace to deliver compensation will he consider fast tracking old and more vulnerable people 
 i will certainly pay tribute to alan and to the work of all campaigner over decade i be restless for progress and i will support the infected blood compensation authority to deliver compensation as quickly as possible on fast tracking for specific claimant last week ibca set out detail of how it be prioritise claim from infected people near the end of their life 
 what direct discussion have the minister have with people in scotland who have be impact by the infected blood scandal about the slow pace of compensation payment 
 in the course of the work i have do i have not only speak to group in scotland but engage with the scottish government ’s health minister on this matter on the pace of the payment ibca have take a test and learn approach which allow it to deal with a sample of the case and then subsequently to scale up ibca be operationally independent but i stand ready to provide all the support i can to speed up the payment 
 my constituent hazel from street be infect with hepatitis c in the 1970 after receive blood product follow the birth of her child she suffer year of ill health and related problem and be still wait for the infected blood compensation scheme her case be truly heart- breaking so what assurance can the minister provide to people like hazel that they will soon be support 
 i express my sympathy and i be sure that of the whole house to hazel in respect of what she have be through the assurance i give be that this government will act at pace that be what we do in put the set of regulation in place by   august   last year and by put the set of regulation in place by   march   this year i continue to stand ready to help and support ibca which be operationally independent in any way that i can to speed up the payment 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service 
 this government believe in the power of good public service to provide security and opportunity but we be clear that the way in which the state work have to change that be why we be reform the planning system to get more house build why we have introduce free breakfast club to give child the good start to their day why we have launch the ai action plan to drive the adoption of new tech in public service and why a combination of investment and reform have help we to cut nhs waiting list for month in a row 
 labour be elect to get the nhs back on its foot and that be exactly what we have be do at sandwell and west birmingham hospital nhs trust in my area the waiting list have fall by since the election which mean that patient be finally get the treatment they need of the key thing we have be do be to look at thing such as ambient ai to automate doctor note and ensure that we have modern technology in the nhs will the minister set out what we be do to ensure that the nhs adopt all technology and reform to ensure that patient be be see as quickly as possible 
 my hon friend be absolutely right there be huge potential to increase nhs productivity through the adoption of new technology and ai as i have say the combination of investment and reform have help we meet our election pledge to deliver extra nhs appointment in england in the year month early but we want to go far we want to adopt the technology to which my hon friend have refer to get maximum productivity and well outcome for patient 
 i thank the minister for his response i have be contact by a constituent who be concerned for his poorly elderly father who require cryotherapy that service use to be offer at his local gp avoid a difficult trip to our local hospital which would have a deleterious impact on his father ’s already poor health give the government ’s focus on move more health service into the community and people ’s home as part of our public service reform agenda do my right hon friend agree that cryotherapy service should be consider as part of that welcome shift 
 the health secretary have talk about big shift that be part of the year nhs plan of those shift be from hospital to the community which will require more service to be available locally we have agree a new gp contract which will see a large boost to general practitioner funding alongside reform to improve digital access if we be go to make this shift it be important that service be available in the local community 
 the government ’s laudable mission lead approach have see nhs waiting list fall for month in a row like many public service our nhs have be plague by over specify guidance and unnecessary target for many year so will the minister assure the house that the mission lead approach will mean a focus on core non negotiable to deliver for the british people 
 the mission set out the government ’s long term target and the plan for change set out the key target for the next few year i do believe that target can play a key role in drive behaviour and that the focus on get waiting list and waiting time down set out in our plan for change can make a real difference over the come few year 
 i thank the minister for that answer i know from my time as a councillor outside this place that under the last government policy be make in westminster with very little thought give to how it could hit frontline service more locally however example such as test and trace during the pandemic show that local service can deliver national priority effectively so what can the minister do to ensure that civil servant down here work well with frontline worker up there to make sure that this government ’s priority be be deliver 
 the hon member make a very good point it be really important that we change the way in which policy be make that we listen more to the frontline and work with the test and learn approach that be refer to by the minister for the cabinet office in answer to the previous question that can help drive well outcome for the public 
 it be clear to i that under the last government our state fail the public we have an agenda that be not root in the life of everyday people mean that despite the number of civil servant be the high in a generation outcome for my constituent in wirral west and people across the country be bad will the minister please set out how a small more modern and more focused state can once again deliver world class public service 
 over recent year the public have see the state get big and taxis go up but they have not always feel that they be get the right outcome from those change to deliver our plan for change we need to reform the state to make it more efficient and more effective we have start to deliver those reform through strong performance management accelerate ai adoption a focus on the frontline and reform rule around recruitment and secondment those plan will help empower our excellent civil service to work well reduce bureaucracy and focus on what really matter which be well outcome for the public 
 i commend the ministerial team both on the innovation fund and more importantly the test and learn culture that have be refer to which embrace a willingness to take risk and iterate do the minister agree that in order for this work to be truly successful and transform   our public service we must also reform our governance and approval process in parallel so that they do not inadvertently stifle this welcome method of innovation 
 the right hon member obviously have hugely important experience in this regard he will know from that experience that the traditional system can be risk averse and that it can seek to resolve too much and try to cover every base before launch a policy the test and learn approach be different by intention it intend to start small and to build from there what be absolutely certain be that whether it be his party or my party in power there be a duty on any government today to pursue reform of the state to improve outcome for the public so in that regard i agree with he 
 a number of month ago the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster announce the plan for change and the pillar mission and various other thing that come with it when will he update the house on how that be go and how the government be meet those target 
 well i have good news for the right hon gentleman laughter this be parliamentary accountability in action of the key target in the plan for change be to get waiting list and wait time down i be pleased to report to he that they have fall for month in a row and that we have meet our step on extra appointment early and i look forward to more progress in the future 
 with job set to go at the cabinet office by please can the minister confirm what impact those cut will have on his department what responsibility might be transfer out of it 
 the cabinet office have triple in size in the past decade or so i think it be right after growth like that that we look at productivity and how to get the good outcome for the public we have introduce a mutually agree exit scheme some of the headcount reduction will be by transfer function to other place but i believe that the cabinet office can absorb a headcount reduction after as i say triple in size over the past decade or so 
 can the minister outline government plan to reform the funding of fire authority that be especially important in somerset where change to employer national insurance contribution the ending of the rural support grant the removal of the service grant and the reduction of the pension grant will cost devon and somerset fire authority nearly £ a year at a time of rise cost 
 i do not want to interrupt the collegiate mood we have have this morning by point out that we have to take those decision after the inheritance we receive i can not speak for every local authority settlement around the country but the local authority settlement announce after the budget be on the whole well than they have be for many year they will not make up for the past year but they be well settlement than many local authority have see for some time 
 i thank the minister very much for his answer to those question the reform of public service be important and i welcome the idea he have put forward i know he have a deep interest in northern ireland be it possible on his journey to northern ireland i understand that he go regularly for he to discuss the reform of public service with the northern ireland assembly and the relevant minister to ensure that we can have the same benefit that come from what he be put forward today thereby improve service and save money at the same time 
 it be important that we have good dialogue between all the devolve government and the uk government i believe that we do have that good dialogue in place at the moment there be always different political party represent around the table and people will come at thing from a particular angle but when it come to this kind of agenda the question be how do we get the good value for money for people how do we get waiting list down and how do we make sure that the taxis that people pay get the good possible public sector productivity there be a common agenda there and i see no reason why we can not keep work productively together on that 
 what step he be take to strengthen emergency preparedness 
 what step he be take to strengthen emergency preparedness 
 the government be introduce a range of measure to strengthen our emergency preparedness we hold regular cross government planning exercise for a range of scenario later this year we will undertake a pandemic response exercise and we will also undertake a national test of our emergency alert system next week my right hon friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster will open the new uk resilience academy which will train over people a year 
 i thank the minister for her response and i particularly welcome the propose test of the emergency alert system the demise of landline and the switch off of the public switch telephone network mean that resident particularly those in area that suffer prolonged power outage such as part of my carlisle constituency now rely on their mobile phone more than ever in emergency event do the minister share my desire to see ofcom expedite its work on the radio access network resilience project so that we can move towards a position where the network put in place emergency generator to switch the mast back on in the event of a prolong power outage 
 this be an issue that i recognise and i reassure my hon friend that my colleague in the department for science innovation and technology be work very closely with telecom company and ofcom to ensure that consumer be protect throughout   the public switch telephone network migration as she mention that will include provision to protect access to emergency service during power outage 
 local resilience forum such as northumbria lrf and durham and darlington lrf which cover my constituency play a very important role in identify potential risk and support our local community can the minister tell the house how the government be work with these local forum and how they will ensure that their insight feed into the government ’s planning and preparation for risk such as pandemic 
 i thank my hon friend for her important question the government recognise the importance of local resilience forum and the role they play in boost resilience in place and community i hope she feel reassure that i have meet all local resilience forum across england to discuss their concern and i have also meet business to talk about the importance of local resilience we will continue to work closely with local resilience forum include northumbria lrf in her local area to plan and prepare for a broad range of risk include pandemic 
 while i be a police and crime commissioner i see many of the thing that have be refer to by hon member as critically important for emergency resilience plan across the public sector and work with the private sector to ensure that that be all target in the right way it be key to make sure that all the different agency public body and company have a share understanding of the risk that we face as a country and receive the late update on those can the minister tell the house when the government will next update the national risk register and explain what plan ministers have for the frequency with which those update will be publish 
 i thank the hon member for his work in this space because i know he have do a lot of work on this issue we be constantly look at the risk register and update it and a lot of work have be do alongside that we be carry out a resilience review as he rightly point out we need to work across a wide range of sector to make sure that wide society play a great role in this matter and the work that i have be do have involve meeting business voluntary organisation and vulnerable group to make sure that the issue be reflect we will make sure that we share the lesson learn with the house in due course and i have also engage with parliamentarian on this issue 
 in the last few week dorset have be ravage by wildfire especially upton heath and canford heath in my local area where more than acre be go i be blow away by the work of the fire crew from dorset wiltshire hampshire and the isle of wight will the minister thank the fire service for their combine work but also acknowledge that there need to be a review of funding for emergency service to ensure that they be consistently able to protect we in the face of climate change i ask she for that assurance 
 i thank the hon member for raise such an important matter i want to put on record my thank to the emergency service which have be do a lot of work on the ground particularly through local resilience forum and her work as a local mp as part of the resilience review we be look at the issue she have raise we be also work collaboratively across department to make sure that the climate change matter she have raise be look at because they should be look at not only by the cabinet office alone but across all departments 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i would like to turn to the sorry state of labour run birmingham where rat the size of dachshund be terrify local resident indeed in the daily telegraph this morning we read that 
 birmingham city council warn of a surge in rat borne disease that the elderly disabled people and baby be particularly susceptible to 
 the government have have emergency power throughout this crisis not least the civil contingencies act will the minister set out for the house why they have decline to use they 
 i thank the hon member for his question and i be sure he would like to join i in praise the deputy prime minister and her team for their hard work on this a lot of the rubbish have be clear and i want to take this opportunity to thank all the staff in birmingham and across departments who have play a key role in respond quickly to and deal tirelessly with this matter 
 i be afraid i be not go to congratulate the deputy prime minister in much the same way that the people of birmingham be not thank she either i very much hope that the deputy prime minister will take the prime minister and maybe the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster to birmingham to see that in fact much of the rubbish have not be clear i also hope that the labour party will undertake not to take any donation from unite the union while this crisis be ongoing 
 the government have commissioner in birmingham at the moment but we know from answer to parliamentary question that the commissioner be not involve in the negotiation to end this ongoing problem with the local union the government have power to do so why be they not use those power and when will they bring an end to these strike and set the people of birmingham free 
 i thank the hon member for the question but i be slightly disappoint by the approach he have take it be important that we work collaboratively together as he rightly point out birmingham be the focus here and let we move the politic out of it it be important that the dispute be resolve as swiftly as possible and that be what the deputy prime minister and her team be do at the moment 
 what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the use of datum by government departments 
 when we come into power the government commission a comprehensive state of digital government review which demonstrate just how far we have to go it set out a picture of fragmentation silos and a failure to maximise the opportunity of datum to personalise and target service the average uk adult citizen spend a week and a half deal with government bureaucracy every year the government have set out a plan to change this and we be take wide range action from create the national data library to increase the number of service that use gov.uk login 
 i be glad the minister mention the government ’s state of digital government review and its fairly excoriate conclusion it be clear that the public sector be not use datum well enough it detail the challenge barrier and reluctance in get the good out of the datum available to departments some can not even get their own arm ’s length body to share datum with they and if we use datum well we can deliver government well would the minister meet i to discuss far how the cabinet office can lead in act on the lesson of the review and ensure that the citizen experience be put at the heart of the change it make 
 i would be delighted to meet the hon member i be very passionate about this in local government i see how difficult it be for frontline staff who be not able to get datum from different service most importantly citizen be have to tell their story to and share datum with multiple service which cause confusion we be work very closely with the new digital centre of government on this and we have an action plan to address it however i always welcome new idea because this could be really transformative for citizen 
 too often when i be try to get to the bottom of problem for my constituent in ribble valley i get response to write question say that minister just do not have the datum available i applaud the government for put datum at the heart of their plan but i worry that we could get too carry away with look at ai solution before we get to solution for actually collect datum in the place could the minister reassure i on how we be work with local government to make sure we be collect datum from all possible source in place to start with before we get to how we can make that more efficient 
 the issue be completely link to use the opportunity of ai which be enormous to personalise service and target prevention we need to have a clear datum picture we need to be able to bring datum together across different level of government there be a huge amount of datum in government but some of it be stick in legacy system and not share properly this be the absolute bedrock of the opportunity around ai so it be something we be very committed to especially work with local government 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i hope to continue the positive cross party approach to this question i particularly like the minister ’s commitment   to a clear datum picture the sullivan review into government datum be publish in march this year and professor sullivan make recommendation to ensure that across government accuracy and consistency be maintain i do not expect the minister to have a full formal response to that review today however can she reassure i that the government will issue a full formal response to the review and its recommendation to provide that clear datum across government within say a year of the report ’s publication 
 i appreciate this collegiate style of discussion there be a huge amount to do here when we come into power we set out as i say a review of the picture that show just how hard it be for citizen to negotiate when move home have to announce it to different organisation use different public service sometimes different service so we need to change we have not wait for the review we have already set out our own plan but we will of course respond to external review that come forward 
 what step he be take to reform the civil service 
 let i thank the thousand of diligent and hard work civil servant who be dedicate to make people ’s live well we want to get the good for civil servant and out of civil servant so we be reform the structure and the focus so that it be well place to fulfil that purpose that include a number of important step in recent week robust performance management well use of digital tool fast recruitment cut to some wasteful spending and a review of the arm length body landscape include the change announce on nhs england to return both power and responsibility to elect representative 
 i thank the minister for his response and i be perfectly happy to accept the diligence of the civil service regardless every year a of the civil service change their department and countless more change to unrelated policy role within each department under the previous government policy expertise be completely hollow out from the civil service will the minister set out how we intend to resolve that to bring policy expertise back into the civil service and ensure we have government team capable of deliver for britain 
 it be probably true to say that a long hold frustration of some ministers have be turnaround and the pattern of career progression where people move on after a few year just as they be become an absolute expert in their area our ambition be not just to have policy expertise but to change the way that policy be put together in the place that be why the test and learn approach which we discuss early in this session be so important frankly the old way of have a group of expert write a white paper throw it over a wall and hop it will work time just do not work in today ’s age what we really have to avoid be a speed world with massive innovation in the private sphere and a public sphere work in the same old way we have to avoid that in the interest of the public 
 the right hon gentleman talk a good game about scrap quango and i support the review he announce to reduce the size of the bureaucratic state why then despite the rhetoric be the government at the same time create dozen of new quango 
 this be another debate which have go on for many year and relate to the question of headcount government can magically reduce headcount by create a quango somewhere but the headcount may not have change at all what be inform the drive this time be the fiction that an arm ’s length body can somehow absolve ministers of responsibility it do not work like that in the real world sometimes there be a good case for have an arm ’s length body but in the end we know that accountability will be with ministers and that be what be inform how we look at these thing at the moment 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i have listen with a great deal of interest to what the right hon gentleman have have to say on the government ’s plan to make whitehall more efficient and to make significant reform to service delivery and we on these benches very much welcome the intention behind that statement however announcement have be make in the medium about the intention to cut job in the cabinet office and reduce the department ’s workforce by a why have we not have a statement in this house about those job cut specifically and when will members of parliament get an opportunity to scrutinise exactly what that mean for their constituent and their expectation about service delivery 
 i work very closely with the chancellor of the exchequer and the treasury on this matter the truth be civil service headcount grow by more than in the year the opposition be in power we believe that some of that can be explain by the repatriation of power after brexit but some of it can be look at in term of efficiency which be what we be do by reduce the government ’s overhead we can devote the resource to where they be really need in frontline public service after such growth preside over by the conservatives over the past decade we believe that can be do 
 what step he be take to strengthen co operation with the devolved government 
 what step he be take to strengthen co operation with the devolved government 
 what step he be take to strengthen co operation with the devolved government 
 what step he be take to strengthen co operation with the devolved government 
 my right hon friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster speak a few moment ago of a good dialogue we be commit to work with the devolved government across the uk and there be frequent proactive engagement between ministers and their devolved counterpart to achieve that for example we have work with the scottish government on the joint investment plan for grangemouth with the welsh government through the tata steel port talbot transition board and alongside the northern ireland executive on the city deal 
 the minister will be aware of last week ’s historic uk supreme court ruling on the definition of a woman be base on biological sex which provide important legal clarity it be critical now that the uk and scottish governments work in a co ordinated manner to ensure that the practical impact be understand how do the minister plan to ensure that this co ordinated approach deliver for woman in scotland and across the united kingdom and do he agree that the ruling must be a lesson for the snp government to stop waste scottish taxpayer money on flawed legislation and court case 
 the ruling uphold the protection of single sex space base on biological sex and bring welcome clarity and confidence for woman and indeed service provider the equality and human rights commission as britain ’s equality regulator have already commit to support service provider with update guidance on the specific point raise by my hon friend we will meet scottish counterpart to discuss the implication of this significant judgment 
 i thank the minister for his answer to the early question event such as tartan day provide a vital opportunity for company such as rse in cumbernauld to promote their product to international market rse have repeatedly tell i that it want to be a part of brand scotland will the minister outline how he will work with the scotland office and the scottish government to ensure that tartan day be an even big success next year to secure investment in the scottish economy and create scottish job 
 let i pay tribute to rse and all its brilliant work on water tech early this month i have the pleasure of represent scotland in the united states along with my right hon friend the secretary of state for scotland at tartan week where we meet a range of business and investor to bang the drum for scotland as a great place to invest and to work it be frankly a powerful opportunity to show that scotland have government commit to its prosperity and wellbeing as the uk government commit to growth we be more interested in new market than old argument and my right hon friend the secretary of state actively reach out to the minister seek to co operate by co ordinate our presence 
 i welcome the step that the government be take to strengthen co operation with the scottish government to cut waste and inefficiency and to ensure that minister take responsibility for public service this be an important area for potential co operation   and dialogue because in scotland we currently have more quango than there be msp in holyrood which waste million of pound a year do my right hon friend agree that the snp scottish government should stop hide behind these quango end the culture of waste and take responsibility for plummet standard in scottish public service 
 i echo the sentiment of my right hon friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster the powerful point he make about the ultimate ministerial responsibility rest rightly and reasonably with elect representative apply north of the tweed as surely as it do south of the tweed i only wish that the scottish government would use the power that they have to do the same and actively cut waste and bureaucracy scotland deserve well than what we be witness just now 
 do the minister agree that this labour government ’s plan for change have help to deliver more gps to help stop the am rush and that the scottish government should work with the secretary of state for health and social care to look at how the snp run health service in scotland could learn from such action 
 as the uk government we have deliver more than extra nhs appointment month early as the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster set out just a few moment ago yet we all know that despite the brilliance of nhs staff the nhs in scotland be still on its knee today from this dispatch box i urge our colleague in the scottish government to work with we and actually learn some lesson from our team in the department of health and social care who be already drive change across england 
 of course if the government be serious about co operate with the devolved government tomorrow ’s reading debate on devolve immigration policy to scotland which have be secure by my hon friend   the member for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins would not be necessary the minister will recall that in the run up to the general election labour ’s deputy leader in scotland jackie baillie say that they would be open to talk on this issue and of course it would be unthinkable that she would have say such a thing just to gain short term electoral advantage therefore have wait a year can the minister tell we when he expect those talk to open 
 in the spirit of collegiality that have be the hallmark of this question session so far let i respectfully suggest that there be a fundamental philosophical difference between our party the snp want to end the united kingdom and we believe in devolution which be ultimately a parliament government solution there be government who represent the good interest of the united kingdom and in that sense i appreciate that there be a constant demand and a constant set of grievance from the snp about why devolution be not work it be about time that we have a government in scotland who be committed to make devolution work 
 far to the question from   the hon member for airdrie and shotts kenneth stevenson give last week ’s uk supreme court ruling which i welcome as a return to common sense and biological reality what step be the minister take to ensure that government message reflect this clarity and that it be implement consistently both across the devolved region and here in westminster 
 i can assure the hon lady that the equality and human rights commission which have a remit across the nation and region of the united kingdom have already commit to support service provider with update guidance i assure the hon lady that we be talk to colleague in scotland and that we will also be talk to colleague in wales and indeed in northern ireland 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to assist local authority in use public procurement to help create economic growth 
 i welcome the house ’s continue passion for procurement and my hon friend have help to lead the way in this area at hammersmith and fulham council i have see how much energy there be in local government to use procurement to deliver job and growth the government be work on plan to allow local authority to reserve contract for local employer public procurement can be a key tool in drive growth and support business across the economy our new national procurement policy statement look to maximise spend with small business and ask contract authority to work collaboratively on local and regional growth plan 
 i thank the minister for her reply and for the excellent work she have do in put together the procurement strategy it have be a passion of mine for many year that we do not use procurement just to get extra social value but extra economic value which will help local firm and local growth that be what this statement do and i hugely welcome it may i ask the minister whether she intend to issue guidance to local authority so that they know how good they can achieve economic value for example they could proactively tell small firm what contract be come up or train they in how to tender which be very difficult for they the government could also encourage local authority to break procurement into lot so that small firm have a well chance of bidding finally local authority could stop require an unreasonable number of year of account to be show before small firm be permit to bid 
 growth be the no mission for this government we have learn from local authority such as hammersmith and fulham which build economic value into procurement the procurement act make new tool available but what be critical be how they be use to deliver innovation and growth the government will be consult on new plan to set target for small and medium sized enterprise use for the wide public sector we have deliver extensive   training and develop new community of practice to help make the most of this huge opportunity as my hon friend have say much of this be about culture and the use of the tool we will be work with local authority around the country to deliver on this enormous opportunity 
 my constituency be a food production powerhouse and i welcome any step by the government to encourage local authority to procure british produce food local authority be under extreme pressure to procure at very low cost what step be the minister take to ensure that the groceries code adjudicator ensure that farmer be pay fairly for the food they produce and secondly the department for business and trade be not about to undermine the food they produce by enter a damaging trade deal with the us that would undermine those standard 
 the guidance we put into the national procurement policy statement make it clear that we want to deliver good value for money which mean not just cost but ensure that we support growth and local supplier that allow local authority to make decision on what will create job and good opportunity for community in the procurement of food 
 what recent progress he have make on implement the plan for change 
 this government be elect with an overwhelming mandate to deliver change we inherit a country hit by an unprecedented cost of living crisis with million stick on waiting list and community blight by crime and antisocial behaviour we be already deliver the change we promise there will be a pay rise for worker thank to our increase in the national minimum wage nhs waiting list be down month in a row and there be fund for neighbourhood police and community support officer that be the change we promise and that be the change we be deliver 
 i thank the minister for her answer it be a really impressive catalogue of achievement in the early month of the government can the minister set out more specific detail for my constituent and the house on big infrastructure project such as the low thames crossing i be delighted that the government have now give consent to it and dartford resident be delighted too how can these big infrastructure project not only kick start economic growth but provide job skill and opportunity for resident in dartford and across the thames estuary 
 my hon friend be a great champion for the people of dartford fix britain ’s creak infrastructure be vital for our growth mission and plan for change we be reform our planning rule to cut through blockage to deliver infrastructure and to help meet our target of planning decision by the end of this parliament the government be commit   to work with the private sector to deliver the low thames crossing as well as create job it will reduce congestion and drive economic growth by improve connectivity between kent and essex 
 as the minister be undoubtedly aware part of the plan for change be kick start economic growth prior to the recess the secretary of state for transport advise i in relation to her statement about electric vehicle charge that the cabinet office be responsible for eu reset negotiation what assessment have the cabinet office make of the cost of the uk not be in a custom union with the eu 
 the minister for the cabinet office have be negotiate with the eu in the country ’s national interest we have be clear that there will be no return to the custom union or single market but the reset in our relation with the eu be an important

 we have recently find out that portrait and painting of elizabeth i sir walter raleigh and william shakespeare be among piece of artwork that have be remove from no no and across the government estate do this not make a mockery of the government ’s st george ’s day celebration this week they be more interested in chase the late woke trend than celebrate the history and heritage of this great country 
 i have already say that we want a public service that reflect all the great accent that make this country such a great place we celebrate our history and i warmly wish the hon member a day late i admit a very happy st george ’s day 
 as we approach the anniversary of grenfell there be still no justice for the bereaved and survivor but we do now have a government response to the national inquiry grenfell campaigner have be clear with i that they want to see the promise change implement but they be sceptical give previous failure of the state to learn the lesson from past disaster do the minister agree that as part of or alongside the very welcome commitment to a hillsborough law there should be a national oversight mechanism to ensure that when inquiry be set up they lead to meaningful change 
 my hon friend be a powerful advocate on this issue it be incredibly important that the government be hold to account for the implementation of inquiry recommendation it be why the government have already commit to establish a publicly accessible record of recommendation make by public inquiry since we will ensure that become standard practice in the future we be also consider wide reform of the inquiry landscape 
 press report early this week indicate that negotiation with the eu around security and defence be to be link to the review of the trade and co operation agreement in particular in relation to access to fishery may i invite the paymaster general to confirm to the house that those report be not true and that there will be no linkage between those important negotiation 
 there be no such link and the right hon gentleman know that the current arrangement will come to an end in we will negotiate in the interest of our fisher and be look at our responsibility to the marine environment 
 it be right that the government have ensure that funding be in place to compensate victim of the infected blood scandal but many of they particularly those in my constituency be still concerned that the process be take too long will my right hon friend say a little more about what we be do to speed up get compensation to those victim 
 my hon friend be a powerful advocate for her constituent the infected blood compensation authority be of course operationally independent but i stand ready to take all the step i can to ensure that compensation be make as soon as possible payment to the infected start at the end of last year payment to the affected will start by the end of this year 
 it be every british citizen ’s right to vote and voter turnout be demonstration of public engagement with politic will the minister consider scrap photo voter id so that the people who say that be the reason they do not vote at the last general election will be able to exercise their right to vote at the next general election 
 as we set out in our manifesto the government be commit to encourage participation in our democracy and believe that it be unacceptable when legitimate voter be prevent or discourage from vote although we have no plan to remove the voter id rule at the election in may the veteran card will be accept for the time and we be conduct a thorough review of the voter id rule evaluate how they impact citizen at the general election 
 too many government departments and public body have foreign make tableware purchase with british taxpayer money may i invite the ministerial team to make a commitment to ensure that every department replace its foreign make table set with a british make preferably from stoke on trent 
 we know of the brilliant craftsmanship of the stoke on trent industry we be commit to support british business and ensure that they have the good chance of win public contract our new national policy statement ask contract authority to maximise spend with small and medium sized enterprise and to support our industrial strategy 
 during the last parliament i make a submission on behalf of the national association of retired police officer for a medal to be issue in recognition of the service give by those injure on duty and invalid out of the service that have the backing of the then policing minister and i understand it also have the backing of the current policing minister but it have now disappear into a black hole in the cabinet office will the minister please dig it out dust it off and give it a fair wind 
 i will find out exactly where we be with this matter and then write to the right hon member 
 under the windsor framework the government through the cabinet office regularly supply datum to the european union about the number and type of check conduct at the irish sea border but they refuse to provide that datum to member of this house when i be a member of the northern ireland assembly and the oversight of those check lay with the local department i be able to acquire that but now that it be under the department for environment food and rural affairs members who ask those question get a refusal of an answer why be that 
 i be perfectly happy to look into the matter that the hon and learn gentleman raise on the uk eu reset i very much hope that if the government be able to secure a sanitary and phytosanitary agreement that they will reduce the number of check on the irish sea 
 the anniversary of the hillsborough disaster come and go over the recess when we also see in the medium rumour that the government be consider water down their propose hillsborough law can the minister explain the government ’s thinking 
 i pay tribute to the hillsborough family and those who have campaign over so many year the government be commit to bring in a    hillsborough law but it be also important that we work closely with the family to ensure that we get it right and that be precisely what we will do 
 urgent question to ask the foreign secretary if he will make a statement on the talk hold yesterday in london on the war in ukraine 
 i thank the right hon lady for her question and for the opposition ’s continue support for the united position that we take in our iron clothe support for ukraine we remain fully committed to work with ukraine and our international partner to secure a just and last peace 
 our support for ukraine be iron clad representative of the united kingdom france germany and the united states convene in london yesterday with ukraine for another round of intensive talk follow up on the meeting in paris last week all party reiterate their strong support for president trump ’s commitment to stop the killing and achieve a just and last peace the talk be productive and successful and significant progress be make on reach a common position on next step all agree to continue their close co ordination and look forward to further talk soon there be an e3 statement on this just last night the foreign secretary have bilateral discussion with foreign minister sybiha and he remain in close contact with his ministerial counterpart to give further detail of the discussion would only benefit putin as i hope the right hon lady understand 
 we condemn russia ’s brutal missile and drone attack on civilian include overnight our thought be with the victim and their loved one at this tragic time they be absolutely horrific scene and they come on the back of shocking scene not only in kyiv but in kryvyi rih sumy marhanets and many other location across ukraine in recent day i remind the house that while ukraine have be in peace talk russia have continue these severe attack include last night that be a stark reminder of the continue bloodshed and aggression perpetrate by putin i witness myself the terrible situation in kyiv when i visit just week ago there be attack on bucha of all place just hour before i arrive indeed this be about not just the killing but the continue shocking abduction of child and attempt to wipe out ukrainian culture putin ’s demand remain undiminished we be very clear about that 
 president zelensky have show his commitment to peace president putin must now agree to a full and immediate ceasefire without condition as ukraine have do we will not stop in our effort to work with all party to that end 
 for all the talk take place it be concern that a clear and unified front in support of ukraine to support a peace on its term have yet to emerge the minister mention the e3 statement on yesterday ’s talk but it consist of sentence state that the talk be productive and successful and that significant progress be make in reach a common position on the next step will he tell we exactly what be productive and successful about the talk what those next step be and whether ukraine be in agreement be security guarantee for ukraine discuss and be progress make   on agree what they will be be the uk ’s long stand position of support ukraine ’s accession to nato discuss 
 follow the abhorrent missile strike in kyiv last night which kill more innocent civilian do the minister believe that putin be committed to a just and fair end to this conflict can the minister confirm whether the status of crimea and other ukrainian territory invade and occupy unlawfully by russia be discuss and what the uk government ’s position be the uk be the strong advocate for ukraine regain all the territory take by force by putin and for putin to lose this war be that still the case 
 there be much debate about the initiative to end the war by negotiation but we can not forget that this war be start by putin a murderous vile autocrat who be be prop up by an axis of authoritarian state try to extinguish democracy on our continent and by those who be oppose to our value include china north korea and iran we need the government to leverage british influence in every way possible for ukraine our ukrainian friend be on the frontline battle an attempt to reshape the whole international order by force 
 i condemn the sanctioning of member yesterday by russia to those colleague i say this it show that you be on the right side of history and that we must always stand up to tyranny uk sanction on russia must stay in place what be the government ’s position on apply secondary sanction and when will the billion of pound of proceed from the sale of chelsea fc be make available for ukraine 
 can the minister explain why the government ’s £ loan to ukraine back by the profit of sanctioned asset be be pay over year rather than in full now finally what more can the foreign commonwealth and development office do to mobilise british technology which could be cheaply and quickly apply to adapt ukraine ’s military effort 
 i thank the right hon lady for her question and for her continued support and unity on these issue it be crucial that we send a signal not only to our friend in ukraine but to putin that this house will not be divide on these issue we be unite in our support for ukraine and i can reassure she of our absolute commitment to ukraine indeed there have be extensive ministerial contact over recent week i meet minister sybiha in turkey a week or so ago and the foreign secretary be with he yesterday contact remain at every level 
 the right hon lady ask a number of specific question i be afraid that i can not go into the detail of yesterday ’s discussion for reason that she will understand i know she have a job to do in hold we to account on that but it be really important that we allow those technical talk to go on at that level between the principal and she will understand why that be necessary 
 i agree completely with the right hon lady ’s point about the sanction against member of this house which i utterly condemn this be par for the course when it come to putin and his regime she ask what we be do on sanction our commitment to sanction remain undiminishe we will maintain the pressure at every level in fact we be ramp up the pressure and   today we have announce new sanction include on the shocking repurposing of game console controller to kill ukrainians by russia we be take robust action at every step we can not only directly to choke off the russian war machine but in relation to and country circumvention of those sanction she can be assure that i have spend a lot of time on this issue in recent week 
 the right hon lady ask about the situation with chelsea fc and i refer she to my previous comment on that we be work at pace to meet the agreement that be make on that she point out the importance of the extraordinary revenue accelerator loan the tranche of that have be disburse in fact i discuss this with the deputy finance minister of ukraine just a few week ago to ensure that they have access to those resource they do have access and i be happy to write to she separately about the detail of the further tranche that will be pay 
 there be absolutely no softening of our commitment to the coalition of the willing indeed the foreign secretary meet french us german and ukrainian counterpart last week underline our share commitment and we be lead a coalition of willing nation to defend ukraine ’s security we will not get into the operational detail for obvious reason as the defence secretary make clear early this week 
 the right hon lady ask about crimea the uk ’s position regard ukrainian sovereignty be well known and have not change we do not recognise russian sovereignty over any territory illegally seize from ukraine include crimea when how and on what term this war come to an end can be decide only by negotiation with ukraine at the heart of they 
 as of the individual who be sanction yesterday by the kremlin i ask the minister whether he agree that if putin be serious about secure any sort of last peace in ukraine he should stop the performative sanctioning of democratically elect member of this house and focus on stop the murderous barbaric killing of civilian in ukraine and the invasion of that nation which we stand with in full support 
 again i utterly condemn the sanctioning of member of this house include my hon friend i be on that list too as be many other member and it be completely unacceptable we be clear on that my hon friend rightly point out example of russia ’s action in recent day the horrific attack the death the killing the continue aggression and of course russia be the aggressor in this conflict 
 i call liberal democrat spokesperson james maccleary 
 overnight russia launch ballistic missile and nearly cruise missile and drone at civilian target in kyiv yesterday ’s talk in london should have be an opportunity to strengthen the western coalition ’s support for ukraine in the face of putin ’s barbarism instead they be derail by president trump who in a petulant response to president zelensky ’s refusal to countenance the recognition of crimea as russian withdraw his secretary   of state and special adviser from the meeting president trump demonstrate that he be not interested in secure a just peace that can deter future russian aggression and protect ukraine ’s right to self determination instead he be intent on secure a carve up of ukraine with putin as long as it be agree before the day of his presidency will the minister make clear to his us counterpart that the apparent ultimatum share with president zelensky last week which would deliver to putin most of the goal of his illegal invasion be utterly wrong and would only embolden future russian aggression i too yesterday find myself on a list of mps from across the house who be be sanction by the kremlin will the government outline how they plan to support member who be be target for speak out 
 while i welcome the hon gentleman ’s party ’s continue support for a united front on ukraine i do not recognise his characterisation of the talk yesterday which be productive and constructive and involve the united states the foreign secretary also speak to secretary of state rubio just the night before and we be in regular contact with our us counterpart secretary of state rubio welcome the fact that we be host special envoy kellogg alongside other of course the prime minister have be in contact with president trump in recent day and the foreign secretary have be in contact with his counterpart 
 we share the president ’s desire to bring this barbaric war to an end of course russia could do that tomorrow by withdraw its force and end its illegal invasion we be work with all our ally include the united states on a plan to stop the fighting we obviously need agreement among all of we on that european ally the united states and other and we be work closely with president trump on that but we be also clear that ukraine ’s voice must be at the heart of any talk we warmly welcome the agreement and discussion between the united states and ukraine but ultimately the ball be in president putin ’s court he continue instead to fire missile and cause the destruction and kill that the hon gentleman rightly highlight it be utterly horrific the responsibility lie with person and that be vladimir putin 
 i associate myself with the minister ’s comment about the appalling attack on ukraine last night and i thank he for his statement today will he update the house on the support the government be offer to ukrainian community across the uk at this very difficult time such as the large ukrainian community in reading 
 i thank my hon friend for his support and he rightly reference ukrainian community across the united kingdom i have meet the ukrainian community in my constituency and just this week i meet ukrainian community member to discuss a range of issue include the horrific abduction of child which russia have continue to perpetrate of the most shocking and heinous aspect of this conflict i be really proud of what british community have do across the country to support ukrainians and the strong tie that have be build it be fantastic that we have sign a year partnership so that for year into the future we have that relationship and give   that iron clothe support on every level economically diplomatically militarily and of course through crucial people to people link 
 our international relationship the world over be dependent on partner country confidence that we will stick by our word and that our ally will do likewise will the secretary of state   the right hon member for tottenham mr lammy convey that message to the united states of america the world friend and foe alike be look at our willingness to stick by the commitment that we have make to ukraine if we renege on those commitment every single relationship around the world will be undermine 
 well i be not my right hon friend   the member for tottenham mr lammy i represent cardiff south and penarth but i thank the former foreign secretary for his comment his continued support and his engagement with i on these important issue when i be in opposition the government and i have be absolutely clear our support be iron clad not only now but for year into the future i be able to convey our support and our unity on this issue to a bipartisan delegation from the us house foreign affairs committee yesterday it be an excellent and productive discussion there be strong unity on these issue we need to continue to work together across europe and in our transatlantic and global alliance to deter and defend against the threat from russia as well as other threat that we face together 
 i be also of the member on the list of people sanction by the kremlin yesterday i want to make it clear in this house that if vladimir putin think that sanction i will silence i he be very very wrong it be no coincidence that the sanction come on the day when i launch a report that i co author with uk friends of ukraine on the issue of the steal child the report outline in detail the systemic capture re education and conscription of ukrainian child by russia will my hon friend outline whether the issue of the steal child be discuss yesterday do he support the campaign to return the steal child will he join i in call for a uk national day of action to recognise the issue of the steal child of ukraine on   july the day of international criminal justice 
 i thank my hon friend for her powerful point and i condemn the sanction against she she be right to raise the issue of the steal child i discuss the matter a short while ago with the ukrainian deputy foreign minister and representative of the different campaign on the issue this be a personal priority for the foreign secretary and i it be of the most heinous and horrific aspect of the conflict not only for those child and their family but because it speak to a wide attempt by putin to subjugate the people identity culture language and future of ukraine that should be clear for all to see of the most powerful reminder of that be a picture that i have in my office paint by of the child who be thankfully   return but sadly there be still far too many child who have be take by russia i look forward to work with my hon friend on this important issue and i be very happy to discuss the event that she suggest 
 if the government could persuade the nobel peace prize committee to give the award to donald trump on condition that he stop side with the aggressor against the victim do the minister think that american policy might revert to of nato deterrence which prevent world war for half a century after the end of world war 
 the right hon gentleman who i know well will know that that be a matter for the nobel committee and not for i i do not recognise his characterisation we be work closely with the united states ukraine and all of our european partner to secure a just and last peace for ukraine we be very clear about who be on the side of peace we and who be on the side of war vladimir putin 
 member across this house who have be sanction by putin and his flunky should wear that as a badge of honour it indicate just how putin and his flunky feel about the prospect of russian asset be seize will the minister update the house on the progress make in move from freeze to seize russian asset to strengthen the hand of our brave ukrainian ally 
 i condemn the sanction against the hon lady and against other colleague in the house we have be very clear that russia must pay for the damage it be cause in ukraine and the destruction that it have work on the ukrainian people and industry i see some terrible example of that when i visit just a few week ago i have speak about the importance of the extraordinary revenue acceleration scheme and the money that be now available to ukraine the government continue to work closely with ally on the issue that the hon lady reference i have extensive discussion with my g7 counterpart and other about consider all possible lawful avenue for make russia pay for the damage it be cause and we will update the house in due course 
 i thank the minister for his statement i also thank   the right hon member for witham priti patel   for her statement because it be important that this house speak with voice on this really important issue on tuesday i ask a question to the secretary of state for defence about the change nature of warfare the minister raise the terrible image of controller for computer game system be use as weapon have he have conversation with nato partner and ally about the change nature of warfare and will that be feed into the strategic defence review 
 we certainly have have those conversation and we have they regularly i thank my hon friend for raise that point the minister for the armed forces be here with i we regularly discuss these issue i be sure all that will be consider as part of the strategic defence review my hon friend rightly point out the effort we be make to deny russia any   of the nefarious mean it use to prosecute its horrendous war in ukraine we have take very specific action on some of those matter today and we will continue to consider further measure 
 i welcome the word of the minister and the uk government ’s steadfast support for ukraine and for far promote european security will he say a little more about how he be work across government departments to support the effort of civil society and business in the uk to ensure that at every level we offer the great support possible to ukrainians 
 i point my hon friend to the important year partnership that we sign engagement at every level between civil society and people in every community be crucial i know that there be very important twinning arrangement between city and community across the uk and we look forward to strengthen those and work with those community i meet ukrainian civil society organisation in kyiv just a few week ago and i regularly meet organisation here in the uk if all of we across this house can create more link that will give true strength for the future to the foundation on which that partnership be build 
 the minister ’s confirmation that the coalition of the willing will not permit the concession of any ukrainian sovereign territory to russia be most welcome but i be not sure that i understand how that square with mr trump ’s current negotiating position which seem to be base entirely on that some ukrainian child have be steal by the neo soviet union and sovietise that be a war crime do the meeting yesterday make it absolutely plain that no recognition of any concession base on war crime will be admit at any time 
 the right hon gentleman ask important question he have hear what i have to say about the abducted child and i completely share his passion and his horror at what have happen i will not go into the detail of what be discuss yesterday but as i say i speak about this issue very recently with our ukrainian counterpart and i know that the foreign secretary take a very keen interest in it the right hon gentleman also ask about territory i will repeat what i say we do not recognise russian sovereignty over any territory illegally seize from ukraine include crimea 
 i be also of the member sanction by putin yesterday for call for this house to do everything we can to stop he the lesson of a century ago be that dictator like putin can not and will not stop unless we stop they and the only way to stop he be through strength through strong armed force a strong nato and a strong nation how will we invest in our strength to stop putin and keep ourselves safe 
 again i condemn the sanction against my hon friend he ask what we be do to keep our citizen and all our ally safe and to keep our share security in place again i be pleased to be join by the minister for the armed forces this government have step up resource for defence and security and   uk support to ukraine we be increase defence spending to of gdp by and have an ambition to reach and the uk be commit to provide ukraine with £ in military assistance this year and every year for as long as it take i mention the era loan and we also have export finance support £ of which be go on supply ukraine with more than air defence missile that be utterly crucial and make a tangible difference not least in the face of the barbaric attack that we see overnight 
 i welcome fresh member to the list of those of we who have be sanction why be president trump treat ukraine as the aggressor will the minister remind us negotiator that together with the united kingdom the usa sign the budapest memorandum assure ukraine of its territorial integrity and independence when that country sacrifice unilaterally its position as the world ’s large nuclear armed power 
 i welcome the right hon gentleman ’s support on ukraine but again i do not share his characterisation of the united states position we share president trump ’s desire to bring this barbaric war to an end and we be work closely with the us and other international partner to secure a just and last peace as i have say it be very clear to we that president zelensky and ukraine be demonstrate and have demonstrate a clear commitment to peace include through their participation yesterday alongside the us and our european partner we know who the real obstacle to peace be vladimir putin 
 do the minister agree that as other hon member have allude to last night ’s brutal attack on kyiv be a timely reminder to government and leader around the world that russia be and always have be the aggressor in this conflict do he agree that that perspective must be central to any talk as we stand with ukraine for as long as it take 
 as i have say we be absolutely unequivocal that russia and vladimir putin be responsible for this war and we be absolutely clear that they be responsible for the ongoing killing and aggression that be why we stand square and iron clothe behind ukraine and we be work with the united states and our european ally to achieve a peace that be just and most importantly last we know that putin ’s demand and intention remain undiminished and we need to ensure that ukraine have the ability not only to defend itself but to deter future aggression by putin 
 this weekend i will join with the ukrainian community in torbay to mourn the sad loss of a ukrainian national who have die far from home almost child have be steal by the barbaric putin regime can the minister advise the chamber on what practical step the government be take to get those child home 
 i be able to discuss some of the practical step that we be take on this important issue just a few week ago with the deputy foreign minister of ukraine and indeed with many of the   organisation that be work on it we be explore further way in which we can assist we have already do a huge amount and i look forward to see step forward take in due course i be very happy to update the hon gentleman in write with further detail 
 i be ashamed to admit that i have not yet be sanction by russia i be feel a little bit lonely clearly i have to do more to call out putin ’s barbaric war crime this house be always at its most united and its most passionate when we be talk about the need for a just peace in ukraine so can i ask the minister very delicately whether he be convince that all our international ally understand that for a peace to be last it have to be just 
 i think that be well understand and it be a point that we continue to underline in all of our conversation whether across the atlantic across europe or with other party internationally it be why we have support the important work on the special tribunal on the crime of aggression it be why we be support action on justice for crime that have potentially be commit in ukraine and it be why we be continue to support key institution within ukraine on these issue and have work within the council of europe on these issue too we have be very clear that justice must come alongside sustainability and ukraine ’s ability to deter future aggression and of course to defend itself and its people right now 
 the assistance that we have provide to our friend in ukraine have include firefighting equipment along with training on the use of that equipment the devastation that take place overnight demonstrate that that assistance be still inadequate so will the minister undertake to review with the fire service minister   the hon member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris what extra provision we can provide if we can not provide anything will he reach out to our international partner to encourage they to supply equipment so that the fire can be bring under control and people ’s life save 
 the hon member raise an important issue and i know the huge support that have go in indeed i work with colleague on some of that in the previous parliament of my friend in ukraine be call up as a military firefighter in respond to some of those attack on the city the need be huge and we have be give a huge amount of support on reconstruction energy infrastructure and other issue i be happy to look at the issue he raise and to see whether there be more we can do in that regard 
 pope francis describe pride as the most devious of sin but i wonder if we can be grant a little bit of indulgence and the minister can take some pride in colleague from across the house join the fine group of those who have be sanction by russia however those who be do the hard yard be in ukraine can the minister assure we that he believe that the united states still believe in ukraine ’s territorial integrity for which those brave ukrainians be fight 
 i have be clear that we be work closely with president trump and the united states our european partner and other i refer the hon member to the comment i make just a short while ago in response to the shadow foreign secretary we be clear that ukraine must be at the heart of these negotiation that be why we be work closely with the united states with our european partner and crucially with ukraine that be exactly what be happen in the technical talk yesterday here in london 
 on tuesday i ask the defence secretary what our red line would be at yesterday ’s peace talk regard any peace proposal from the us that require ukraine to cede any of its sovereign territory to russia i do not receive an answer yesterday us vice president j.d. vance tell reporter 
 now of course that mean the ukrainians and the russians be both go to have to give up some of the territory they currently own 
 can the minister now state that the government will not support any us proposal that see russia make territorial gain at the expense of ukraine upon any permanent cessation of hostility 
 the hon member will understand that like the defence secretary i will not be draw on the detail of the discussion yesterday the only person that that would benefit be vladimir putin we have be clear that we share the united states desire to bring this barbaric war to an end ultimately though it be for ukraine to decide its future our position on that have not change and that be why we be work closely with ukraine our international partner and other to end the bloodshed and suffering cause by russia we be clear on who the aggressor be in this situation we will continue to stand iron clothe with ukraine 
 i have nothing new to say about this but since i be of those include yesterday in the list of those who be no long welcome in the kremlin not that i have think i ever would be i feel compel to place on record that my determination to oppose and expose the brutality and illegality of vladimir putin and his government be great today than it be yesterday can the minister do what he can to make sure that our resolve in this house be hear in the kremlin and also if necessary in the white house 
 i be absolutely sure that the voice in this house be hear across the world i have no doubt that the kremlin be watch what be be say again i condemn the sanction against the right hon member and other members across the house this terrible aggression by russia and by putin have often have the exact opposite effect of what he intend it have strengthen nato unity and we have new member of nato increase defence spending increase resolve increase unity and increase willingness to stand with ukraine not just now but year into the future that be the message that we continue to send from this house and that we continue to send from our ally it be the message that we must continue to send 
 at the london talk do the government have the opportunity to discuss with ally the deployment of member of the chinese people ’s liberation army in support of russia against ukraine 
 i be not go to get into the detail of the talk yesterday but i will make it clear to the hon member that we be act robustly against country support for russia ’s illegal war include through our sanction we do so in relation to a series of matter include the support of military industrial company and other the foreign secretary raise concern with his chinese counterpart on china ’s supply of equipment to russia and the democratic people ’s republic of korea ’s relationship with russia we engage very closely on country support in whatever form that take and we be not afraid to take action where that be necessary 
 i welcome the uk government ’s recent commitment to strengthen their energy partnership with ukraine which be crucial for europe ’s energy independence i recently visit urenco ’s capenhurst site where an advanced nuclear fuel facility be be develop a market that be currently dominate by russia could the minister outline how the uk government be advance this technology and what it mean for the uk ’s energy partnership with ukraine 
 diolch yn fawr i appreciate the hon lady ’s interest in these issue and her support we have be do a huge amount with ukraine to support its energy sector against the terrible attack that have be take place but we have also be work on how we might co operate together on energy in the future that be a crucial question for all of we across europe i continually raise with european and other counterpart the issue of remove the dependency on supply from russia and elsewhere we need to look at new partnership and way forward in which we can support all our energy need whether that be through renewable through nuclear or in other way this be an important issue and i thank the hon lady for raise it 
 can the minister update the house on whether yesterday ’s meeting involve discussion of any potential future co operation between the us and russia on energy if it do do he impart to his us counterpart that such an arrangement would be a folly 
 as i say before i will not get into the detail of talk and discussion we be very clear on our position which be that we need to support and stand with ukraine we be have productive and constructive talk those continue yesterday with the united states european ally and other and i refer the hon gentleman to the answer i give to   the hon member for ynys môn llinos medi   a moment ago 
 how can the minister describe yesterday ’s talk as productive if the united states continue to make unreasonable demand of ukraine that the united kingdom do not support 
 i can describe those talk as productive and constructive because they be 
 it be be report today that the white house be consider lift its sanction on the russian nord stream natural gas pipeline more evidence in case it be need that this us administration be increasingly side with russia this be hugely concern as i be sure the whole chamber agree may i please urge the minister and the department to use whatever leverage they have with the us administration to prevent that from happen if it do go ahead what will the government ’s next step be 
 the hon lady ask an important question about sanction the prime minister have be very clear that sanction against russia be a vital part of our armoury and the uk be commit to maintain our russia sanction we be not consider lift they as the pm say in paris in order to get russia to the table we need to keep up the economic pressure to hinder its ability to wage war and we need to deal with all the way in which the war be be fuel and supply the purpose of our sanction be very clear to stop russia threaten and undermine ukraine ’s sovereignty territorial integrity and independence to help ensure that russia pay for the damage it have cause and to make sure that ukraine be place in the good possible position to secure a just and last peace we will continue to work with the united states and all our ally on those important issue 
 far to the last question there be rightly concern that russia continue to bypass sanction through its shadow fleet what measure be the government take alongside our ally to prevent that 
 since this government come into office we have ramp up our effort particularly on the issue of the shadow fleet on which we seek sanction at the european political community summit just day after come into office i can tell the hon gentleman that the impact of those sanction have be substantial in constrain and take down russia ’s ability to wage this war collectively the sanction by the previous government and this government have prevent $ worth of support to fuel russia ’s war that could have pay for another or year of military aggression against ukraine we will not hesitate to consider further action in this area indeed we have announce some of the big package in recent week 
 i thank the minister very much for his answer i be of those to be sanction but what do that sanction mean it mean that my superyacht i do not have cannot be take to vladivostok for the summer or for the winter so i will have to take it to ballywalter the village where i be bear and bring up and put it alongside the rent rowing boat that i use now and again the sanction will not stop i speak up to tell it straight on russia ’s crime and let we remember what those be there be the steal child whom   the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter   talk about there be the thousand of man woman and child who have be murder and the church pastor who have disappear there be the massacre in bucha all those crime anger we this be about   accountability it be about make sure that the russians who carry out those crime will be hold to account some day by the way i hope they be watch because a sanction do not stop i and it will not stop anyone else in this chamber speak up either 
 i apologise for that introduction but as i say early this week peace be the goal but not at any price what discussion have the minister have with the ukrainians to ensure they understand that our support be there until the right deal be in place what discussion have take place with our american ally to ensure that we be still on the same page when it come to make sure that russian aggression be not reward and that ukraine ’s sacrifice be always remember 
 i think the hon gentleman ’s comment like those of my hon friend accurately capture the sentiment of this house i condemn the sanction against he but the reaction of he and other member of this house should show everybody in the world include vladimir putin but also our ally and most importantly ukraine that our support remain ironclad and undiminishe it will strengthen rather than diminish
