i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no and negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 pet be a part of our family they provide support and companionship when we need it most in time honour friday tradition i would like to name my own pet from my childhood cat perdita through to phoebe who i adopt while i live in the states my yellow labradors harry and george and my current much adore fox red labrador henry 
 have the hon lady ever own a ferret if so what be that ferret ’s name 
 that be an excellent intervention i will come to ferret but unfortunately i have not have the pleasure of at home myself 
 the companionship of pet be highly value during the covid pandemic when there be a surge in demand for puppy and kitten which unfortunately lead to even more upsetting case of pet smuggling in the uk during covid legal commercial import of dog rise by nearly to more than dog in and trend in illegal import could be expect to be similar 
 puppy and kitten smuggling come on my radar as an mp shortly after the lockdown begin in march when i be of those people try to find a new pup which be hard to find i be grateful to my great dog love friend bethany sawyer for her advice not to see the cute puppy that be the wrong age without both parent available in the advert while henry my fox red labrador be not smuggle into the country i meet his mum and dad at their farm just above my north devon home i understand how the emotion in adopt a new pet and companion often leave some of the rationality and question behind price for specific dog breed double and the uk market struggle to keep up with huge profit to be make that imbalance provide ample opportunity for people act illegally and irresponsibly to import puppy and take advantage of innocent pet buyer who may not have know that their furry friend be suffer yougov polling show that of the public want the government to crack down on puppy smuggling 
 i be the parliamentary private secretary on the animal welfare kept animals bill committee and i be delighted to be flank by my whip from that committee my hon friend   the member for south derbyshire mrs wheeler   and other member of that committee who be support this bill just this week alone more than colleague have drop in to see the dogs trust and support the bill 
 when the keep animal bill be withdraw and divide up i make a commitment to the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and the dogs trust that if i come high up in the private member ’s bill ballot i would take part of that bill through as i be not a regular raffle prize winner i be more than a bit perplexed to find myself come i look at henry i be still not sure whether he fully understand all the medium attention and explain that we be go to be help puppy for many month to come i be delighted that i have be able to keep that commitment here today 
 as a dog owner myself i find it horrific to hear story of puppy and kitten be smuggle across the border and the poor condition they have to endure pet be more than just property they be family the bill will ensure that pet be not sell or trade as object 
 this be such an important bill which my hon friend be bring forward with passion and eloquence do she agree that the government must put in funding at the border to deal with the problem and stop the smuggling of puppy kitten and indeed ferret it be a worry that the department for environment food and rural affairs have reduce or propose to reduce biosecurity funding at the port of dover and in the dover area money must be put behind this important initiative 
 my hon friend be a huge advocate for her constituency and the port of dover the environment food and rural affairs committee of which i be a member be indeed look at some of those matter the bill will deliver a manifesto commitment to crack down on puppy kitten and ferret smuggling by closing loophole exploit by unscrupulous commercial trader 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for the passionate case she be make for her bill which i think we all support her legislation rely quite extensively on regulation do she have a sense of how quickly those regulation will come forward once the bill hopefully pass 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his intervention and i hope that the minister can provide guidance on that at the end of the debate 
 the bill will ban the import of puppy and kitten under month and dog and cat that be mutilate or heavily pregnant it will also address the abuse of non commercial rule that compromise animal welfare and biosecurity by make it more difficult and less profitable for trader to fraudulently import animal for sale under the disguise of owner travel with their pet the bill also address the issue of commercial import be disguise as non commercial movement   by amend the rule that govern the non commercial movement of dog cat and ferret into great britain from country 
 the puppy trade have become a multimillion pound transnational industry with uk sale of up to puppy annually and a value of £ however of the industry be either illegal or unlicensed and off the enforcement radar of that half originate from animal come from outside the uk 
 accord to the animal and plant health agency in more than landing of dog and cat be intercept at the port of dover and find to be non- compliant with import requirement of those puppy and kitten be quarantine for be below the legally require minimum age for import that datum do not include animal detain at airport or find inland we can not know the true extent of puppy smuggling operation so those figure likely capture only a small proportion of the animal smuggle into the country 
 ferret be include in the bill because dog cat and ferret be in the same category for rabie risk i have not have strong representation from the ferret community but i would like to mention on the record the ferret of   the right hon and learn member for banbury victoria prentis who be the minister for the original bill her gorgeous ferret roulette be no long with we but i know that the now attorney general have previously ensure that reference to many of her much love pet be record in this place and i be delighted to remember roulette today 
 while not many ferret have make my inbox i have do much to support the work of our fantastic animal welfare charity on puppy and kitten smuggling so i will focus on their travel arrangement pet animal can be bring into the uk from eu member state through different scheme be for the travel of owner with pet and the other be for the commercial import of pet animal under the eu pet travel scheme or pets vaccinate and microchipped dog cat and ferret be allow to travel between eu country for non commercial reason as long as they have a pet passport and have comply with all the requirement of the scheme which include a rabie vaccination 
 the current pet travel scheme be design to allow a maximum of pet to travel with their owner rather than for the commercial movement of animal intend for sale as pet under the scheme pet owner must fill in a declaration confirm that they will not sell or transfer the ownership of the pet an approve transport company must be use for the travel of the pet unless travel between the uk and ireland where a private boat or plane can be use 
 although i understand that the pet travel scheme be create to make it easy for owner to take their family pet on holiday with they the system have be abuse by unscrupulous trader trader have take advantage of the scheme ’s simple set up to illegally import thousand of puppy for sale make a huge profit at the cost of welfare the most common method of attempt to smuggle puppy into great britain be by bring they in under the pet travel scheme when they be in fact be import for commercial sale and should instead be subject to the requirement of the balai directive and the trade in animals and related products regulations 
 most of all i highlight the great work that the pet charity have do to raise this issue dogs trust expose the cruel puppy smuggling trade in and have be push for change to the law to help stop it ever since the dogs trust puppy pilot scheme be set up in to aid the interception of illegally import puppy by apha at the port and to provide care and rehabilitation for they until they find love new home since then it have care for more than puppy 
 as part of the dogs trust puppy smuggling taskforce i experience the documentary and identity check that currently operate at the border i see for myself the tactic that smuggler employ to avoid detection i thank dogs trust for all its hard work in campaign on this issue and for work with i on the bill ’s progress through the roundtable and the event this wednesday to discuss their recent tragic tales and the decade of delay campaign which feature real life case study of dog who have be help by the puppy pilot special thank go to my local dogs trust site in north devon between ilfracombe and braunton which do exceptional work to rehome dog locally 
 i also thank the rspca for its work on this issue and for its forpupssake campaign especially during the pandemic when interest in get a puppy sky rocket the campaign call for a stop to illegal puppy import and highlight how smuggled puppy can cost the owner more than they think on behalf of the fluffy furry kitten i would like to thank cats protection which publish its cat and their stats survey it find that of the cat obtain in the month precede the survey be from abroad equate to cat it be unclear what condition those cat be subject to during travel 
 there have be significant change in the cat market in the past year with a big rise in pure bred and pedigree cat of the cat obtain in the past month be pedigree and pure bred cat compare with year ago it be likely that many of the import cat be pedigree have have a cat while i be live overseas i know that cat be extremely stress by transportation over long distance which in turn can supress their immune system so that their risk of infectious disease and other stress relate illness be markedly increase by importation 
 vet charity such as the british veterinary association have also raise directly with i the significant threat pose to biosecurity by the large number of smuggle puppy enter the uk although it be not in scope of the bill i hope that raise the issue be a step and that the department will take forward those concern other charity such as battersea dogs and cats home paw and the kennel club have all do invaluable work to campaign on the issue i thank they all today 
 move on to the bill and the measure that will be enact through primary legislation clause will reduce the number of animal that can travel under non commercial rule from per person to per vehicle or per foot or air passenger the charity would have prefer animal per vehicle as their research show that over of pet owner have or few dog however the reduction be a significant and welcome step to tackle the illegal smuggling of pet the non commercial rule be intend to make it easy for genuine pet owner to travel unscrupulous trader   fraudulently claim ownership of several pet that they be actually import for sale they do that because the requirement for owner travel with pet be less stringent the bill reduce the number of dog cat and ferret that can be bring into great britain non commercially reduce that number be proportionate and take into consideration other pet own by the household that may also travel 
 article 5a in clause 4(5 ensure that when a non commercial movement of a dog cat or ferret be carry out by an authorised person it may only take place within day of the movement of the owner there be evidence that the ability for a pet to travel with an authorised person under the non commercial rule be be use as a loophole to bring in animal that should be move under the commercial import regime and therefore subject to more stringent requirement for sale or transfer of ownership the new measure will ensure that pet be move under the owner ’s direct responsibility or where the pet animal can not be move at the same time as the owner under the responsibility of a person authorise by the owner and within day of the movement of the owner an authorised person be who have authorisation in write from the owner to carry out the non commercial movement of the pet animal on their behalf this will also ensure that only an owner of a pet can sign a declaration that   a movement be non commercial this will stop non commercial route be use as a loophole by trader movement that be not within day will require the dog cat or ferret to be bring in as a commercial import rather than a non commercial movement 
 on the measure to be enact through secondary legislation the bill contain an enable power to make regulation on the bringing of dog cat or ferret into the united kingdom for the purpose of promote their welfare the regulation that can be make in relation to dog and cat in great britain under that enable power have be outline on the face of the bill to provide reassurance of the government ’s intention to lay the measure through secondary legislation   the enable power provide the opportunity for the government to gather further evidence and discuss the proposal with stakeholder and the public in order to develop the new restriction effectively the power will enable the government to tackle low welfare import dynamically they will allow we the flexibility to address know issue quickly but also act to close down emerge practice include those attempt to circumvent previous restriction 
 the government will use that power alongside the other power in the bill subsection and to clause introduce prohibition that restrict the commercial import and non commercial movement into great britain of puppy and kitten under month we be still see high volume of smuggle puppy dog under month which do not comply with current animal health rule and be land in great britain for the purpose of commercial sale as well as other low welfare movement and import of pet animal 
 i understand the kennel club ’s concern about genetic diversity and rescue dog that be bring into the country at the age of month however the need for a month minimum age be due to the practicality of identify the age of a dog or a cat that can come into the uk at month old the majority of puppy   and kitten will have a full set of permanent incisor canine and premolar and can therefore be age more accurately the measure will enable the identification of puppy and kitten that be be move at young age and be thus at risk of low welfare 
 the prohibition be intend to prevent the import of under age puppy and kitten by increase the minimum age from week to month to illustrate the importance of that i want to talk about bruce who be available after today ’s sit for photo in room w3 if you would like to meet he mr speaker bruce highlight the need for a change to the minimum age he be a french bulldog who be seize at the border at just week old alongside of his sibling who have all endure a journey in cramp and squalid condition over thousand of mile from bulgaria in week be well under the week that puppy must have reach to legally enter the uk 
 bruce and his sibling be find in a poor condition infest with worm and severely underweight all of the dog weigh roughly kg which be half the expect weight of french bulldog of their age their passport be fake with at least claim that the dog have be worm before they be even bear the dishonest trader claim that bruce and his sibling be all their own pet upon seizure however dogs trust staff be able to find evidence of all dog be advertise for sale online fortunately for bruce the dogs trust be able to take he in and care for he until he could find his forever home bruce have now be rehome responsibly through the dogs trust he be a very cute french bulldog 
 some of these dog be breed for fashion and the kennel club along with other animal charity and vet have highlight the health and welfare issue that can be associate with such breed although the issue of breathing and flat face dog be about genetic mutilation and be therefore not in scope of the bill i would like to highlight the need still to safeguard dog of this type that be already in the country we must look at what else we can do to help with genetic mutilation which cause our pet to suffer 
 last week it be reassuring to hear about crufts ’s respiratory function grade rfg scheme for brachycephalic dog such as french bulldog pug and bulldog it be great to meet dr jane ludlow the vet who have devise the scheme which assess dog with a stethoscope the dog exercise for minute and the process be then repeat we see at hand that the test be quick and straightforward and it assign an rfg rating to each dog those with the low grade should not breed 
 far too many flat face dog have brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome know as boas which can chronically impair the ability of the dog to breathe normally and carry out everyday task all the dog at crufts have the option of be test which become compulsory next year and all those that win be test to ensure that the breed retain high health standard i hope that my highlight this issue today will ensure that more potential pet owner ask question about the health of the parent of their future pet 
 i be really glad that the hon lady have bring up this issue i do not know whether she have see the number of brachycephalic   dog that be go to battersea because pet owner can not afford to have the operation the charity have see an exponential rise in these dog be dump do she agree that much more need to be do 
 i have indeed be to battersea which be what really trigger much of my interest in this particular area like the hon lady i be deeply shock by what i see which be why it be such a relief to see the new system come into effect at crufts it give people the opportunity to find out whether their dog be unwell ideally before they have be adopt as puppy 
 cats protection have highlight the issue of under age kitten smuggling nala be smuggle illegally into the country when she be around week old she have be with her owner for day when they bring she into the uk from germany without a pet passport and appropriate vaccination they become concerned for her health and take she to a vet who realise that she have arrive without meet the requirement of the pet travel scheme and report the matter to trading standard the pet travel scheme pets allow pet cat dog and ferret to enter the uk without quarantine as long as they be microchippe have a pet passport and a rabie vaccination and have wait day after the vaccination before travel 
 in addition to break the term of pet and be face prosecution nala ’s owner be also unable to pay for the cost of week of quarantine which come to £ so they sign she over to feline welfare charity cats protection it ensure that the tiny cat be appropriately quarantine and receive vet care before be take into its ferndown adoption centre despite be remove from her mother at about week old a week early than be advise nala be a lively energetic kitten and a suitable home be find for she 
 clauses 1(3)(b and 1(4)(b introduce prohibition that restrict the commercial import and non commercial movement into great britain of heavily pregnant dog and cat those that be more than day pregnant there be an emerge trend in the import of pregnant dog but there be a strong consensus to tackle that with dogs trust polling show support for a ban on the import of heavily pregnant dog the prohibition in the bill be intend to ensure the welfare of pregnant dog and cat by lower the gestation limit to prohibit the movement into great britain from a country of dog and cat that be more than day pregnant and so within the final of the gestation that align with clear marker in pregnancy and therefore pregnant dog and cat under that limit can be more easily identify in addition we expect that trader will respond to an increase in the minimum age for import puppy and kitten by increase the number of pregnant dog and cat that they import this measure be need to prevent that anticipate increase in import of low welfare dog and cat from producer with unacceptable welfare standard 
 the tragic case of snowy the heavily pregnant bichon maltese show how important this measure be in this bill snowy be seize at the port of dover in may after be illegally transport into the uk before she be intercept snowy have travel to the uk from an eu country snowy be day pregnant   when she be seize in the final of her pregnancy when it be illegal to transport dog just day after she be seize and despite her ordeal snowy give birth to healthy puppy snowy and her puppy have all now be responsibly rehome through the dogs trust the disturbing trend of transport heavily pregnant dog into the country in the later stage of pregnancy cause significant suffering and health implication to both mum and puppy not only will import dog attract less suspicion at the border but as responsible buyer will ask to see the puppy with their mother this tactic allow criminal to give the impression of be legitimate breeder and thus avoid be report to trading standard 
 clauses 1(3)(c and 1(4)(c introduce prohibition that restrict the commercial import and non commercial movement into great britain of dog and cat with non exempted mutilation for example dog with cropped ear or dock tail and declawed cat from my previous meeting with pet charity i know there be a clear consensus among the charity about a ban on dog and cat with cropped ear and declawed cat and i be delighted that it have be take forward the intended approach to the prohibition of mutilate animal be set out in further detail in the department for environment food and rural affairs consultation commercial and non commercial movements of pets into great britain the summary of response and the government response to that consultation be due to be publish in due course and i be very much look forward to see the consultation response 
 the ban on crop ear mutilation would have help year old maisie who come into rspca care in october due to welfare concern she be incredibly malnourished and underweight she be a sweet and gentle girl who absolutely love play with a football chase tennis ball and eat sausage she arrive in rspca care with a dock tail and cropped ear she have a passport from overseas so the rspca believe she be import have already be crop and dock unfortunately it be not just dog that be mutilate many kitten be subject to declaw an extremely painful and distressing procedure that prevent cat from exhibit normal scratch behaviour and be the equivalent of amputate a human fingertip at the knuckle although it be already illegal for cat to be declaw in the uk cats protection the rspca and battersea have be campaign hard to ensure that cat with this mutilation be include in the bill and ban from importation that be both to deter any market or interest in declawed cat and to keep in line with ensure that the high standard of cat welfare be consistently maintain in the uk the pdsa animal wellbeing report state that 
 alarmingly of cat owner who get their cat from abroad equate to cat tell we that they choose to get their pet from abroad because they want they to be declaw 
 clause 1(2)(b deliver relevant exemption to the prohibition for example for recognise assistance dog or military or service work animal the enforcement measure and exemption for the bill will be deliver through secondary legislation as with the exemption deliver the enforcement measure through secondary legislation will enable we to work closely with enforcement body to develop guidance and ensure they have the correct tool to deliver these measure effectively 
 i commend the hon lady for bring forward this bill the legislation we pass in this place be only as effective as the enforcement that follow from it a dogs trust investigation find that of the authority involve in enforce breach of exist regulation in this area the animal and plant health agency and trading standard have no officer on active duty at port of entry over weekend do she agree that as well as pass this welcome piece of legislation we need assurance from the minister about the resourcing and capacity of those agency to ensure the bill be properly enforce 
 although i agree that we need to ensure enforcement as i say to my hon friend   the member for dover mrs elphicke i believe we have an opportunity today to highlight the need to educate people who be about to adopt a puppy or kitten they need to ask those question if illegally import animal be not adopt the trade will dry up i agree with the hon gentleman but i also think we have an opportunity today to extend knowledge about the process of adopt i have learn so much in develop this bill 
 the measure will be enact through secondary legislation in order to refine the scope and detail of the policy and take on the view of the public and key stakeholder the bill provide that the prohibition must be enact the time the enable power be use in relation to dog and cat in great britain to show commitment to deliver these measure i have be assure by the department which i thank for its help in get the bill to this point that it will lay secondary legislation as soon as possible follow royal assent and defra official be already work on develop it that will ensure that the bill be future proof and that it respond dynamically to smuggle practice 
 as be the nature of organised crime the illegal pet trade be unpredictable and ever change these enable power will ensure the government can tackle low welfare import dynamically they provide the flexibility to address know issue quickly and ensure that we can act in the future to close down emerge practice whereby people try to circumvent previous restriction 
 finally let i set out how this will be apply as a gb wide bill and the extent and application involve the devolved administration clause set out the meaning of appropriate national authority regard the devolved administration clause set out the territorial extent of the bill and describe the jurisdiction in which the bill will form part of the law the territorial extent and application of the bill be england wales scotland and northern ireland except clause and which extend and apply only to england wales and scotland 
 the bill relate to animal welfare which be a devolved matter in scotland and wales include in relation to the regulation of movement of animal for the purpose of protect animal welfare in northern ireland animal welfare be generally a transfer matter but the subject matter of this bill mean that the reserved matter in schedule 3(20 to the northern ireland act be engage i thank my dup colleague   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   and   the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson who be unable to join we today but have write to support the bill 
 the hon lady be make an excellent speech about this really important bill which i fully support it be good to see it come forward as she outline we be still wait for a consultation response from the government but do she agree that it be deeply disappointing that the government drop their animal welfare kept animals bill which would have look at these issue more carefully we need great action from the government on animal welfare even though this bill will help we need more 
 this government have do more on animal welfare than any previous government and we will continue to do so like everyone else i be disappoint that that bill collapse but that be due to amendment that change the nature of the original bill i very much welcome the cross party support for this bill 
 the amendment to the non commercial pet travel scheme rule and related measure which include the maximum number of dog cat and ferret that can be move into great britain within day of the owner ’s movement will extend to england wales and scotland the bill do not apply to the domestic movement of dog cat and ferret within our united kingdom so travel between northern ireland and great britian will not be affect 
 many colleague and hon friend be in the chamber to support this bill and i know that some may think that we have not go far enough but we need to be pragmatic with this bill and do not want perfection to be the enemy of the good i believe that as it stand it will do a lot to safeguard the welfare of the thousand of puppy cat and ferret that come into great britain from overseas each year it will also prevent the heartache and unexpected cost to family who unknowingly buy young and ill pet that often come with hidden health condition 
 the measure i have outline aim to make vast animal welfare improvement to the current pet import rule with secondary legislation the measure will go far than the animal welfare kept animals bill to ensure that loophole be tighten i again thank all the charity and interested group that have share their view about the bill i hope that the bill have meet some of the expectation and illustrate the positive step that we be take to stop this cruel trade we be a nation of animal lover a parliament of pet lover and this legislation will ensure that the uk be lead the world when it come to animal welfare 
 it be a pleasure to speak in today ’s debate on the animal welfare import of dogs cats and ferrets bill cestrian be certainly fond of animal and animal right and i have receive hundred of item of correspondence from constituent regard the bill and ask i to contribute to the debate i congratulate   the hon member for north devon selaine saxby   on bring forward the bill 
 like my hon friend   the member for bristol south karin smyth   and many of my constituent i be disappoint by the scrapping of the animal welfare kept animals bill last year a manifesto pledge on which the government stand so i be pleased that   some of the key issue from that bill be address in this bill again i congratulate the hon member for north devon 
 as important as this bill be do my hon friend agree that its provision could have be on the statute book by now if the government have not block labour ’s effort to revive the animal welfare kept animals bill last year 
 yes indeed i agree with my hon friend 
 the bill be a declaration of our commitment to compassion and responsibility towards our furry companion it seek to address several press issue concern the importation of these animal ensure their safety health and wellbeing 
 my constituency have always care for animal and lead the way on animal right chester west and chester council be of the authority to permanently ban the practice of trail hunting on council own land the national trust soon follow suit the change introduce by the last labour government have leave an indelible mark on british history and have stand the test of time from the ban on fox hunting and fur farming to the action to stop experimentation on great ape and the testing of cosmetic on animal we must ensure that we do not stop there we should lead the way on animal welfare and this bill be another step forward and be long overdue 
 puppy kitten and other animal continue to be illegally import into the uk on an industrial scale alongside increase number of heavily pregnant dog and cat and animal with mutilation such as cropped ear every year thousand of puppy be illegally import into the uk to be sell to unsuspecting dog lover have be transport thousand of mile with little or no food water or exercise i be concerned that there be widespread abuse of the pet travel scheme to smuggle animal illegally often under age unvaccinate and in poor welfare condition 
 dog cat and ferret can enter the united kingdom in of way as non commercial pet travel movement or as commercial import more stringent requirement apply to commercial import than to non commercial movement evidence have show that commercial movement be frequently be describe as non commercial movement to avoid the more stringent requirement 
 in more than landing of dog and cat be intercept at the port of dover and find to be non- compliant with import requirement of these puppy and kitten be quarantine for be below the legally require minimum age for import that datum do not include animal detain at airport or find inland we can not know the true extent of puppy smuggling operation so these figure likely capture only a small portion of the animal smuggle into the country 
 accord to dogs trust since the relaxation of the pet travel scheme pets in the number of dog enter the country via pet have increase exponentially dogs trust have conduct investigation which have expose smuggler use pets as a cover to illegally import dog into great britain for sale in dogs   trust set up the puppy pilot through which it fund the quarantine cost of illegally import puppy seize at the border and then rehome they responsibly through its network of rehome centre since more than illegally import puppy have be care for by dogs trust through the puppy pilot which if sell to unsuspecting member of the public would have make more than £ for the illegal importer as many as dog come in through the dogs trust puppy pilot have have their ear crop despite this cruel mutilation be illegal in the uk and the eu 
 my hon friend be make an interesting contribution from her research have she any idea to what extent the regulation be enforce to crack down on ear cropping which be already illegal in britain but which we know still go on it be all very well not bring in dog that have have their ear crop but what do she think be happen to enforce the current law 
 my right hon friend make an important point as my hon friend   the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook   say in his intervention the government need to commit to enforcement if they accept this important piece of legislation in order to tackle serious issue like ear cropping i thank dogs trust and other animal welfare charity such as cats protection and the rspca for the important work they do to support the wellbeing of our beloved animal 
 talk of the rspca i think that i would take the opportunity to talk a little more about ferret which do not seem to have be mention much during this session of parliament with the obvious exception of   the right hon and learn member for banbury victoria prentis i do not think we have talk about ferret in this place at all we have be more likely to talk about reverse ferret than actual ferret 
 i be grateful to the rspca for its fun factsheet on ferret to which i shall refer i have learn a great deal about ferret in do research for this debate apparently ferret or mustela putorius furo which translate as stinky rag thief be a close ancestor to the european polecat and because of their charming and cheeky character have become popular pet 
 ferret have a number of characteristic which the rspca draw out ferret enjoy explore and be very curious they be obviously predator which be a characteristic for which they be more widely know but they be also very sociable which be probably why they have rise in popularity as a pet they be playful and they also like sleep apparently they can sleep for between and hour a day which be quite a feat 
 ferret use a range of method to communicate they use a smell to hunt and they be also very vocal which make i think in a particularly vocal debate about how they communicate an excited ferret will make a dooke noise which be also call chuckle they can also produce a bark like sound and sometimes do that if they be afraid continuous screaming be an indication that they be highly alert in the presence of danger ferret be flexible colourful and can catch cold they sound like a fascinating animal and i be so pleased that the debate of   the hon member for north devon selaine saxby   cover ferret as well 
 let i return to the bill and welcome some aspect of it i welcome the fact that it will ban the import of puppy and kitten under month old and dog and cat that be heavily mutilate or heavily pregnant it will also address the current abuse of non commercial rule that compromise animal welfare and buyer security by make it more difficult and less profitable for trader to import animal for sale fraudulently in the guise of owner travel with their own pet 
 at its core the bill seek to establish comprehensive regulation and standard for the importation process for dog cat and ferret by implement stringent health check vaccination requirement and documentation procedure we can effectively safeguard against the spread of disease and prevent the introduction of infectious agent into our community these measure be essential not only for the protection of the import animal but for the welfare of domestic animal and the public at large 
 furthermore the bill advocate the humane treatment of animal throughout their journey from the moment they leave their country of origin to their arrival at their destination animal deserve to be treat with dignity and respect we must ensure that they be transport in safe and comfortable condition free from stress fear and unnecessary suffering additionally the bill seek to combat the cruel practice associate with the illegal trade of dog cat and ferret by crack down on unscrupulous breeder and trader who exploit these animal for profit in that way we can protect vulnerable specie from exploitation and abuse 
 the bill go far on the importance of responsible pet ownership own a dog cat or ferret be not merely a privilege it be a responsibility that require commitment care and compassion on behalf of my constituent in chester and the many animal lover across the country i once again congratulate the hon member for north devon on this important and long overdue bill 
 it be a huge pleasure to speak in the debate i congratulate my hon friend   the member for north devon selaine saxby   on promote this legislation 
 just from look at the text of the legislation hon member can see quite how complicated it be to amend a variety of bit of law on something we would have hop would be straightforward the reason we have get to this place be frankly that criminal be abuse the rule we have in place they have be smuggle dog cat and ferret to such an extent that more than instance of non compliance be find in dover alone just in give people ’s concern it be right that we update the law this single issue bill be the right way to make that happen 
 during the debate on the animal welfare kept animals bill there be understandably considerable concern about mutilation i be pleased that the bill address that as be say by   the right hon member for garston and halewood maria eagle i use to live in garston at point mutilation be already against the law in this country but too often people say oh well the dog come from abroad to try to get around the law it be important that we address those specific issue 
 concern have be express about the number of pet that can be bring over and what will be consider a non commercial arrangement for what it be worth i think that a sensible compromise have be reach but will the minister answer a question about propose new paragraph 1a in clause 4(4)(a someone can bring in animal if they be in a car but only in any other form of transport i wonder what the situation be for someone on the train on eurostar but not in a car i think go through eurotunnel be cover if the minister want to think about that i do not need an answer today but i think it be worthy of consideration 
 we must ensure that the bill work across the united kingdom so it be important that there be the ability to give power to ministers in the devolved administration during the bill ’s progress which i hope be rapid i would like to probe far the different time at which different clause will come into effect it be good to see that clause and will come into effect straightaway on royal assent it would be useful to understand a little more why clause and will take long i appreciate that there might be a transition but at the moment the bill say month 
 i guess that the most important thing of all be that we go far in committee and on report so that a deadline be put on the introduction of the regulation certainly as far as the power of uk ministers allow at the moment the bill provide the power to make regulation but i think it be well especially as we be try to   take this legislation through the private member bill route to give ourselves a fix deadline for get the regulation do 
 to that end i be very conscious of other primary legislation consultation must often happen for regulation and we know that that can take some time so i would be grateful to hear whether the minister have already start prepare regulation to bring clause into effect that be a very good point in the bill to ensure that the regulation must be about the specific issue of smuggling i welcome that 
 i be conscious that plenty of people would like to speak today i know that the bill will be welcome by many pet owner who believe that they be do the right thing i be conscious that a lot of people when they be on holiday abroad will see animal and try to bring they back through conscience if that be what they feel but that be not always very wise we have to be careful about the sort of disease that can be bring into the country especially in feral animal of course we be well know around the world for our love of animal and we do not like to see they in distress or just abandon 
 i encourage people who be consider take on a pet to go to of our brilliant charity and give an animal a home i can say from personal experience that it can be very positive it can also be a bit of a nightmare deal with some of the behavioural element which later in life can be a bit challenging to correct however a rescue cat a rescue pet i have never experience a rescue ferret will love you forever it   be a vital part of animal welfare to ensure that they be go to good home and be not in the hand of criminal the bill will address the loophole that   exist today 
 it be an absolute privilege to speak in support of the bill and well health and welfare standard in our dog cat and ferret import industry i congratulate   the hon member for north devon selaine saxby   on introduce the bill i admire the work that she do to tighten our importation regulation and advance animal welfare standard for some of our most love pet her work be even more important give the absence of any government legislation to introduce such measure 
 many of my constituent and many people in the country more broadly will be hearten by the hon member ’s dedication to improve the welfare of our import pet with national pet day on   april   fast approaching the debate be timely national pet day celebrate the contribution of pet to our life and highlight the care and welfare requirement of our animal just a week early national ferret day will be mark on   april celebrate the estimate pet ferret in the uk the contribution that cat and dog make to our life will be celebrate on their namesake day on and   august   respectively 
 that show and prove that we be a nation of animal lover and that hold particular affection for cat and dog like many other member i be sure i grow up with dog mainly lancashire heeler that be sadly a die breed but they be wonderful dog that be particularly special to my west lancashire constituency where we have kind of heeler the lancashire heeler and the ormskirk heeler we have scamp who be a vicious little beast but be love nevertheless as well as pal beauty becky and sadly becky tilly tiny and pippin everybody in the family be involve in name those dog and they be very much a part of our family life grow up as an adult i have always have cat unfortunately we most recently lose colin to a congenital heart disease 
 research from the world population review this year reveal that the united kingdom be home to about dog the large population of dog in the world research from various organisation include the pdsa put the percentage of uk household home to a dog at between and which be huge as of the number of cat own be almost as high as dog with cat across the united kingdom 
 to the many people across this country with a dog cat or ferret these animal be not just pet but value member of our family for other a dog or cat can offer the much need companionship they may not otherwise have we see the social and personal benefit of animal ownership throughout the pandemic when pet be purchase during the period of lockdown lack social interaction and instead face social isolation individual and family alike seek the great companionship that pet can provide with this nation ’s love and affection for our feline and canine friend in mind i believe the bill ’s provision will be welcome by many of our constituent 
 to understand the importance of the bill it be essential to understand the current issue around puppy kitten and ferret smuggling currently these animal can   enter this country in primary way under the non commercial rule of the pet travel scheme or via the commercial importation regime pet travel rule   have make travel with pet both cheap and easy for owner however these non commercial rule have be abuse by puppy and kitten smuggler particularly those who care not for the health and welfare of these animal but for the financial reward from this exploitative practice trader have fraudulently claim pet ownership of numerous puppy and kitten to import these animal under the non commercial rule of the pet travel scheme yet these puppy and kitten be commercially sell upon importation 
 requirement for owner travel with a pet be less stringent than those for commercial import and rightly so that be perfectly understandable smuggler have therefore seek to abuse the pet travel importation route to circumvent more stringent health regulation for their animal it be the health and welfare of puppy kitten and ferret that be frequently compromise when these pet be illegally smuggle into the united kingdom 
 as i suggest when i outline the sheer number of these pet in this country the demand for cat and dog be extremely high the demand for young puppy and kitten from high value breed be similarly high as be sadly the demand for animal with certain mutilation cropped ear dog and declawed cat be both in demand despite the illegality of both mutilation in this country the sheer demand for dog and cat of all type couple with the demand for dog and cat with illegal mutilation under uk law have encourage the abuse of our animal importation rule with less stringent regulation pet importation have be feign and the health and welfare of import animal have suffer in almost dog and cat be detain for be non compliant with exist animal health and welfare legislation and that be just the number of identify import animal as with any illicit industry the true figure could well be far high 
 it be with those issue in mind that i welcome the bill ’s provision which will offer far great protection for the health and welfare of dog cat and ferret import into this country the measure outline be eminently sensible to address the abuse of non commercial importation rule it be my understanding that the bill will reduce the number of animal that can travel under the non commercial rule from per person to per vehicle or per foot passenger or air passenger right now smuggler be benefit from non commercial pet importation rule so reduce the number that any person can claim as a pet when travel will impinge far on the fraudulent use of this importation route and the associate health and welfare cost of puppy smuggling under this system 
 more broadly the bill ’s provision will put in place high health and welfare standard for import puppy and kitten ban the import of puppy and kitten under month of age seem very reasonable because separate puppy or kitten from their mother too early carry a risk of illness or even death for those young animal we know that the separation of puppy from their mother be not advisable at all before week for exactly those reason 
 in the united kingdom it be illegal for a licence holder to sell a puppy as a pet or to permanently separate it from its biological mother before week and for those who may choose to sell a litter from a family pet there be a consensus among many welfare and veterinary organisation such as the animal welfare   foundation the blue cross the pdsa and dogs trust that puppy should not be separate until this age the emotional and physical distress experience by both the mother and the puppy can be immense and if not fatal it can have behavioural consequence for these animal throughout their life each week a puppy spend with its mother be crucial for its social and behavioural development bite inhibition and gentle play be teach in this environment and be essential before a puppy be rehome 
 the recognition of harm to kitten separate from their mother at a young age be also already recognise in legislation in this country it be illegal for a licensed breeder to sell a kitten under the age of week of age in recent month this place have show great concern about the possession of dangerous dog that pose a risk to public health ensure a suitable age for import dog and the welfare of these animal should therefore be an equally high priority in this house 
 to prevent the proliferation of a dangerous dog population in the uk we need to prevent the importation of animal at high risk of display dangerous behavioural trait this should include prohibit young puppy without the behavioural maturity and bite inhibition that they learn from their mother that be why this bill ’s provision to ban the importation of puppy kitten and ferret under the age of month can only be a positive step towards great animal welfare standard and towards reduce our population of dangerous dog that may pose a threat to public health 
 my hon friend be make an excellent thoughtful and well research speech do she agree that there be a need for great public information and education as previously mention in the debate to reduce the risk of young age puppy be sell 
 i thank my hon friend for his consider intervention and agree wholeheartedly that we need to make sure that public information and education be improve many people do not understand the impact and possible implication of take a young puppy or kitten so early they often do this out of the goodness of their heart and with the good intention of want to look after a young puppy or kitten or get for their child but we need to ensure that people be aware of the long term and often permanent damage that can be do to young puppy and kitten in this way by remove the ability to import puppy and kitten under the age of month we can likely remove the incentive for these animal to be strip from their mother at a critically young age and thus reduce the number of puppy and kitten suffer from the health and welfare consequence of premature separation 
 we should also prohibit the import of dog and cat that have be mutilate which several member have talk about those animal have often suffer the trauma of unnecessary procedure such as ear cropping and tail docking such mutilation have no health benefit they be abusive practice recognise in uk law as illegal they offer only emotional and physical trauma to   the animal on which they be inflict prevent the importation of animal with these traumatic mutilation    will also prevent the importation of animal which as a result of the physical and emotional trauma cause by the mutilation can develop behavioural change 
 dogs with cropped ear or dock tail may be recognise by certain member of the public as be more aggressive or dangerous we hear that regularly or at any rate i do in my surgery if people keep their own pet away from these animal which they often do for fear of aggression towards they or their dog the animal will suffer far from a lack of socialisation and their behaviour will worsen far similarly the banning of import of dog and cat with mutilation will protect puppy and kitten from harmful practice and will hopefully instigate a decline in demand for pet with certain physical characteristic if it be illegal to import a puppy with cropped ear it be common sense that the incentive to crop that puppy ’s ear at its location of origin will be diminish if it can not be import and sell legally in the uk it be logical to conclude that that characteristic will lose the value that it once have to the importer 
 we may also hope that the criminalisation of certain mutilation will reduce the demand for these practice from the consumer along with the education refer to by my hon friend   the member for reading east matt rodda in this place i frequently hear the argument that the criminalisation of any activity may increase the attractiveness of engage in whatever be be criminalise but in the case of animal welfare i do not find that argument particularly convincing we be a nation of animal lover and i believe that follow the criminalisation of certain mutilation those want to buy a puppy or kitten may understand well the harm associate with these practice and choose to shun the import animal we ban they because of the mutilation and because they be damage not just because this be a fashion that we do not like 
 as for those whose conscience do not prohibit they from require a mutilate puppy or kitten the recognition of their pet ’s become illegal in the future might we can hope that both the importer and the consumer will be discourage from mutilate and acquire mutilate animal respectively the legal importation will all but disappear and we may hope optimistically that the illegal smuggling trade will face several disruption with the broad recognition of the harm that mutilate animal have endure 
 my hon friend be make an excellent speech do she agree that although many of we have learn a great deal about these practice courtesy of   the hon member for north devon selaine saxby the wide public be not aware of some of the consequence could the government not do much more to inform the public of these practice and support the wide provision of the bill 
 i entirely agree the wide public be not necessarily aware of that or the wide range of exist legislation let alone the provision that will be introduce by the bill if it proceed successfully by engage in this debate we be help to raise awareness and i congratulate the hon member for north devon on enable that by present the bill 
 the propose banning of the import of heavily pregnant dog and cat be another provision that will help to protect animal health and welfare the plan of those seek to circumvent new rule limit the number of animal import under non commercial rule would be scupper those seek to abuse our law will always try to find new way in which to sustain their exploitative operation in any which way they can but the bill well think out as it be offer great layer protection for puppy and kitten let we imagine a scenario in which a puppy smuggler want to import several puppy or kitten under the guise of the animal be their pet the limit to the legal importation of these animal under non commercial rule on an aeroplane would now be cognisant of that limit a smuggler could have seek to import a heavily pregnant dog or cat which would then give birth in the uk to numerous puppy or kitten which could then be sell this practice would be limit with the further provision ban the import of heavily pregnant dog and cat a puppy smuggler could not simply travel with a heavily pregnant dog or cat under the guise of pet ownership for the animal then to give birth as a commercial opportunity in the uk 
 crucially the bill will also support the health and welfare of pregnant cat and dog who be our pet and can suffer greatly from international travel when heavily pregnant the physical and emotional upheaval of long haul travel can prompt early labour without the necessary veterinary care and therefore carry risk of harm or death for both the mother and the puppy or kitten involve 
 in review the specific of the bill in preparation for the debate i be astonish to find that some of its provision be not already enshrine in legislation these be sensible and consider measure for which i can see little downside and they be well support by other outside this place the support that the bill have garner from animal welfare stakeholder and charity demonstrate the benefit its provision could have for the health and welfare of puppy and kitten in the uk 
 the rspca the dogs trust and battersea dogs and cats home all support measure in the bill and they support they when they be introduce in the animal welfare kept animals bill those stakeholder be the expert in the field and their endorsement have reassure i that the measure be well consider and likely to positively impact the health and welfare of cat and dog 
 in fact the importance of support the bill have grow great since the government abandon the keep animal bill in may the prime minister ride back on the commitment he make during his ill fat leadership election in which he pledge to retain that bill in the government ’s legislative agenda it be leave to opposition members to try to revive that bill in an opposition day debate on   june   last year i speak then in defence of great regulation to ensure the welfare of animal import into this country despite vote in favour of labour ’s motion government members reject our good attempt to revive the bill 
 i have since press the government in this place on their failure to support well animal welfare standard in january on the animal welfare livestock exports    bill i press the minister about the government ’s plan on puppy smuggling and ear crop legislation however as the title of that bill suggest the government be concern there not with the importation of domestic pet but with the export of livestock the absence of legislation in this area be exactly why i be keen to speak today in support of this bill 
 the banning of live export be of the real benefit of our leave the european union be we to have stay in we would not have be able to give that benefit to our livestock do the hon member not agree that that be a real benefit to animal in this country 
 i thank the hon member for his intervention it be unfortunate that even at that point we still have not manage to bring anything forward around the importation of pet and it be disappointing that the keep animal bill be abandon we be tell in the house that the government expect such measure to come forward through private member bills and i wholeheartedly congratulate the hon member for north devon on her bill i be delighted that what i consider to be something for the bird at the time have come about and i be delighted on this occasion to have be wrong 
 if the moral argument for the bill great protection for the health and welfare of domestic animal be not compelling enough for member across the house the biosecurity threat pose by a poorly regulate and exploit importation industry should be that be of particular relevance to my constituent in west lancashire which be also a farming community and so rely significantly on biosecurity 
 puppy kitten and ferret import into the uk illegally pose a significant risk of parasitic disease the environment food and rural affairs committee take oral evidence on its puppy smuggling inquiry in october but the write evidence submit to that inquiry and publish for all member of the house to read be particularly interesting dog and puppy illegally land in the uk be recognise as present a significant biosecurity risk the pet travel scheme require microchipping rabie vaccination a mandatory pre travel waiting period and depend on the country from which the pet be travel tapeworm treatment and a rabie antibody test result to create a pet passport 
 the commercial importation scheme have great requirement as i reference early and have all the condition of the pet travel scheme alongside a pre importation veterinary examination an animal health certificate and pre notification to the authority to ensure welfare during transportation the illegal smuggling of pet where there be not compliance with pts or commercial importation standard leave our resident pet animal and we at risk of infectious disease that may spread to other animal or in some case people in the uk 
 my hon friend be make point that other have not make so this be a very valuable contribution will she say something about how animal come in that perhaps have not have those vaccination or that be not properly certificate as such can cause devastation to farming community like her because the disease   they carry do not necessarily stick to individual specie this can be a real issue for an entire community it be all very well have a law but enforcement be the key to stop these problem arise 
 i thank my right hon friend for recognise how important this be in farming community such as mine this be crucial and we have legislation in place some of which many farmer find quite onerous to protect the biosecurity of their livestock and land it be particularly relevant in my constituency which have wetland and bird sanctuary 
 some protection be difficult to put in place and i have have long discussion with chicken and wildfowl breeder in west lancashire about the thing they have to do to protect our nation ’s biosecurity we need to ensure there be continue awareness of the legislation because obviously parasitic infection take no notice of border 
 as i say in my speech this be not cover by the bill and the british veterinary association be quite comfortable that it be not fully include and   that the efra committee be continue its work in   this area 
 i thank the hon lady for that welcome clarification 
 the provision in the bill to reduce the number of animal that can be claim as personal pet and that can therefore be import under the pet travel scheme regulation will help to address this biosecurity risk reduce the number of puppy kitten and ferret that can be admit to just will help to reduce the number that a smuggler can import under these less stringent biosecurity rule 
 propose new article 5a of the regulation should far help to limit abuse of the pet travel scheme under this article the movement of a cat dog or ferret would not be class as non commercial unless the animal be accompany by its owner or unless the movement occur within day of its owner arrive in the country this change would help to prevent abuse of the non commercial importation regulation and limit the awful feigning of commercial animal as pet to circumvent the requirement for commercial import 
 alongside that reduction the bill would place an emphasis on great enforcement mechanism which we have talk about at length i would welcome any further detail that the hon member for north devon can provide to ensure that this sensible and worthwhile legislation be able to be enforce 
 have look at the bill with great interest and have consider the specific of each measure carefully i be proud to support the hon member for north devon in the passage of the bill along with many million in this country i hold our pet in the high regard they make the life of family and individual up and down the country fuller and bright it be with the societal benefit of cat dog and ferret and their welfare and health in mind that i be proud to support the bill its measure will protect the welfare of our domestic animal import and protect our animal and public health at home 
 i also support the bill because as i say we sadly lose our cat colin to congenital heart disease just after we have move house we be look forward to get a new cat yet to be name and hopefully a new dog which i be insist will be call kenneth it be really important to i that legislation be in place to ensure that anybody buy a new cat dog or ferret as a member of their family can be reassure that it have be treat properly after the contribution from my hon friend   the member for city of chester samantha dixon i be seriously consider also get a ferret my father have always want 
 once again i thank the hon member for north devon and congratulate she on pick up what the government have hitherto refuse to advance this be a necessary important and common sense piece of legislation that i urge all member who be present today to support 
 it be a joy to follow that incredible speech i begin by congratulate my hon friend   the member for north devon selaine saxby   on introduce the bill not only do it help the government to continue to fulfil the commitment in the conservative manifesto on animal welfare an area of great concern for a vast number of my south derbyshire constituent but crucially it directly and effectively legislate against those who might attempt to illegally smuggle puppy kitten and ferret across our border i be sure that colleague across the house can support that sentiment and will want to get on with this i have receive many letter from my constituent about the bill all ask i to pledge my support and i submit to do that on the record now 
 this illegal trade be appalling the puppy trade in the uk as have be note be value at £ with around puppy a phenomenal number be sell annually the number be staggering and when consider that as much as of the trade be illegal or unlicensed the enormity of the issue be really bring into focus in any industry or trade where the number and profit margin have the potential to be as large as these be we can always predict that there will be a degree of exploitation on an issue such as this however which involve the welfare and treatment of puppy kitten and ferret in some case barely week old it be incredibly important that we act again i commend my hon friend for bring this issue to the floor of the house 
 the criminal who perpetrate this trade be motivate purely by greed in most case these poor animal be either pregnant or newly bear and be keep in condition of squalor and filth until they be then subject to the cramped condition of their smuggling they be subsequently sell to unsuspecting owner without any knowledge of the hardship that their new pet have undergo madam deputy speaker i have take a large chunk of my speech out to make sure that colleague can get in 
 towards the end of last year i visit daisy brook boarding kennel in my constituency the owner of the business frequently and legally transfer pet from the uk and europe across our border and have have plenty of run in with those who smuggle puppy and kitten   illegally they tell i that the smuggler have a staggering lack of regard for the animal they be smuggle these young puppy be nothing more than future profit and any thought of the welfare of these animal be non existent 
 the bill be crucial to restrict smuggler and it will prove yet again that we be a government for whom the welfare of animal be a top priority we leave the eu so that we could make our own decision on these issue 
 the hon member be obviously very passionate about this issue do she have any thought about enforcement there be widespread support around the house for the measure in the bill but the issue of enforcement be key to ensure that we really do stamp out the puppy smuggling trade 
 i thank the right hon lady for that intervention and i know the minister will reply fully later 
 indicate assent 
 the minister be nod as i say that 
 the stipulation in this bill be clear and will be effective it will ban the import of puppy kitten and ferret under the age of month ensure that they be not take from their mother too young and crucially that they be old enough to travel safely potentially for long distance it will ban the import of heavily pregnant dog cat and ferret to which the same concern apply it will ban the importation of dog and cat that have be mutilate by have their tail dock or ear crop or in the case of cat by have be declaw all of which be extremely painful procedure most crucially it will reduce the number of animal that can travel under the non commercial rule from in the vehicle to that close a loophole currently be exploit by many unscrupulous traders—[interruption i be nearly finish madam deputy speaker 
 the bill will significantly disrupt the method of pet smuggler and their activity and will help prevent low animal welfare breeding operation from supply the great britain pet market it will give owner the assurance that the dog cat and ferret they be buy and allow into their family have not be source illegally nor treat inhumanely that be undoubtedly a good thing and should be celebrate 
 what be crucial be that the bill remove the suffering of those animal it must never be allow to be turn into profit by those who be break the law the situation be tragic and i fully commend the bill to the house i hope all colleague on both side of the house be willing to do the same if we wish to maintain our position as a leader on animal welfare which we pride ourselves on it be crucial that this bill become law as soon as possible i again thank my hon friend the member for north devon for introduce it thank you madam deputy speaker for call i so early it be much appreciated 
 animal welfare be a top priority for my constituent i regularly get hundred of email a month from concerned resident who want to see action on a raft of animal welfare issue from puppy smuggling to cat declaw and animal testing as the husband of a veterinary surgeon i completely concur with my constituent on the importance of this hugely significant policy area it would of course be remiss of i not to mention my own pet cat frank and the unfortunate recent passing of my cat smudge and my dog roger 
 i fully concur with   the hon member for north devon selaine saxby pet be indeed part of our family and be miss as much as family member i be sure mr speaker will concur with that i have yet to meet attlee the cat i do not know whether you have madam deputy speaker but i hope to do so at some point in time 
 many of my constituent have write to i about the abhorrent practice of ear cropping as colleague may know in the rspca record a horrify increase in the number of dog ear cropping report it receive over the previous year of course ear cropping have be illegal in this country since the previous labour government make sure of that i will come to labour ’s animal welfare achievement shortly the rspca have real concern that an increase number of dog be be send abroad for ear crop to circumvent uk law let i be clear that there be absolutely no evidence that ear cropping be necessary or have any medical benefit for dog innocent dog ear be clip often simply because their owner want their dog to look scarier for cosmetic reason most horrifyingly of all far too often the procedure be carry out by amateur with basic diy tool and no anaesthetic for the dog we must be clear that ear cropping be mutilation it be cruelty 
 i commend my hon friend   the member for city of chester samantha dixon   for her very interesting insight into the world of ferret and just to broach the inevitable question from my family when i return home no we can not have a ferret 
 i be immensely pleased to see such an important bill receive parliamentary time i pay tribute to the hon member for north devon for all her hard work in securing and bring forward the bill she be a powerful campaigner on ecological and environmental issue and on animal welfare i have immense respect for she but i have to say that it be a damn indictment of just how far this conservative government have give up on governing they have their own mp legislate from the back benches via private member bill because minister refuse to pass an equivalent bill in government time 
 the tories repeatedly promise to progress the animal welfare kept animals bill but fail to do so abandon ship after readings despite it supposedly be a key manifesto priority for those on the tory benches colleague may recall that labour attempt to revive the bill last year how foolish we be to assume that just because it be in the tory manifesto and promise repeatedly during the last election and by tory ministers countless time since the government would actually stick to their word i be glad the   government seem to be content with the bill progressing but it seem bizarre that they have to be remind of a key plank of their own manifesto from of their own mp as my hon friend   the member for croydon north steve reed the shadow environment secretary say it be as plain as day that the conservatives have simply bottle it 
 in contrast with this tory government i be immensely proud of the contribution the previous labour government make to animal welfare in labour ban the practice of experiment on great ape and introduce a ban on test cosmetic on animal extend to include cosmetic ingredient in labour then pass the groundbreaking fur farming prohibition act 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for give way on that point because it be my private member ’s bill that lead to the act although it be talk out on report by then opposition mp who do not like the word prohibition it be adopt by the labour government and pass into law which be a very good thing and lead to a european wide ban on   fur farming 
 i thank my right hon friend for that intervention and for all the work and effort she make to make that possible 
 labour pass the hunting act which ban the hunting with dog of fox deer hare and mink we ban the use of drift net in fishing freeing dolphin sea bird and other sea creature from painful and cruel ensnarement labour ’s animal welfare act see for the time animal owner responsible for ensure that the welfare need of their animal be meet labour have a proud animal welfare legacy and it be a privilege to represent a constituency that continue to take these issue so very seriously 
 this bill will finally make provision for restriction on the live importation of dog cat and ferret as originally attempt in the fail animal welfare kept animals bill i be pleased the bill have the support of many other include pet at home and vets for pets who have long support action on this issue and whom i recently visit the condition on importation set out in the bill be vital for effort to continue to drive up animal welfare standard in the uk the bill ’s ban of the importation of kitten and puppy under the age of month and dog or cat that be more than day pregnant or which have be mutilate by ear cropping declaw or tail docking be welcome provision that will bring a wave of relief to my constituent in wakefield who care so passionately about this issue 
 touch briefly on cat smuggling i be pleased that the bill have the support of cats protection its research find that cat be obtain overseas in without strong restriction on import condition there be very little that we can do to ensure that these cat get the veterinary treatment they need for legal entry into this country without strong law there be very little that we can do to ensure that a cat ’s travel condition or point of origin be not traumatic which be so often   the case stress from long journey be well document and as my husband have attest can cause cat   painful cystitis it be critical for animal welfare that we get this right 
 i particularly welcome the provision for the regulation of the number of cat dog and ferret that can be import at a time per vehicle or foot passenger before it be deem a commercial import this be a vital part of the bill that will go some way towards address the scourge of puppy and kitten smuggling and of animal mutilation both of which blight our animal welfare reputation and actively harm the welfare of hundred of animal every year 
 i welcome the bill and i sincerely hope that the government provide the parliamentary time for its progression 
 it be a privilege and an honour to speak in this vital debate i declare my strong personal and professional interest as a veterinary surgeon and a fellow of the royal college of veterinary surgeons i strongly support the bill 
 i have have to frantically rewrite the introduction to my speech have hear my colleague name check their pet i know that my lovely dog poppy and juno be follow the debate closely so i now have to name check they they would never forgive i if i do not and i be sure that they would punish i by roll in something unspeakable 
 we be a nation of animal lover animal provide we with so much companionship and help our physical and mental wellbeing i commend my hon friend   the member for north devon selaine saxby   for drive forward this important bill and colleague across the house for support this important area of legislation over many year i also commend many charity institution and organisation the british veterinary association dogs trust i mention specifically paula boyden its veterinary director who have do so much work on this issue cats protection blue cross battersea the rspca paws the conservative animal welfare foundation and the veterinary surgeon marc abraham have do so much on this issue 
 the environment food and rural affairs committee have take a close interest in this area for many year and we have run various inquiry in recent year be about move animal across border and we have a current inquiry on pet welfare and abuse which deal with a lot of the issue that we be discuss today we have an emergency special session this week on issue face the veterinary sector and we look at biosecurity and animal welfare as well 
 i welcome the fact that this bill be about dog cat and ferret because it be important that we encompass all those animal i also welcome the fact that the bill will increase the minimum age on importation to month i note that some measure be not in the bill but also that we want to get this legislation on the statute book as soon as possible i hope that the government will bring in secondary legislation to add thing as and when necessary we need to keep the option open for future secondary legislation to include thing such as reinstate the rabie titer check and increase the post rabies vaccination wait time to week such measure would help to reinforce the increase in the minimum age to month 
 i hugely welcome the change to the policy on heavily pregnant animal on the efra committee over the last few year we have take harrowing evidence of the    awful trade in heavily pregnant animal be ship into this country to give birth and then ship back out again sometimes with fresh suture wound it have be awful and harrowing to hear that evidence since dogs trust have take in pregnant dog that have be transport currently it be not permit to transport dog and cat in the last of pregnancy it be difficult to assess when that be so include the last of pregnancy in the ban be a very important step 
 we need to keep a watching brief on whether unscrupulous trader be flip between the non commercial and commercial movement of animal and whether we need to act on the commercial importation of pregnant animal as well we have take evidence show that there be bad people ship animal in over recent year these unscrupulous trader have be switch between commercial and non commercial movement and when the authority move way they move the other we need to keep a watching brief on this 
 i welcome that clause state that a movement be not non commercial if there be more than animal per vehicle that be very important many institution and charity want the figure to be per vehicle but per vehicle be an awful lot well than per vehicle because people be pick up passenger and say these pet be with these passenger on board the animal per vehicle rule will be a game changer 
 it appear to i that clause will allow ministers to bring in secondary legislation so we do need to keep a watching brief and to allow secondary legislation when previous law have come in unscrupulous people have find loophole that be not predict by the legislator draw they up so we need to be able to act to close the loophole 
 there have be a lot of discussion today about the mutilation of dog and cat and the bill will do much to tackle that to be clear ear cropping be an absolutely horrific practice that have no role in a civilised society there be no medical or clinical benefit to the animal in have its ear crop as have be discuss a lot of this be about how the dog look it make they look more formidable or ferocious there have be an upsurge in the prevalence of dog with cropped ear when we be walk around we see these dog now 
 the select committee have also take harrowing evidence on this practice it be illegal in this country to crop a dog ’s ear but we have evidence that it have be take place here people be do it in horrific circumstance potentially in their back garden shed look online we see that the situation be horrific there be online ear cropping kit we need to stamp that out as well this law be important and it will help address that it will close the loophole 
 we must look at popular culture as well include popular animate film of my favourite film that i watch with my child be the disney pixar film up which we all absolutely love but if you look closely at the dog in that film you will see that many of they be crop if people be go to the cinema with their kid and see this on the big screen it look normal and that be wrong in the last couple of year there be another hugely successful animate film the super pets movie again the lead character be an   ear crop dog many people in our country who love their animal do not realise that ear cropping be not normal and want their dog to look like that unfortunately there be a popular and celebrity culture as well we need to educate people that these dog have be horrifically mutilate the bill will close that loophole 
 my hon friend the member for north devon raise the important issue of brachycephalic dog dog with very short face that have real difficulty breathe that be so important because they be lovely and wonderful dog but they have a lot of clinical difficulty we need to do work to make sure that in the future breeding of these dog their nose become long again so that they can breathe more easily again this appear in popular culture and in the advertising of product i will not name they but a lot of major product use image of brachycephalic dog in their advertising we need to be very cautious about that 
 may i draw the hon gentleman back to his previous profession when a vet see a dog that be unsuitable for breeding do the hon gentleman think that the vet instead of facilitate the breeding process have a responsibility to say no we ’re not let this go forward 
 i can give the hon lady a categorical reassurance that the veterinary profession be strongly look at the issue very closely it also have a role in educate the pet own public about where to source their dog responsibly and to ensure that those dog have a good and happy life but yes the veterinary profession be look at this closely what come into frame with ear crop dog be an upsurge in the past few year of unregulated canine fertility clinic where act of veterinary surgery be be perform by people who be not qualified in future we need to ensure that we strongly clamp down on those practice as well 
 i be absolutely delighted that the bill include cat the mutilation include those cat that have be horrifically declaw there be no benefit to the cat in be declaw the bill will help an awful lot of cat 
 in future we need to look at whether secondary legislation be need we will ban the import of ear crop dog but we need to think too about ban the onward sale of those dog in this country however i hope that the bill will stop the importation so that that may not be necessary again we need to keep a watching brief 
 many colleague today have talk about disease the importation of animal present a risk to not only animal in this country but people major disease that we be concerned about be canine brucellosis cause by brucella canis there be positive case in dog from to and positive case in there have be laboratory confirm case in people this be a disease zoonosis that can be transmit from dog to people 
 the bill will ban the importation of heavily pregnant dog of the main exposure to brucellosis be when a pregnant dog come into the country and whelp here the birthing fluid be a potential risk for people vet nurse and practitioner on the frontline be at risk as be owner as i say people in this country have contract the disease 
 brucellosis be an unpleasant disease for the dog treatment be not recommend the prognosis be poor and often euthanasia be recommend it be also an unpleasant illness in people especially in vulnerable and immuno compromise people it be a salient point to make that we need to be cognisant that law like this will help the situation because we have see an increase of dog come in that have such disease 
 the hon gentleman be make an excellent speech give his experience as a vet to what extent do he think that enforcement be an issue i think that there be widespread support around the house for the provision in the bill but enforcement be key do he think that that be get well or bad 
 enforcement be pivotal i chair the efra committee this week in the chair ’s absence and we have a special session on issue face the veterinary sector we look closely at biosecurity animal health and welfare and thing like the animal and plant health agency it be about be vigilant about disease and monitor they later in my speech i will touch on how we can do more in that area 
 on the importation of dog as we have say in the uk people love their animal a lot of people think that they be do the right thing by import and rescue those dog we have see a surge of dog come over from the continent of europe from eastern europe macedonia and so on and some of those dog have have disease like brucellosis and leishmaniasis and that be where we need to be careful people think that they be do the dog a favour but unscrupulous people be probably round up street dog to bring they over when that do not benefit the dog in its own country at the same time we need to remember that we have animal welfare charity in this country absolutely full of lovely dog that need to be rehome people in this country can do a well thing by seek their dog cat and other pet from such charity 
 may i give a huge shout out and say thank you to all those animal welfare charity and shelter that do so much to rescue these animal we have see a real upsurge in pet ownership through the pandemic people talk about pandemic puppy people take on animal in different circumstance and now many have go back to work and can not deal with they many of these animal be not socialise in the efra committee inquiry we have see an increase in behavioural issue with animal welfare charity pick up the slack i pay tribute to those charity they have a really important and stressful job and we be very lucky to have they 
 we need to keep vigilant when it come to biosecurity we should think about introduce secondary legislation on pre importation check for dog so that we can check they for brucella canis when they come in 
 in the eu stop the mandatory treatment against tick and tapeworm in some animal come in now that we have leave the european union we have the opportunity to reinstate that mandatory treatment let i illustrate how that could be important madam deputy speaker just up the road from your constituency in epping forest be harlow a few year ago a dog pick up babesiosis on a walk in harlow the dog have never be out of the country so have pick up that disease from a tick in a field in harlow essex obviously   a dog have go out of the country or come back in and have not be treat drop the tick and a dog here get that disease that illustrate how a simple change through secondary legislation could protect dog in this country that be something that we need to consider 
 we have talk a lot about biosecurity and we have mention today the animal and plant health agency which do fantastic work in keep our country safe it have deal with incredible threat in recent year it have be tackle avian influenza it be work closely on bovine tuberculosis and now there be the increase threat of bluetongue which the minister for food farming and fisheries my right hon friend   the member for sherwood mark spencer   be look at very closely as the midge season approach this virus will put everyone under pressure again i pay tribute to those people on the frontline who be try to do so much to keep the animal and plant health of our nation safe and indirectly human public health as well
