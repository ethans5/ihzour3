the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership on small and medium sized enterprise in the uk 
 the cptpp be of the major benefit of brexit it have the potential to deliver billion of pound to our economy and benefit small business across the uk the deal deliver low tariff reduce red tape and cut edge digital provision that directly support small business to trade more it have an sme chapter commit all country to make the agreement accessible for sme i know that will be welcome news for my hon friend ahead of small business saturday 
 i thank the secretary of state for her answer it be great news that we be progress membership of cptpp and i welcome what she say about sme many sme will be new to export and need expert advice will she outline what particular plan there be to help small business 
 we will ensure that our support offer for sme will help firm build their capability to import and export under our free trade agreement we have start prepare for cptpp enter into force we will be produce write guidance on gov.uk to ensure business be equip with the knowledge they need to access those opportunity specifically our export support service network of international trade adviser export academy and in market support service will also help business to access opportunity in cptpp market 
 in my constituency of strangford sme be an integral core part of create job put wage into pocket and ensure that people can progress and learn more trade we want to be part of the united kingdom of great britain and   northern ireland push for the cptpp what can the secretary of state do to help i and my business in strangford to be a part of that and to move forward 
 the hon gentleman will know that we have the northern ireland investment summit a few month ago we meet lot of business and investor who talk about how they want to take advantage of these market in fact we have have of the big investor into a factory in belfast what i can do be help he with some of the material we have around the export academy and the export support service which he can hand out to business in his constituency who want to find out more 
 i call the shadow minister 
 for uk business to benefit from agreement like the cptpp we must have a clear plan to boost small business export labour have a plan to remove export barrier with clear information and support that be in stark contrast to the government ’s approach which have be a catalogue of failure include the recent fiasco with the government ’s export website which be so deficient that firm be force to seek essential information from foreign government website what immediate step will the department take to provide some stability and ensure uk business can excel in export 
 i think the hon gentleman might be talk about something that happen year ago which we fix he talk about the export support service website business have actually be praise it interruption business have be praise it they very much have be we have an expert toolkit which have be develop by business and trade official what be interesting be that all he say be that labour have a plan to remove export barrier we have actually be remove export barrier labour talk about a plan with no detail no be take it seriously at all the conservative party be the party that represent business in the house of commons 
 what recent progress her department have make on bring forward legislative proposal on reform of audit and corporate governance 
 we remain committed to reform significant reform have already be deliver to the financial reporting council to strengthen its capability and drive up audit quality 
 the institute of chartered accountants of scotland have brand the government ’s decision to leave the audit and governance reform bill out of the king ’s speech as a lost opportunity and a huge blow to the interest of uk business and the public the government have be promise the bill since will they reconsider that backward step and make the uk ’s corporate regulatory framework fit for purpose in the century 
 time and again opposition party seek to wrap business up in red tape whereas conservative be keen to cut red tape consultation with business reveal concern about impose additional reporting requirement while the government be look to simplify and streamline exist requirement 
 this week the business and trade committee take evidence from wilko business collapse such as that of wilko carillion thomas cook and patisserie valerie have be a consequence of failure in the audit process cost people their job and hurt investor and supplier audit reform be recommend by the then business energy and industrial strategy committee in and the government offer to bring forward a draft bill i know the minister want to reduce red tape but do he agree that some form of action be now pretty urgent 
 i be delighted to give the select committee evidence on wilko the administration report on wilko be continue and clearly we need to see the finding but investigation so far have not show that director misconduct play an instrumental part in wilko ’s failure although i think it be clear to all concerned that there be failure in management that lead to the company ’s demise 
 i call the scottish national party spokes- person 
 how strange the change from minor to major in that response financial transparency and accountability be essential component of economic stability for year now the government have be promise legislation and improve check on company finance but they have repeatedly fail to deliver how can the minister justify leave the audit and governance bill out of the king ’s speech when it be support by business regulator and auditor alike 
 we work very closely with the financial reporting council no can deny that the frc have change its approach completely and be now a much more effective regulator sir jon thompson do a fantastic job when he be there and the current chief executive richard moriarty and chair jan du plessis be follow his work we be confident that the frc can make sure that the uk ’s corporate regime work effectively without tie business up in red tape 
 what step she be take to prevent the use of fire and rehire practice 
 what step she be take to prevent the use of fire and rehire practice 
 the government consult on a draft statutory code of practice on fire and rehire early this year the government response and the final version of the code will be publish in spring next year the code set out employer responsibility when   seek to change contractual term and condition of employment and be design to ensure that dismissal and re engagement be use only as the last resort 
 the very fact that only last week p&o cruises feel able to say it would impose new contractual term on worker through fire and rehire tactic show that some employer still feel that they can use these tactic with impunity in spite of the government ’s promise to clamp down on they i thank the minister for his answer but be there any way he could bring in the legislation more urgently so that we can protect our worker properly 
 i agree with the sentiment behind the hon lady ’s question in term of bring legislation forward as quickly as possible of course we have to get this right i have to say that p&o be not a fire and rehire situation it be a fire only situation which be strongly condemn by this government and by many other stakeholder and a civil investigation be ongoing into the matter surround that case but yes the hon lady be right and we be keen to get the new statutory code of practice in place as soon as possible we expect that to be in spring next year and once it be in force the employment tribunal can increase employee compensation by up to when an employer fail unreasonably to comply with the code 
 last week concern be raise that the carnival group be make provision to fire and rehire hundred of staff work on p&o cruises and cunard line revive memory of last year when p&o ferries sack over of its employee and replace they with agency labour while the government sit back and let it happen do the minister agree that the only way to provide worker with the security they deserve be by legislate to outlaw fire and rehire tactic once and for all if not it be time the government come clean with the british public and admit that they will always side with bad boss 
 that be not the case at all we take these matter very seriously but we do not think that completely ban fire and rehire be the right thing to do because there be some situation in which company need to restructure quickly we think that employee proper consultation right should be observe where they be not observe and where an employer do not follow the statutory code of practice employment tribunal can impose a significant uplift on redundancy payment we think that be the good way to deal with this by strike a balance between company and their worker 
 i call the shadow minister 
 fire and rehire be rife in this country research publish by the chartered institute of personnel and development find that between march and july employer change their employee contract through fire and rehire technique the government promise in march that they would take action follow the p&o scandal and we now learn that it will be a full year since that time before anything actually change give the propensity for use fire and rehire tactic   can the minister tell we how many employee he estimate will have have their contract change through fire and rehire in that year period 
 i do not have that number to hand we want to strike a balance between employer and their workforce we condemn what p&o do we need to bring in new measure on fire and rehire and we have commit to do that a consultation be clearly need to make sure those provision be fair on both business and worker that be what we be do right now and we intend to bring those provision before the house next spring 
 what step she be take to encourage business to open outlet on high street 
 what step she be take to encourage business to open outlet on high street 
 in addition to small business rate relief under which business with a rateable value of less than £ pay no business rate whatsoever in his autumn statement the chancellor announce a further business rate support package worth £ over the next year to support small business and the high street 
 my constituent in flitwick have be dismay over the past few year as their high street have be gradually hollow out lose much love business and recently both their post office and banking facility sadly that be far too familiar for people in town and village across my constituency where business be weigh down by high cost pressure and a business rate system that no long seem fit for purpose or fair when will the government commit to bring forward the comprehensive business rate reform that my business be cry out for so that we can get back to revitalise much love high street 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and welcome he to his place in the house 
 of course we be very concerned about the high street the pressure on the high street be largely cause by change consumer habit but the government have step in to ease pressure such as through the £ energy bill support scheme and the £ business rate package 
 the hon gentleman talk about completely scrap the current business rate system which labour have commit to do but it be incumbent on labour to set out how it will replace the £ that business rate currently add to the exchequer what be the solution it be not right for he or other simply to say they will scrap that £ without set out how they will replace it 
 the vanishing of debenhams wilko and paperchase have leave huge hole in our town centre i have lose a wilko in both ealing and acton analysis show that the incentivisation of out of town retail be   the culprit labour have a point plan to revive our high street put community what be the government do about all this 
 i do not accept that although out- of town shopping can put pressure on the high street local authority have to be very careful when they give planning consent for out of town shopping centre that could put pressure on the high street that be clearly an important part of the planning process but it be not the responsibility of central government of course i would be interested to see that point plan but if it include the scrapping of business rate which raise £ i ask the labour front bench team once again i have yet to receive an answer where be that money come from 
 labour run leeds city council have decide that it want to bring parking charge to my market town of wetherby it currently have no parking charge do my hon friend agree that the investment we be make be all very well but if local authority make it hard for shopper by increase their cost that will choke off the high street rather than help it 
 i thank my right hon friend for his question and he be absolutely right to say that some local authority see parking charge as potential revenue raiser but this be in effect a tax on business local authority can of course make charge where appropriate but they should only cover the cost of maintain those car park they should not be a punitive tax on business 
 there be street in the west end of this city important to our economy that would certainly benefit from the ability of tourist to reclaim vat be n’t there 
 my right hon friend raise an important point that this department have look at carefully we be concerned about the impact of the withdrawal of that tax concession on business not just for these business themselves but for the other business that rely on foreign visitor i be talk about hotelier restauranteur and so on we be keen to look at this matter the chancellor commit in his autumn statement to review the evidence to see what impact this be have we will look at that with great interest and make our view know strongly to the exchequer 
 what step she be take to help small and medium sized business to export 
 what step she be take to help small and medium sized business to export 
 the government ’s export support for sme include the export support service the export academy more than export champion our network of nearly trade adviser and support provide around   the world through the international market service just last week my noble friend the minister with responsibility for export announce that uk export finance be introduce more flexible fast track financing for sme make it easy than ever for uk firm to sell into international market 
 last week i welcome the duke of gloucester to my constituency to award local sme garadry the king ’s award for enterprise for its innovation in international trade how can such business have confidence in the government ’s support for sme when britain ’s export growth be among the bad of the g7 economy and be forecast to be fall 
 i certainly welcome the royal visit that the hon lady have in her constituency it be always fantastic to see that support particularly for exporter however i think she be a bit off on the datum when we look at export datum we see that we have £ worth of export in the month to the end of september we be head towards the £ export target and that figure be up by almost £ or 29%—on the figure from year ago which be before brexit 
 in the government launch a rebrande trade show programme pilot to great fanfare but between november and march only business in the uk be fund under the programme we now hear that the scheme have be shelve will the minister explain what have happen to that initiative which have launch a number of household british fashion brand abroad and which serve as a vital gateway under the last labour government for sme to access new market 
 the last labour government be of course in office rather a long time ago it be not always incumbent on successive government more than a decade later to keep previous labour government scheme go the scheme to which the hon gentleman refer be a pilot which do not yield the success that we might have hop however i will take no criticism from he and the labour party for the support we be give to exporter we be spend £ over this spending review period to support sme to grow and succeed internationally and we have a record to be commend 
 as the prime minister ’s trade envoy to kenya may i welcome the fact that this week the government hold the successful global investment summit and be take step to help british business to export i recently return from nairobi where i visit some of the uk ’s flagship investment include in infrastructure and clean energy will the minister provide an update on the africa investment summit next year i also ask that the uk continue to bang the drum for british business to export to kenya the gateway to east africa 
 let i commend my hon friend for win speech of the year at last night ’s the spectator parliamentary award she have continue her fine form today she do an amazing job for the country as the prime minister ’s trade envoy to kenya   and her recent visit in september be a big success particularly on the infrastructure side of thing she have already refer to railway and other infrastructure she mention the uk africa investment summit which will take place in london next year and will further our engagement with kenya and other african country foster modern partnership in trade and investment in area such as resilient infrastructure clean technology and renewable energy 
 i welcome my right hon friend back to his post i pay tribute to he and to the secretary of state for the international trade deal that they have strike during their period in office the uk have strategic relationship with a number of gulf nation what progress be be make on a free trade agreement with the gulf cooperation council if it be more challenging to strike a deal across all nation what bilateral trade agreement can we explore in order to exploit the opportunity for those nation to invest significantly in the uk 
 i be excite by the prospect of the deal with the gulf cooperation council with which the secretary of state be very much engage and i be look forward to be re engage with it it be a huge opportunity for we as the late figure show that total trade between the uk and the gulf be worth more than £ we be look forward to move the negotiation forward and get a very good deal for the uk 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the minister back to the department for business and trade and i look forward to help he hopefully to do well this time around accord to the international monetary fund over the past decade british food and drink export include from sme rise by just which be the low growth of any g7 country the us canada italy and japan all see their export grow by between and government ministers will not negotiate a veterinary agreement with the eu which would help they have cut funding for trade mission and now the secretary of state have cut funding to go to trade show too why will ministers not share our ambition for britain to have the fast export growth rate of any g7 country 
 of course the hon gentleman and i have be around in these job for a while he be possibly the last trade minister under the last labour government so i will not be take any lecture from he on how to improve uk export we have be finance dozen of global trade mission and we be spend £ over the spending review period on export in general on the export figure he neglect to mention service export which total £ in the month to september that be a huge increase of on our performance in before brexit 
 what assessment she have make with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of retail crime on high street business 
 the government be clear that violent and abusive behaviour towards any public face worker be never acceptable and we recognise the implication that such incident can have on business as well as victim on   october the government launch a retail crime action plan which include a commitment to prioritise police attendance at the scene where violence have be use towards shop staff where an offender have be detain by store security or where evidence need to be secure by police personnel the government also launch project pegasus a unique private public partnership that will radically improve the way retailer be able to share intelligence with the police 
 in recent week i like many colleague have visit shop in my constituency as part of usdaw’s the union of shop distributive and allied workers freedom from fear campaign i have hear from staff about the daily level of verbal and sometimes physical abuse they face and the huge loss from theft will the minister say more about what the government be do to stem that tide of lawlessness particularly for independent retailer who may not be part of the pegasus project will she also say how much be be lose to theft because that cost all of we as customer as well as cost retailer 
 the hon gentleman make an important point this be not a victimless crime it impact shop worker and customer credit be due to the hon gentleman for visit the shop in his constituency overall crime be down by since and down by since last year however he be right that shoplifting be up which be why the action plan be so important the action plan work for our high street because it be about ensure that the police be determined to collect evidence and to go after repeat offender and organise gang 
 project pegasus be key because it be a public private partnership we have create an extra offence with a long sentence for those who be violent towards a shop worker with those extra programme of work and evidence collection more people will be convict so those who be involve in crime against shop will spend some time in prison 
 if she will make a comparative assessment of the adequacy of the number of statutory duty of the competition and markets authority and other regulator report to her department 
 the cma have a primary statutory duty to promote competition both inside and outside the uk for the benefit of consumer which provide the cma with a clear strong focus on deliver for consumer in our recent steer to the cma we do point out how very important it be that it focus also on economic growth 
 regulator such as the cma have huge power so parliament must give clear instruction about how those power should and should not be use do the minister agree that the cma ’s instruction be a   model of the kind of clear and strong legal duty that leave no doubt in regulator mind about the job that parliament have ask they to do will he join i in push for equally clear and focused duty for other economic regulator where sadly the same can not currently be say 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for his very important work in this area i know that reduce the regulatory burden be a cause that be very close to his heart and to the heart of those in the chamber today who support his amendment in the recent digital markets competition and consumers bill that view be also share by myself and by the secretary of state we be very keen to make sure that as well as ensure that sector be well regulate our economic regulator focus on competition and economic growth 
 i disagree the competition and markets authority be not only the dog that do not bark but the dog that do not bite we see multinational corporation and investment fund of such a size that they have more power than a sovereign government when will the government give the cma the power and authority need to tackle the corporate monopoly and cartel that have so much sway over our life 
 the hon member raise an important matter that be why the government be legislate in this space through the digital markets competition and consumers bill which give the cma huge new power particularly over some of our large online platform platform that have what we describe as strategic market status this be world lead legislation that will tackle many of the example of detriment that he will be aware of and that he raise in his question today 
 what step she be take to maintain access to high street postal service 
 the government protect the post office branch network by set access criterion and minimum service level to be provide by branch across the country more post office have open this year than have close the network be as large today as it have be for year with around branch open above the target that we set for the post office 
 the minister mention that more post office be open actually they be close the clapham common post office in my vauxhall constituency have be earmark for closure and there be no current plan to replace it i be fight this closure along with my hon friend   the member for streatham bell ribeiro addy   and local ward councillor in the communications workers union this be a pattern that we be see across the country it have be identify that postal shopfront have close across the country in the past year with those closure we be see elderly and   vulnerable people people who need their post office on the high street have to travel far will the minister tell i what more he and the government be do to protect these vital service 
 the hon member be absolutely right to raise this issue the post office have launch a public consultation regard the clapham common post office the post office maintain that local will continue to have good access to service there be a post office within a mile of the clapham road branch and further branch within mile nevertheless the government support the post office network with a significant amount of financial support—£2.5 over the past year so we do continue to support post office we know how important they be to constituent and other colleague in this house i be very happy to meet she to discuss this particular case 
 what her plan timetable be for the ratification of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership 
 we be work at pace to ratify the cptpp which we hope to bring into force next year we be the european country to join the cptpp and i know how powerful it will be for british business and consumer which be why this government be progress legislation as quickly as possible with reading of the bill have take place in the other place on   november we be already play our part as the large economy in the agreement the secretary of state meet other cptpp minister week ago in san francisco to discuss the blossoming future of the agreement 
 across the house over a period of time member work with organisation such as the trade justice movement have express concern about the inclusion of investor state dispute settlement procedure within treaty because they restrict our own country ’s ability to regulate i raise that issue in september and suggest that as the government have do with australia and new zealand we agree in a separate letter that the settlement procedure will not be include in this treaty i be then tell rather curtly that it be too late actually it be not too late there be the potential to do a side letter as we have with other country to exclude an investor state dispute settlement procedure in the light of the government ’s negotiating remit for the free trade agreement with canada the government be specifically seek to exclude that procedure i wonder whether the government might think again 
 it be good to be spar with the right hon gentleman again from the dispatch box we have both have a few up and down since we last go head to head cptpp do not compromise the uk ’s right to regulate at all it expressly preserve the right of state to regulate proportionately fairly and in the public interest it be worth remind the house that the uk have never lose an isds case such procedure actually help to protect uk investment abroad british   investment in canada total £ in which will be cover for the time by these protection as i say if we can not trust canada in international affair who can we trust i assure the right hon gentleman that the deal can not be ratify until the legislation have be approve by parliament and the deal have complete the constitutional reform and governance act process 
 what step she be take to help increase the number of business that export 
 the government ’s publish export strategy focus on address the challenge that uk business face when export the government continue to promote exporting and to support company through our network of international trade adviser sector specialist and the export support service all our service can be access on great.gov.uk 
 in my constituency i have company such as eyeol lindal valve peli biothermal friction marketing signature flatbread and small business all of which export globally the small business export through amazon that be fantastic as there be evidence that business that export can pay their staff more but what be the good way to get business that have not yet realise that the world be their marketplace export not just to europe but around the whole world 
 i commend my hon friend for be a long stand champion of his constituency exporter as the prime minister ’s trade envoy to south africa and mauritius he know only too well the importance of export the government ’s export strategy be clear we have a clear programme to assist small and medium sized enterprise particularly time exporter all of our service can be access via great.gov.uk and we have a network of international trade adviser locally for bedfordshire who be able to help as well 
 what step she be take to help support business in essex to export 
 as a fellow essex mp i can assure my right hon friend that this matter be close to my heart business can access support through great.gov.uk include our self serve digital offer the export support service international trade adviser and uk export finance my department be help essex company such as icon lifesaver in colchester to secure potential sale of over £ in the us colombia and estonia kestrel liner agencies which be headquarter in my constituency and last year receive its queen ’s award for international trade have also benefit we be focus on priority trade barrier in particular which could boost uk export by around £ over year 
 the secretary of state will know inside out what the wonderful county of essex have to offer when it come to business export we have company such as wilkin sons and wicks manor and many other producer who will sell the produce that household across the country will enjoy this christmas at home and abroad will the secretary of state highlight how she be work across government with other departments to reduce the barrier to export that cover for example produce manufacturing cost energy cost and even the processing of animal 
 remove barrier to trade be of this government ’s top priority my right hon friend will know many of the thing that the government have be do include subsidise energy bill because we recognise the difficulty that manufacturer and processing plant face at the moment i be particularly focus on resolve trade barrier we have resolve trade barrier worth more than £ to business include those in essex over the next year food producer in her constituency specifically will be pleased to know that just last month when i be in japan for the g7 we resolve a barrier restrict export of cooked poultry from the uk to japan which i think will provide a festive boost to uk exporter worth an estimate £ over year 
 whether she have make an assessment of the potential merit of revoke arm export licence to israel 
 whether she have make an assessment of the potential merit of revoke arm export license to israel 
 since the barbaric terrorist act by hamas against israel on   october   and the subsequent conflict in the region the government have be monitor the situation very closely the uk support israel ’s legitimate right to defend itself and take action against terrorism provide that that be within the bound of international humanitarian law export licence be keep under careful and continual review as standard and we be able to amend licence or refuse new licence application if they be inconsistent with the strategic export licensing criterion 
 no be suggest that israel do not have the right to defend itself but as the secretary of state say and we agree within the bound of international law the mass killing of civilian in gaza should concern we all without resort to platitude about the relative toughness of the uk ’s arm export control could she please identify which arm export licence be currently in force include open licence for end use by the israeli defence and security force and provide detail of they to the house 
 i do not believe that be something that i be able to do or should do i can tell the hon and learn lady that last year we grant standard individual export licence for military good value at   £ to israel if there be a specific issue that she would like to highlight we be prepared to look at it but she will know that security and defence export be not necessarily well discuss on the floor of the house or in public for obvious reason 
 a state that supply military equipment that be use in the commission of violation of international humanitarian law be at risk of complicity in a humanitarian catastrophe in continue with those licence and supply uk arm to israel what assessment do the secretary of state make of the potential for uk government complicity if israel be find to have commit war crime in gaza by the ongoing international criminal court investigation 
 i be quite surprised that there be not a word of condemnation and the implication that the uk be complicit be really not the sort of thing we would expect from a british member of parliament in this house i completely disagree with the premise of the hon gentleman ’s question the government take our defence export responsibility extremely seriously and operate some of the most robust and transparent export control in the world 
 what recent progress she have make on negotiate a trade deal with india 
 i be pleased to confirm that advanced talk with india be ongoing we be in round with discussion currently focus on good market access service and investment we remain clear that we will not sign until we have a free trade agreement that fully benefit the uk people and economy we be focus on the deal not the date 
 total trade in good and service between the uk and india be £ in the year to march an fta with the large economy in the world and of the fast grow would be a massive boost to the uk economy and put uk business at the front of the queue to supply india ’s grow middle class which be expect to be a quarter of a consumer by this be an important exploitation of brexit so will the minister do all he can to bring this deal over the line as soon as possible for britain 
 my right hon friend of course have a lot of experience in complex negotiation and i can say that we like he will not be satisfied until we have the right deal he be right that a deal with india would be a big step forward in the uk ’s post brexit strategy to refocus uk trade on the indo pacific region which represent of global gdp my negotiator and i continue to work at pace and we will negotiate until we have secure the right deal i warmly welcome his interest in do more trade with india 
 what step she be take to help support the steel industry 
 the government recognise the vital role of the steel sector and be work with the sector to achieve a sustainable future we have announce £ of support towards a joint £ investment with tata steel to achieve the transformation of port talbot and we be also in talk with british steel we have provide the steel sector with £ in energy cost relief since and announce the british industry supercharger decisive measure to reduce energy cost for energy intensive industry 
 in community across the country particularly in wales through port talbot steel have create high pay productive job for generation but we be the only g7 country with a steel industry in decline thousand of job be be lose what we need be a long term plan that support steelworker and their community to maintain those good job into the future and transition to net so why be the minister make short term decision instead of deliver on the long term industrial strategy that community such as mine and our steel industry and worker desperately need 
 that be just not correct especially the comparison to the g7 the decision over port talbot have be hang around for quite some time and we be able to work with tata steel to ensure that job be confirm long into the future tata steel employ more than people and that be under serious threat until the investment be secure now consultation be take place with the union and the reality be as the medium have note that the union themselves be not sure how they want to take this forward we be absolutely sure that we want steelmaking in that area and that job should be secure that be why we offer the support that we do 
 i have write again to the secretary of state to seek specific confirmation of the government ’s position on a virgin steelmaking sovereign capability in this country will she ensure that that specific question be address when i receive a response 
 my hon friend be and foremost an advocate for the steelwork and steelworker in her constituency obviously that letter will be on its way and i thank she so much for raise it 
 we be use to this government flip flopping all over the place it would be funny if it be not so serious for business export and job so when we hear the treasury tell everyone who would listen that the government ’s response to the carbon border adjustment mechanism would be in the autumn statement we be not surprised that it be not the future of steel investment and growth rely on a clear and certain path from government we can not have our business disadvantage any more so what be the decision on the cbam if this government can not decide be it not time to make way for who can 
 decision have to be take while respond to the consultation that take place we have be absolutely determined to ensure that steelmaking will remain competitive in the uk which be why we have   be able to support the steel sector with high energy cost and put over £ in place to deal with decarbonisation technology when it come to tata the support we have pledge involve an investment of over £ to ensure that job remain secure in the future and negotiation continue with british steel as well that be the support that we have provide and will continue to provide for steel in the uk 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 this week i host more than global ceo and investor at the uk global investment summit which be an extraordinary success the prime minister set a £ target to beat and we triple it secure £ of investment and more than job the success of the gis be a vote of confidence in the uk my department ’s work support by the £ business tax cut in the autumn statement be secure our country as a world lead business and investment destination 
 many people be aware of the incredible story of the redcar steelwork site be reborn as teesworks create job and unlock £ in private investment few people be aware that stockton ’s very own freeport business park be be build at the airport do my right hon friend agree that teesside as the home of the uk ’s and big freeport offer a unique opportunity to those invest in the industry of the future 
 i do agree and my hon friend be quite right to praise the progress that have be make on deliver teesside freeport the freeport have already be successful in secure several landmark investment include from seah wind which be invest £ in build an offshore wind manufacturing facility that will create around high skilled job and build on the measure announce in the autumn statement last week to far strengthen the offer of uk freeport my department will continue to work with freeport in teesside and elsewhere on secure high value investment 
 this be the department in charge of growth investment and export in the late figure follow the autumn statement growth have be downgrade business investment be still forecast to be the low in the g7 and good export have decline both to the eu and to non eu country give that there be so many amazing business and sector in the uk how do the government account for their poor performance 
 i will not allow the hon gentleman to spin his way out of what be actually a very good news story for the government the fact be that the uk have overtake france to become the world ’s large manufacturing nation we be the world ’s large exporter we be grow fast than germany and france and have receive more investment than they combine we be the top investment destination certainly   for financial service we be do well perhaps this be the moment for i to tell he what business tell i at the global investment summit that they be unimpressed by the labour shadow ministers they have meet that their offer be unimaginative and that they be repetitive and have no vision for the future of business in the uk

 i want to ask the secretary of state about late payment in the year that the government have spend consult on late payment business have go under while wait to be pay why do the government ’s new plan on late payment apply only to firm contract with the government why do they not rather follow our proposal to make sure that all public company disclose their payment practice 
 i have be work with the federation of small businesses and other on late payment the hon gentleman will have hear the measure announce in the autumn statement this be an issue that the government take very seriously i disagree that we be implement our plan in a partial way we will resolve this issue but i be afraid that i completely disagree with the opposition have do quite a lot on this and many business have praise the measure that we announce in the autumn statement

 we be ready to have a free trade agreement with the us but it be not undertake free trade agreement with any country that is of course disappointing but it know that we stand ready that be why we have the state mou programme the late figure show that uk us trade have reach £ we be the big investor in florida i be pleased to meet governor desantis early this month and i also meet the california governor gavin newsom who want to be even fast in sign an mou with the uk they believe that this country have a lot of opportunity and they want to do business with we 
 import tariff on egg product allow we to recognise the high cost of uk egg production because of safety welfare and environmental consideration can the secretary of state give an assurance that egg and egg product will be afford sensitive product status by the uk in future free trade agreement negotiation and that import tariff will remain in place on those product 
 it be difficult to comment on tariff in live negotiation but i would say thing to the hon gentleman this country import very few egg from abroad and secondly anything that happen   with import egg would not change our standard on food import food safety and animal welfare in this country

 as the prime minister ’s trade envoy to brazil i know that the good way of support export from my dudley business be to remove barrier to trade that be why i be absolutely delighted when both our country sign a double taxation agreement in good faith and to the high possible standard there appear to be complication in brazil at the moment with ratify that agreement through congress as we have ratify it through our parliament what more can minister the chancellor of the exchequer perhaps do to try to persuade brazil that it be indeed a very good deal for itself as well

 so it be another week and another business statement yet still no emergency legislation on rwanda as promise it have be another week of infighting division and chaos on illegal and manage migration from the conservative party apparently some in the cabinet i do not know whether the leader of the house be of they be hold that legislation back while other clamour for it with the minister for immigration go rogue the prime minister be strand between they too weak to face down either side and too weak to act week after it be promise in day when will we finally see the treaty and legislation 
 as well as a treaty to negotiate we have the ongoing situation between israel and gaza i welcome the further extension in the temporary truce this morning war still rag in ukraine a diplomatic row with greece visit to kyiv and the middle east a nato summit cop28 this week and a visit to brussels next week yet not a peep from the foreign secretary in this house and no reporting back to member when i last raise this issue with the leader of the house she say that the house must be able to hold he to account when i welcome the procedure committee look into the matter but the government could and should do more to ensure that we be able to raise issue directly and regularly now we have have no foreign commonwealth and development office statement this week or last only an urgent question yet again the government be be drag here instead of respect the house of commons and it be just not good enough the next question to the foreign office will be on   tuesday december will the leader of the house ensure that some progress on hold the foreign secretary to account be make before then 
 it be not just foreign policy decision that member be keen to ask lord cameron about question about his dealing with greensill capital continue to rumble on thank to diligent work by my deputy my hon   friend   the member for blaenau gwent nick smith the insolvency service have be ask whether lord cameron could be consider a shadow director of greensill if that be the case he could be subject to the same duty and liability as a director his tax affair from the time be now under scrutiny for fail to provide detail of his personal use of plane own by greensill capital my hon friend have write to the chair of the treasury committee to ask she to consider whether lord cameron ’s failure to declare that information to the committee be potentially in contempt of the house will the leader of the house encourage the chair of the committee to investigate that will she also ensure that lord cameron do not wriggle out of frequent appearance in front of the foreign affairs committee 
 it be not just his lordship who be dodge scrutiny because that be the government ’s try and test tactic on every front day by day they be erode the convention of this place with their cavalier approach to scrutiny and good government on monday members debate minimum service level regulation for rail without the opinion of the government ’s own independent assessor because they do not give they enough time to look at they yesterday we have report stage of the data protection and digital information bill and the government table new amendment some really substantial at the last minute it be outrageous 
 even the former leader of the house   the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg not someone i often agree with think that the government take a dictatorial approach to new legislation it have also emerge that the government ’s leasehold and freehold reform bill not only will not apply to new flat but now will not even apply to the sale of new house we have a flagship bill to ban lease- hold that do not even ban leasehold what a shamble this be child ’s play and no way to run a government 
 finally this week see some serious question about what can only be describe as the possible bribery of sit member   the hon member for ashfield lee anderson   be record reveal that he have be offer a lot of money to join the reform party the offer be year of an mp ’s salary as insurance for defect these allegation be incredibly serious and tantamount to bribery from a rival political party potentially in breach of electoral law it have subsequently emerge that the government chief whip be make aware of these enticement be offer month ago and believe they to be serious and potentially criminal have these matter now be pass to the police if so when if not why not why have it take a secret recording to bring these very serious matter which go to the heart of our democracy to the attention of this house 
 may i wish everyone a happy st andrew ’s day i be sure i speak for the whole house when i say that our thought be still with the hostage who be still in gaza and their family we hope that situation can be resolve quickly 
 the hon lady raise the issue of the foreign secretary be answerable to this house she will know that a senior foreign office minister be available to lead on matter and on very serious issue the prime minister would speak from this dispatch box the foreign secretary have be forward lean and suggest a number of thing that he think would be highly appropriate   for how he could be hold to account in this place and directly by member of this house no decision have be take yet because we be wait to hear from the procedure committee it be right that matter for this house be deal with by the committees of this house 
 the foreign secretary have be forward lean i know that many member have be concern in particular about liaison with member of this house who have hostage family live in their constituency whether they be british national or have a connection to britain the foreign secretary be meet and have offer to meet all such family and he be in touch with hon member who be in that situation when the procedure committee bring forward measure it be always sensible in its deliberation i be sure those measure will be put in place 
 the hon lady criticise we for not allow scrutiny of legislation her point might have have more traction if in yesterday ’s sit we have not finish an hour early part of the reason for that be that only opposition back bencher speak in the debate i think we be have vote when report should have be conclude 
 the hon lady talk about the leasehold and freehold reform bill she will know that bills can be amend during their passage through the house and we have commit to include a ban on new leasehold house during the bill ’s passage despite what have be report that commitment have not change 
 the hon lady talk about migration and emergency legislation and i will put that in context it be slightly ironic that labour be eagerly await further legislation from we on these matter when labour member have oppose all the new power that we have bring in to protect our border they fight against we in end free movement and deport foreign criminal they would wish to take an extra people every year from europe and labour in wales be give asylum seeker £ a month the legislation will be bring forward shortly but i be not hold my breath on the opposition support it further business will be announce in the usual way 
 i call the father of the house 
 i welcome the news that the leasehold and freehold reform bill which will bring in modern housing term will have its reading in a week or so through my right hon friend may i say to the government that even if we have to add thing to the bill as it go along that be well than have to wait another year for this overdue opportunity to reform effectively the scandalous abuse within leasehold which be load so much against home occupier the tenant of leasehold home 
 i draw my right hon friend ’s attention to the name day question i table for the foreign office about the acid attack on shahzad akbar on sunday in england if minister think it be appropriate to make an oral statement will she please encourage they to do so it be just as shocking to have a commonwealth country suspect of an acid attack on of its national a human right lawyer in this country as it be to have the russian attack in salisbury and the alleged indian attack in canada 
 may i ask my right hon friend to draw to the home secretary ’s attention the letter he will have receive today from the human right lawyer clive stafford smith ask whether the police force in the relevant area be right to assess the risk to this man as low when in fact it be high and whether be it true that the local police have switch off the automatic number plate recognition system for some reason when that might have help to detect the culprit of this terrible acid attack 
 i thank my hon friend for his warm welcome for the leasehold and freehold reform bill i will certainly ensure that the home secretary be aware of his concern with regard to that police force he will know that the next foreign office question be on   december but i will certainly ensure that both the foreign secretary and his lead minister in the commons be aware of his concern about that terrible attack 
 i be sure that the heart of all of we in the house go out to those innocent who have suffer in gaza and israel and who continue to suffer 
 i too wish the house a very happy st andrew ’s day to you mr deputy speaker and to we all on this special day i have a word of thank the leader of the house have describe i in this chamber and on social medium as sanctimonious delusional treacherous and slopey shoulder i can not say how much that language from a tory be a badge of honour for i in scotland so i be grateful even more her comment last week about scotland ’s drug policy be literally front page news the daily record describe they as an odd rant of the more positive response correspondent ask 
 why do penny hate scotland so much be she scared by the bagpipe as a child 
 we certainly look forward to her reply to that 
 i be afraid that that answer from the leader of the house illustrate comprehensively the attitude and contempt on the government side of the house for the people of scotland maybe she need to refresh her government ’s grow army of scriptwriter in edinburgh pay for of course by taxpayer money no more fat- free out of date trumpian rant please 
 the leader of the house have claim that she take an interest in the welfare of scotland ’s child so obviously she will have see the remarkable new assessment of the scottish child payment post on the london school of economics website by a number of academic expert in social policy and economic it say that the scottish government ’s payment be 
 predict to have a monumental impact on reduce child poverty rate 
 and that they will 
 transform scotland from be of the most unequal place to live in europe to be of the most equal 
 i feel that this house should be give an opportunity to debate it as child poverty in england rocket give her stated interest will she please confirm that she have read that assessment if not would she like i to send she a copy or maybe it be really all about clickbait and social medium reach and she do not care at all 
 let i add some more adjective to what the hon lady describe the snp really have surpass itself this week in be self obsess self pitying and self delusional i have hit on why it be lose the case for independence if scotland be to take the leap surely it would want its leader to be the sort of people to step up take responsibility and work hard to improve their opportunity but despite the scottish government be of the most powerful devolve administrations in the world they can not accept responsibility for anything 
 give that the snp have be in power for year and in every single year its budget have be high than in england who do the hon lady think be responsible for scotland ’s decline a&e performance increase waiting time hike in drug relate death and increase in the attainment gap what about the year that the scottish government have miss their cancer and housing target the rise crime the soar violence in school the low police number since or the few teacher who do she think be responsible for the fact that some police force do not even investigate certain offence and be warn that soon they will not be able to attend call out 
 who do the hon lady think be responsible for plummet international ranking in math literacy and science who do she think have snaffle more than half the £ in extra tax that scottish resident have to pay which never reach public service she talk about scottish schoolchildren but who have choose to pay so much less to scottish school per pupil than anywhere else in the uk the autumn statement have give the scottish government an additional £ we be about to hear their budget and it be a pretty safe bet that it will not be spend wisely by all mean the hon lady can send i what she like but there be a trend here scottish snp supporter will soon be outnumber by the panda in her local zoo 
 i want to raise the brilliance of the fromehall mill team and to encourage everyone to look at the stroud times article and video as they try to raise share support to buy the mill it be a multi business powerhouse with everything from bike and bakery to artificial intelligence and social action will my right hon friend tell the house when the next round of community ownership fund bid will be announce can we have a debate in the house about small company around the country that be use sell and teach ai technology because they be do an incredible job

 in every of our constituency across the whole of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we have girlguide group which we greatly support as they do wonderful work with girl of all age it be therefore with much concern that i ask the leader of the house very kindly whether we may have a debate in government time on the floor of the house on the propose devastating decision by girlguiding uk to sell off its uk activity centre and to stop direct delivery of girlguide in british overseas territory and on uk military basis it will have a catastrophic impact not just here but across the sea on young woman in the british family which we all want to preserve and retain 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his early question this week i think that would be an excellent topic for a backbench business debate many member be agree with he as he outline the issue i know that of the problem be that the guide community do not feel that it be properly consult in advance of the decision be take and i know that many right hon and hon member have write to the board to question it i think an airing on the floor of the house or in westminster hall would be welcome 
 i know my right hon friend be as shocked as i be by some of the work practice of sse in provide power to commercial premise my constituent philip liddell of ace liftaway have pay £ on deposit to sse but because of sse ’s delay with sse ’s solicitor it have now ask he for an additional £ to move an electricity substation on his commercial premise an increase of mr liddell do not cause the delay but he have no choice but to pay up will my right hon friend find time for a debate in this chamber to discuss sse ’s working practice and how it be hold people to ransom
