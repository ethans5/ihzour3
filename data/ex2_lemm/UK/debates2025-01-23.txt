 i welcome the hon gentleman to his place if he want to know what the target be i suggest that he read the plan for change they be set out very carefully in it on the list of process i say that we be focus on outcome that be why today we have announce reform of the judicial review process to stop repeat and often lengthy and hugely expensive action that delay important investment project that be in the national interest i would have think that he would have welcome that

 last year the national cyber security centre locate in the constituency of my hon friend   the member for cheltenham max wilkinson say that the government be almost certain    that russian actor have attempt to interfere in the general election we be clearly in a new era of politic trust in politic be at an all time low disinformation be on the rise and follow instance across the world of foreign interference in election it be essential that the government make a plan to address this threat to democracy it be vital that we take all possible step to restore faith in politic to strengthen our political system boost political engagement at home and protect our national democracy from external influence what step be the secretary of state take to safeguard the democratic process of the united kingdom from foreign interference 
 the liberal democrat spokesperson make some strong point we have to take the protection of our democratic system and process seriously i outline russian activity in my speech to the nato cyber security conference a couple of month ago we have to guard against it here and help other country guard against it too my right hon friend the secretary of state for defence make very clear yesterday what we think of russian interference in our water and the same apply in the cyber sphere 
 what step he be take to improve relation with the eu 
 what step he be take to improve relation with the eu 
 what step he be take to improve relation with the eu 
 the prime minister and the president of the european commission have agree to strengthen the relationship between the eu and the uk put it on a more solid stable footing i be take forward discussion with my eu counterpart commissioner maroš šefčovič in week time the prime minister will attend a summit with fellow european leader on european defence 
 do the minister agree that the art musician and the wide creative sector play a vital role in our economy which be why work to negotiate a deal with touring artist be so important will the minister confirm that this be still a priority for he 
 my hon friend make a good point and i can confirm that our priority remain ensure that uk artist can continue to perform and promote themselves around the world that be why the department for culture media and sport be work collaboratively with the creative sector and across government to address key issue for our brilliant artist and their support staff tour the eu as we set out in our manifesto we will work with the eu and member state to explore how good to improve those arrangement but without see a return to freedom of movement 
 i be frequently contact by business in my constituency who be deeply concerned about the trade barrier put up by the previous government that be damage growth in the north east may i urge my right hon friend in the strong possible term to prioritise pragmatism in our relation with the eu and to ensure that business in my part of the country can get the support they need and export the good they manufacture 
 my hon friend raise a good point of course we set out in our manifesto that we would not return to the single market to the custom union or to freedom of movement within that framework we absolutely take a pragmatic approach put the national interest to tear down trade barrier wherever we can 
 the end of this month will mark the anniversary of brexit will the minister assure i that we will not return to the appalling division of the past and do he agree that the forthcoming summit and reset negotiation be a vital opportunity to discuss growth not just for the diverse community and business in my constituency but for our nation 
 my hon friend be absolutely right this be a time to look to the future not to go back to the division of the past the forthcoming eu uk summit present significant opportunity to make people in the uk and the eu more secure safe and more prosperous 
 for more than year the european union have be in breach of its international treaty obligation to join the european convention on human right what be the government do to address the arrogance of the european union on that issue 
 i would say that the government be commit to our membership of the european convention on human right and secondly that the hon gentleman talk about body and organisation not be compliant with international treaty but of the big problem with the previous government be how they sign international treaty and then seek to condemn they when they themselves have put pen to paper 
 maroš šefčovič be today dangle the prospect of the uk join the pan euro mediterranean convention of course the quiet part be that that would once again turn this country into rule taker not rule maker ahead   of the summit can the paymaster general rule out   the prospect of the uk fall in line with so call dynamic alignment in other word take eu rule and regulation and will we instead strike out in the   world and do new deal with america and around the pacific rim 
 i do not accept the binary choice that the hon gentleman present we want to increase trade and export all around the world that be hugely important as the prime minister say we do not choose between ally we look to deepen all our relationship of course we welcome the positive and constructive tone from commissioner šefčovič we be always look for way to reduce barrier to trade but   within our manifesto red line because we take a pragmatic view on where the national interest lie we do not currently have any plan to join pem and we will not provide a running commentary on every comment that be make 
 i call the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster 
 yesterday in davos mr šefčovič suggest that the uk and the eu be talk about dynamic alignment as the paymaster general will be aware that be if true a very significant step will he be clear with the house be dynamic alignment on the table 
 i have to give the hon gentleman top mark for audacity i do not know whether conservative mp have hear but a week ago the leader of the opposition give her new year speech and as i be sure they know we listen to it extremely carefully do they know what she say about previous eu uk negotiation she say that the conservative government be engage in they 
 before we have a plan for growth outside the eu these mistake be make because we tell people what they want to hear and then try to work it out later 
 why do n’t the 
 order i think we be in danger—[interruption i be not go to sit down minister interruption thank you we have a lot of question to get through if you want to make a statement on that in future i would welcome it 
 i would welcome that too mr speaker because the right hon gentleman be not answer my question just as he do not answer the question of my hon friend   the member for dumfries and galloway john cooper and just as his department be not answer question of any hue at the moment as my hon friend   the member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood   make clear it come to something when mr šefčovič be a well guide to what be go on than the british government if the government be commit to dynamic alignment that be a significant step as the right hon gentleman will know because it could bring the european court of justice back into have jurisdiction over the united kingdom so for the avoidance of doubt will he rule out the ecj have jurisdiction over the uk in any regard in the future 
 i be astonish by the question because the hon gentleman be also the shadow northern ireland secretary and will know the role that the european court of justice play in the windsor framework turn to his question about the negotiation we have set out our red line in the manifesto and have set out example of thing that we be seek to negotiate that be already there 
 the leader of the opposition be apologise last week for the conduct of the conservative party in its relationship with the eu why be the hon gentleman not start with an apology or do he just not get the memo from his leader 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the wholly inadequate deal with the eu negotiate by the previous conservative government have do enormous damage to british business which have see soar import cost increase workforce shortage and ream of red tape create huge barrier to growth the return of a trump administration in washington change the landscape of trade deal globally with the threat of high tariff and will be deeply worry for many business across the country the uk must lead on the world stage again stand up for our interest by work closely with other country most importantly our european neighbour as set out by my right hon friend the leader of the liberal democrats in his new year ’s speech last week i urge the minister to be more ambitious in rebuild our relationship with europe do he agree that the good way to boost growth and fix our relationship with the eu be to agree a new uk eu custom union 
 i be grateful to the liberal democrat spokesperson for her question but as i indicate in an early answer we do not choose between ally we be look to deepen our trade link right around the world with different partner but the hon lady should be aware that we be ambitious on the uk eu relationship and we will take that ambition forward into the uk eu summit 
 what recent progress his department have make on reform of the house of lords 
 what recent progress his department have make on reform of the house of lords 
 as an immediate step in reform the government introduce the house of lords hereditary peers bill to remove the right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords that bill be unamended and pass in this house and will soon be in committee in the other place 
 i regularly meet talented hard work and intelligent young people across ossett and denby dale who often feel detached from politic how quickly can the government make progress on this legislation so that all young people have an equal chance to make the law and shape our future not just those bear   into privilege 
 my hon friend be absolutely right and we want to see this bill on the statute book by the end of this session the role of hereditary peer be completely indefensible in this day and age last year the bill be resoundingly approve by this house and it be currently go through the other place where it will soon be in committee it be a clear manifesto commitment by the labour party and i look forward to it be deliver 
 i thank the minister for his answer be the mp for leeds south west and morley be the great privilege i could ask for and constituency boundary ensure that all part of our country be   represent in this place the same be not true of the other place which be not representative of our nation and region what work be be do or consider to remedy that to ensure that all of our community be represent in the other place 
 as the member of parliament for the seat where i grow up i share my hon friend ’s passion for represent my area he will be aware of the government ’s manifesto commitment to reform the process of appointment to the house of lords so that it well reflect the country it serve and we will consult on proposal for an alternative chamber that be more representative of the nation and region 
 in the then shadow leader of the house rightly accuse boris johnson of abuse the honours system by appoint crony to the house of lords and promise that an incoming labour prime minister would never do such a thing now have lose her seat at the general election that former shadow leader of the house be of new labour peer wait to be appoint by the prime minister to sit in the house of lords could the minister explain how the labour party stuff the house of lords with its crony be any less of an affront to democracy than when the tories do it 
 i do not think the hon gentleman can seriously compare the appointment we have put forward with what happen under the conservative party we have already set out that each and every appointment will be accompany by a citation indicate the experience to be bring to the upper house and the people he refer to will make an excellent contribution there 
 what progress he have make on payment to infect and affect people under the infected blood compensation scheme 
 what recent progress he have make on establish the infected blood compensation scheme 
 what recent progress he have make on establish the infected blood compensation scheme 
 what step he be take to monitor compensation payment for people impact by infected blood 
 the infected blood compensation authority have make the compensation offer to people with a total value of more than £ the government have also pay over £ in interim compensation and in the budget we announce £ of funding for the scheme yesterday i visit the infected blood compensation authority office in newcastle and i be reassure to see the progress that be be make swiftly and compassionately 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his update to the house i note the press release that go out yesterday and no doubt there will be another on   march the day before the next cabinet office question however i want to be constructive in my approach i too will be visit the infected blood compensation authority in newcastle next thursday 
 the legal representative of the complex web of stakeholder in the infected blood and affected community remain concerned about the status of the arm ’s length body the appeal process and the role of victim in the oversight board i be absolutely clear that the infected blood compensation authority have the necessary authority and will work through those issue i urge the minister to work with and reassure the victim representative so that the lawyer can be more constructive in support these people along this difficult pathway no doubt hon member will come in with more question but do the minister agree with i that we need to move forward in a constructive manner 
 yes the right hon gentleman be absolutely right i look forward to the former paymaster general ’s reflection after his visit next week i be delighted yesterday to meet the user consultant victim infect affect who be certainly make their voice hear at the infected blood compensation authority that voice of victim be hugely important as be the constructive approach the right hon gentleman have indicate 
 i welcome the £ allocate in the budget for the infected blood scandal which be   a clear commitment from this government that they   be act on this injustice however parent and   partner of the infected include in my constituency of bournemouth west be rightly apprehensive about when they will receive compensation many be elderly or in poor health give the urgency of the situation can the minister outline when they might receive compensation and whether he will consider include they in the initial wave 
 in october application open for eligible estate to claim interim compensation payment of £ so far more than estate have receive payment i hope those payment be welcome as the beginning of recognition for those who have lose love one to this devastating scandal the delivery of compensation payment be rightly a matter for ibca which be an independent arm ’s length body chair by sir robert francis the government expect payment to eligible affected people to begin this year follow a set of regulation that i will be lay before parliament in the come week 
 i do not imagine there be mp in this house who have not have constituent come to talk to they about the infected blood scandal in fact this week i speak to such constituent linda cannon who tell i her story say 
 i lose my husband billy in february to hepatitis c after a blood transfusion in for a stomach ulcer at bangour hospital he be not inform till that he have be infect only find out after present with a sore back he undergo severe treatment without success which will live with i forever life have be difficult to deal with after this 
 the consequence have be completely devastating for her family mr cannon will not see justice but several of my other constituent must i welcome the urgency with which this government have move forward with this issue because justice for the victim of this injustice be long overdue can the minister update the house on how he have be work not just in england but across wales scotland and northern ireland to make sure that payment get to those who need they immediately 
 the whole house will be move by the story of my hon friend ’s constituent it be a story from this appalling scandal that many of we across the house will be hear from our constituent i be pleased that payment have be make to people who have wait far too long for compensation those payment be make by the end of as i commit to the house to do i also commit specifically to my hon friend to work closely with the devolved administration to ensure that victim across the united kingdom can achieve justice 
 the victim of the infected blood scandal include those from my constituency who attend treloar college in hampshire have be fight for justice for decade they have raise deep concern about the slow progress of compensation payment the infected blood compensation authority project that by the end of march just people will have be offer compensation will the government accelerate the roll out of the compensation scheme to ensure that victim see justice within their lifetime 
 i be restless for progress on the speed of payment and i will do everything in my gift as a minister to lay the regulation before this house speedily ibca be obviously operationally independent and i be have this discussion yesterday in newcastle the test and learn approach that it use which start with a representative sample of case will allow it to ramp up delivery when i be in newcastle yesterday i see a group of public servant work efficiently in a compassionate way to deliver 
 what step he be take to reduce the cost of ministerial travel 
 across all our work this government be determined to deliver well value for money for taxpayer that be why shortly after we come to office this government scrap the conservative party ’s vip helicopter service which be a grossly wasteful symbol of a government who be totally out of touch with the problem face the rest of the country under this government ministers must ensure that they always make efficient and cost effective travel arrangement which the government publish on gov.uk 
 the minister refer to helicopter travel and she have give her description of the previous government do she not accept that the government be use vip helicopter travel not through the ministry of defence budget but through the cabinet office   budget do that not make this government grossly hypocritical and be that not a symbol of how out of touch they be with the british public 
 under the last government the former prime minister would take helicopter for short journey at huge waste to the taxpayer the prime minister ’s ministerial travel under this government be always decide with consideration for the most efficient and good use of time and crucially in the interest of the taxpayer 
 whether he have have recent discussion with the fishing industry on the uk eu trade and co operation agreement 
 i engage with a range of stakeholder relevant to our relationship with the eu for example through the uk eu trade and co- operation agreement ’s domestic advisory group which i last meet in september and which include representative of the uk fishing industry the department for environment food and rural affairs be the responsible department and have ongoing dialogue with the industry i recently meet my hon friend the minister for food security and rural affairs to discuss fishery matter and i will meet representative of the scottish fishing industry in the very near future to discuss their interest in our fishery relationship with the eu under the trade and co operation agreement 
 i be delighted to hear that those meeting be schedule because the review of the tca be see by fishing industry around the uk as an opportunity to undo some of the damage that be do by boris johnson at the end of the brexit negotiation i meet the eu commission official who will be lead the eu side of the negotiation and it be clear that she be inform of their industry priority and have a plan for achieve they the eu see this as an important piece of work the minister can only do what need to be do if he be prepared to engage with and listen to the view of our fishing industry and community 
 i understand and recognise the strong interest in what happen in when the arrangement that be negotiate by the previous government end i say to the right hon gentleman that i will listen and engage we will protect the interest of our fishery and also fulfil our international commitment to protect the marine environment 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reform public service 
 as i set out in a speech last month modern government be about not just what the government want to do but reform of the state itself we want to see public service that revolve around the need of service user use new technology in the good way possible to   secure value for money and well outcome for our citizen we have launch a number of test and learn project with local authority area to get well result on difficult issue such as temporary accommodation just this week we announce that we will launch a new gov.uk app in june which will be a step change in fast and easy public access to government service 
 i thank the minister for those comment how will he ensure that tackle health inequality be bake into public service reform devolution agreement and local growth plan 
 at the heart of what we want to do be improve living standard outcome and opportunity for all of the consequence of the long waiting time and waiting list in the nhs in recent year be that it have be tough on those who simply can not afford to pay it be therefore in the interest of good health and equal access to put in the investment that be announce by the chancellor in the budget which be be take forward in the plan announce by my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care 
 the reform of public service and the reliance on artificial intelligence to deliver that lead the department for environment food and rural affairs to pilot the microsoft copilot program that pilot end after month yet it demonstrate transformative improvement in departmental efficiency and be particularly beneficial for disabled and neurodivergent staff will the minister confirm whether funding for that tool which have be suspend until could be release so that staff could benefit from its application 
 the hon gentleman be quite right to point out the advantage that can come from these thing i be reluctant to make specific announcement about funding for specific project however the government be determined not only to make the uk a good home for investment in ai which will be huge around the world in the come year but to make the good possible use of ai in the delivery of public service which we believe can get good value for money and well outcome for the public the road will not always be easy and there will be thing that go wrong but frankly with our tradition of creativity and innovation we want to grasp this technology and make the good use of it 
 what step he be take to reduce fraud in the public sector

 my hon friend as a local government leader during the pandemic will know how hard thing be for community sacrifice be make and people risk their life to keep the rest of we safe he will share my anger at those who use the national crisis to steal billion from the taxpayer we will take action on that where the last government fail the public authorities fraud error and recovery bill which be introduce yesterday will give the government tough new power to investigate and recover money steal from the public and will double the time we have to bring those fraudster to justice

 i welcome the conversation last week with my hon friend who talk i through the importance of small and medium sized enterprise to growth in truro and falmouth a lot of small business i have speak to say the same thing it can be too complex and slow to bid for government contract sometimes those contract come out too late and sometimes they can not get on the playing field we have listen very carefully to what my hon friend and other have to say on these issue and we will bring forward an npps that deliver for sme 
 i call the shadow minister 
 unbelievably the treasury committee have already raise concern about the office for value for money cite issue around its remit cost cross government duplication and more which could be express concisely as fear around the value for money of labour ’s new office for value for money do the minister agree with the financial market which do not believe this government ’s commitment to reform public procurement or to prudent financial management which be why they have add a reeves ratio to the uk government ’s debt cost taxpayer an extra £ a year 
 yesterday the national audit office publish a report on the almost £ gap in building maintenance that be the legacy that the last government leave we crumble building year of lose wage growth and stall productivity compare that with this government ’s record in just the past month £ investment at the uk investment summit and lead the way on artificial intelligence the international monetary fund upgrade our growth to the fast in europe the opposition might want to run down this country but we be determined to grow our economy

 quite properly this week the government have be talk about apply ai to improve efficiency and effectiveness across whitehall when a human civil servant let we say at his majesty ’s revenue and customs or the dwp make a mistake and be challenge they can explain their logic and how they come to the decision we know that the court always believe that computer be good and give the right answer but ai make mistake sometimes huge one because of the way it be program it can not explain how it get to the decision how will the government ensure that the appeal process continue to work and we do not have a high tech version of the post office scandal 
 the right hon gentleman raise an important issue the public inquiry into the horizon scandal show that blind faith in a computer system use in a court of law can lead to injustice i do believe in the possibility of ai but it be important to keep the human element at all time it will enhance human productivity but not replace it that be the way we should go

 week ago my constituency be hit by the bad snow in year leave vulnerable and old resident school and gp surgery block in by the snow i commend the barnsley council team who be out   hour a day day a week solid but because resource be stretch their gritter can cover only the council ’s primary and secondary road do the minister agree that much more should be do to improve national resilience in extreme and exceptional circumstance where snow be prolong by cold temperature by give local authority that cover rural area such as mine increase grit resource and access to snow plough 
 i thank my hon friend for the work she do to support constituent during the heavy snowfall and i thank barnsley council and other responder for their work this responsibility lie with local authority but i know that my colleague in the cabinet office the department for transport and the ministry of housing communities and local government be keen for authority to receive as much support as possible mhclg will be in close contact with local resilience forum to see what support they need 
 what progress have be make on improve engagement with those infect and affect by the contaminated blood scandal as the paymaster general be aware there have be a great deal of concern among those people and the organisation that represent they may i urge he to sit down with his opposite number in the department    of health and social care which be responsible for get aid to the organisation that support those people who be infect and affect because they be desperately in need of the resource 
 i will be carry out another round of engagement with victim next week as i say in answer to the former paymaster general   the right hon member for salisbury john glen the role of user consultant in the infected blood compensation authority be vital as well 
 there be still sadly victim of the contaminated blood scandal die on a weekly basis will my right hon friend say what be prevent the government from instruct ibca to issue core payment today to all live infect victim register with the exist support scheme 
 ibca be operationally independent but i expect the payment for the affected to be make before the end of this year i be restless for progress and will do all i can as a minister to drive this forward 
 public sector procurement be a fantastic way to drive productivity innovation and local value in public service but too often small business start up and voluntary service provider in newcastle tell i they have difficulty access public sector contract they do not have as many lawyer consultant or project manager as big business what step be the minister take to ensure well access to public sector contract 
 i have hear very similar thing from the small and medium sized enterprise i have be talk to around the country we be bring forward a new national procurement policy statement that will put sme right at the heart of government procurement policy 
 open end to end procurement datum could be a goldmine for mission drive government and as the competition and markets authority warn recently it could make bid rigging hard can the minister explain how we will grasp the opportunity of open end to end procurement datum 
 i have meet the cma about the critical issue of bid rigging and it be something the government be look into more broadly the procurement act and the new national procurement policy statement put transparency and openness at the heart of our strategy include a new online portal which will make it much easy to see upcoming bid 
 urgent question   to ask the chancellor of the exchequer what assessment she have make of the office for budget responsibility ’s supplementary forecast information release on the costing of change to agricultural and business property relief 
 at the autumn budget we take difficult decision on tax welfare and spending that be necessary to restore economic stability fix the public finance and support public service we have to do that to address the mess we inherit from the previous government which   the right hon member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins   will remember well have serve in that ill fat government we have take these decision in a way that make the tax system fair and more sustainable 
 the government be well target agricultural property relief and business property relief to make they fair these reform mean that despite the tough fiscal context the government be maintain very significant level of relief from inheritance tax beyond what be available to other 
 under the current system the benefit of the relief on business and agricultural asset be heavily skewed towards the wealthy estate accord to the late datum from his majesty ’s revenue and customs of agricultural property relief benefit the top of estate make claim that be just estate claim £ of relief it be a similar picture for business property relief with more than of it be claim by just of estate make claim which equate to estate claim £ in tax relief our reform mean that individual can access relief for the £ of combined business and agricultural asset and thereafter give the nil rate band this mean that a couple can pass on up to £ between they to a direct descendant inheritance tax free 
 yesterday the office for budget responsibility publish further detail on the data source and modelling use to estimate costing across a number of the tax measure announce at budget include the reform to agricultural property relief and business property relief the costing be the same as publish at budget and the approach to model the costing be typical and in line with other tax policy as the government have set out the reform mean that almost quarter of estate claim apr in include those that also claim bpr will not pay more inheritance tax this be a fair approach that protect farm while also fix the public service we all rely on 
 i call the shadow secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs 
 have inherit the fast grow economy in the g7 the chancellor ’s budget have lead to the high borrowing cost since the pandemic growth flatlining business confidence plummeting and job freeze who have labour choose to pay the price for its economic illiteracy pensioner family business and farmer for   month farmer farming business professional adviser and economist and now major supermarket have warn the chancellor that she have get her figure wrong but minister cleave desperately to their soundbite let we hope that they listen to the obr 
 yesterday the independent obr release additional information about this particular measure and reiterate the high uncertainty of the predict yield it note that the yield of the measure be likely to be reduce by because of behavioural response and that it be unlikely to reach a steady state for year the obr also express grave concern about the impact on old individual and their ability to plan in short the reassurance provide by minister be fall almost as flat as the economy 
 the chief secretary to the treasury have lecture this house about the peril of sideline the obr in light of its analysis will the minister now commit to a full and proper review of this dreadful policy the public have notice that government ministers be fail to answer reasonable question about their policy so will the minister please give straight answer to the farmer and business watch our proceeding today 
 in light of the new analysis how many farm do the treasury think will be affect by the change to apr apr bpr and bpr alone what assessment have he make of the central association of agricultural valuers find that the chancellor have underestimate the number of farm affect by the change by a factor of how many tenant farmer will be evict as worrying report of suicide among farmer begin to emerge will the minister please do what the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs have fail to do and measure the number of suicide over the next month so that we can understand the human cost of this policy 
 finally why do the minister think that tesco sainsbury ’s asda morrisons marks spencer aldi lidl and the co op have all come out against this tax policy and believe the treasury ’s figure to be wrong why do he think they be wrong and he be right 
 i think there may be some confusion on the conservative benches about what the obr data show the datum publish by the obr yesterday refer to exactly the same costing as be publish at budget it set out the approach to modelling and the costing which be typical and in line with other tax policy indeed the obr ’s statement make it clear that 
 the obr ’s role be to provide independent scrutiny and certification of whether the government ’s policy costing be reasonable and central 
 that be exactly what the obr have do in publish the extra information which show the modelling behind the datum that be publish at the time of the budget 
 the shadow secretary of state ask about the datum the datum on the number of affected estate claim apr and indeed apr bpr some be the upper estimate be in table of the obr document publish yesterday that be consistent with what we have be say for many month since the budget i think opposition members be confuse the value of farm with the value of claim under inheritance tax the only way to truly understand the impact of change to inheritance tax policy on inheritance tax claim be to look at the claim datum itself 
 we be work in partnership with the large supermarket chain to make sure they be drive economic growth we be very clear that some of the decision we have to take in the budget be difficult decision that will have consequence but we be determined to work with business across the country to drive economic growth which be the no mission of this government 
 the people of newcastle upon tyne central and west love the local produce provide by local farmer in our fantastic market such as grainger market and they enjoy the beautiful countryside of northumberland which have be shape by generation of sustainable farming however we can not help but be aware that most of that land be own by for example the duke of northumberland big landowner and those seek to minimise their tax exposure so do the minister agree that by keep this loophole open for so long the country have push up land price and push out the next generation of young farmer 
 there certainly be evidence that the current inheritance tax system have cause people to use these relief for tax planning and to avoid inheritance tax bill my hon friend allude to the broad question of the fairness and sustainability of this measure as i mention early of agricultural property relief benefit the top of estate and of business property relief benefit the top of estate the leader of the opposition have say that she think this be a good way to prioritise public money but we think it be neither fair nor sustainable 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 after year of the tories fail our rural community include with a dodgy and utterly shameful australian trade deal it be a great pity that the new government have pick up the baton from orkney to the isles of scilly liberal democrat colleague be extremely concerned about the impact of these proposal 
 the report publish yesterday clearly demonstrate the uncertainty about the income from the misguided family farm tax over the next decade in the light of this and give that it will hit old farmer in particular and those who put food on the table of the united kingdom will the minister do the right thing and scrap this tax 
 the obr document publish yesterday refer to the level of uncertainty associate with this policy which be exactly what be set out at the time of the budget and it be a typical way in which the obr respond to new measure what be publish yesterday simply reiterate the obr ’s conclusion from the end of october 
 do my hon friend agree that once again the conservative party have fail to agree with the tough decision we have make and have no idea how to raise the revenue to finance the public service that benefit rural community like mine in north buckinghamshire 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the party opposite in fact the party opposite routinely support the government ’s spending and investment decision but will not support any of the difficult decision we have to take to fund they 
 the weight of public and business opinion be not with the minister on this issue and the body of expert opinion speak out against this tax proposal be now overwhelming the minister be a kindly man so i wonder if he will indulge i what would he be say if he be in opposition and that weight of opinion be be express against a conservative government ’s treasury policy 
 the hon gentleman be a kindly man too i value the conversation that he and i have have outside the chamber people look at this policy and all our policy in the budget will recognise that we have to take difficult decision and will understand the context our inheritance from the previous government we recognise the toughness of those decision they be not easy to make but we prioritise balance the public finance and economic stability because that be how   we get investment in growth which our country so badly need 
 rise 
 mr dickson i think you be very late i would not want to embarrass you by allow you to ask a question 
 of the witness before the environment food and rural affairs committee tell we that the government ’s change hit the people the government say they be protect and protect the people the government say they be hit it be difficult to improve on that analysis of what be propose it really do not have to be like that there be a sensible debate to be have about reform inheritance tax to stop the super rich from shelter their wealth while still protect family farm his majesty ’s revenue and customs have its technical consultation come up why do the minister not agree to broaden its term engage with the farming community and look for a way to protect family farm and get at those who be shelter their wealth in land 
 the policy that we be implement include generous provision to protect family farm the £ entire relief from inheritance tax for agriculture and business property asset that be in addition to the nil rate band that people can access as part of the general inheritance tax scheme we think that strike the right balance between make sure we raise money for the public finance and protect family farm 
 mr speaker have you notice a pattern that on a thursday a treasury minister will be ask to come to the commons to answer an urgent question and there will be barely a soul on the labour benches behind they when they do 
 order surely that be not relevant to the question you be go to ask come on 
 the office for budget responsibility forecast that the measure will raise £ in revenue by which in the context of tax revenue of over £ be a very small number what value do the minister put on food security for the united kingdom 
 obviously the government put the high priority on food security that be why our policy set out to support it and the farming sector more widely the policy be of many difficult decision that we have to take in the budget to balance the public finance support public service and provide the economic stability we need for investment and growth 
 i have hear from many farming business across glastonbury and somerton over the last few month but farm in hurcot near somerton recently write to i to describe the anguish and stress that the change to the apr and bpr have cause they as in the case of many farming business their succession planning have focus on the primary landowner retain the farm until death how will the minister explain to they that accord to the obr the potential loss of their family farm business be likely to have little impact on the public finance and that the policy will hit the old farmer hard 
 the obr ’s publication yesterday set out the costing that be in the october budget there be no difference between the costing set out in october and what the obr set out yesterday it simply show more of the background behind how they calculate those costing for transparency and so that people be aware indeed it say in the report that that be do in an effort to improve the public debate and ensure that people understand what be behind the datum publish at the time of the budget 
 as i say to several opposition members clearly this be of many tough decision that we take in the budget to balance the public finance but we also make sure that there be great protection from inheritance tax under our propose reform scheme than be available more widely 
 the labour government ’s family farm tax will be catastrophic to farmer in my constituency in the borders i will join many of they and their tractor in kelso on saturday when the farming community come together to show its displeasure and disapproval of this policy farmer will struggle to pay this tax so what assessment have the government make of the policy ’s impact on vet feed merchant machinery supplier and all the other people who support the rural economy 
 support the rural economy public service and investment right across the country be part of labour ’s national mission to get the economy grow but the prerequisite for that investment and economic growth be stable public finance without economic stability we can not proceed to the investment and growth that we all so desperately need that be why the decision   to target agricultural property relief and business property relief be take alongside all the other difficult decision that we take in the budget 
 this measure be now reveal to be spectacularly ill consider leave aside the fact that it be also a breathtake betrayal of farmer who be promise before the election that this would not happen the measure group intergenerational farmer with speculative millionaire seek to dodge tax by get involve in farming it have put an immediate brake on investment in farming which threaten to low yield and drive up food price that then threaten to put inflationary pressure on the uk economy which be already in a perilous state this government can not just agree with the obr when it suit they they must agree with the obr regardless of what it say will the minister please respectfully pause the measure take some time to think about this and come up with something that will actually deliver for the treasury but not push our family farming sector under 
 there still seem to be confusion among opposition members about what the obr publication set out it reiterate the costing that be publish at the time of the budget on   october it explain how those costing be arrive at so that people can understand the calculation behind they but the costing be the same as those publish at the time of the budget 
 mr speaker if you look at the register of members financial interests you will see a reference to my family farm in my constituency last sunday i drive of our tractor to fakenham racecourse to support the farmer protest against the apr and bpr i talk to other farmer and the key complaint be that there have be no consultation on the change and no time for old farmer to adjust their affair all those concern have be rubbish by ministers time and again most recently today now that the obr confirm that it be more difficult for old people to restructure their affair quickly will the government finally listen show some humility and consult on how good to tackle the tax shelterer while still protect our farmer 
 the comment in the obr publication yesterday about old individual reference a point that have be make since the budget in debate in this place and elsewhere we have point out that our reform of agricultural property relief and business property relief maintain generous exemption from inheritance tax £ be subject to relief and there be the relief beyond that the exist nil rate band and other exemption in the system 
 unusually in scotland tenant farm can be pass down as inheritance i have be ask the treasury whether it have make an assessment of the impact on such farm give that their farmer can not sell land to meet the apr liability that they might face so far the answer appear to be that there be no assessment so i ask the minister for an answer from the dispatch box be he aware of agricultural tenancy under the agricultural holdings scotland act and have he make an impact assessment 
 the way to calculate the impact of change to inheritance tax policy be to look at the inheritance tax claim that have be make and that be what we have use as the basis for our calculation in fact the obr publication yesterday confirm that it use hmrc ’s datum on inheritance tax relief in the past and inheritance tax project forward and it be on the basis of that datum that we design our policy 
 the minister have just confirm that the treasury ’s modelling be base on agricultural property relief and joint agricultural and business property relief claim yet tax expert have say in evidence to the environment food and rural affairs committee that many family farm will wrap their agricultural land into a single business property relief claim so the treasury ’s modelling do not take into account family farm that have use a bpr only claim tenant farmer who use bpr and the many rural family business that will also use bpr will the minister please take this opportunity to look at this again before his government wreck the countryside 
 as i set out early the need to reform business property relief be as strong as the need to reform agricultural property relief in order to have stable public finance and a fair and sustainable tax system as i set out of apr go to the top of estate and of bpr go to the top of estate give the fiscal context that we inherit that kind of unfairness be not sustainable when balance the book we need to develop the tax system in a way that be sustainable and give we the economic stability that we desperately need after the mess that the previous government leave we 
 farmer have make their inheritance tax plan in good faith base on exist rule in effect the measure be a retrospective change to tax law so will the minister agree to at the very least delay its implementation until the effect be properly understand by both farmer and the government 
 the government be commit to deliver the reform announce in the budget we have carefully consider their impact and design the policy to provide generous exemption from inheritance tax for small family farm and business while ensure that we balance the public finance as fairly as possible 
 in the light of the uncertainty in the obr ’s report the fact that the policy will hit elderly farmer the hard and put food security at risk and the fact that rural community will suffer the most give the impact on tenant and young farmer and the wide agricultural sector do the minister really still believe in this policy 
 the obr ’s allusion yesterday to a degree of uncertainty be exactly the same as what it say at the time of the budget the costing be exactly the same as what it publish at the time of the budget yesterday the obr publish more information about how the costing be arrive at but the cost itself the degree of uncertainty and the calculation remain exactly the same as at the time of the budget 
 the minister just mention balance the public finance those be the key word through these measure we have just have the debt figure for december which be high than the obr expect they to be just month previously at what point will the minister and the government recognise that they have get this badly wrong and change course 
 we recognise that when the conservative party be in government it get it badly wrong the country decide to change course which be why they elect we into government to fix the public finance put our public service back on their foot boost investment and get the economy grow 
 they say that ought to build ’s enemy a golden bridge i think the compromise and pause propose by the national farmers union be an elegant solution that golden bridge be now be signpost by tesco aldi lidl the co op and all the major retailer the minister claim to be engage with why do he not just pause go back listen and review the policy 
 as i set out in answer to a previous question the government be commit to deliver the reform announce in the budget they be carefully calibrate to retain generous inheritance tax exemption while ensure that we balance the public finance as fairly as possible 
 bence builders merchants in my constituency have be provide good local produce and good local job since the earl of aberdeen be in power the owner paul bence fear that the combination of business property relief change and change to employer ’s national insurance mean that there be a huge disincentive to invest far do the minister share my constituent ’s concern 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise his constituent ’s concern i do not know the specific of the case but more broadly investment decision depend above all else on a stable economy and stable public finance without the hard work that we have do since take office to fix the public finance and bring back economic stability investment would be hamper and our growth ambition would not materialise in the way that we be determined to ensure happen 
 there will be a rally on saturday and the minister appear to imagine that this indicate acclamation for his policy we hear early in the week from   the hon member for falkirk euan stainbank   and today from   the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central and west chi onwurah both well know rural area that this be all about the land estate and wealthy people but i can assure the minister that the farmer i will speak with in castle douglas on saturday be tenant farmer and family farmer and they face be put off the land after generation be he really suggest that i should tell they they have nothing to worry about 
 i be not go to tell the hon gentleman what he should say to his constituent but what i can tell he about the government ’s policy be that we have reserve generous inheritance tax relief for people in   the situation he describe i encourage anyone who be concerned to seek advice to understand exactly how the new rule might apply to they 
 sometimes i be absolutely flummoxed we probably all be by the chancellor ’s intent to tax work family farm which we all know will result in the loss of small farm the sale of the land and a reduction in food security now it seem that the obr agree that it will not make saving will the minister commit to meet cabinet colleague urgently to remove the sword of damocles that be hang above small family farm and hurt the agrifood sector as a whole i say to the minister that there be a way forward increase the threshold from £ to £ and family farm will be save 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question but i think it be base primary on the obr publication yesterday i reiterate the point i have make several time now that obr publication reiterate the costing and figure set out at the budget it reiterate the level of uncertainty associate with the measure as publish at the budget it provide more detail behind that but the conclusion be the same as it be on   october 
 on a point of order mr speaker before question the minister i should have remind the house of my entry in the register of members financial interests my failure to do so for which i apologise be inadvertent i just get carry away with the excitement of the moment 
 thank you for that wonderful clarification 
 urgent question to ask the solicitor general if she will make a statement on the management of conflict of interest in the attorney general ’s office 
 the attorney general ’s office have an established and rigorous process for identify and deal with conflict and potential conflict that arise from the law officer past practice that process predate the appointment of the attorney general and sit against the backdrop of every lawyer ’s professional obligation to be alert to and to actively manage any situation that might give rise to a potential or actual conflict learned member of this house will keenly appreciate the importance that all lawyer place on that obligation 
 in identify conflict or potential conflict the attorney general ’s office adopt a cautious and   beyond reproach threshold to any conflict or potential conflict my department work with the government legal department the foreign commonwealth and development office which oversee international litigation on behalf of the government the crown prosecution service and the serious fraud office to revise and augment the list of conflict identify 
 once the conflict have be ascertain and a set of action identify for each conflict the attorney general ’s office take step to ensure that the law officer be appropriately limited in their involvement on matter relate to the relevant area of government policy or related litigation the list be keep under review and amend for example when new government policy or litigation emerge in situation where law officer be conflict another law officer be ask to act in their place 
 the law officer convention be an important principle enshrine in erskine may and the ministerial code and uphold by successive administration that preserve the ability of government to receive full and frank legal advice from their legal adviser in confidence i be therefore unable to comment on the specific detail of legal advice provide by the law officer other than to note that of course decision on policy be take by the relevant secretary of state as have be the case under successive government that process sit alongside the system relate to ministerial interest oversee by the prime minister ’s independent adviser on ministerial standard who be provide with the attorney general ’s list of conflict follow his appointment i can reassure the house that the attorney general ’s office will continue to apply the most rigorous standard in its conflict process 
 i call the shadow solicitor general 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker 
 the attorney general previously represent former sinn féin leader gerry adams in a damage claim bring by victim of ira bombing indeed we know that he receive £ for that representation the   constitutional propriety of our legal system demand absolute clarity on how conflict of interest with   former client be manage at the very high level of government this go far beyond individual matter of advice it strike at the very heart of the proper administration of justice 
 let i be absolutely clear that this be not about lord hermer ’s career at the bar it be about the proper mechanism for recusal when matter concern former client come before government the house must know what safeguard be in place to protect the public interest when such situation arise especially regard section and of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 what be the formal procedure for the attorney general ’s recusal in matter involve former client have the attorney general recuse himself from any matter since take office what assessment have be make of potential conflict arise from his extensive litigation against the government interruption 
 this all go to the heart of public confidence in our legal system the prime minister stand at the dispatch box and promise this house a government of standard and integrity interruption the proper management of conflict of interest at the high level of the government legal service be not optional it be fundamental to that promise 
 order please you have minute not and we have to stick to the rule i allow you to go on but i be not cough for my health it be to give you a hint to come to the end of your question have you now finish 
 i have mr speaker 
 thank you i call the solicitor general 
 i have outline the rigorous process that exist in the attorney general ’s office and have exist across administration of all colour the house may be aware that the shadow justice secretary   the right hon member for newark robert jenrick have write to the cabinet secretary seek clarity the clarity to which the shadow solicitor general refer on that process and an investigation into it the cabinet secretary have today confirm by reply that the attorney general ’s office have a rigorous system in place to ensure that a law officer would not be consult on any matter that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest he have restate that those arrangement be of long standing and part of standard practice that have apply under successive administration interruption i encourage opposition members to take comfort from that statement—[interruption 
 order interruption solicitor general when i be stand you must sit down mr mullan whether here or elsewhere i do not want a running commentary from you on everything we debate do we understand each other 
 indicate assent 
 good because i have certainly have enough of it 
 thank you mr speaker 
 the shadow solicitor general raise the previous experience of the attorney general lord hermer be a very experienced barrister and during his time in private practice prior to his appointment to government he represent high profile client in a number of case it be a central and well understand aspect of the british legal system as she know that barrister be require to accept instruction if they be available and qualified to do so the well know cab rank principle she will also be very aware that put simply barrister be not their client as the bar council state 
 barrister do not choose their client nor do they associate themselves with their client opinion or behaviour by virtue of represent they 
 in recent day the opposition have cynically link the attorney general with some of his previous client i grow up on military basis in armed force community in the 1980s and i remember what it feel like when my dad have to check underneath the car before every single journey we make i note that because it be the backdrop against which i say that i would defend with every fibre of my be the duty of any barrister in this country include lord hermer to defend any client before any court as we all should i will end by restate the principle in word that i think be particularly powerful 
 do not judge a surgeon by their patient a journalist by their interviewee or a lawyer by their client 
 those be the word of the current conservative shadow attorney general 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 do the solicitor general agree that what the shadow solicitor general be ask she to do in a not very subtle way be to breach the law officer convention by the back door if the attorney general be to reveal whether or not he be able to advise on a particular issue that would reveal the fact that he have be ask to advise on it the opposition ’s intention be clear it be to gain party advantage the effect be to undermine the rule of law 
 i very much agree with my hon friend i be happy to confirm that where the attorney general have conflict he will recuse himself 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the shambolic conservative government create a crisis for democracy in this country with their cronyism rule break and constant sleaze scandal they even appoint as their attorney general   the right hon and learn member for torridge and tavistock sir geoffrey cox who before his appointment represent some of the world ’s large tax dodger the liberal democrats want to repair the damage that be do by the constant stream of conservative sleaze and finally restore public trust in our politic 
 i do however have some question for the solicitor general have the attorney general seek independent legal advice regard any possible conflict of interest relate to his previous work at matrix chambers can the solicitor general assure the house that all and any   impropriety will be thoroughly look into and will she please introduce annual training on conflict of interest and ethic for all ministers and finally enshrine the ministerial code in law 
 order the hon gentleman have mention another member i do not think it be critical and that be fine but if it be critical—[hon member it be just let i finish if it be critical i be sure that he will have inform that other member 
 i do 
 you do there we go and members be get all excite i call the solicitor general 
 i be grateful to the hon member for his question i have outline the rigorous process that exist in the attorney general ’s office and as i say have exist across administration of all colour 
 i declare an interest as a member of the justice select committee do my hon friend agree that the opposition ’s position fundamentally misunderstand the role of lawyer in our justice system the attorney general also represent victim of the tragedy in grenfell tower do my hon friend also agree that the attorney general have follow the same process as his predecessor in manage any potential conflict and that what we be face with be just another example of the opposition try to undermine our legal institution merely for political gain 
 i very much agree with my hon friend the undermining of this foundational principle of our legal system have be extremely cynical 
 section and of the legacy act enjoy unanimous support in both this house and the other place it be the government ’s choice to repeal those section that have raise the question before we today and open up the possibility of compensate gerry adams be n’t it 
 i do not agree i be afraid 
 do the attorney general ’s experience have serve both as a distinguished advocate and now as a law officer not make he uniquely qualified to uphold the rule of law and advise the government appropriately 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question and it will be no surprise to hear that i very much agree with she lord hermer be an extraordinarily experienced barrister and he bring that experience to his role as attorney general 
 i understand that the solicitor general want to maintain the confidentiality of the law officer office but the issue before we be whether there be a conflict of interest for example the attorney general have advocate in relation to the policy of the israeli government and then we have have a change of policy by the government that have be directly influence by the legal advice that have   be give the challenge be whether that advice have be give on the basis of prejudicial view hold prior to enter the attorney general ’s office i do not expect the solicitor general to unveil the detail but she must understand that that be the impression be give every aspect of transparency and democracy require that the advice give by the attorney general to the government be impartial correct and not prejudiced 
 the hon member will know that the law officer convention mean that i can not confirm that the attorney general have advise or whether his advice have be seek on any matter 
 we be see some extraordinary and absolutely shameless attack because not only be the attorney general a barrister of international standing but as my hon friend   the member for wolverhampton west warinder juss   say he represent the victim of grenfell tower do the solicitor general agree with i that conservative members would do well to remember that when they attack the attorney general about his former client 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question and i agree with she 
 i call jim shannon interruption 
 oh sorry mr speaker i be so used to be call last laughter my humblest apology 
 my motivation be clearly justice for the innocent victim that be what i be about at the heart of this urgent question be gerry adams when this house put in place a pension for innocent victim of the trouble and at that time exclude perpetrator from apply gerry adams and his colleague seek to block those pension adam hand be dripping with innocent blood not least from when he be the commander of the la mon bombing which kill and maim my constituent will the attorney general recuse himself from all matter relate to adams and will this government ensure that adams do not get single penny 
 as i have already state the law officer convention do not permit i to reveal when the attorney general have be ask for advice or when he have advise 
 i draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as a member of the bar 
 it seem that conservative members be deliberately feign ignorance about our constitution to make an empty political point the truth be that lawyer in this country represent client without fear or favour we do not in this country associate the view of our client or the client with the view of their lawyer and there be the concept of the cab rank rule do the solicitor general agree with i that the law officer convention and exist process which as she say have be in place for many year under successive government can be leave to regulate conflict of interest as they   always have do if the conservative genuinely have a problem with that they would have change it when they be in government 
 i agree with my hon friend and i be grateful to he for make that point as i say early barrister be quite simply not their client and i have quote the word of the current conservative shadow attorney general
