 i associate this side of the house with the remark that the right hon lady have make about staff come in today we be incredibly grateful to they 
 i be sure we be go to hear a lot today about urgency move at pace and the rest of it but the truth be that the government have make a total pig ’s breakfast of this whole arrangement the fact be that anyone who have be pay any attention to this story over the past few month have know that this be come down the track the house be sitting—[interruption 
 order we have come back on a saturday that do not mean it be crackerjack day we be go to listen 
 the house be sit on monday and on tuesday and on those day my hon friend   the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers   raise these issue the fact be that the government make bad deal for britain when negotiate and as ever they be make a bad deal it be a huge discourtesy to the house that we see this bill only minute before the start of the sitting far reach power be be give to the government power not see in legislation really in the past year i very much hope that the government will apologise for the way that they have do thing for have take their eye off the ball yet again and for have negotiate badly for the british people 
 question put and agree to 
 reading 
 i remind member that under the order of the house of today notice of amendment and new clause to be move in committee of the whole house may be—[interruption this be very serious they may be accept in person by the clerks at the table in the chamber before the bill have be read a time the deadline for amendment table in this way be noon any amendment table to the bill will be treat as manuscript amendment mean that only those table before noon and select by the chairman for debate at committee stage will be distribute and publish 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 we meet in exceptional circumstance to take exceptional action in what be exceptional time our request to recall parliament be not we make lightly i be genuinely grateful to hon member in all part of the house for their co operation and for be here today as we seek to pass emergency legislation that be unequivocally in our national interest i thank in particular the staff in parliament for facilitate today ’s sitting and the prime minister the chancellor and the home secretary for their support indeed we can take this action today only because of the restoration of economic stability and the dedicated resource for steel in the last budget i acknowledge my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin   the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers   and all my hon friend from teesside for their advocacy and engagement on this matter throughout on behalf of their constituent 
 as hon member will know since take office the government have be negotiate in good faith with british steel ’s owner jingye we have work tirelessly to find a way forward make a generous offer of support to british steel that include sensible common sense condition to protect the workforce protect taxpayer money and create a commercially viable company for the future despite our offer to jingye be substantial it want much more an excessive amount frankly however we remain committed to negotiation but over the past few day it have become clear that the intention of jingye be to refuse to purchase sufficient raw material to keep the blast furnace run in fact its intention be to cancel and refuse to pay for exist order the company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally close down primary steelmaking at british steel 
 i want to make it absolutely clear that separately from any conversation about a possible deal to co invest in new infrastructure the british government offer to purchase the raw material in a way that would have ensure no loss whatsoever for jingye in maintain the blast furnace for a period of time a counter offer be instead make by jingye that we transfer hundred of million of pound to it without any condition to prevent that money and potentially other asset be   immediately transfer to china jingye also refuse the condition of keep the blast furnace maintain and in good working order 
 even if i have agree to those term i could not guarantee that further request for money would not then be make in that situation with the clock be run down do nothing be not an option we could not will not and never will stand idly by while the heat seep from the uk ’s remain blast furnace without any planning due process or respect for the consequence that be why i need colleague here today 
 from what the secretary of state have describe it be begin to sound as though jingye be try to manoeuvre the government into a recompensed nationalisation will he make it plain that if it try to manoeuvre we into nationalisation we will pay not more than a penny for the business 
 to be clear where there be a transfer of ownership to the state we would always pay the fair market value for the asset in this case the market value be effectively so i take the right hon gentleman ’s point entirely i would say that the intention of jingye have not be to engineer that situation its intention have be to keep the downstream mill which colleague will know be fundamental to our construction and steel industry and supply they from china rather than from scunthorpe that be the situation 
 be it now the view of the government that primary steel production in the united kingdom be an override national security issue 
 as the right hon gentleman will know we have have this exchange at the dispatch box before i believe that the capacity for primary steel production be important the steel strategy look at new way of ensure that and at not just protect the past but at what the future may bring direct reduce iron technology be of significant potential interest to we for the future however this situation involve the last remain blast furnace and the proposition put to we be exceptional and unique and i need all colleague to recognise that 
 the legislation ahead of we today be therefore a proportionate and necessary step it allow we to take control of british steel ’s blast furnace maintain steel production and by extension protect the company ’s strong workforce the bill do not transfer ownership to the government we will have to deal with that matter at a later date i take the decision that give the exceptional nature of a recall it would be well to limit the power in the bill which be still significant rather than introduce more complex matter of property right and public ownership at this time 
 the secretary of state be take extremely extensive power for the government and they apply to what he describe in the bill as specify asset as far as i can see they be not limit to blast furnace or asset require for make virgin steel do he accept that he be leave hand on the tiller when it come to the   operation of all the steelmaking company to which the bill may apply in other word he be say that the government can direct a company in relation to specify asset but that company can do other thing of its own initiative do he recognise that he be create considerable legal complexity in the operation of those company go forward why be that the right approach 
 i be extremely grateful to the right hon and learn gentleman for his thoughtful question the fundamental purpose of the bill be to allow i as secretary of state and this government to take control of this situation the reason why this be the steel industry special measures bill and not a bill specific to british steel be as he will know that the latter would be a hybrid bill and introduce that would be a far more complex procedure with the clock be run down that be not an available option 
 the bill broadly replicate the situation that would apply if the civil contingencies act have be trigger but rather than seek to meet the threshold to trigger that act i be seek parliamentary permission the consent of this house and the other place to take control which i think be a well way forward i want to make it clear to the right hon and learn gentleman and to the house that i want this to be a temporary position i do not want these power a minute long than be necessary but i need the power to rectify and save the situation 
 give that the secretary of state have infer that the owner jingye be not and have not act in good faith surely the right thing to do be to seize this great opportunity now this weekend and nationalise british steel 
 a transfer of ownership to the state remain on the table it may well at this stage give the behaviour of the company be the likely option however our aspiration for british steel remain a co investment agreement with a private sector partner to secure a long term transformation the action i seek to take today be not a magic wand or a panacea the state can not fund the long term transformation of british steel nor would it want to but a failure to act today would prevent any more desirable outcome from even be consider and that again be why we must act today 
 i applaud my right hon friend for his decisive action in this matter i have only have a chance to read the bill for minutes—[interruption that be not a criticism it be the natural procedure of this house the bill could not be lay until reading the bill talk about compensation he have make the point that he be not plan to take over and run british steel which be not the desirable option but have he do some sort of impact assessment on the potential range of cost to the taxpayer in these circumstance 
 i think my hon friend refer to clause which deal with compensation again let i be clear this be a clause that we would put in any bill we be not russia and we do not sequester asset the   language in the clause the legal definition be something that we would use in most standard procedure go back to the question from   the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis the effective market value of jingye be so there be no inconsistency between those point 
 what be happen today be something that mining community like swadlincote in my constituency of south derbyshire will be feel deeply in their soul it be something that they could have only dream of back in the 1980 when they want a government who have their back and prioritise the national interest instead they have a conservative government who sell they down the river do the secretary of state agree that this be a pivotal moment in our history because we have a labour government prioritise our people and the national interest 
 this be a significant moment how a country handle economic transition be not about nostalgia for the past we have to embrace the future but how we help our people our industry and our nation get to that point be key my hon friend and i come from similar place and we have not manage these transition particularly well in the past we be meet this weekend to discuss the potential loss of thousand of job which be what be on the line the fact that we do not accept that and that we will do thing differently be a welcome change 
 we will scrutinise this bill today but we want to do so in a constructive fashion give the huge damage that president trump ’s tariff have do to the british steel industry accelerate this crisis do the secretary of state agree that any member of this house who actively campaign for president trump ’s election and cheer he on have behave shamefully unpatriotically and should apologise to british steelworker 
 i be extremely grateful to the right hon member and his party for their presence today he will not draw i on the other principal issue that we have be deal with at the department for business and trade over the last few day but to be clear the issue around british steel be about more than the imposition of tariff the tariff be not welcome and i do not think there be justification for they to be put in place i believe that it be in our interest but also in the us ’s interest to agree a position that remove those tariff in the interest of steelworker 
 i fully understand the nature of what the right hon gentleman be bring forward i also understand some of the requirement for speed in this case and we can argue about whether this should have be do before have quickly look through the bill i do not see a sunset clause i ask about that not because i want the government to set a particular date but because such a clause would bring they back here to debate whether the process should be extend it would therefore put a reasonable limit on government activity without debate can he explain why there be no sunset clause in the bill 
 i absolutely understand and welcome the right hon gentleman ’s question i do not want these power for a minute more than be necessary i can not say at the minute have draft the bill the timeframe for which they will be require but i will endeavour and i commit at the dispatch box to keep the house update perhaps i will ask the business and trade committee for its involvement in order to make it clear how long we believe it will be to be absolutely specific where we make an order in relation to control of a steel undertaking we can revoke the regulation once that control have be establish and be no long require 
 rise 
 i know there be huge interest but i will make a little more progress and that might deal with some of the matter member want to raise 
 this be what it mean to be a government unashamedly on the side of work people that will never hesitate to take action to protect this nation ’s asset and economic security i understand that some have ask about precedent or refer to other troubled industrial situation to be clear again this be an exceptional and unique situation the question for all members be whether we as a country want to continue to possess a steel industry do we want to make the construction steel and rail we need here in the uk or do we want to be dependent on overseas import as a government we be not passive in any way about the future of british industry 
 the secretary of state have say this be unique and exceptional and make reference to energy transition and thousand of job in the scottish context many mind right now will be focus on the situation in grangemouth where we know that hundred of job will be lose directly as well as thousand in the supply chain be i or perhaps even the local member   the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman to bring forward a similar bill to save scotland ’s only oil refinery and give the secretary of state the executive power to do as he please as he be do with british steel would the labour party back it as it be back this bill today 
 i be pleased for the chance to address this issue the importance of grangemouth be why this labour government have pledge £ to secure its long term future it be an important asset but it be not the only remain refinery it be of cracker in the united kingdom that be important specifically it be not a comparable situation and the behaviour of the company be not comparable to the case of british steel 
 i also say to the right hon member and indeed to all member that this be why we fight and fight again to secure the future of british shipbuilding by save all of the harland and wolff site in england scotland and northern ireland the right hon member will know that the commercial interest be not in the scottish yard but we hold they together precisely because of our commitment to scotland and the union it be also why within week of take office we secure a well   deal for the worker at port talbot we have repeatedly act and we will continue to act no matter how hard the circumstance 
 do my right hon friend agree that the failure of the tories and the snp to develop an industrial strategy for scotland mean that they have no plan for grangemouth they know for over a decade about the problem at the refinery and do nothing do he agree that as soon as labour come into power we get to work and deliver support for the site the workforce and the local community 
 i endorse my hon friend ’s comment entirely i do not believe there be a history of the snp call for the nationalisation of grangemouth it be as ever on the bandwagon i think we all recognise that the snp do not campaign on its record in run scotland it campaign on grievance my hon friend be absolutely right that the contrast be with a labour government in this place who be on the side of work people everywhere 
 the secretary of state mention port talbot i appreciate the unprecedented circumstance we find ourselves in today when the government have rightly move quickly to safeguard primary steelmaking and the secretary of state will be very mindful of the extraordinarily difficult circumstance that the steel industry in south wales have face i recognise the £ fund available but can he make sure that south wales and llanwern benefit from their share of the £ clean steel fund can that also be at the forefront of his mind 
 i be incredibly pleased to have the chance to answer the point my hon friend raise the port talbot deal be originally negotiate by the previous government i do try to reopen it i go to see chandra in davos and fly to mumbai to talk to he about it to be frank i keep port talbot open on polling day because it would have close due to the industrial action that almost take place the previous government be nowhere to be see even before the result of the election be in we be not able to reopen the deal but we do negotiate a well deal as a result port talbot be in a strong position than british steel because it have a long term future in place interruption this be because we improve on the deal that the leader of the opposition botch at the time to be clear the £ green steel fund the chancellor have put in place be in addition to the £ already go to port talbot that be an incredibly important point 
 i thank the secretary of state for give way and for act in the national interest the complete opposite of   the hon member for clacton nigel farage who say he be against intervene to save british steel year ago do the secretary of state think the hon gentleman say that in the british interest or in the foreign interest the reform party seek to serve 
 i believe that that be on the record i hope to convince all colleague today to support this action which be in the national interest 
 when the blast furnace in port talbot close down last september this government could have take exactly the same legislative action as they have choose to take today we will endeavour to amend the bill to include wales because there be still the opportunity for this government to make a real difference to the community of port talbot and the job that have be lose there 
 i do not want to embarrass the right hon lady but the blast furnace have already close at port talbot they be not available to be save that situation have move on let i stress again port talbot be in a strong position because it have that long term future in place and the potential additional investment through the green steel fund 
 rise 
 i think i must progress mr speaker i can see your indication to do so 
 will my right hon friend give way 
 i will take more intervention 
 i thank my right hon friend for give way and for the consider way in which he be look after the national interest the steel union the gmb community and unite would like clarification that any board that be set up will have at its heart the steelworker who have keep the steelwork go through thick and thin 
 we remain in close engagement with all the union which have be monitor the situation closely again i reiterate that the bill be not in itself about a change of ownership it be about a change of control to rectify the situation however i will certainly have regard to the comment my hon friend have make and of course the role of the workforce at all stage 
 we will never accept the argument that steelmaking   be a sunset industry steel be vital to every bit of the modern economy domestic demand for steel be set only to go up not down in the past few week alone we have see heathrow airport announce multibillion pound expansion plan require tonne of new steel and universal studios confirm it will be build europe ’s big theme park and where possible will use uk make steel to do so this government be back the builder not the blocker with the action we take today we have the chance to feed that boom with steel make in britain 
 the legislation we be set out today will help to end the uncertainty that have be hang over british steel ’s scunthorpe site for too long i welcome the opposition ’s support today for this recall but this issue should have be resolve year ago i believe they may now view it as a mistake to have give this essential national asset to this company 
 i have to address the statement make by the leader of the opposition yesterday which i do as a matter of genuine regret she claim that while she do my job    she negotiate a modernisation plan with british steel to build an electric arc furnace at teesside follow by at scunthorpe i wish to make it unequivocally clear to the house that the new government inherit no such deal we could not renege on that deal because it do not exist on day i be tell that there have be a lack of progress on this matter to date 
 rise 
 if such a deal be negotiate somehow in secret i ask the leader of the opposition to say how much money she agree to give jingye for this deal and what condition be place on it to state the obvious build electric arc furnace in different location would be more expensive than build in location and give that jingye ’s request to build furnace in scunthorpe be for £ in taxpayer support what 
 on a point of order mr speaker i would like advice on how to counter the point the secretary of state be make give that they be factually incorrect and a complete misrepresentation of the situation that he inherit 
 it have just be clarify by your good self i can not make the secretary of state give way when you want to come to the dispatch box but i be sure that if he notice you do so again he may wish to 
 this be an excellent chance to clarify that if the leader of the opposition agree a deal with jingye to cause massive job loss in scunthorpe and transfer the job to a completely different place and at high cost than the request the company make to we i think she should be able to tell we i be more than happy to give way 
 labour can not negotiate we be negotiate a modernisation deal that would have have limit job loss just as we have in port talbot the labour government inherit a function commercial deal in port talbot and the same would have happen with british steel have we not have a snap election   what the secretary of state be do now be the union push deal they bring that deal to i i say no he say yes 
 this be genuinely revelatory i say again if jingye ’s request be for £ to build at less cost in place what be the sum of money agree by the leader of the opposition when she be business secretary to build in place it certainly be not in the account that the chancellor have i will give way how much money be agree to jingye to close the job in scunthorpe i ask she 
 when you be negotiate you do not have—[interruption labour member be cheer and laugh because they love this they think that the public take on billion of pound in liability be fantastic we have not finish the negotiation so there be no amount but it would have succeed well than the terrible plan that the secretary of state have now 
 our friend in the press will follow that up and find out exactly how much money the leader of the opposition secretly promise to jingye to transfer those job out of scunthorpe i think it might be wise on all count for that statement to be withdraw 
 the situation we inherit across the board on assume office be where most of our foundation industry be in some substantial difficulty since uk crude steel production have almost halve and we know that rebuild our steel industry after year of neglect will be a challenge but it be that this government have grasp 
 my right hon friend and i be in this house in when the conservative party sit on its hand and kiss goodbye to the redcar blast furnace and with it the state of the art coke oven that could have resolve this situation today before he sit down will he say something about the jingye activity at lackenby and skinningrove and how they will be impact by today ’s announcement 
 i be really grateful that my hon friend have be able to put that point on the record for his community to avoid the kind of situation we have see in lot of industrial community to be frank over the year this be why we take this action today in the national interest to provide that bridge and that possibility to the future 
 specifically in relation to the downstream mill even if we be willing to accept a situation in which they be supply from a foreign country as in this case the confidence of consumer and business would surely be put at risk and it would bring into question the entirety of british steel ’s workforce and business and a huge part of our strategic asset that again be why this decisive action today be necessary 
 the right hon gentleman say that steel production be strategically important and i agree he say that we should be avoid have to be reliant on import and i agree however his government block production of the raw material metallurgical coalmine in the north west will he now go back to his colleague in government and the company to encourage they to reapply so we can have security not just of steelmaking but of the raw material that be need to make it 
 the hon lady will know that the company bring into question whether that coal be the right grade for blast furnace supply i remember several debate in this place about that i should also make it clear i think hon member understand this that we be talk about blast furnace that date from the 1930 and 1950 we must also be look to the future to new technology and new investment crucially have the dedicated resource that this government have put into steel be why we have the chance to look to the future with optimism the uk steel industry be an outlier in the sense that it be a much small proportion of our overall economy than in any major comparable economy so of course there be potential and we should look to the future i would be more than willing to work with the hon lady as a local mp to do so 
 rise 
 i will give way last time 
 i thank the secretary of state for give way once he have the power in this bill i urge he to use they decisively and swiftly but then as he have say we need to look to the future once we have secure scunthorpe ’s future we need to discuss what happen next which be clean energy and invest in the global clean energy that the uk really could succeed in do he agree that the people of scunthorpe have uphold their end of the bargain for decade and now it be time that we in this house make sure we uphold our end too 
 the hon member put it extremely well if i may say so the people who have uphold steel as the backbone of construction in the uk for decade deserve well treatment than they would have have if parliament have not be recall today to take this action and we should all bear that in mind 
 whether it be at port talbot via our upcoming steel strategy via our work to improve public procurement or in the introduction of our industrial strategy to tackle the most thorny issue of industrial competitiveness where other have shy away this government have step up 
 let i conclude by say that steel be fundamental to britain ’s industrial strength our security and our identity as a primary global power today ’s legislation will help ensure that we can retain that steelmaking capability here in the uk both now and for year to come for british worker security for british industry future and without hesitation in our national interest and for the worker of british steel and their family this action be essential and i commend this bill to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for take the time to brief i last night ahead of today ’s sitting and for advance sight of his speech 
 to fail to prepare be to prepare to fail what a way to proceed recall parliament for only the occasion since the end of the world war to debate a bill publish only minute ago this would be conduct unbecoming of a parish council our country our economy and this parliament all deserve well that be why the amendment in my name would at least put a sunset on the bill and i hope the government will accept it 
 today be not a failure by the steelworker of scunthorpe and elsewhere their family or the community they have toil for generation to ensure that we have the primary steel we need for our structure our safety and our security this be a failure on the government ’s watch let we be crystal clear what today mean we be enter a tunnel with only exit this be a botched nationalisation plan reveal that the government have no plan 
 in government we act to secure port talbot and we be negotiate a plan include british steel ’s preferred option of an electric arc furnace on teesside which would have limit job loss and keep scunthorpe run in transition once again when labour negotiate britain lose the chagos island us tariff the train driver and now this late crisis a bad toolmaker blame his tool but this time the government have only themselves to blame 
 do the hon gentleman not accept that in the year between and steel production in this country fall by to 50%—and do that not underline the lack of strategy under the previous government 
 i will talk about the difficulty face steel around the world but let we just be clear what be happen today the british people must not have lose their winter fuel allowance and their disability benefit in order that china can walk away from its liability leave british taxpayer to pick up the bill 
 steel need energy and energy need steel no deny that steelmaking have be difficult for some time but scunthorpe be the victim of a dishonesty that pretend it be well for the environment to ship coke halfway around the planet than from down the road and of an energy policy that have drive cost high than in any compete nation no be more responsible for this than the energy secretary and the prime minister who appoint he 
 will my hon friend give way interruption 
 order i remind member that those who keep intervene will go down the list so that everybody get a fair chance 
 i assume that apply after the warning mr speaker 
 we have a government who i believe be ship coke coal just off the lincolnshire coast today from japan when it be perfectly possible to have the world ’s green production of coke coal in cumbria with thousand of job be it not a disgrace that this government turn their back on job in cumbria and indeed in the north sea because they put ideology ahead of practicality and even ahead of the environment 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right it be sad to say that scunthorpe be the victim of exactly that policy put ideology before british interest 
 rise 
 i will make some progress 
 million of other business be also struggle with their energy bill which be why the chancellor ’s tax choice have be so devastating steel may be the domino to topple but glass chemical car and concrete be other industry at risk do the prime minister    envisage a whole series of saturday sitting or will he change course today and cut energy cost now and not in year time when it be too late 
 we be hear about the previous government ’s effort to save british steel and we have hear a somewhat confusing account of the deal that the now leader of the opposition negotiate if such a deal exist can we see a record of it 
 my right hon friend the leader of the opposition have make it extremely clear that the deal be be negotiate and the point about it be negotiate be that it would have be conclude after the election 
 rise 
 i will make some progress 
 it do not need to be this way my hon friend   the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers   have be warn of a grow threat since last september the mayor of tees valley have be ask the government to present their plan for steel for month rob waltham the leader of north lincolnshire council have do all he can to support steelmaking in scunthorpe and on   april ed conway of sky news show the world that we be just day away from the risk of the furnace shut down but the government do not listen and they do not act 
 it have be almost day since parliament last debate substantive government business rather than this rush minute to midnight bill we could have use that time for proper debate proper process and proper scrutiny this be indefensible incompetence despite year to prepare it be clear that the government come into office with no plan there be no steel strategy there be no industrial strategy there be no export strategy and now we have this botched nationalisation 
 the secretary of state say that his preference be to find a commercial partner but let we be serious do the government think that be likely after attack business with a £ job tax and his bill to create the most hostile environment for employer since the 1970 on the chancellor ’s watch in case she have not notice all the flow be of investor leave this country 
 i be still a little confused about the deal negotiate by the last government as the leader of the opposition do not answer could the hon gentleman please clarify the situation for the house 
 i be not surprised that the hon lady be a little confused as i say the government have fail to lay out their plan and to afford this house the opportunity to debate it everything that we have hear this morning say that the government have not really think this through steelmaking be complex intense and highly operational iron ore have to reach thousand of degree to become molten iron it be a dangerous process that pose a serious risk to health in birmingham labour struggle to collect the bin 
 rise 
 sit down from midnight the chancellor will be stand behind the payroll settle every bill with every supplier even if they be in arrear if these decision no long sit with the plant owner where do the buck stop old admiralty building the treasury no how can other steel provider have any confidence in the impartiality of the government ’s steel strategy if the umpire be now on the pitch what assessment have the government make of the impact of the bill on public finance there be no impact assessment 
 the government have be talk to british steel for month they have put at least £ of taxpayer money on the table surely by now the business secretary and his official have a comprehensive understanding of the cost of the action that he be ask we to vote for what disrespect it show to this house for the government to come along today have recall parliament after month of fail to land a deal and ask we for a blank cheque that be no way to run a corner shop let alone the country have anyone in government ask the office for national statistics 
 rise 
 if they sit down they might learn something 
 you will sit down actually it be the hon gentleman ’s choice whether he give way so member should stop hang around 
 i will take an intervention if someone want to answer this question have anyone in government ask the ons whether as a result of the power that be be take in this bill from today british steel will be classify as publicly own whether it have be formally nationalise or not no answer 
 rise 
 that be a bit slow interruption go on then 
 that be a relevant question give that the hon gentleman be boris johnson ’s business adviser when the jingye deal be be negotiate what advice do he give boris johnson about whether to accept that deal 
 disappointingly there be no answer to my important question about the ons and whether this asset will sit on the government ’s balance sheet perhaps when the minister wind up he will provide an answer to that important question that affect the nation ’s finance 
 the market know the world know and we know that the chancellor ’s headroom be inadequate from the very moment that she sit down after her last emergency budget only this week the bank of england take the unprecedented step of cancel the plan sale of government bond today ’s botched nationalisation will far unsettle international market when will the chancellor be present she next emergency budget and what be her plan to update the market 
 there we be a disrespect of this house the government treat parliament with disdain month of dither and delay and a botched nationalisation of steelmaking with the british taxpayer on the hook it be crystal clear that when labour negotiate britain lose this be not a serious government it be a government shape by event not in control of they it be government by sulky teenager not share their plan not answer the question and when it go wrong it be everyone ’s fault but theirs 
 i call the chair of the business and trade committee 
 mr speaker i wonder whether you will forgive i for return the debate to the bill which be about save british steel that be what the debate should be focus on and i commend the secretary of state for bring forward the power to achieve that goal he have act with decisiveness speed and certainty and i thank he for the bill he have present today he have act in the national interest and he have act to safeguard our economic security i be delighted that he have also act in line with the select committee ’s advice which be table with he day ago as we know that do not always happen we urge he to maximise pressure on british steel ’s owner not to do what be easy but to do what be right today he have return to the house with a bill ask for the power to do exactly that 
 this legislation matter not simply because it protect job in scunthorpe not simply because it protect job in the steel supply chain across our nation and not simply because it safeguard nearly £ of economic output it matter because it defend our economy our security and therefore our future at the heart of this debate be a very simple question can we entrust a critical national asset to a company we do not trust i say no we can not we must not and we dare not we be present with a very simple challenge in british steel ’s owner we have a company in possession of an asset that we need yet it be a partner that we do not trust in a world where threat to our economic security multiply each day we can not allow that risk to fester at the heart of our industrial core 
 do the right hon member agree that there be a wide issue at stake our energy security and national security we have see what can go wrong with a chinese company that we do not trust and we see chinese influence increase in other vital sector particularly our energy industry should that not underline our concern and act as a warning that we do not want the chinese to have control of our energy supply 
 we be here in the house to answer a very basic question if we can not trust a company can we entrust to it a capability that we need when that capability be so vital to our strength that be reason why the select committee have set up a new sub committee on economic security arms and export controls we will be report back to the house on the state of economic security in our country before the summer recess and i look forward to the hon lady ’s comment on that report 
 the general point i want to land be this what we value most can not be entrust to those we distrust most the timing of the bill be critical we live in an age of intensify insecurity president putin ’s violence be unabated china ’s military build up be unabated and now president trump threaten to upend the free trading system in such a world to surrender our ability to make primary steel would not be a misfortune it would be negligence 
 my right hon friend will know that the select committee have speak to defence company about how necessary it be not to rely on import at a time such as this do he agree that national resilience and defence rely on industrial security 
 my hon friend be absolutely right in this debate we need to remember that of our rail infrastructure be make by british steel british steel also supply quarter of every major construction project in this country thank to the chancellor we be about to invest £ in the rearmament of this country much of what we need to put in place will be make by british steel how can we afford to let british steel go out of business today how can we vote against the bill british steel be not simply a pillar of british industry it be a cornerstone of our economic security 
 do the right hon gentleman agree with i as a card carry advocate of industrial strategy that this argument apply to some of our other key high growth sector such as fusion quantum and space we have to accept that the day of easy globalisation be over and be a bit more strategic about how we support our emerge industry 
 mr speaker you know that i could answer that question all day but you would rule i out of order so i will confine my remark to the bill however i agree with the hon gentleman he be absolutely right and that be why we have to work hard across the house to build a consensus about the big call that we need to get right for our future 
 british steel face significant headwind not just from chinese steelmaker flood the market but from the new tariff from the united states and we have to rise to the challenge of decarbonisation yet we in this house must keep our eye on the prize ahead of we the chancellor have just commit £ worth of capital investment we be build affordable home at a pace not see in decade and we be invest £ in defence there be a market to seize but only if we have the mean to supply it british steel can not profit from britain ’s future if chinese firm be allow to kill it today 
 i agree with the right hon member that we need a steel industry in britain and that we need to invest in it do he not think that we could be go a bit far today and instead of this temporary measure take the whole steel industry into public ownership so it can be what it have always be the bedrock of manufacturing industry in britain and give we security for the future free from market force 
 the right hon gentleman may well be right but this be the key point that i want to land the truth be that jingye be a mess it have fail to publish account since auditor have resign cite material concern about the company ’s ability to remain a going concern inventory can not be verify cash flow statement be miss the company be not act in good faith and that be why the secretary of state be right to take the power that he be ask for today 
 it be clear that the escalate trade war between china and the united states create the imperative to act today it be clear that jingye be about to move primary steelmaking capability from scunthorpe back to china and merely use the downstream mill in scunthorpe that may have be good for china ’s economic security but it be not good for britain ’s national security and that be why we need to give the secretary of state the power that he be ask for 
 the option on the table be very simple the secretary of state could do nothing and watch the furnace close he could hope but hope be not a strategy or he could act as he have do today he have act with strength and make a decision in the long term interest of our country and the house should give he its full and unabated support 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 recall parliament today be absolutely the right thing to do but to be frank it be extraordinary that we find ourselves in a situation in which our sovereign steel industry be in such peril as a result of the conservative failing and the labour government be now try to give themselves unprecedented power 
 it be astounding that even after british steel be sell for £ even after it enter insolvency and even after the government ’s insolvency service temporarily run it the conservatives press ahead to erect more trade barrier through their botched brexit deal scrap the industrial strategy council and allow the sale of the steel plant to a chinese firm that accord to ministers be now refuse to negotiate in good faith at least to keep the plant go the conservatives be asleep at the wheel they fail to tackle energy cost and business rate and now trump ’s tariff and contagious protectionism be the straw that have break the camel ’s back 
 do the hon lady agree that the conservatives be also in government in when the steelwork at redcar close and thousand of people lose their job 
 as the hon member know the thing that i have just outline british steel be sell for a pound british steel enter insolvency and the government ’s insolvency service be leave temporarily run the firm all happen in 
 with putin ’s barbaric war in europe and donald trump ’s disastrous tariff cause economic turmoil around the world we must secure the future of steel production here at home we liberal democrats welcome the sense of seriousness and urgency show by the government   in recall parliament we must work together to rescue our steel sector and the ten of thousand of job that directly and indirectly rely on it but under the term of the bill the secretary of state be give himself huge and unconstrained power that could set a very dangerous precedent i urge he to make a commitment in the strong possible term to repeal the power that he be give himself as soon as possible within month at the late and to come back to this house for another vote to extend those power if they be still require after that 
 as i try to articulate in my opening speech on reading i understand the gravity of the situation which give put some context to the demand for further power to be include in the bill the limitation as wide as it be be the right measure and i can give the hon member my absolute assurance that i shall seek to do exactly as she say 
 i be incredibly grateful to the secretary of state for give that assurance which be important in the context of what the power in the bill actually be 
 clause 3(4)(a give the secretary of state the power to break into anywhere to seize asset clause 3(4)(c give the secretary of state the power to take whatever step he consider appropriate not what a court or a reasonable person might consider to be appropriate to seize or secure asset clause 4(3 on offence make it a crime for anyone not to follow the instruction of the secretary of state or to refuse to assist the secretary of state in take those step without a reasonable excuse however a reasonable excuse be not define in the bill no example be give and quite frankly it be hard to work out what defence of a reasonable excuse might be accept give that under clause 3(4)(c it be whatever the secretary of state himself consider to be okay 
 clause 6(1 on indemnity appear to give the secretary of state and potentially any other person who be with he a police officer a civil servant or a border force official immunity from prosecution for use any of these wide range power these power be unprecedented and they be unconstrained i be grateful to the secretary of state for say that that be precisely why he intend to repeal they as soon as possible 
 more broadly the government must now also bring forward plan to guarantee the future of this vital sector we know the steel industry be surround by crippling uncertainty after decade of underinvestment and shocking indifference to our sovereign economic security the previous conservative government have leave our sovereign national capacity on steel diminish and endanger yet there be no chance that uk demand for steel will disappear how absurd and irresponsible be it that we have a sustainable and endure long term market for british steel but that our supply could keel over in a matter of day because of the failure of the fail conservative party 
 so look ahead let we remember that save scunthorpe be necessary but not sufficient on its own there have be significant discussion about the future ownership structure of this company give the precarious fiscal position in which the government find themselves it be important that all option on ownership be put on    the table so that this house can take an informed decision about what they mean for the public finance i hope the government will make a commitment that in the come week they will bring forward a report that set out option for future ownership of the plant 
 look ahead many big question remain unanswered will the government immediately designate uk make steel a nationally strategic asset will they be use direct reduce iron and if so will that form part of the uk ’s plan alongside protect the production of virgin steel at scunthorpe when will the government bring forward a comprehensive plan to ensure that more british steel be use in vital infrastructure project from defence to renewable energy will ministers work shoulder to shoulder with our european and commonwealth partner to tear down trade barrier include by negotiate a custom union by will they develop initiative to retrain and upskill worker across the country as we transition to green method of steel production how do the government intend to respond to call from uk steel for the government to achieve the low electricity price in europe parity with competitor on network charge and wholesale electricity market reform 
 this case should also raise concern about the role of chinese corporate interest in the uk ’s national critical infrastructure the decision by british steel ’s chinese owner to turn down the government ’s offer of £ to support the future of the scunthorpe plant have directly precipitate this crisis we must now be clear eyed about the risk pose by chinese involvement in our country ’s vital infrastructure to that end will the minister tell the house when the government ’s promise uk china audit will be release and how the government plan to strengthen protection for critical infrastructure can he assure the house that the government have assess whether there be any risk that jingye on behalf of the chinese government have deliberately run down the plant to jeopardise the uk ’s capacity to produce steel 
 we be in a precarious position and it be not as if there be no warning in the royal united services institute think tank say 
 domestically produce steel be use in defence application and offshore the supply chain may have security implication for example in a scenario where multiple ally country rearm simultaneously at a time of global supply disruption such as during a major geopolitical confrontation 
 the fact that jingye have now close down the supply of raw material be further evidence that the plant should not have be sell to it in the place quite frankly the fact that some conservative mp be call for nationalisation show how far through the look glass we really be 
 be not the conservatives attitude abundantly clear on national security they cut troop number by on food security they undermine our farmer with unforgiveably bad trade deal and on economic security they leave our country with almost no sovereign steel capacity on security the conservatives leave our island nation severely vulnerable like flotsam in the sea passively bob up and down or be bash around by the tide of international event 
 as for hon member from the private limited company reform ltd they have a bit of cheek to claim to support uk steelworker while cheer on their pal   president trump whose punish trade war be put those steelworker job at risk perhaps the company ’s director who sit in this house will come clean about whose side they be really on 
 time and again we have see the failure of an ad hoc piecemeal approach to industry across all sector from the failure of our water company to the shocking state of our housing nationally and the dismal situation of our health service for too long there have be no stability for these industry which be constantly fix on a short term basis only to the point where they be practically hold together by string and tape and the dedicated worker who remain we liberal democrats stand ready to help constructively to bring about an outcome that deliver real change 
 today some of we have be surprised to hear the opposition talk about a failure to prepare the worker of scunthorpe might say that they have year to prepare and fail 
 british steel ’s product be essential to industry to this country ’s security and to the delivery of major infrastructure programme across the country include in london british steel supply transport for london with the power rail use on its transport network which be not manufacture anywhere else in the country for railway include the underground power rail from british steel be essential to the everyday operation of the service which support up to customer journey each day the closure of british steel would have a very serious adverse effect on transport for london ’s service as it would on project up and down the country so above all transport for london believe in the importance of a uk base supply chain for steel 
 finally everyone in this house understand that the bill be not about bring steel into public ownership whatever the opposition assert but some of we hope that move on to nationalisation will not be rule out all of we on the government benches believe in what work but privatisation certainly do not always work the water industry come to mind since privatisation not a single reservoir have be build instead billion have be pour into the pocket of shareholder now raw sewage float in our waterway and river and it be the consumer who will have to pay exorbitant charge for investment that should have be make all along 
 this house support the government in move to save british steel and the job of thousand and thousand of worker it also support the government in move so quickly and with such certainty to protect the country ’s interest include in relation to security and in work to save the community in scunthorpe because of the issue with deindustrialisation be the long term effect on many community up and down the country we all support what the government be do 
 i have just come off the phone to tom smith the trade union convenor at the blast furnace on behalf of my many    constituent who work next door in scunthorpe my primary concern today be with the nearly people who work in this plant let we be clear we have be make the good quality steel in the world for year in lincolnshire and we intend to go on do it we be not go to allow cheap inferior chinese steel to kill off our industry the worker of scunthorpe be breathe a sigh of relief 
 we can be party political i have to say that i think the chairman of the business and trade committee make an excellent speech he be positive and talk in strategic term but i do not know what the liberal democrat spokesman   the hon member for st albans daisy cooper achieve by constantly attack the conservative party on what be a very complex issue of course we can be criticise because we sell this company to jingye yes i agree but how many voice on the liberal democrat benches be speak up at the time be they speak up when greg clark our then business secretary pay the wage of the scunthorpe steelworker for many month be they speak up when we save sheffield forgemasters this be a highly complex issue and we should be work together so i support the bill 
 i know that we can be critical of the government perhaps we should have act soon my hon friend   the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers   have be raise this point i be sit beside he at the end of march when he raise it and call for nationalisation of the industry but we have now get to work together to save our steelmaking capacity 
 we know though that this bill be a bit of a stick plaster it be quite dangerous quite extensive power be be take by the government so there have to be a sunset clause we be give unprecedented power to the government we can criticise they for not act soon but this be a stick plaster on a gap wound 
 let we be honest steelmaking in this country be under extreme stress and why be that why be we load the most expensive energy cost on to our own steel production why be scunthorpe pay almost twice as much in energy cost as those in south korea or in america high energy price make uk steel expensive to produce and uncompetitive versus that produce by our european counterpart in the average price pay by uk steelmaker be £ a kwh compare with the german price of £ and the french price of £ we be make our own steel industry uncompetitive we have to stop these green energy cost we have to be realistic the secretary of state for energy security and net have now leave but we need to get real we can take steel into public ownership now but if we go on load cost on our industry we will have to come back month after month and year after year 
 we will support the bill although we want a sunset clause but we have to get real about china too be it not obvious for week and indeed for month this be a so call private company but there be no such thing as a private company in china they be all under the cosh of the government under an autocratic regime what do they care about the steelworker in scunthorpe what do they care about our national interest never again colleague must we allow such a strategic industry to fall into the hand of the chinese the russians or anybody else 
 will the right hon gentleman clarify whether he be aware that the chinese company that be now in possession of british steel be sell it by a conservative government of which he be part 
 of course i be because i just say that i have just admit that it be a mistake but i ask everybody what they be say at the time of course there be silence it be easy to be wise after the event but i be worried about my steelworker i be worried about their future 
 rise 
 i give way to our former leader 
 i want to make sure that my right hon friend put the record straight some of we on the opposition benches warn the then government that it be wrong 
 there we be some of we apparently warn the government i do not know how many 
 we now know the true nature of our chinese friend we support the bill let we make our steel industry really competitive again and let we make great britain great again 
 rise 
 order can i make an appeal to everybody a lot of people want to speak and there be go to be some disappointment i think those whose constituent be actually go to be affect should be allow to speak but let we see how we go for time we need to be brief to get more member in let we have a good example from melanie onn 
 i be delighted to follow   the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh give his damascene conversion to socialism today he could be term the new red ed 
 i welcome the government ’s decisive action to bring security for worker at scunthorpe they be grasp the nettle after the can have be kick down the road for far too long british steel at scunthorpe be not just of interest to that town its importance emanate across northern lincolnshire to my constituent in great grimsby and cleethorpes whether directly or indirectly the employment and training opportunity that come from that single site be so important to our local economy and the product be of course nationally important when i consider the business that operate across the humber and northern lincolnshire i think the industry that be relevant to secure the future of steel seem strong from the siemens factory in goole to the boatyard of hull and the turbine off the cleethorpes coast the product that scunthorpe could have a role in produce be plain for we all to see 
 the government must turn their attention to the next step because the measure we be take today be not without risk unless we set a course for steel in the uk that closely align with our industrial strategy   this will be only another stick plaster for a site that have already be put through the wringer too many time over the year the power that the government seek today will protect the worker at british steel from any retaliatory measure that jingye may have seek to take that be welcome by those worker who have often feel at the mercy of the company ’s owner and unseen by the government 
 do my hon friend agree that major way in which we could secure market for british steel be through the british strategy that the ministry of defence have set out for the building of future warship 
 order mr roca have somebody texte a photograph outside this place of what be go on here this morning 
 indicate dissent 
 okay can people please not take or text photograph i do not know if that be the case here but your name have just be associate with it 
 i agree with my hon friend   the member for north durham luke akehurst it be imperative that we tie up all the initiative that this government be bring forward whether in defence or other critical area of industry to make sure we can secure the long term future of steel 
 to ensure the good chance of successfully secure a private partner or long term commercial solution the government must take all action available within their power and do all they can to make british steel viable i wonder whether now be perhaps the time for the government to look again at the carbon border adjustment mechanism the eu have already bring in the adjustment mechanism to protect against international steel dumping by do all we can whether by keep down energy cost as i know the minister have seek to do invest through the national wealth fund or indeed bring in the cbam this be our chance to secure a genuine long term solution for the preservation of british steel 
 it be a pleasure to follow   the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn my member of parliament on this matter we be in complete harmony before i talk about the local situation which be what i want to focus on may i thank the secretary of state for give i a call yesterday evening and outline the proposal he would be bring forward this morning i do say to he that i would not be entirely uncritical so i be sure he will not mind a few jab here and there 
 the local situation be extremely critical as have be point out the impact not only on the workforce but on the wide economy of northern lincolnshire would be extensive i have be a resident in the grimsby cleethorpes area all my life and i have see the impact when a town lose its core industry in the case of grimsby of course that be the deep sea fishing industry when that decline happen it have happen to so many town up and down the country as a result of the   decline in mining shipbuilding and other heavy industry it take a generation or perhaps more for the town to fully recover 
 that be the last thing i want to see happen in my neighbouring constituency of scunthorpe or to the hundred of my constituent who work there those member who be here for the easter adjournment debate there be a handful might have hear i say this only day ago but the site extend way beyond the bound of scunthorpe into my brigg and immingham constituency the site be the equivalent of wembley football pitch which give an idea   of its size and of the amount of work that would be need be the steelwork to close there would be demand for vast government investment over decade in order to remediate the site and to provide new employment 
 i say that i would not be entirely uncritical of the secretary of state so i refer he to my urgent question on this matter on   september   last year i say on that occasion 
 there have be widespread medium report suggest that coke will stop be import from october which would mean production would stop in scunthorpe by christmas there be rumour concern the fact that employee will be give notice very soon that be obviously create great anxiety among those directly employ by british steel and those in the supply chain which in northern lincolnshire extend to many thousand of people and many business ”—[official report   september vol c. 
 thankfully we have have a month reprieve from those threat in october but i have to say the government have be a little dilatory on this i appreciate that negotiation have be take place and ministers can not give away their negotiating position but i make this point as long ago as september as well as when you grant i an urgent question on   march mr speaker only a couple of week ago and surely the government be begin to realise at that point that the negotiation with jingye be go nowhere 
 i be extremely grateful to the hon gentleman for put that point on the record it be precisely because of those concern that we be able to have ready a legal route to intervene to directly offer support to purchase raw material what we could not have anticipate or expect be for a company to act in an irrational economic manner when such a clear distinctive and generous offer be make 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention i would say merely that he have be party to the negotiation and he must surely have realise that the company be not negotiate in good faith and expect his official to prepare legislation if require to deal with the situation that we be now in as other have say this be crucial not just for thousand of my constituent who work at the site but for the defence of the nation i assume and hope that defence ministers have be lobby the secretary of state to make their concern clear 
 locally there be continue concern like the father of the house my right hon friend   the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh i will support the    proposal i float the nationalisation issue on   march and i see this as a step stone to that situation to those who will perhaps demand nationalisation today i would say that this be a very complex issue and what matter more than anything else be the future of the workforce and the ability to produce virgin steel nationalisation legislation would not i sincerely hope be pass in hour it would involve a great deal of work 
 have get themselves into this situation the government be now take the right action there have be disappointment locally to put it mildly that the prime minister do not follow my question to he only day ago take up the option to meet a cross party delegation of mp to discuss the situation but now that we be where we be i fully support the government and i hope that they accept the sunset clause amendment which would be prudent i can assure they of my full support today which they will continue to have when they act in the good interest of my constituent 
 rise 
 order can we try to help each other by not speak for too long i hope we do not have ream of paper for the next speech bill esterson will be a good example of a short speech 
 well thank you mr speaker no pressure interruption i will put some of my paper down 
 may i start by praise the business secretary and his team for the way in which they have introduce the legislation i add to that my praise for trade union local management and members of parliament of both main party not least my hon friend   the member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin who be a minister be not speak in the debate i join he on a visit to scunthorpe where the very concern about jingye that we have hear today be share with we by local management and trade union alike it be no surprise that those concern have come to pass 
 the last government be warn and they choose not to take the action need minister in the last government tell i that steel need by the navy and by those across our economy could not be make at scunthorpe or at other steel plant interestingly the local management and the trade union tell i that they could make whatever their customer ask they to make by adjust production again it be a pity that the last government do not listen or we might be in a rather different place now during the last parliament we be the only country in the g20 where production of primary steel and steel overall be fall if the blast furnace be allow to close we would be the only country in the g20 without any primary steelmaking capacity which underline why today ’s legislation be so important 
 the steel at scunthorpe be of strategic national importance some of our rail track be make at scunthorpe and the steelwork there carry out automotive construction and defence production all of which be critically important to this country in addition to what be make now there be opportunity in energy transition   and defence some tonne of steel will be require over the next year in the offshore wind sector alone so there be great opportunity if we can secure the future of scunthorpe 
 at the liaison committee last tuesday the prime minister mention that the grid connection plan for the scunthorpe site be only due in our electricity price be above the average for international energy agency state the government have to address the challenge of slow grid connection and uncompetitive industrial energy price if they be to enable the modernisation of industry as a whole and steel in particular 
 the business and trade committee of which i be a member have hear evidence about the importance of the steel industry and about the need for primary steelmaking to be retain as a key pillar of uk industrial sovereignty we have hear that blast furnace still play a critical role in strategic and high grade steel production do my hon friend agree that our economic security be intrinsically link with our onshore industrial capability and that our government ’s focus on both construction and defence in these uncertain time mean that this bill be very welcome news 
 my hon friend make extremely well the point that our economic security and our national security be side of the same coin i be pleased to hear about the work be do by the business and trade committee in his excellent speech the committee ’s chair my right hon friend   the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne mention the sub committee that have be set up 
 i want to talk about port talbot because the energy security and net committee visit it week ago there will be a delay of several year between the closure last year of the blast furnace there and the opening of the new electric arc furnace which be a massive cause for concern in south wales and beyond the excellent financial support provide by this government and tata ’s willingness to engage be a good example of industry and government be partner and an indication that the industrial strategy that the government plan to bring forward be already be effective 
 the bill give the government the opportunity to secure steelmaking in this country i congratulate the secretary of state and his colleague on their decisive action worker and the nation as a whole be grateful for the work of this government who be do absolutely the right thing 
 my hon friend   the member for clacton nigel farage   and i have be call for british steel to be a strategic national corporation for some year we say to the previous administration that the last thing they should do be sell it to the chinese but they ignore our splendid advice the industry require long term investment the problem as we all know be that it have be beset by short termism and short term thinking as well as by the vast electricity cost in this country partly cause by net stupid and the carbon tariff 
 there be now a great opportunity for the house to unify as the secretary of state confirm we have the opportunity to take british steel into public ownership this weekend we would urge for the sum of £ we could do a great deal for the taxpayer we should invest in refurbishing and reline these blast furnace in the same way that the french be do in dunkirk they be spend a quarter of a euro in dunkirk and we should do the same we should bring in excellent global expertise to help british steel there will be opportunity if we do those thing and have long term procurement contract for raw material include the opportunity to use british coal from cumbria that be an opportunity that the government decline but it would create more job and save on transport cost there be also the opportunity for long term procurement contract for british steel product those be opportunity to make british steel a long term viable business for the taxpayer we can bring in long term patient capital if we do those thing we can get everything that we want primary steelmaking be a vital strategic asset and scunthorpe can be its epicentre 
 we will support the government ’s bill today but there be an opportunity to go far to be bold and to be courageous the secretary of state should show his cajone and show some mettle this weekend he and the government have the opportunity to remove the uncertainty for family in scunthorpe let we go for it let we nationalise british steel this weekend and make british steel great again 
 today i represent not only my constituent in neath and swansea east but those of my hon friend   the member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock after year of under investment and neglect by the previous government this government ’s commitment to steel be truly welcome however it be vital that the £ steel renewal fund already announce by the government be use to support the industry across the uk and wales need to get its fair share some steelworker lose their job in the region but they recognise that the circumstance in port talbot be different from those in scunthorpe 
 in port talbot half the steel production have already be shut down when the labour government come into power despite plaid cymru ’s desperate attempt to electioneer this as an issue it be impossible to reverse the deal that have already be strike between the previous tory government and tata although steelworker understand the urgency of the current situation and support the government ’s action to prevent further closure and job loss they need commitment for wales that will attract investment and create much need employment opportunity like those be offer by the float offshore wind industry it be too late to save the furnace in port talbot and the job be long go but investment in the area will bring new job and most importantly new hope to all our constituent 
 you   will not need reminding mr deputy speaker but i will remind the house of quite how unusual a day this be for   a variety of reason the last time we meet on a saturday be at a time of war and the last time we put a bill through in day be at the beginning of the pandemic that be how serious the disastrous circumstance in which we find ourselves be i assume that this house will accept the bill so i will address my comment directly to the secretary of state 
 at level this be a nationalisation in all but name bill because of the power it give the government indeed it actually give they more power than a nationalisation bill would it will allow the government to do thing that they could not do under a nationalisation bill frankly i would have vote for i be not a fan of nationalisation as the secretary of state will know but i would have vote for nationalisation i will vote for this bill for a simple reason it buy we time people have to understand that this be a reprieve not a rescue 
 i do not agree with   the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice   on his strategic nationalisation argument nationalisation under these circumstance buy the secretary of state time and leverage and he need to be able to use his judgment on how to use that time and leverage we have have just a hint of a view of how complex a game jingye be play in fact if i be to recommend any amendment to the bill it would be an amendment to limit to penny the amount of money that the government could pay to jingye because then no court could challenge that amount and jingye would know full well that it be not in line to make money out of the british taxpayer we have to look at this in strategic and tactical term 
 will the right hon member give way on that point 
 if the hon lady will forgive i i will not because lot of people want to speak i will refer to something she say in a minute so if she really need to intervene i will let she come in then we be try to manage a disaster a disaster for scunthorpe which be local to i as member of my community work at scunthorpe the knock on economic effect will be feel much more widely than in town this will affect thousand and thousand of people all round 
 this be also a disaster for our last primary steelmaker and steelmaking have suddenly become more important it be always an important part of national strategy but mr trump have make it a vital unavoidable piece of national strategy we have to create a circumstance that allow the secretary of state and the government to manoeuvre we through that as member have say that mean have an energy policy that make the plant viable not just viable when it be own by the state but commercially viable it mean have an energy policy under which we do not have the high energy cost of our competitor which we do now it also mean that we have to think very hard about carbon supply at the moment the technology do not exist that allow we to make primary steel without carbon supply so we have to think about that primary steel be a strategic supply so we can not rely on another country for it 
 i want to see this bill use in a way that give the secretary of state the time to deliver those thing but it must also give this house the right to see what he be   do and how the strategy be turn out nobody have get this right if those on the government benches want i to i can go back to and park blame but i do not want to do that today i want to make this viable we have to get our energy environmental and industrial policy all in line to make this work 
 to put this in context last year british steel lose about £ that be the september number this year it be about £ neither of those be small amount of money the treasury would shut down an operation if we just leave something like that run inside the government for very long we need a new strategy that cut our carbon emission without export our industry to the rest of the world i be afraid that most of our success in carbon reduction over the last decade or or have be by dint of export industry to other country often with much bad record than we in this case it would be china china have of the world market already it have massive excess in steel capacity and its steel capacity be the most carbon inefficient there be so we would actually be worsen the circumstance 
 the business and trade committee have take clear evidence that we need a carbon border adjustment mechanism so that carbon rich steel such as that from china be tax much more heavily crucially what be need on the table be the steel safeguard from the trade remedies authority to guard our market from a flood tide of chinese steel right now 
 i be afraid the right hon member be right the difficulty be that we be in a new world the terrible thing be the house will only ever hear i say this once that trump have a small point in some respect and we have to deal with the world as it be 
 move on to the sunset clause i can imagine that the instinct be not to put a sunset clause in the bill because we be deal with a difficult negotiator and put in a sunset clause would be put in a backstop when we put a backstop on ourselves we give the other side a negotiating advantage in his speech the secretary of state mention that the civil contingencies act would be a route for those who have not read that legislation we spend a year put it in place under the blair government and it have recourse to parliament at every turn minister be properly control it must be transparent and so on i suggest to he that at some point he might organise a transition to that so that the house have great control the coronavirus act do not have that it miss all those defence and look what happen to the policy as a result 
 this be what i would like to see recourse to parliament over the action the secretary of state take to manage the survival of scunthorpe and the policy to ensure its viability and in the post putin and trump era the security of supply we want to see all those thing and we can organise legislation to permit they i ask the secretary of state to take the house into his confidence and do this properly
