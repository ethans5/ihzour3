the secretary of state be ask 
 whether he be take step to improve animal welfare standard applicable to food import and export 
 we be committed to maintain high animal welfare and food standard since leave the eu we have put in place strong control on import and we be use brexit freedom to strengthen animal welfare standard even far by ban the export of live animal for slaughter interruption 
 order can i say to   the hon member for east londonderry mr campbell   that we be in the middle of a question and he have just walk right in front of the member ask it 
 yesterday the uk government implement a border target operating model in which a veterinarian must provide a health certificate for meat import from the eu meanwhile the uk australia free trade agreement which come into effect month ago be likely to lead to increase import of low cost product produce in australia use pesticide that be not permit in the uk and in the absence of veterinary check accord to the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animal australia have low welfare standard in many sector such as egg pigmeat production and chicken do the secretary of state accept that this asymmetry on standard of animal welfare be incoherent and pose a significant risk of contaminate the food chain with ban pesticide 
 the hon gentleman be mix up issue he mention australia and specifically egg if he actually look at the agreement with australia he would see that egg be exclude as be pork and poultry he be mix that up with the issue of food standard for import from europe of course if we do what his party would advocate and be still in the eu there would be no check at all 
 this week ian perks a constituent of mine have his entire shipment seize in france by over zealous french official because he miss out a single word on the export health certificate can the secretary of state please reassure i that we will find arbitration method to speed up the process of challenge these completely ridiculous situation 
 i know my hon friend champion very strongly the farming and food sector in his constituency and that he have raise this issue with my right hon friend the minister for food farming and fisheries who be actively engage on it of course a proportionate approach should always be take on these issue 
 whether his department be take step to help ensure profit in the food sector be fairly distribute 
 power in the agriculture act allow we to introduce statutory code of practice to improve market transparency and ensure fairness in the supply chain we will use these power whenever we find clear evidence of unfair practice so that all farmer get a fair price for their product 
 when will the minister wake up to the fact that since brexit food price have rocket my constituent can not afford to buy staple food be it not the truth that farmer be struggle they be get almost nothing for their milk their potato and the ordinary thing that man and woman buy in this country where be the money from these high price go because it be not to the farmer 
 i can tell the hon gentleman where the high price be they be in france and germany if we look at the value of a basket of good we see that in the uk they be low than they be in the european union if we have follow his model or his advice we would still be in the eu our retailer our farmer and our processor be work together and we want to see fairness in the supply chain we want fairness for the consumer and also for the farmer the retailer and the processor 
 yny môn farmer and the farming community be important to food production and their profit be vital to our anglesey island economy do the minister agree with aled jones the president of national farmers union cymru that welsh government sustainable farming scheme will have damaging consequence include the potential loss of job in the sector 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for how she campaign on behalf of her constituent i know that welsh farmer be very concerned about the welsh government ’s approach to welsh agriculture here in england we be try to support farmer in produce top quality food and look after the environment and i think the welsh government need to reflect on how they should influence their farmer to do exactly the same 
 what step he take be to support local authority to reduce litter and fly tipping in city 
 what step his department be take to tackle fly tipping 
 i know what a blight litter and fly tipping can be on local community which be why we have provide nearly £ to help council purchase new bin and almost £ to combat fly tipping while a furth £ will be award in the spring we have more than double the maximum fine that council can issue with all income from fly tip fine to be reinveste in enforcement and clean up our street from april to ensure that council can invest in crack down on crime 
 bring the wombles back 
 my constituent anger and frustration with litter and fly tipping have grow as £ worth of government cut to newcastle city council ’s budget have impact on service child in particular complain to i about have to play in rubbish my point plan for rubbish set out some of the additional power council need to address the scourge will the minister meet i to discuss it and will he back labour ’s plan for fix penalty notice for fly tipper 
 this government be take tough action on fly tipping which be why we have specifically allow council to collect those fine and ringfence they for prosecution and clean up the street it be important to note that it be conservative council that be go above and beyond in deal with the issue labour council be time bad than conservative council at deal with fly tipping crime 
 resident live in cobham road friar park in my constituency have recently experience fly tipping in the alleyway behind their property despite this be report by councillor month ago sandwell council have still not remove that rubbish apart from tell my constituent to vote conservative in may what further step can the minister take to ensure that council fulfil their duty to remove rubbish quickly my constituent in west bromwich east deserve well 
 i be disappointed to hear once again about the fly tipping that my hon friend ’s constituent be experience for the time in friar park we be give council extra power to crack down on fly tipping but of course it be up to council to use the power we be give they and it be important to note that the labour administration at sandwell council be once again the bad perform council in the country with prosecution for fly tipping last year that be despite this conservative government raise fix penalty notice for fly tipping from £ to £ and the government enable those council 
 i call ruth cadbury 
 hounslow borough be plague by fly tipping despite the council use all the power it can to address the problem spend large amount of money to do so and have a good rate of recycling fly tipping continue what be the government ’s timetable for respond to the public accounts committee report on the government ’s programme for waste reform 
 we be give council more power than ever before to deal with fly tipping we have raise the minimum penalty fine from £ to £ and be allow council to ringfence that money for prosecution and clean up their street it be disappointing to see from the stat that labour council be not use the power we be give they as much as they should 
 the penalty be insufficient if offender be garrotte with their own intestine there would be few of they 
 it be important to note that council can use the power that we be give they to apply increase penalty fine of £ the government want those penalty to be use so that we can drive down fly- tip in all council area 
 when his department plan to bring forward legislative proposal to ban the sale of horticultural peat 
 this government be absolutely clear about the need to end the use of peat product in horticulture in england the use of peat have halve since we signal that in and in august we announce that we would ban the sale of peat for use in amateur gardening we remain committed to legislate for that when parliamentary time allow in the meantime we be continue to work with the industry to explore way to help it transition completely to peat free working 
 uk peatland store over tonne of carbon which be more than all the forest in the uk france and germany combine the government be right to bring in proposal for a ban but that be back in and we have have no primary legislation yet the royal horticultural society which be commit to be peat free say that of the industry be wait for the legislation so it can get on with a ban across the whole sector the industry want to do it but it need the legislation urgently 
 i too have meet the rhs and go to see its wonderful experiment on peat free product very recently some of which the department for environment food and rural affairs put money into this government be commit to end the use of peat in horticulture in england and we will legislate as soon as parliamentary time allow i can assure my hon friend that in the meantime we be work closely with those who want peat free medium as well as the business   supply those grow medium a wide variety of work be go on include research and experiment as i have say peat use have halve and my hon friend might be interested to know that the forestry commission promise to go peat free 
 order i call jim shannon 
 i thank the minister for that very long response peatlands in northern ireland be extremely important they absorb water and moisture and improve the habitat this question be as important in this house as it be to we in northern ireland give that the northern ireland assembly will hopefully be up and run again will the minister have discussion with the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs minister to ensure that we can work together for the betterment of all 
 peatlands be such an important habitat so it be important that we work together that be why we be put huge amount of money into restore peatland in the upland and the lowland and we have just increase our sustainable farming incentive payment for that farmer can get more than £ a hectare to start to re wet peat 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i agree entirely with what   the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton   say we welcome the government ’s intention on peatland but the idea that this government after year be so fizz with new idea that they do not quite have the parliamentary time to get on with act on those intention be candidly laughable will the minister tell we what be actually happen we be expect legislation in this year ’s king ’s speech but it be not there there be an urgent need for it and it be support by industry will the government just get on with implement of the few popular policy they have leave 
 the hon gentleman should look at what we be do on peatland i have just mention it there be all the work to restore peatland both upland and lowland and all the work on pilot project so that farmer can transition to new crop to grow on peatland we have commit to ban the use of peat when parliamentary time allow 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help ensure public safety from dog attack 
 we have take quick and decisive action follow the concern rise in fatality there have be recent fatality we have now see dog owner register as part of the balanced approach we be take 
 follow the ban on xl bully dog owner will have apply for a certificate of exemption so that they can   keep their dog and as part of that the dog have to be neuter the british veterinary association have put forward a prudent neutering suggestion give the evidence that neuter large breed dog before they be month old can increase the risk of developmental orthopaedic disorder and other medical condition will the government take the reasonable small step of extend the neuter deadline to the end of june for those dog under month of age at   january 
 give my hon friend ’s expertise on this issue as parliament ’s only vet i listen closely to what he propose as he know neuter be a necessary population control and we have already respond to the great risk to dog of a young age by take action to extend the deadline i be happy to take away the proposal that he raise and look at the issue again 
 the deadline for register xl bully be o’clock yesterday i have be contact by a constituent who miss the deadline for financial and personal health reason many people up and down the country will genuinely have not be able to meet the deadline accord to the legislation they could face up to year in prison an unlimited fine and the destruction of that xl bully pet can the secretary of state advise i what step people in that position people who genuinely want to register might take to remedy this awful position 
 across the house we all want to ensure that a proportionate approach be take and that people register as quickly as possible we all see the risk in term of the harm and the attack that the house have be unite in addressing i be happy to look at any specific constituency case that the hon gentleman raise but the clear message be that people need to register as quickly as possible 
 what step he be take to support farmer through the environmental land management scheme 
 this year we be increase payment rate under environmental land management scheme through a average uplift and we be add about new action so that farmer can access the most comprehensive offer yet the sustainable farming incentive and countryside stewardship mid tier application process will be streamline make it easy for scheme to slot into farm business 
 i thank my right hon friend the farming minister for meet my farmer in wasdale last year i be sure that sure the journey through the english lake district be inspiration to provide those payment for stone wall 
 i have continue that conversation in a succession of farming policy information supper there be a keen desire among farmer to take advantage of elm what they be overwhelmingly ask for though be clarity about what to go for and when to go for it to achieve the most successful sustainable and profitable farm business 
 my hon friend be truly privileged to represent such a beautiful part of england we be collaborate with stakeholder to ensure that our scheme work for they we regularly communicate with they through the department for environment food and rural affair ’s farming blog by meet they at trade show through ministerial visit and through stakeholder organisation such as the national farmers union the country land and business association and the tenant farmers association we be also provide free business support to farmer and land manager in england through the future farming resilience fund grant and scheme for farmer be publish through our single funding page 
 i call the shadow minister 
 last week ’s report from the government ’s environmental watchdog the office for environmental protection be a damn indictment of the government ’s record it say they be largely off track with just of the target be achieve when it come to the environmental land management scheme can the minister tell the house just how much environmental improvement they have help farmer to deliver so far 
 i think that month into a year plan be probably too soon to judge that plan we be make huge stride with our stakeholder and farmer who be work up and down the country to improve the environment they have spend generation create that environment we should celebrate what they have achieve and we should encourage they to do more that be what the sustainable farming incentive be design to do and what the scheme be deliver 
 the minister do not know do he the government be spend large amount of public money but they do not set up a system to measure it the new secretary of state be generally on the money so i be sure he have ask this question what we be get for the money let i try a simple version of the question with elms so far have there be environmental improvement or environmental degradation or be it simply do not know 
 these thing be actually quite easy to see and to measure if we look at the hedgerow plant in england in the last decade we see that thousand of kilometre of hedgerow have be plant large area be be dedicate to biodiversity and create food for wild bird population that be what the sfi be deliver it be there to see all the hon member need to do be get out of cambridgeshire and look at some of those farm 
 whether he have have recent discussion with horticultural business on the operation of the windsor framework 
 defra official meet king seed on   january the department regularly meet a range of business   include through the working group establish with the horticultural trades association which meet most recently on   january 
 the minister will know that king seed be what be know as a well establish local business have be base in kelvedon since it trade in horticultural seed and be know for its sweet pea but as he will be aware it can not send its product to northern ireland which it say be because of barrier relate to the windsor framework will he clarify whether the announcement make early this week we will discuss the statutory instrument relate to they later today will resolve the issue if not will he work with i and team across government to ensure that we deal with the issue perhaps he would like to come to kelvedon to meet the company 
 as i say defra official meet king seed on   january i be more than happy to meet my right hon friend and the company to discuss its concern and see how we can support it in all its excellent work in her constituency 
 we appreciate the concern of king seed we be invite it to the new horticulture working group announce in yesterday ’s command paper along with industry representative the government will ask the group to address the movement of seed to consumer in northern ireland as a priority i look forward to hear its recommendation 
 i apologise for my early misdemeanour mr speaker 
 now that we have significant progress towards the restoration of devolution will the minister agree to work with dup members and his ministerial colleague to ensure that issue such as the horticultural continue to be resolve so that we have maximum efficiency across the north channel 
 i be delighted to work with the hon gentleman we have a track record of work with our dup friend to solve the challenge that we face that conversation can continue and i look forward to work with he to continue to solve those challenge 
 what step his department be take to help reverse biodiversity loss 
 this government have create a whole framework for restore nature through our legally bind environment act target which include our world lead commitment to halt the decline of specie by we be accelerate action towards that through our environmental improvement plan it be a shame i be not ask about this by the shadow minister but we have restore an area of wildlife habitat the size of dorset we have a network of marine protect area tree be plant last year we have plus landscape 
 order it be   the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds   who ask the question let ’s not have a personal battle across the chamber 
 ruislip northwood and pinner be home to many incredibly important site for biodiversity as be many of our london suburb do my hon friend agree that the new riverside park deliver by harrow council in partnership with the hatch end association be a good example of project that support biodiversity in our suburb 
 my hon friend be a great champion for his local area he be absolutely right we be work with a range of local partner and people to put nature at the heart of what we do i can not commend harrow council and the hatch end association enough for their work they be put in an apple orchard wetland and wildflower meadow which be a superb addition to his already beautiful constituency 
 environmentalist such as those at chester zoo be shock to see that the government have ignore the advice of their own expert and authorise the use of neonicotinoid pesticide for the year in a row will the minister tell i how that be line with our national and international obligation to reduce the overall risk from pesticide and how it reduce our biodiversity loss 
 the hon lady will know from read the detail of the derogation that those pesticide will be use only if they hit the criterion in many case they never do 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of environment agency funding level in the context of recent storm 
 the environment agency ’s budget this year be £ so around £ which be an increase of more than £ since we closely monitor the quantum and how we ensure we get value for money 
 follow the flooding the current foreign secretary the then prime minister state that money be no object as he agree a £ plan to protect the somerset level year on we be experience devastating flood with increase regularity what step be the secretary of state take to protect home in somerset from flooding and to ensure that floodwater be efficiently and effectively pump away from farmland 
 the hon lady raise an extremely important point flooding be devastating to homeowner business and farmer that be why in her part of the country we set up the somerset rivers authority partnership and secure an extra £ of target   funding for somerset that targeted action be enable the area to be more resilient but there be further work to do 
 severe winter storm drive many seabird inland and most leave after a few day but not cormorant the number of cormorant roost permanently inland have rise from year ago to about now they be have a huge impact on freshwater silver fish will the secretary of state meet i and representative of the angling trust an organisation i use to chair and other interested party to discuss this issue 
 it be always a pleasure to meet my hon friend he mention the important issue of seabird he will have notice yesterday ’s announcement of major positive step the no issue of the royal society for the protection of birds for the last year have be tighten up the overfishing of sand eel we be close english water to sand eel fishing which be hugely important to seabird particularly the puffin secondly we announce marine designate area to put that into context that be an area equivalent to the size of suffolk it be a huge step forward in protect seabird on which the uk have a lead position globally 
 hopefully emma hardy will get we back on track i call the shadow minister 
 i recently meet with farmer henry ward who show i the extensive and damaging flooding right across his farmland cause by breach in the river after a storm the environment agency be unable to tell he when it will have the resource to repair those breach this mean that henry not only lose all the crop that be flood but will be unable to plant a new crop in spring he be not the only farmer to be impact when will the government realise that their failure to be decisive and get ahead of the problem of weak defence be cost farmer their livelihood and 
 order we only get until o’clock to take advantage be just not fair we must have brief question from the front bench 
 not only have the water minister the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for keighley robbie moore be decisive he have meet the individual farmer the hon lady mention on his farm we be take action to look at how we can well empower the internal drainage boards—[interruption the hon lady chunter from a sedentary position i actually represent in the fen of the area where internal drainage board be most important i have work with they for year and the ministerial team be work actively with they now 
 whether he have have recent discussion with his eu counterpart on access to veterinary medicine in northern ireland 
 arrangement be in place through to the end of to support the continuity of the supply of veterinary medicine into northern ireland we be clear that we must also ensure a long term solution to safeguard those supply on an ongoing basis and we will continue to engage with the eu on all aspect of the operation of the windsor framework 
 continue restriction to veterinary medicine remain a very real threat to local agriculture the british veterinary association northern ireland branch president have say that a serious risk be pose to public health and animal welfare if a permanent solution for access to veterinary medicine in northern ireland be not find while the command paper signal a welcome focus on this issue with a work group to deal with it can the minister confirm that the government will act unilaterally by spring if it be not resolve 
 we will continue to work with the eu to try to find a long term solution of course we have to find that solution those negotiation be ongoing and i do not want to pre empt any of those discussion from the dispatch box but we do recognise that we need a long term solution to solve this challenge 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since i last update the house the government have be deliver on their plan to back british farmer we be now see an average increase of in our environmental farming payment so that farmer can protect our environment and continue to grow the food that we need recent storm have threaten the livelihood of many farmer which be why alongside the wide flood recovery framework i announce financial support of up to £ for farmer who have suffer uninsurable damage to their land 
 yesterday be the year anniversary of our environmental improvement plan i will not repeat the announcement we touch on early mr speaker give your steer on brevity finally it be worth remind the house that we have pass reading of the pet abduction bill which introduce strict sentence for those who steal dog and cat pet abduction cause huge trauma to family and to pet and we be take decisive action to address those crime 
 flooding have cause repeat damage to home across rural fylde last week i hold a multi agency meeting with fylde ’s flood authority which update i on the work carry out since our initial meeting last july from blocked culvert to overflow from highway and apparently insufficient drainage on newly build estate the cause be wide ranging at the meeting ’s conclusion i ask the agency to provide a write breakdown of their action plan will the minister meet i to discuss the plan and how his department can assist 
 as my hon friend know i be familiar with the fylde and the issue there i be always happy to meet he to discuss the issue he mention i be in contact with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities about new development and some of the wide issue that my hon friend have be raise 
 i call the scottish national party spokesman 
 the uk end the year as the only rich nation with food price inflation of more than and family buy food still face persistent price increase new brexit red tape affect european food import pose a further risk of rise inflation in the price of item such as bread milk and even baby formula may i again ask the secretary of state to commit himself to implement food price control if further brexit red tape lead to the food price hike that be be anticipate 
 such be the obsession with brexit in the snp that we hear no mention of the impact of the war in ukraine no mention of the farmer who be strike across the eu and no recognition of the huge amount of work on supply chain that be be do by my right hon friend the farming minister moreover the hon gentleman seem not to have notice the rapid review of label that we be conduct which be about empower consumer and ensure that the high animal welfare standard that we have in england be well reflect 
 i be sure the secretary of state have see report in that about a of the uk wheat crop have either rot in the ground because of the wet condition or be not drill at all supply of spring seed be very tight with many variety already sell out and while it be possible for some farmer to use farm save seed it be illegal for it to be trade between farm many farmer do not grow spring crop this year or indeed sell their crop at harvest be there a solution to the problem 
 i be very alive to this matter both because of the very good work that farmers weekly have do to highlight it and because my right hon friend as chair of the select committee have discuss it with i and my right hon friend the farming minister who be also discuss it with plant breeder we need to look at what we can do constructively work with they to deal with what be an entirely legitimate issue 
 accord to the recent report from the office for environmental protection the government be off track when it come to hit environmental target which include restore our waterway to health what will the government do to get back on track 
 as be mention early that report be base on month of datum within a year plan and be therefore somewhat premature in its judgment this be the government in the world to put legally bind target to reverse nature decline into law yesterday we mark the anniversary of those target at kew   and set out further proposal which have already be touch on we have also provide international leadership by put nature at the heart of tackle climate change at cop26 which be strongly reflect at cop28 
 the select committee have be consistently hold water company and regulator to account for the inexcusable level of sewage be illegally dump in our precious waterway but more can be do do my right hon friend agree that give our plan for water our record level of investment in monitor and improve water quality and the unlimited fine impose on water company while the opposition party have no affordable plan and just throw muck from the sideline it be this government who be actually get on with and deal with the issue 
 my hon friend be right in say that we have a plan and that a great deal have be do he be also right that more can be do and i reassure the house that i be entirely committed to do it we will hold the water company to account that be my absolute intention 
 springwater park in my constituency suffer from regular flooding during storm which cause landslip and movement approach the highway unfortunately it fall outside established funding pot from scheme such as bellwin so we keep be bounce between the department for levelling up housing and communities and defra will the minister meet i along with representative of bury council to see what we can do to address the problem 
 the government be invest in ongoing project in the hon gentleman ’s constituency include the radcliffe and redvales flood risk management scheme and we be double our investment in flood alleviation scheme from £ to £ over the next year funding round however i be of course happy to meet he 
 my constituency be home to many international food and drink manufacturer include general mills and coca cola both of which be seek to expand their operation here in the uk will my right hon friend update the house on the work be do to help such manufacturer to expand and grow for the benefit of our local and national economy 
 we have regular meeting with the food and drink sector to ensure that we be in tune with its concern and aspiration those discussion will continue and we will continue to support great business such as coca cola in my hon friend ’s constituency support british job and generate benefit for the uk economy 
 town and village such as maulden and shefford in my constituency have see their flood risk profile change dramatically over the year partly owe to housing   growth how will the minister ensure that funding for the environment agency and internal drainage board adequately reflect the way in which that risk have evolve 
 improve our flood alleviation scheme and our flood resilience be incredibly important which be why the government be recognise the amount of investment we need to put into it we be double that investment from £ to £ over the next year period the sort of scheme we be help will assist project across the country to deal with those problem 
 do my right hon friend recognise that drift net fishing for bass be more sustainable targeted and efficient than fish with set net will he reconsider the ban which be introduce as a temporary measure in order to allow those with an exist bass entitlement to undertake drift net fishing 
 bass stock be still recover from poor spawning period and overfishing the bass fishery management plan commit to review exist commercial access include gear type such as drift net which pose a high risk to sensitive specie and bass fish a careful balance must be strike between increase fishing opportunity and protect vulnerable bass stock but i assure my right hon friend that these matter will remain open 
 since april last year thousand of home in my constituency have suffer from a fly infestation assume to originate from a recycling plant will the minister meet i and the environment agency to get this resolve 
 i be more than happy to meet the hon gentleman to try to deal with these issue because for this government deal with waste and recycling be incredibly important if the challenge be have an impact on householder we need to get on top of this and i be to meet he to discuss it 
 walleys quarry in the constituency of my hon friend   the member for newcastle under lyme aaron bell be stink again with monitoring station show high level of hydrogen sulphide and with complaint soar the site be blight my constituent too and the environment agency now say the owner be no long work towards compliance it be long past time that the permit be revoke and the company prosecute will the minister come to staffordshire to witness the stink and see the sorry sight for himself 
 when he do can he take the licence away from the at cuerden in chorley 
 i always listen closely to your steer mr speaker my hon friend raise an extremely important issue which i know be very troubling to those affect the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend   the member for keighley robbie moore   be go there in the come day and i can assure she that this be be discuss and actively follow up 
 food price inflation remain twice as high as general inflation in the uk and the energy and climate intelligence unit warn that it could rise even high next year what assessment have the secretary of state make with his colleague of the impact of soar food price on those we represent 
 of course we continue to monitor food price inflation and work with the sector to reduce it as much as possible we co operate with not only farmer processor and retailer but all those involve in the sector to try to make sure that we provide a reasonably price food basket for our constituent the good news be that the cost of our food basket in the uk be low than that find in many part of the european union 
 on a point of order mr speaker in response to question the secretary of state attribute another party ’s position on europe to my party the alba party ’s position on europe be to opt for the european free trade association thus maintain sovereignty over fishery and farming i would be grateful if the secretary of state would correct the record 
 i call the secretary of state 
 such be the confusion within the scottish national party that i hope the house forgive i for the mistake i recognise that the hon gentleman have change his party and now be an alba member i be happy to correct the record 
 on a point of order mr speaker i would like your advice on the scheduling of business today a number of people 
 sorry but that be not relevant to the question we have just have the only way the hon gentleman can raise that as a point of order be by do it after we have do all the question we now have question to the attorney general 
 the attorney general be ask 
 what step she be take to help ensure effective prosecution of perpetrator of fraud and economic crime 
 what step she be take to help ensure effective prosecution of perpetrator of fraud and economic crime 
 what recent step her department have take to increase prosecution rate for fraud and economic crime 
 the crown prosecution service and the serious fraud office play a crucial role in bring economic criminal to justice indeed this month the sfo charge company director with fraud in relation to a car lease scheme into which hundred of british saver pay about £ 
 the horizon post office scandal have appal the nation hundred of sub postmaster be wrongly prosecute and convict and many be jail although they be entirely innocent of any fraud on the other hand covid-19 fraud be know and real estimate put it as high £ yet we have not claw back a fraction of what have be steal why be the innocent leave to rot for so long while the guilty go free to enjoy the fruit of their covid crime 
 the hon lady be absolutely right about the appalling miscarriage of justice i agree entirely with everything she say about horizon and the post office as she know step be be take to address that and work be ongoing on covid crime the attorney general and i meet regularly with the serious fraud office and the crown prosecution service to press for action on whatever be the press issue of the day the cps have charge a number of individual in relation to precisely the fraud activity she refer to 
 be the solicitor general aware that the home affairs committee be currently look at the whole issue of fraud and find a huge problem with everything from romance fraud to fraud financing terrorism clearly there be an urgent need for much well join up work between agency and information sharing in this country as well as on the international front what discussion and experience have he have on which nation prosecute fraud more effectively than we do in this country 
 my hon friend raise an excellent point i commend he for his work on the home affairs committee and look forward to the result of that work which we will consider carefully the attorney general and i meet regularly with the sfo and the cps to assess good practice and to see where lesson may be learn both internally and from abroad intelligence sharing go on between the respective agency in any event and we will look at what lesson can be learn from good practice here and abroad to take forward the point he raise 
 in the past year law enforcement agency include the cps proceed of crime unit have confiscate £ from criminal those agency get to keep a tiny percentage of recovered asset and virtually no fine to help they continue their work why be the government enfeeble the very organisation it rely on to win the fight against economic crime why will they not adopt labour ’s invest to save model of enforcement 
 i commend the work of the enforcement agency which have rightly crack down on the fraudulent activity the hon gentleman refer to he be right that the government have tirelessly pursue   criminal with a view to recoup money to prevent those criminal from benefit from their ill get gain among a number of positive outcome have be £ be return to victim 
 i thank the solicitor general for provide detail about what be happen but since the pandemic fraud have cost the public purse more than £ much of that relate to the government ’s own scheme public resentment be understandable because at the same time prosecution for fraud and money laundering have go down by more than since do the solicitor general agree that the time have come for more action and that we should seriously consider an economic crime fighting fund to reinvest seize asset and profit into improve law enforcement against fraud 
 the hon lady be right that this be matter of huge public concern and understandably so the government work very hard during the pandemic to ensure that support be provide but clearly where people have take advantage of a system that must be pursue that be why we be look at the fraud strategy for example and the economic crime plan part we will continue to drive forward to see what further action can be take 
 every day old and vulnerable people be prey upon by fraudster and scammer be it online by phone or on the doorstep will my hon friend reassure my constituent and the country that the conservative government the police and the criminal justice system will do all they can to bring those immoral criminal to justice 
 yes i can my hon friend be right to draw attention to this as people be take advantage of be of the great issue of our age it happen to member of society of all kind but particularly to those who be elderly and vulnerable work continue on a number of sector charter which have be successful in bring forward positive outcome for example scam text have be block we have take forward work on the online safety act as well as the charter i refer to but i assure my hon friend we will continue to see what more can be do 
 i call the shadow minister 
 it be year since the former anti fraud minister lord agnew resign in embarrassment over the government ’s oversight of covid business loan scheme describe it as nothing less than woeful can the solicitor general tell we in the past year how much of the miss billion seemingly write off by the prime minister as chancellor have be recover and what the government be do now to chase down the covid crook 
 the hon gentleman be right to draw attention to this the public quite rightly expect the money that the government advance in good faith to help those who be challenge during the pandemic not to be the victim of fraudulent activity intelligence sharing go on between the serious fraud office which as he know prosecute the most serious case   and the crown prosecution service which have already charge a number of individual we will continue to do that both from our perspective and with the law enforcement agency to make sure that the crook to whom he refer be pursue 
 what recent assessment she have make of the compatibility of the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill with the european convention on human right 
 i would like to assure the house that the government respect their international obligation the law officer convention prevent i from disclose outside government whether i have give advice or even what the context of any such advice might be the bill to which the hon gentleman refer be currently in the other place and will i be sure be discuss very fully there 
 just this week we hear medium report that rwandans have be grant refugee status in the uk in the past month cite well- found fear of persecution at the same time the government would like we to accept that rwanda be a safe country despite the home office accept that those individual face a real threat of persecution can the attorney general tell we how we can send asylum seeker to rwanda under those circumstance 
 we be ask parliament to look at the matter afresh not just to look at the fact as they be before the supreme court but to look at new circumstance evidence be publish on   january   to assist parliament in those deliberation we have assurance from the government of rwanda that the implementation of all measure within the treaty will be expedite and we will ratify the treaty when we be ready to do so 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 journalist and blogger who criticise the government be arrest threaten and put on trial with allegation of torture disappearance and suspicious death those be just some of the issue that human rights watch and amnesty have report on in rwanda when ask parliament to disregard establish legal principle such as the burden of proof and the need for evidence be the attorney general genuinely comfortable in pass the rwanda bill 
 it be constitutionally proper for parliament to legislate in response to a decision of the supreme court we do it all the time in the finance and tax space lord reed be careful to point out to the constitution committee in the other house that we do it follow the burmah oil case in the war damage act in this case i urge the hon lady to look hard at the evidence that the government put before the house on   january if the bill pass everyone must treat rwanda as generally safe for the transfer of individual under the treaty 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for case relate to violence against woman and girl 
 what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for case relate to violence against woman and girl 
 we be steadily increase the number of rape case send to the crown court we be prepare to launch a joint justice plan which will transform how the police and the crown prosecution service investigate and prosecute domestic abuse case 
 i will welcome my friend andriy kostin the ukrainian prosecutor general who be not quite here yet because his plane have not arrive in my office after question the relevance of that be that a team of uk expert be support his office to investigate and prosecute case of conflict relate sexual violence in ukraine 
 last july the then solicitor general   the hon and learn member for mid dorset and north poole michael tomlinson tell the house in a write answer to   the hon member for strangford jim shannon 
 a new vawg strategy for be be develop for publication later this year 
 that year have come and go as have that solicitor general so can the attorney general tell we the status of the strategy and its content who the government be consult and when it will be publish 
 the hon lady take a long term interest in these affair and she i have discuss they for many year i reassure she that a great deal of work have be do the work in the rape sphere which i reference early be very commendable after have a really difficult time in prosecute rape for many year we be back up to level and indeed be exceed they the joint justice plan which will build on the rape work in the domestic abuse sphere will be ready very shortly we be say in the spring but i think she will have to wait only a few week 
 the home affairs committee carry out an inquiry into the investigation and prosecution of rape of our very clear recommendation be that police force need to have specialist unit to investigate rape for case to proceed to the cps and hopefully to court we know that we get well decision making and communication with victim and the cps if we have those specialist officer be the attorney general as surprised as i be that not all police force have those specialist unit to deal with rape and sexual assault 
 the right hon lady who do sterling work on the home affairs committee know that the police be not directly under my supervision but i be proud to talk about the very close co operation between the police and cps specialist in this field   which have really help together with some great granularity and push on the statistic to drive up rape prosecution she will be glad to know that in her area of yorkshire and humberside the number of suspect charge with rape have increase significantly over the last year 
 my newton aycliffe constituent zoey mcgill suffer from appal knife crime when her son jack woodley be kill in she be now suffer again as of the perpetrator be use social medium from custody to glorify himself do the attorney general agree that such action should be prosecute and that the consequence should be publicise to ensure that they become a deterrent against other glorify themselves from our prison 
 my hon friend highlight a horrific case that be why it be so important that we crack down on mobile phone use and indeed mobile phone existence within prison the government have put in £ to ensure that prison have airport style security to ensure that it be much more difficult for phone to get in incident such as he raise be very serious and i commend he for do so as well as his constituent zoey and the northern echo which i understand have be campaign on the issue 
 how many prosecution have be bring by the serious fraud office for case of fraud connect with covid-19 a contract and b financial support scheme 
 the serious fraud office have bring no prosecution for case of fraud connect with covid-19 the sfo deal only with the most complex and serious economic crime so the vast majority of such case would not fall within its remit the sfo work closely with other law enforcement agency to ensure that intelligence be share and the investigation be handle by the most appropriate agency 
 it be staggering to hear the solicitor general refer to this as not serious or imply that it be not serious in the level of fraud report by his majesty ’s revenue and customs in covid-19 financial support scheme sit between £ and £ with less than £ be recover consider that the uk government have already write off an alarming £ that they spend on protective equipment buy during the pandemic will he commit to routinely publish account include the number of prosecution and the cost of recovery for covid-19 contract and support scheme 
 the hon gentleman misunderstand my point the sfo deal with the most complex scheme not for a would i have suggest that any such fraud be not serious of course it be but the vast majority of the crime to which he allude would be deal with by the cps indeed the cps have charge a number of individual with precisely those sort of crime 
 what recent discussion she have have with the director of public prosecutions on his priority for the crown prosecution service 
 i have regular meeting with the director of public prosecutions his priority align closely with those of the government namely tackle delay combat violence against woman and girl enhance our work with victim and drive improvement across the system 
 it appear that almost every week on our street we see hate fill demonstration with antisemitism rife yet no action seem to be take the end result be that my hon friend   the member for finchley and golders green mike freer   have announce his decision to leave this place because of antisemitism and the threat against his person will my right hon and learn friend the attorney general take up the matter with the cps to ensure that that be the last such case and that antisemitism be prosecute properly in the way it should be 
 my hon friend raise an important and serious matter i reassure he that i have be work closely with the cps which in turn be extremely close to the police to deal with these very significant issue the cps have be embed in the control room during the most serious of the march that have take place 
 i also reassure my hon friend that a large number of prosecution have already start most of the one that have come to conclusion be necessarily guilty plea because prosecution take time but we all see sadly a large uptick in that horrible crime after   october   last year and we be just start to get to the phase when trial be begin where people have not plead guilty i hope he will take some reassurance from my answer and that he will come and see i so that i can talk he through some of the work we be do 
 do the attorney general agree that a key priority for the cps must be fix the flawed way that joint enterprise law be use and do she agree that no should ever be convict of a crime that they make no significant contribution to 
 i know the hon lady be a long- time campaigner on joint enterprise and i also know that the lord chancellor my dear friend in this place have also consider such matter very carefully 
 what recent step she have take with cabinet colleague to ensure the rule of law be uphold within government 
 i have always be clear that the rule of law be fundamental to our constitution and it be the duty of the law officer to   uphold it as i emphasise in my speech at the institute for government last summer and in my appearance before the house of lords constitution committee i take that duty very seriously indeed i engage not only with colleague across government but with student and other young people to ensure that the rule of law be protect not just now but for generation to come 
 the horizon scandal have raise many important legal question range from the reliance on flawed evidence to the slow pace of the justice system in correct miscarriage of justice will the attorney general now address the implication for the power of organisation such as the post office to pursue private prosecution and in particular what oversight the crown prosecution service can or should have over the use of those power 
 i thank the hon lady for her serious question and would like she to rest assure that these matter be be consider very carefully within government the immediate priority be to take bold and novel action to right in so far as we can the wrong that have come about through the horizon scandal but a slow timed but nevertheless urgent piece of work be to make sure that private prosecution be sufficiently scrutinise and inspect in future 
 do my right hon and learn friend agree that the leaking of law officer advice for political or any other purpose be not only a breach of the very important law officer convention respect the confidentiality of legal advice but damage to the public interest and contrary to the rule of law 
 my right hon and learn friend make a characteristically significant intervention have serve as both solicitor general and attorney general he will know very well the importance of the law officer convention to the working of government legal professional privilege generally be a very important construct and something on which the client relationship rely in government it be if anything even more significant and when law officer advice be leak it have a chilling effect on our ability to provide free frank and honest advice to the rest of government that be something i wholeheartedly deplore and i agree with everything my right hon and learn friend say 
 i call the shadow attorney general 
 we have all read with deep concern last week ’s interim ruling from the international court of justice regard the situation in gaza and labour be absolutely clear that hamas must release all remain hostage immediately that israel must comply with the icj ’s order in full that the judgment of the court must be treat with respect and that all party must comply with international law as part of an immediate humanitarian truce and a sustainable ceasefire i ask the attorney general very simply do she agree with i on all those point and be it the official position of the government to accept the authority of the court in this matter and even more importantly to urge israel also to accept the authority of the court and to implement its order in full as a matter of urgency 
 the right hon lady be right to call for international humanitarian law to be respect and civilian to be protect in gaza and i join she in that call we be deeply concerned about the impact of what be happen on the civilian population in gaza    too many have be kill and we want to see israel take great care to limit its operation to military target we regularly review israel ’s commitment to ihl and i believe that we in this house all call for an immediate pause that will allow aid to get in and hostage to come out 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on afghan relocation and assistance policy eligibility for afghan special force 
 i be grateful for the opportunity to update the house on development relate to the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme and to answer the specific question raise by the hon gentleman in relation to former member of commando force and afghan territorial force 
 many colleague across the house be passionate advocate for applicant to the arap scheme whether they serve shoulder to shoulder with they in afghanistan or represent applicant and their family member who be resident in their constituency we owe a debt of gratitude to those brave individual who serve for with or alongside our armed force in support of the uk mission in afghanistan defence be determined to honour the commitment we make under the arap scheme which be why we have robust check in place and regularly review process and procedure 
 although many former member of the afghan specialist unit have be find eligible under arap and safely relocate to the uk with their family a recent review of process around eligibility decision demonstrate instance of inconsistent application of the arap criterion in certain case the issue relate to a tranche of application from former member of afghan specialist unit include member of cf and atf know as the triples have identify this issue through internal process we must now take necessary step to ensure that the criterion be apply appropriately to all those individual 
 as such i can confirm that the ministry of defence will undertake a reassessment of all eligibility decision make for application with credible claim of link to the afghan specialist unit the reassessment will be do by a team independent of the that make the initial eligibility decision on the application the team will review each case thoroughly and individually a write ministerial statement to that effect be table this morning and i commend it to colleague a further dear colleague letter will follow by close of business tomorrow 
 it be the case however that arap application from this cohort present a unique set of challenge for eligibility decision making some serve in their unit more than decade ago and some while the afghan state apparatus be still in its infancy or yet to come into existence all together it be also the case that they report directly into the government of afghanistan mean that we do not hold comprehensive employment or payment record in the same way as we do for other applicant 
 i fully understand the depth of feeling that arap evoke across this place and beyond i thank member from across the house for their ongoing advocacy and support for arap we have that same depth of feeling in the mod and in government and we will now work quickly to make sure that the decision be review and change if that be necessary 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question 
 the triples afghan special force train and fund by the uk be some of the top target for taliban reprisal around triples face imminent deportation from pakistan to afghanistan and at least member of the triples be report to have be murder by the taliban since the withdrawal from kabul minister have allow medium speculation to build for almost a week before set out to parliament today the government ’s plan to u turn and look again at the application 
 the minister highlight inconsistency in process the application failure flaw how be that allow to happen on his watch how long will the review take and what new information will be factor in tragically today ’s decision could be too late for many do the minister know how many of the triples who be wrongly deny support have already be deport to afghanistan torture or kill what conversation have he have with pakistan to halt deportation of those who could now be grant sanctuary there be no time to waste 
 the least the triples deserve be clarity over arap policy but for month a public spat have play out between the minister for veterans affairs and the minister for armed forces we should all remember that the people who matter here be those afghans who have be leave in limbo fear for their life and their future that be why clarity matter britain ’s moral duty to assist afghans be feel most fiercely by those in the uk force who serve alongside they many of whom sit on both side of the house british personnel who have offer reference to former triples say that they be never even contact by the ministry of defence many of their arap application be deny will such basic error happen again or will that be review properly 
 the british public do not understand why afghan special force personnel who serve and fight alongside our troop and who be eligible for safety have not yet receive sanctuary here will the minister now sort this out 
 i know that the hon gentleman who have be advocate for some case and be as passionate about the matter as anybody will feel aggrieved as will many colleague around the house the responsibility of any minister be to own any failure of process that happen in their department and i accept that responsibility 
 the reality be that these be very difficult decision to make the hon gentleman say that the triples be fund by the uk government that be not entirely accurate they be fund as a donor alongside many other donor into the government of afghanistan who fund the unit as he will well know from colleague on his own benches who command unit that work closely with the triples top up payment be make in order to generate loyalty and frankly to avoid the triples be poach by other coalition partner which have similar force of their own 
 the record of those top up payment be very ad hoc i take my responsibility for accuracy to the house seriously and i can tell the hon gentleman in all seriousness that we have look for employment record and none of those ad hoc record of additional payment be available to we we have speak to colleague who have experience of these matter in the house and   beyond to ask for any record that they have but even then a lot of the record produce be those that be put together by charity advocate for the triples rather than contemporary record of those top up payment 
 the reality be that whatever the challenge have be some decision be make in an inconsistent way that be why they must be review we will aim to get the review do as quickly as possible we anticipate that it will take around week before that we need to put in place the people who will do the review who will be independent of everything that have go before in the instance it will be a review of the robustness of the decision themselves and where it find that decision be not robust we will of course seek new information both from the applicant and from colleague in the house who have advocate for they 
 the shadow minister make some good point about what this mean for people who be in pakistan it be impossible to say who of those who be not already in the pipeline as approve applicant have be deport we do not track that so i can not answer his specific question but of course we will alert the government of pakistan to those who be include within the review so that they can enjoy the same protection from deportation as those who have already be approve and be await their onward move to the uk 
 the shadow minister necessarily point to the politic and the alleged disagreement among conservative members that be the nature of his role but i be simply not motivate by such thing the reality be that we be try our good to bring as many people to the uk from afghanistan as possible some decision be relatively straightforward because we hold the employment record but other be far more complicated although there have undoubtedly be some decision that be not robust and need to be review i put on record that the people involve in make those decision across the mod have be work their hard and do their good i stand up for their service and for what they have do and i take responsibility for their shortcoming 
 i have be approach by people who be involve in train these soldiers—333 and bost and they tell i that they be the most loyal brave and most effective soldier who be operate in afghanistan as a result they be the soldier the taliban fear the most which i guess be why the taliban have be execute they in front of their family whenever they catch they 
 the minister rightly say that we owe they a debt of gratitude but this be more than that it be a debt of honour can we ensure that both in our administration and in our relationship with pakistan we do everything to deliver on that debt of honour as quickly as possible 
 we certainly will it be important to mention that the government of pakistan have often be the subject of question in relation to arap over the past year or so in my experience they have be incredibly co operative we be hugely grateful to they for that 
 the limit on the speed of flow be not any problem with the government of pakistan but the challenge of get people out of afghanistan the reality be that   no matter how many decision we review and no matter how many additional people we add as eligible for the scheme there be a limit to how fast we can move people over the border into pakistan that will take time 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i thank the shadow minister   the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard for secure this urgent question 
 the department ’s late number show that people have be grant entry to the uk and that have be give indefinite leave what have happen to the remain individual be they still wait for a decision have any be eject as other have say those who be target by the taliban can not wait the minister indicate to the shadow minister that we be about to have discussion with pakistan but what discussion have already take place we be all concerned that pakistan be eject people 
 finally the fear of persecution due to religion or political belief be a qualifying factor under the refugee convention what consideration have the mod give to the compatibility of that qualifying factor with the arap scheme 
 to take the hon gentleman ’s last point the mod be not consider asylum claim which be a separate matter for the home office the mod be consider the case of people who claim to have serve alongside uk armed force although i do not doubt the seriousness of the right to asylum the mod make no decision in that regard we have no responsibility for that part of immigration policy 
 turn to indefinite leave to remain i will need to write to the hon gentleman with the detail because my understanding of the immigration status of those approve to come to the uk under arap be that they have it immediately they be effectively citizen in that they have the right to immediately come here live and work there be no further immigration phase require after their arrival because the approval of their visa to come afford they all the right that indefinite leave afford they in the place however i will write to the hon gentleman to confirm that my understanding be correct and that he have not pick up something that i be not aware of 
 on pakistan i refer the hon gentleman to my early answer i genuinely could not wish for well engagement from the pakistan government with our high commissioner in islamabad and i be grateful to the pakistani high commissioner to london who have similarly make himself available to i whenever i have need to speak to he the issue with people in pakistan be challenge pakistan have a very large cohort of people whom the pakistan government regard as illegal migrant and whom they be seek to deal with that be their sovereign choice as a nation and it be not for we to tell they that they must not however where we have be able to tell they that people be part of our scheme those people have be protect from deportation for that we be very grateful indeed 
 far to the question ask by my right hon friend   the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis we clearly   owe these individual a debt of honour what assessment have the minister make of the number of people who be affect and how many family there be what be the ministry of defence do to reach out to the family of these brave man and woman to ensure they can come here as they should have the right to do 
 we think that about decision need to be look at again some of those will be entirely the right decision they just be not write up and document particularly well so it be difficult to say at this moment how many of the case that we will review will require further scrutiny what i can say to my hon friend be that once we have carry out that initial review of the robustness of the decision that be take we will notify people if their case be up for review and additional information might be require while i will set out the detail of that process in the dear colleague letter that will follow my expectation be that we will also reach out at that point to any colleague in the house who have advocate for that case so that they be aware that it be up for review and can similarly put forward whatever evidence they have 
 i be grateful to the minister for meet with i recently to discuss this matter but give the unique nature of the relationship between uk force and the triples and give the commitment that have be make previously it be beyond bewilder that we have not get to this point soon the minister speak about instance of inconsistent application of arap criterion in certain case and have say that he take responsibility for that but can he give an assurance today that he will work at pace to put it right and what do he think it will mean for our international reputation will people trust we in the future 
 i be grateful for the constructive engagement that the hon gentleman have have with the department ever since the evacuation from kabul our meeting the other day be most instructive and much of what he say cause we to reflect in the way that we have do he should take much credit for that 
 we be work at pace the hon gentleman have my assurance that we will continue to do so but we have be do so all along this be an incredibly difficult process that be consume ever large amount of horsepower within the department and rightly so because we owe these people a debt however as have come up previously at defence question we must be careful not to set the expectation among our partner force that everywhere that the uk armed force operate now and in the future there will be an immigration angle to such partnering i accept that there be reputational damage to the mod and that have an effect on my reputation too that be right that be ministerial accountability but i push back gently against the idea that it will have an impact on the willingness of partner force to work with we i do not think it be helpful if partner force think the reward for work with we be a visa that do not work at all 
 i appreciate the minister ’s comment and his commitment today but it be more than year since the chaos of the collapse of the operation in afghanistan and this surely have come much too late there be still many people not just the triples but interpreter and people who work   alongside the force trap in country that be hostile and threaten they with transportation back to afghanistan can he commit today to ensure with some urgency that all case be look at quickly and speedily and that we get as many people to safety as possible 
 the case be be look at urgently in the wide arap cohort that the hon member describe that process have be much easy some time ago i direct the excellent official who work on this instead of work through the pile of application to go to the employment record we hold for interpreter and other locally employ civilian and to focus on find they in the pile of application rather than go through all the application that may be spurious or less credible we will do so as quickly as we can but it take time and even once eligibility decision have be take if people be undocumente and many of the arap cohort be it be incredibly challenging to get they out of afghanistan and into a safe country and that limit our rate of flow enormously 
 on those in other country we do all that we can through the excellent staff in our embassy and high commission to facilitate their movement out of those country however there be some country with whom we have quite challenging diplomatic relationship particularly at the moment and that make it particularly difficult that do not mean that we do not keep try and i be very grateful to our ambassador and high commissioner for their effort but fundamentally we can not tell sovereign country what to do 
 back in september the minister for veterans affair tell this house that about afghans be access homelessness support and that be after the government have evict afghans include arap personnel from uk hotel could the minister confirm that there be still afghans access homelessness support 
 i will need to write to the hon member on that 
 due to the high number of former afghani soldier whose life be at risk as long as they remain in afghanistan what conversation have the minister have with cabinet colleague on the possibility of additional safe route to the united kingdom 
 these thing be discuss regularly as the hon gentleman would imagine there be an additional route to the united kingdom in the afghan citizen resettlement scheme indeed our arap and acrs offer cover all afghan citizen who serve alongside our armed force or work alongside our diplomatic mission or who be simply prominent in afghan government and society and for whom we therefore feel that relocation be necessary for their protection up to a point arap and acr be match not quite in their generosity but in their scope by scheme in many other country that be a part of the nato force in afghanistan and/or the wide donor community for afghanistan so the opportunity for people to leave afghanistan and resettle elsewhere be enormous we should be proud of the uk scheme which today ’s announcement   notwithstanding be incredibly generous we be move at the good pace we can to move people out of a country where that be very difficult 
 i think   the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis   could not have put it well when he talk about the debt of honour we owe all those who serve with our armed force in afghanistan i be sure that member on all side of the house will be appal at the fact that year later the situation be still not completely resolve the minister rightly highlight the challenge pose by lack of documentation in some case but give that for those individual obtain documentation will often mean apply to a taliban control passport office will the minister say how the government be ensure that those affect have a route to get the necessary documentation in a safe and efficient manner 
 no i be not go to share that detail with the house because it be in absolutely nobody ’s interest for the taliban to know how we be do that 
 i call jim shannon 
 i think happy birthday be in order madam deputy speaker if you be like i you do not count the year you just make the year count 
 i thank the minister for his very positive answer i ask this question simply because i meet a gentleman in pakistan about month ago on this issue he work for the british army alongside those in the special force so it be wonderful news that special force in afghanistan will have their application review i wholly welcome that but want yet again to highlight the need to do the right thing by other as well as those who put their life on the line in afghanistan as part of the rebuilding effort and who have find themselves hide away out of sight in pakistan for example because they be not yet safe i ask the minister for consideration to be give to review of application for interpreter and those who provide sustained assistance to our force and who live life in darkness and in fear 
 as i say in response to early question the interpreter and those who work alongside we in a support function be much easy to find within the pilot application because we have the employment record and be therefore able to confirm their service easily if the hon gentleman would like to write to i about the specific case raise with he i will endeavour to get he answer as quickly as i can 
 be 
 to ask the leader of the house if she will give we the forthcoming business 
 the business for the week commence   february   will include

 may i wish you a very happy birthday as well madam deputy speaker 
 i start by express our profound regret that   the hon member for finchley and golders green mike freer   have decide to step down due to fear for his safety and that of his family the recent attack on his office be horrific that any member be force from office due to intimidation threat and fear be an attack on all of we and what we represent it be unacceptable and we must do more to protect our freedom and democracy we stand together 
 yesterday alison phillips be bang out of the newsroom in her last day as editor of the daily mirror alison break the mould for female journalist and she lead a number of campaign that have a direct effect on this place she leave a proud legacy 
 last week i ask the leader of the house about the procedure committee report on scrutiny of lords secretaries of state have she now digest it and when will she bring forward a motion to make it happen i will chalk it up as a victory that after many week of ask foreign office ministers finally come forward with a statement this week on the ongoing conflict in gaza and israel will the leader of the house ensure that that happen more often with the foreign secretary himself take question the situation demand it 
 the international court of justice interim ruling be deeply significant and make for difficult reading we be clear that israel must comply with the order in the ruling in full and that hamas must release all the hostage immediately international law must be uphold and the independence of international court respect with all side hold accountable for their action innocent people be dead include thousand of woman and child and of the population of gaza have be displace and million face the risk of famine we can not let innocent palestinians pay the price we must redouble our effort for a sustainable ceasefire and a political process for a state solution 
 on that i welcome the foreign secretary ’s willingness to recognise the state of palestine which be a policy we have long support we hear this morning that secretary of state blinken be move the us in that direction too as the leader of the opposition say it be an 
 inalienable right of the palestinian people 
 can the leader of the house clarify as there be some confusion the government ’s policy on the recognition of palestine 
 talk of secretaries of state be accountable perhaps the leader of the house can clear up some of the creative use of language by the home secretary in his appearance before the home affairs committee yesterday apparently we no long have a backlog of asylum claim it be just a queue of applicant some queue but definitely not a backlog the asylum seeker who have go miss apparently be not miss but have simply disengage do the leader of the house recognise that the government have lose control of the asylum system and that smoke and mirror can not hide the truth 
 the business secretary be not exactly forthcoming with the truth this week either on monday she tell this house that negotiation with canada to save british car import be ongoing but now we learn that she walk out of those discussion and the entire issue be on pause do the leader of the house want to take this opportunity to correct the record 
 finally i can not let business question go by without refer to the leader of the house ’s rather bizarre unprompted over the top glow tribute to the prime minister in last week ’s business question i feel the lady do protest too much it be as if she be at the traitors roundtable desperately want everyone to believe she really be a faithful it seem that the traitor sit among they still secretly plan their next kill the evil plotter be try to avoid banishment so they can win the prize can she reveal herself today because we all want to know perhaps some of her colleague can too or perhaps they should do we all a favour cut straight to the endgame and let the public decide quite honestly much as i love the traitors this be not a tv show and their antic have real life consequence as much as we be all sick of watch it unfortunately there be no off switch 
 from the government benches i say happy birthday to you madam deputy speaker 
 this week i meet ashley the cousin of year old hostage agam berger she be the girl that many member will have see in video footage play her violin in happy time she volunteer with special educational need child and be actively involve in work towards a peaceful solution in her region i thank the shadow leader of the house for her remark about the hostage and all member who be work hard to keep the spotlight on these people and their family i hope that they will all be home soon 
 i also thank the hon lady for her remark about my hon friend   the member for finchley and golders green mike freer who have say that he be go to stand down because of his safety and the wellbeing of his family such attack on elect member be attack on democracy itself i know that many hon and right hon member and their family be endure such   threat we condemn such action and those who encourage incite and excuse they i thank the hon lady for her cross- party support on that matter

 however the leader of the house be not alone in her desperation to keep scotland lash tight to westminster she will remember see a secret document present to the cabinet in july by her colleague the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities the existence of that document be reveal at the covid inquiry this week finalise at the height of the   pandemic it be entitle the state of the union and be a blatant attempt by her government to politicise the pandemic and undermine the scottish government when trust in government message be crucial it ask the cabinet to endorse some sort of strategy most detail of which sadly be miss from the inquiry ’s version it require polling research and data analysis all at a time when scotland ’s minister and government be focus on and do their damnedest to protect the people of scotland 
 no be slither from scandal to another we know that a union strategy committee and a union operation committee be set up to mimic the strategy and operation committee that help create the monster of brexit the right hon lady will agree that considerable resource be require divert cash and personnel from fight the pandemic it must be make clear to the public who fund that will she ask her colleague to give a statement on the project lay out why it be an appropriate use of governmental resource what it do and what it be feel to have achieve its key performance indicator let we say particularly give the time in which it be conceive finally the leader of the house will recall that the state of the union report find among many thing that of young voter in scotland want independence be she surprised 
 the hon lady talk about normal service and we have have normal service from the snp this morning the full bingo card of textbook standard nationalist operating procedure failure to take responsibility for the thing that it be responsible for tick blame other tick demonise opponent tick distract from the indefensible thing that we have find about this week tick a complete lack of self awareness tick
