i congratulate   the hon member for stafford leigh ingham   on secure the debate i could easily spend my whole speech talk about the challenge of increase girl participation in pe and sport in school despite the progress make through initiative such as the this girl can campaign there be still a gender gap with only of girl age to achieve the recommend minute of physical activity each day compare to of boy accord to sport england ’s active life survey in we have come a long way since my schoolday in the 80 when girl over be not allow to play competitive mixed football and there be no girl team i could join i have be delighted to see the great stride make in woman ’s football in recent year and it be a joy to join a girl training session at pucklechurch primary school recently the plus girl run around on a very small pitch show that girl really do like football 
 however i want to focus today on a different area of inequality the participation in pe of child and young people with special educational need and disability i be pleased that the hon lady raise this issue in her speech child with send be and a half time more likely to be inactive compare to their peer without send we know the benefit that physical   activity can bring improve mental and physical health boost self esteem and important social opportunity for send student so what be the barrier only of pe teacher feel fully confident in adapt activity for child with send accord to research by the youth sport trust there be a significant gap in teacher training for inclusive sport school often lack access to the necessary adaptive equipment make it difficult for send student to engage in physical activity on an equal footing with their peer provision be inconsistent with some school able to offer much more well develop programme for send student than other 
 consequence of that which may surprise some be that it can lead to increase absence for send student the youth sport trust have highlight that pupil with send be more likely to experience disengagement in physical education which can lead to increase school absence a report from scope a lead disability charity find that child with send who feel exclude from physical activity be at high risk of develop mental health challenge which can far exacerbate absence a study by the national autistic society find that student with autism in particular be more likely to be absent from school when pe lesson be not adapt to their need with absence increase by up to for those student to tackle that scope call for more accessible pe facility and training for teacher on how to adapt physical activity for send student it emphasise the importance of inclusive support suggest that school offer a broad range of activity that cater to different ability from wheelchair sport to multi sensory activity 
 the national autistic society stress the importance of clear communication structured environment and sensory friendly approach while special olympics great britain highlight that a key barrier for child with send be the lack of mainstream sport club that offer inclusive programme urge school and community to create partnership with local club offer pathway to competitive sport for send child and foster an inclusive and welcome environment on that i would like to highlight the work of yate ’s acrobatic gymnastic centre contrary to the hon member for stafford i do think this will require some funding for adaptive equipment and the specialist training for staff 
 i will conclude by highlight the work do by the charity gympanzees which be currently fundraise to open in my constituency the uk ’s fully accessible exercise play and social centre for disabled child and young people i have the privilege of visit its pop up offering before i be an mp where i see for myself the fantastic holiday activity it provide with an array of specialist equipment and dedicated staff it have have a massive impact on its user life whether that be the year old laughing for the time the year old who have refuse any form of sport at home and school but who row a kilometre on their rowing machine the year old who hold up his head on his own for minute for the time or the child and young people who be able to walk for the time use the specialist equipment 
 open this permanent home for the charity ’s activity will allow it to offer scheme not only in school holiday but year round and would give the centre the scope to open up its facility for other organisation to use include school gympanzee have already raise more   than half of its £ target to fit out the facility i have previously write to ministers ask they to consider contribute to the funding of this centre as a pilot facility a model that could be roll out across other region to help to inform provision in and provide training for our school i ask they to look again at the huge benefit this project could bring for child with complex need and the potential it have to deliver access to pe for child who currently miss out 
 i thank my hon friend   the member for stafford leigh ingham   for secure this debate she make some fantastic and profound point in her speech 
 like   the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young i will focus on disability sport in school across the country in disabled child do not take part in pe regularly and in confide that they would like to take part in more sport if it be offer we should not underestimate the impact this have on these child with disabled child already face exclusion and of they report feel lonely 
 i know this from my own experience madam deputy speaker i have not play sport since i be i have an accident in year where i shatter my hip i do not walk for year and then have a hip replacement in form a challenge a lot of child who be disabled face in similar situation be that play football and other sport be how child often build common bond with their friend it be what they do together and what they talk about be exclude from that have far wide repercussion 
 this have be a big priority for i in my constituency i pay tribute today to the work of paralympicsgb the youth sport trust and other they really recognise this and be do lot of important local work to improve it we have some fantastic project and organisation in beckenham and penge that be use their own initiative to increase the participation of disabled people in sport in crystal palace the national sports centre be undergo a multimillion pound refurbishment to secure its facility for future use and crucially to make they accessible i think world record have be set in crystal palace but wheelchair user currently can not get to the pool and a lot of the other facility as member will know this issue be close to my heart and i be proud that this facility in my constituency will be make fully accessible and will be of the good facility not just in london but across the country for disabled sport go forward 
 i want to put on the record my thank to sir sadiq khan the team at the greater london authority include project manager ben woods and councillors ruth mcgregor and ryan thompson and to the crystal palace sports partnership with john powell and fran bernstein who have really bring people together and make this happen 
 crystal palace football club and the charity palace for life foundation do genuinely incredible work right across south london include at the national sports centre to support disabled people and other as part   of this work the foundation host football session for those with down ’s syndrome and visual impairment as well as powerchair football 
 of the point that i often try to make to people be that of all the protect characteristic define by the equality act disability be by far the most diverse we also talk of specific disability such as autism and cerebral palsy as have spectrum the challenge for disabled sport be really comprehensive but we have expert by experience people with disability who understand how good to bridge that gap and make inclusion possible it be fantastic that the schools minister have recognise this i know that she have speak about the need for increased pe in school for disabled child if i speak to some of the local school in my constituency i be tell that have other facility outside school be absolutely essential 
 it would be remiss of i not also to mention kent county cricket club in beckenham which alongside manage disability team run a regular friday night disability cricket session in beckenham for child and young people it have be fantastic to see a renew focus on access to disability sport both in government and in my local community especially follow the paralympics increase access to pe and sport be not something that will happen if we sit back and wait for it inclusion be not just an absence of exclusion and achieve equity will require an active effort from all to get involve i again thank my hon friend the member for stafford for secure this debate 
 with permission madam deputy speaker i would like to make a statement on the united kingdom ’s economic relationship with the united states the uk have a strong and balanced trading relationship with the us worth £ which support job across both our country this be only to the eu where our trading relationship be worth £ yesterday evening the united states announce a reciprocal tariff on uk export and it have today impose a global tariff on car that follow the application of tariff of on us import of steel aluminium and derivative product announce on   march 
 no country be able to secure an exemption from those announcement but the uk do receive the low reciprocal tariff rate globally and although that vindicate the pragmatic approach the government have take we know that while the tariff be still be levy the job be far from do we be of course disappoint by the increase in tariff on the uk and on other country around the world the impact will be feel among all trading nation but i would like to update the house on how the uk can navigate these turbulent time act in our national interest and for the benefit of all our industry 
 i would also like to take this opportunity to thank my american counterpart secretary of commerce howard lutnick us trade representative jamieson greer and special envoy mark burnett for their engagement over the past few month while any imposition of tariff be deeply regrettable from the beginning they promise to make themselves available and they have be true to their word i look forward to our continued engagement over the day ahead 
 as member will know since the new us administration take office my colleague and i have be engage in intensive discussion on an economic deal between the us and the uk that would not just avoid the imposition of significant tariff but deepen our economic relationship on everything from defence economic security financial service machinery tech and regulation there be clear synergy between the us and uk market that be reflect in the fair and balanced trading relationship that already exist between our country 
 i can confirm to the house that those talk be ongoing and will remain so it be the government ’s view that a deal be not just possible but favourable to both country and that this course of action serve britain ’s interest as an open face trading nation i have be in contact with many business across a broad range of sector include those most affect who have very much welcome this approach it be clear to i that industry itself want to grasp the opportunity a deal can offer and welcome the government ’s cool headed approach 
 in increasingly insecure time i have hear some member cle to the security of simple answer and loud voice i understand the compulsion but i caution member of this house to keep calm and remain clear eyed on what be in our national interest not simply to proclaim that we follow the action of other country the british people rightly expect the government to keep our country secure at home and abroad and an unnecessary escalate trade war would serve neither goal 
 true strength come in make the right choice at the right time thank to the action of our prime minister who have restore britain ’s place on the world stage the uk be in a unique position to do a deal where we can and to respond when we must it remain our belief that the good route to economic stability for work people be a negotiate deal with the us that build on our share strength however we do reserve the right to take any action we deem necessary if a deal be not secure 
 to enable the uk to have every option open to we in the future i be today launch a request for input on the implication for british business of possible retaliatory action this be a formal step and it be necessary for we to keep all option on the table we will seek the view of uk stakeholder over week until   may   on product that could potentially be include in any uk tariff response this exercise will also give business the chance to have their say and influence the design of any possible uk action if we be in a position to agree an economic deal with the us that lift the tariff that have be place on our industry this request for input will be pause and any measure flow from it will be lift further information on the request for input will be publish on great.gov.uk later today alongside an indicative list of potential product that the government consider most appropriate for inclusion 
 i know that this will be an anxious time for all business not just those with direct trade link to america let i say very clearly that we stand ready to support business through this that start by ensure that business have reliable information any business that be concerned about what these change mean for they can find clear guidance and support on great.gov.uk where there be now a bespoke webpage 
 this government be elect to bring security back to work people ’s life at a time of volatility business and worker alike be look to this government to keep our head act in the national interest and navigate britain through this period while some may urge escalation i simply will not play politic with people ’s job this government will strive for a deal that support our industry and the well pay job that come with they while prepare our trade defence and keep all option on the table this be the right approach to defend the uk ’s domestic industry from the direct and indirect impact of us tariff in a way that be both measure and proportionate while respect the rule base international trading system 
 as the world continue to change around we british worker and business can be assure of constant this be a government who will not be set off course in choppy water the final part of our approach will be to turbo boost the work this government be do to make our economy strong and more secure include our new industrial strategy we will strike trade deal with our partner and work closely with our ally for our share prosperity we have a clear destination to deliver economic security for work people we be progress a deal that can do just that lay the foundation to move quickly should it not and ensure that british business have a clear voice in what happen next i commend this statement to the house 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to help promote rugby league 
 mr speaker i take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work that rugby league club do across the country and to my own team wigan warriors who absolutely smash warrington wolves in las vegas last month 
 be you still in the cup by the way laughter 
 no comment rugby league club be at the heart of many community include my hon friend ’s in rochdale i be delighted that in the last financial year sport england award over £ to his constituency to support grassroots rugby league 
 rochdale hornets have have a win start to their league season a spicy performance no doubt link to our new partnership with nando ’s restaurant mr speaker if you get a rochdale hornets season ticket you can get off in rochdale nando ’s ours be a true community club with the work off the pitch as important as the result on it do the secretary of state agree that we should be promote rugby league as not just great entertainment but a brilliant way to help our nation ’s mental and physical health 
 i could not agree more rugby league club have the ability to reach where other can not this week i be delighted to convene a roundtable with the prime minister to discuss the issue raise by the tv series adolescence and in particular the impact of mental health and isolation on young man we be work with rugby league club to see what more we can do to support young man ’s mental health in coalfield community i will be in a position to announce more to the house shortly 
 the secretary of state and   the hon member for rochdale paul waugh   be both right to praise the important work that rugby league and indeed rugby union club do in their community what step be the secretary of state take to well balance that with the public accounts committee ’s cross party criticism of how her department be manage its covid loan book 
 this labour government will always protect value for taxpayer money and we be determined to grip the issue that we inherit we have already recover of the repayment schedule to the department and we will respond shortly to the serious issue raise about the handling of covid loan in the public accounts committee ’s report i will then be in a position to update the house 
 i be go to call the shadow minister but i be not sure whether he should declare an interest as a former apprentice of london broncos 
 thank you mr speaker i be happy to declare it we lose a lot of game back then 
 the return of the ash be welcome news for rugby league but while the next generation will be inspire by the series the labour government have drop the ball encourage grassroots participation be key to the future of all sport and community club across the country but labour have cut the £ opening school facility fund £ of investment in multi sport grassroot facility and end the £ lionesses future fund that invest in facility to support woman and girl sport arguably the big owngoal for grassroot sport be the removal of planning protection for sport pitch across england why be it only the conservatives who will protect grassroots club and the sport pitch that labour want to concrete over 
 the conservatives can not have it both way on the hand they want to see economic growth but on the other hand they be not prepared to take the necessary step in order to achieve it the truth be that the government take grassroots sport incredibly seriously i be really proud that sport england be able to provide financial support to club across the country through the £ movement fund with support of up to £ for grassroots sport organisation i have to say to the shadow minister that it take some brass neck to stand at the dispatch box and lecture this government in the light of the mess that his government leave to we 
 what discussion she have have with representative of the creative industry on the use of ai 
 our creative industry lead the world this be the top priority for they and i be clear that if it matter to they it matter to we and we be determined to get it right since i be appoint i have discuss this with representative across music publishing film tv fashion and gaming the secretary of state for   science innovation and technology and i will shortly convene further roundtable to work with industry across artificial intelligence and the creative industry to strike the right balance and to grip this issue 
 the secretary of state will be aware of suggestion that the government may offer concession around ai regulation in a deal to reduce us tariff will she assure the creative and news medium sector that any negotiation will not include an offer to weaken our copyright framework which would be oppose by creative industry both in the uk and in the us 
 our creative be to none in the world as i just say and our copyright framework be an essential part of their success we have be clear that if it do not work for creative it do not work for we and we will not do it on negotiation with the united states the prime minister have be clear that this be the start of the process but we will always work in the national interest and we be consider all step as we look to the future 
 what step her department be take to reduce gambling harm 
 what step her department be take to reduce gambling harm 
 this government have introduce a landmark statutory gambling levy which will be charge to gambling operator to fund the research prevention and treatment of gambling harm the levy will come into effect next week and will raise around £ every year we be also introduce stake limit in the come week for online slot game which be associate with a high risk of harm for the time we know that gambling bring joy to many but for those for whom it pose a problem we be determined to offer all the support they need

 may i thank my hon friend very much and not just for raise that serious issue but for the sensitive way in which he have approach it i extend my sincere condolence to luke ’s family who i believe be here today i be so sorry to hear about their loss 
 we believe as a government that advertising should be socially responsible the minister for gambling have set the gambling industry a clear task to far raise standard to ensure that level of gambling advertising do not exacerbate harm and we will continue to review the evidence include the very tragic case that my hon friend talk about to make sure we get that right 
 a report by the gambling commission release in november show that the proportion of young people between the age of and experience problem gambling increase by in just year will the secretary of state please outline the step her department be take to prevent young people from become victim of problem gambling 
 i share my hon friend ’s view that there be clear evidence of particular problem for young people and i know she have be active on that in her constituency the online slot stake limit will come into force on   april   for the £ limit and on   may   for the £ limit for young adult that be a key harm reduction measure and target at those most at risk of harmful gambling 
 the minister for civil society know about the fantastic work that gordon moody do at its dudley treatment centre to help people rebuild their life follow gambling relate harm the secretary of state may not know however that gordon moody face have to suspend its residential treatment because of the government ’s dither over how to distribute fund from the gambling levy will she finally get a grip before other fantastic charity with expertise like gordon moody have to shut their door 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that we be absolutely clear that we do not want any gap in funding the minister for civil society and the minister for gambling who sit in the other place have meet representative of industry and we be work hard to make sure we resolve that 
 do the secretary of state agree that there be a world of difference between bet on sport which employ many thousand and bring joy to million and gaming which be all about pure chance and require no skill or knowledge at all will she commit to treat the very differently in regulation and increase the difference between they in the tax system 
 i be not sure that i would share that blunt characterisation but i very much recognise that we need to treat different form of gamble differently in particular member have raise concern about the impact of reform on land base gambling we be work hard to bring forward a package of measure this summer to support land base gambling in our coastal town and in place around the country where it bring enormous joy to people and that include bingo which we all want to see protect and thriving 
 if she will have discussion with ofcom on extend the list of event designate as free to air 
 we believe the current list of event work well and strike an appropriate balance between access and allow sport to maximise broadcasting revenue the government have no plan to review the list at this time 
 the bbc have secure an exclusive contract to broadcast live all of scotland ’s man ’s international football match in the run up to the world cup it be part of a wide deal agree with the european governing body uefa which also include match for northern ireland and wales on friday night the bbc will provide extensive live coverage on several platform of scotland ’s woman ’s team play germany in the nation league at tannadice stadium in dundee i be sure the minister will join i in wish they well but will she also consider take step to safeguard these event for free to air broadcaster so that our nation can enjoy they without pay expensive subscription

 i want every child to have a chance to learn how to play a musical instrument or take part in music and i want every musician to be able to make a living out of their career i be work on well support for small venue across the uk and well remuneration for legacy artist songwriter and session musician 
 sunderland be a music city and key to that be our great grassroots venue such as the bunker independent and pop recs but venue like those across the country operate on a financially precarious basis will the minister update the house on how he will monitor the implementation of the voluntary levy on arena and stadium gig so that it can rapidly provide financial support to venue like those in my constituency 
 the bunker look absolutely amazing it be a not for profit organisation apart from anything else that give young people and other an opportunity to learn how to play perform and record that be precisely the kind of venue we want to be able to support which be why i be determined to get this voluntary levy over the line as soon as possible so we can put million of pound into small venue the last time i be in sunderland be for p!nk at the stadium of light perhaps a helpful line from she be 
 what about all the plan that end in disaster 
 i be determined that that be not go to be of they 
 for the time since no uk artist have make it into the world top album or single chart that be partly down to effectively close the eu to tour artist   where following now can not get build and remuneration be not make for artist the minister promise to fix this when will we get our artist back into europe 
 the hon member make a good point obviously we need more song from runrig to get we back to the top of the chart 
 to make a serious point it be absolutely essential for new and emerge artist in particular that they have the opportunity to tour across the whole of europe i be determined to get this over the line it be of the thing that we need to renegotiate with the european union we have a key meeting come up in the next few week and i hope we will be able to make some progress 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 music fan be leave outraged last summer by rip off price for oasis ticket many pay hundred of pound over resale value to access the concert they want to get to as dedicated fan liberal democrats be call for an outright ban on resale above face value at the moment it seem the government be half the world away from a solution when the ministers answer whatever they say please promise i that the answer to whether we will have a ban above resale value be not definitely maybe 
 as the hon member know perfectly well a consultation be ongoing and will close on   april it be a manifesto commitment of our to ensure that the secondary ticket market work for everybody if someone be not able to turn up to a gig for whatever reason family reason a funeral or whatever they should be able to sell the ticket on we have ask specifically whether people should only be able to sell it at face value or face value plus or i note his response to the consultation i hope he have respond to all the other issue in the consultation as well

 my department be in regular contact with the organise company and i be pleased to meet recently with both the ceo and the chair to discuss progress on delivery at a meeting in my department and when i be delighted to attend the king ’s baton relay launch at buckingham palace with his majesty the king to mark day until the game the uk have be proud to host the commonwealth game twice since and i be delighted that the uk government have be able to get behind and support glasgow 
 i thank the minister for her response do she agree that it be important that the game bring benefit to local community what discussion be she have with colleague in the scotland office the scottish government and glasgow city council to ensure that local community in glasgow benefit from the game in

 the hon member be right to pay tribute to the economic contribution and the huge inspiration of these event we have a number of exciting event come up whether that be rugby or cricket and the government be hugely supportive of major event 
 what step she be take to promote coastal britain to overseas visitor 
 britain as everybody will have note be an island nation so our coastline be a vital part of what define we as a visitor destination i be really glad that the star great britain campaign which we launch early this year feature many coastal area but we need to ensure that people get an opportunity to see our amazing beach eat our amazing food and enjoy the perfectly sensible summer weather that we have 
 the tourism industry in east suffolk be worth an estimate £ and account for over of job locally but we have suffer post pandemic estimate suggest that we be down on pre pandemic number which i imagine be just the tip of the iceberg can the minister share with i what he be do to support coastal tourism in place such as southwold aldeburgh and felixstowe 
 i be very keen to integrate the creative industry far well into our visitor economy my hon friend will know in her own patch that it be not just the aldeburgh festival which have be go since she have maggi hambling live down the road in saxmundham and there be a lively artistic community we need to build that far more into our coastal offer around the country i want we to get to international visitor to the uk by we will only be able to do that if more of they do not just visit london 
 in a debate in westminster hall week ago the minister be quick to respond on the need to ensure that the tourism   industry across the whole of this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland can take advantage he will know the advantage of tourism in strangford he will know strangford lough the ards peninsula and the irish sea the shadow minister   the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew know it very well he do not do wild swimming on the day he be over but he wish he could have there be many thing to attract tourism wherever we be will the minister ensure that discussion to improve coastal tourism for the united kingdom include northern ireland we can do it well together 
 it be a bit shameful to accuse the poor shadow minister of wimpe out on cold water swimming i be sure he would have do it if it have be available i be very keen that we have a national tourism strategy for the whole country by the end of this year and i be work with the visitor economy advisory council to deliver that that have to address the problem that many of our coastal area have face include in northern ireland again i make the point that the creative industry in northern ireland be vital to the tourism economy 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as have be say tourism be a huge contributor to the uk economy and i be delighted to take part in english tourism week as many member will have do the government have commit to visit by and conservative members welcome that ambition i be surprised to hear from the tourism sector that there be great concern about a purported cut to the visitbritain budget will the minister categorically tell the house whether there will be a cut to the visitbritain budget and if so will he transparently tell the house how much that budget will be cut by 
 i think the hon gentleman be talk about the great campaign budget and it be certainly true that finance have be tough we be look at precisely what money we may be able to source into that fund for the next year i be very serious about want to develop a uk wide visitor economy strategy i think it might be valuable if the hon gentleman and i sit down at some point and he give i some of the idea that be rock around in his brain and we will see whether any of those can be incorporate into our plan 
 what step she be take to help increase tourism outside city 
 not only be we an island economy but i would argue that our town and village be just as important for our visitor economy as our great city i recently spend a pleasant weekend in chipping campden and many international visitor be wander up and down broadway the right hon gentleman have some extraordinarily beautiful village in his constituency which i expect he be about to tell we about 
 since we be swap village i be in pocklington last week at the site of what professor alice roberts describe as the most important iron age archaeological site in britain the pocklington chariot burial it be a magnificent thing and the centre of a huge area of iron age archaeology i be there to meet dedicated local volunteer who be create a new museum at burnby hall base on that archaeology which will bring tourist into the countryside what can the government do to help people like that develop idea such as this 
 not every village in britain suffer the problem of midsomer but i know of the work that people be try to do in pocklington the right hon gentleman refer to professor alice roberts and her wonderful work in this area and everything i have see about the hoard in pocklington be absolutely amazing i slightly expect that the right hon gentleman would turn up wear some of the bling 
 or the armour 
 or some of the armour because there be a time when it be fine for a man to wear a brooch perhaps that time will come again i pay tribute to burnby hall garden and museum and it would be amazing if we be able to get it back into full use the garden be amazing apparently there be different kind of wild water lily but it would be good if we could get the whole museum go and i pay tribute to the volunteer who be try to make that happen 
 what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of the plan increase in employer national insurance contribution on creative industry 
 as the right hon gentleman know a large proportion of the creative industry be constitute as small and medium sized enterprise and the vast majority of those be protect from the increase in national insurance contribution importantly as many of they have say to i they fully understand the need for great expenditure on our public service and that have to be match by find the money from somewhere 
 i have always be particularly impress by your brooch mr speaker nevertheless those increase be damage for any enterprise but we could make it up to they by restore baroness kidron ’s amendment to the data use and access bill will the minister do that 
 no we have just take it out of the bill for the precise reason that we do not think it would make the blind bit of difference to the financial support provide to creative industry today that be why we be not support the amendment 
 what step her department be take to support the development of grassroots football in scotland 
 what step she be take to support grassroots sport venue 
 what step be she take to allocate funding to local grassroots sport facility in the north of england 
 what step be she take to support grassroots sport venue

 certain sport often remain inaccessible to woman and girl early on make it hard for they to join later will the minister confirm how her department be support club like chess valley rugby football club in my constituency of south west hertfordshire that promote woman ’s participation at all level 
 the hon gentleman raise an important point i attend the launch of the woman ’s innovation hub at loughborough university a few week ago and i convene the woman in sport taskforce along with karen carney we be clear that we want to support woman ’s sport at every level

 we be provide support to charity the right hon gentleman will know that we have more than double the employment allowance to protect the small charity and business more than half of those with national insurance contribution liability will either be well off or see no change next year he will also know that there be a reason why we have have to make difficult choice his party have year in power it crash the economy and leave charity in an appalling position with not just the economic mess we find ourselves in but far more people to support that be why we be launch the civil society covenant to reset our relationship with charity and put they at the heart of national life where they belong 
 we support charity through the pandemic with million and million of pound and with the £ cost of live fund month after month we have urge the secretary of state to tell the chancellor that this policy be wrong and will do irreversible harm we now hear that charity a day be close because of government decision how many will have to close before the government acknowledge that they have make a terrible mistake 
 i be afraid that that be an absolute rewriting of history i be old enough to remember the conservatives charity minister tell charity on his day in the job that they ought to stick to their knitting this government be determined to treat charity with the respect that they be owe which be why we have establish the civil society covenant why the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my hon friend the member for barnsley south meet with the charity sector regularly and why we have take action to protect the small charity

 thursday may business to be determine by the backbench business committee 
 friday may the house will not be sit 
 it be some week away yet but this be the last moment i will have to wish you mr speaker and all member of this house and staff a very happy easter i hope i may do so easter be a joyous occasion full of family and possibly inappropriate amount of chocolate i will be make the shadow leader of the house ’s legendary hot cross bun not very much of the mix actually make it into the oven but that be part of the joy 
 it be lucky however that we have several week to look forward to easter because this week have not be of joy we will be debate tariff later and we have also have the impact of the national insurance rise which have push up cost raise inflation make it hard than ever to hire a new employee and block route into work for young people 
 my question however be this what on earth be happen in birmingham as the house will recall birmingham city council be now in the week of a strike with the   union unite over bin collection apparently this matter concern just a few dozen out of some city council employee as the house have hear tonne of rubbish have pile up so far grow by a report tonne a week let we not forget that birmingham ’s bin collection be reportedly and a half time bad than the bad of other council even before this strike the public health implication be now so dire that the council have declare a major incident 
 the strike come on top of other recent fiasco the athlete village in perry barr be build by the city council to host competitor during the commonwealth game in but be never use and have be sell at a report loss to taxpayer of about £ secondly birmingham city council try to install a shiny new oracle it system result in a disaster whose cost be set to reach £ odd by accord to a report by academic at sheffield university 
 as a city birmingham be technically bankrupt it have be control by labour for well over a decade but my point be not about the council it be about the government the minister for local government let the cat out of the bag in his statement on this topic on monday when he say 
 birmingham ’s waste service have be in urgent need of modernisation and transformation for many year practice in the waste service have be the source of of the large equal pay crisis in modern history result in cost of over £ to the resident of birmingham this situation simply can not continue ”—[official report   march vol c. 
 the prime minister go far in his own remark yesterday say 
 the situation in birmingham council be completely unacceptable”.—[official report   april vol c. 
 however neither the minister nor the prime minister have yet offer any criticism at all of unite whose action be the cause of all this rotting refuse in the street 
 unite be labour ’s big union donor before the general election give £ to a total of mp although not to the leader of the house i be very pleased to say do she think there could be any relationship between the government ’s reluctance to call out unite on the disastrous situation in birmingham and the half a pound in donation their mp have just receive some member of the house may see this whole situation as eerily reminiscent of the 1970 especially labour ’s winter of discontent in when strike binman cause refuse to pile up across major city include in birmingham my worry however be about not the past but the future labour consistently back public sector union strike when they be in opposition a point the prime minister conveniently forget to mention yesterday but now they be in power they have throw money at the union hand over fist with little or no negotiate improvement let we not forget that northern rail negotiator have even say that their agreement with the union require they to use fax machine 
 there be a very serious point here mr speaker at this moment the government be abolish nhs england and take direct control of the nhs do anyone seriously think that a government who be incapable of call out their union donor over bin collection will have any ability at all to withstand pressure from the same and other union donor on the nhs what will that do to cost control and productivity to public spending and inflation i would be grateful if the leader of the house reflect on those issue in her remark 
 may i join the shadow leader of the house in wish everybody a very happy easter i hope that member can resist eat too much chocolate and hot cross bun especially those who be on diet at this time of year 
 today be a day to reflect mr speaker because we face unprecedented time which have the potential to change the global trade consensus of the past year a consensus that have bring this country and most western country a great deal of prosperity we be still process exactly what the new tariff will mean for british business and we will shortly hear from the secretary of state for business and trade about that in more detail just as president trump be act in what he believe be his national interest we will always act in our national interest we will do whatever be necessary to protect british job british business and british consumer i be sure the shadow leader of the house will agree that in any eventuality secure the long seek economic deal with our close partner the us which the prime minister have be lead on for many month be in our national interest and i be sure the whole house will support he in those endeavour 
 as the shadow leader of the house say this week be the start of a new financial year and the annual uprating of bills it be also a very worrying time for family the cost of living crisis be not yet over and many people will be wonder as the month begin how long their pay cheque will last we have inherit a very difficult situation and the global trade war will not help but we be determined to protect work people that be what we be all about we be about make work pay with our employment rights bill we have see a £ a year increase to the national living wage and for young people there have be an unprecedented uplift to the national minimum wage which be now up to £ an hour the state pension will increase this week by £ we will take the action necessary to bring down in the long term our bill include those for water and energy 
 the shadow leader of the house raise the situation in birmingham i be in birmingham just last weekend visit my husband ’s family and find the condition to be totally unacceptable it be awful what people be live with and we want to see the situation end and end immediately i be happy to tell the right hon member that i have no problem in say that the trade union unite need to step up get back round the table and come to an agreement a reasonable agreement be on the table so the trade union and the council should be able to deal with this very quickly 
 i gently say to the shadow leader of the house however that i do not think the situation in birmingham cover anybody in glory to make some party political point about it do not serve he too well he and other conservative members might have a short memory but this be a failure of successive leadership of that council include the tory liberal democrat coalition of the early 2000 in particular that be a critical phase in resolve the equality pay dispute which other council include in manchester and other city deal with during that time while birmingham ’s bury their head in the sand about it

 i thank the hon member for raise this issue it be also raise last week by my hon friend   the member for widnes and halewood derek twigg she be right as we approach the anniversary of the hillsborough tragedy we should remember the life lose all the family affect and the year and year of fighting for justice and accountability that the family have suffer since frankly with the state fight against they in most case that be something we should all endeavour to put right as she say the prime minister and the whole government myself include remain focused on fulfil our commitment to the hillsborough family to bring forward and enact a hillsborough law which will of course include a duty of candour at all time that be a very important measure to take forward 
 at this time the most important issue be to ensure that the legislation reflect the full range of concern and experience and meet the expectation of the family the very bad thing we could do be not meet those expectation give that all the trust issue relate to the state fail to live up to the family expectation we be work on the bill at pace but we will take whatever time be necessary to work collaboratively with the family and their representative because get the legislation right be overwhelmingly our priority as i be sure the hon lady can understand

 i call the chair of the backbench business committee 
 on the business that the leader of the house announce i have to say it be disappointing that we do not have backbench   business on   april my reading of the business that day be that the bill be uncontroversial and we be likely to finish early but we will be deny the opportunity to have a debate on st george ’s day which be of course on   april or a debate on parkinson ’s awareness month which be april 
 we be contemplate organise minute debate on   may which be local election day colleague may wish to be campaign elsewhere but that would at least allow debate on some of the motion that we have in the queue it would help if the leader of the house could confirm when estimate day will be in may by my reckoning there be only around possible date and our committee have to advertise the opportunity for people to apply for an estimate day debate and then choose the debate 
 on   tuesday may there will be a westminster hall debate on the persecution of christians when we return on   april there will be a debate on residential estate management company i remind colleague that we will sit monday hour on that day so the debate will start at am rather than at am on   thursday april there will be a debate on lesbian visibility week follow by a debate on the trading relationship with the european union which will be quite topical give the tariff arrangement that have just be announce on   tuesday april there will be a debate on compensation for criminal injury
