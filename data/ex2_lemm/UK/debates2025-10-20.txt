i rise to raise another case of foreign interference in our politic nathan gill the former leader of reform uk in wales and a constituent of mine plead guilty to accept bribe from russia he be stop by the police in september but only charge in february this year report now suggest that the kremlin operation target not only he but at least other member of the european parliament and a member of the house of lords what step be the government take to ensure that russian network can not continue to influence uk politic 
 i will be brief but i be very pleased to be able to speak in this debate as chair of the all party parliamentary group on the chagos island which last week have its meeting it have be ably support by david snoxell the former british high commissioner to mauritius who have do incredible work with his knowledge of and empathy for the chagossian people there be former chair of the group in the committee at the moment the hon member for romford andrew rosindell and for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane)—and the former member for crawley be also chair of the group at time 
 we found that group a long time ago to listen to and take action in support of the chagos islander who be angry that they have be forcibly remove from their home angry at the way they have be treat by successive british government and very angry at the initial decision that be take and the sheer brutality that go with it to give member a brief example in a year old chagossian woman liseby elysé while carry her unborn child be forcibly remove from the chagos island of peros banhos she lose her unborn child soon after her traumatic upheaval and the journey and she and her husband survive with considerable uncertainty and in very precarious living condition like all other chagossian however year later in she represent her community at the hague when she speak about her life and her loss her story be compelling and memorable like those of so many other chagos islander because of the personal horror trauma and abuse that they suffer they have always demand and fight for their right of return and that be the central core of what the all party parliamentary group on the chagos island have do 
 i realise there be now different opinion in the group about the sovereignty or otherwise of the island but there have always be a fundamental agreement on the right of return that lead to massive legal action which be bravely fight by the chagos islander with very little support there be a few people such as richard gifford their solicitor who be fantastic in their support eventually we gather wide support and we get favourable decision at all level of justice around the world include at the united nations general assembly 
 it be worth recall as many member have do the decision make by harold wilson then prime minister in offer mauritius its independence he come to this extraordinarily complicated deal which essentially involve the united states get a base on diego garcia and in return mauritius get its independence somewhere along the line as   the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger   point out there would either be a discount on the next generation of nuclear weapon or free delivery of weapon at some point in the future a lot of this be shroud   in mystery in the private conversation between wilson and prime minister ramgoolam at the time so there be a lot of confusion surround that 
 somewhere at that time the idea be to set up the british indian ocean territory and somewhere at that time the decision be make that the archipelago include peros banhos which be a considerable distance from diego garcia would be separate from mauritius as well and that it would have to be depopulate hence the utter brutality of the removal of the entire population from the island so the question that many member have bring up be this should the chagos island be separate from mauritius or part of mauritius interestingly during the discussion mauritius never accept the separation it never accept that the chagos island should be separate either constitutionally or in any other way from mauritius as we know the decision be basically force on the mauritians in return for their independence 
 we now have a situation in which we have finally get a treaty it have its imperfection of that everyone be agree personally i be less than happy about the idea of a massive military base on diego garcia and even less happy that it might be there in year time however a treaty have be agree that will ensure the right of chagos islander to return to the chagos island but unfortunately only a limited right of return to diego garcia itself i be look forward to the minister ’s speech and i would be grateful if be able to say a bit more about the right of access to diego garcia for chagos islander their right to visit the church and the graf of their ancestor and whether there be some possibility of a degree of residence on diego garcia there be no other place in the world where a military base be surround by an entirely depopulated area in this case an island and i would be grateful if the minister be able to say something about that 
 we have fight for the right of return i fully understand that chagos islander some resident here some in the seychelles many in mauritius and other in a diaspora all around the world in france and many other place probably all have different view and different memory but in the survey that be do when this issue be discuss at great length about year ago they be all in favour of the right of return the issue of sovereignty under mauritius be not really a great feature of those discussion although it appear to be now 
 we should listen to the chagos refugees group base in mauritius and lead brilliantly by olivier bancoult who have be through every court case indeed he start the whole process of demand the right of return which have eventually be successfully achieve the statement that the chagos refugees group make last week say 
 the agreement therefore meet the aim of our community to be reunite with our islands it have be conclude after nearly year of negotiation between mauritius and the uk and extensive consultation unless therefore the agreement be approve and implement our exile will continue with no hope of restore our fundamental human right to return it be the creation of biot on   june year ago which lead to our exile 
 we be see another page in the dramatic history of the indian ocean surely we should recognise the human right of the people who be so disgracefully treat by britain and by the united states but principally by britain they at last will see some degree of justice and the ability to return to their island i hope when the minister reply that he will be able to give i some hope and comfort on the question of access to diego garcia and also explain why it be necessary to have these incredibly long lease for the us to continue its operation on diego garcia it seem to i that we should be work towards the indian ocean be an ocean of peace not an ocean of conflict between rival power 
 i recognise the challenge that we have see in part because of the big number of to year old we have come through the system that be why we be prioritise invest in to-19 funding for our college and ensure we have more capital available to create the place that be necessary work with local area run alongside that be our technical college which will drive up standard spread good practice and be hub of excellence in their region work with other college 
 the government make big decision at the spending review to increase the overall funding available to to-19 course next financial year there will be an increase of over £ that mean that per pupil funding be go up substantially the large programme uplift sit on top of that and the government have make the decision to prioritise the large programme uplift for student do multiple a level in science technology engineering and math subject we still support the international baccalaureate and recognise it as a programme that can work for many student 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take to ensure the provision of adequate funding for pupil to study the international baccalaureate 
 fund institution for those age to have the freedom to decide how to use their funding for the provision they offer include whether they offer the international baccalaureate 
 varndean form college in brighton be the only state fund ib provider in sussex it have warn that without the large programme uplift the ib will become financially unviable many mid sussex student have go on from varndean to study engineering medicine and math at lead university do the minister think it right that this world class qualification become available only in the private sector entrench a tier education system will he meet i and varndean student to discuss the benefit of the ib for state educate pupil and why this decision must be reverse 
 the government make big decision at the spending review to increase the overall funding available to to-19 course next financial year there will be an increase of over £ million.[official report   october vol c. 4wc correction that mean that per pupil funding be go up substantially the large programme uplift sit on top of that and the government have make the decision to prioritise the large programme uplift for student do multiple a level in science technology engineering and math subject we still support the international baccalaureate and recognise it as a programme that can work for many student 
 i welcome the minister ’s support for the international baccalaureate ashcroft technology academy in my constituency run a successful ib programme will he confirm that the programme will still be fund and that pupil can still choose to study the international baccalaureate at ashcroft academy 
 i know that my hon friend be a champion for ashcroft academy and have visit it many time i can confirm that the change that the government be make will mean that the international baccalaureate can still be study we be provide funding for to-19 provision so that form college can make those decision 
 this week i have be inundate by family who send their child to europa school just outside my constituency they be so concerned by these change i teach the ib for year and i know full well the difference that its incredible curriculum can make to child ’s life do this policy direction not send a negative signal from the government i remind the minister that it be a labour government who introduce the funding in the place surely this be the wrong direction 
 the decision be essentially about where in the system resource go over of student in receipt of extra support from the large programme uplift be study a level and we want to prioritise support for the vast majority of student who be study a level and take extra a level include further math that be right for our economy and it be also right for the vast majority of student we still recognise the international baccalaureate as an important course and we want to support it 
 i too have a school in my constituency that offer the international baccalaureate dane court school in broadstairs have an extremely successful programme in break down barrier to opportunity for a large number of pupil in an area of significant deprivation only of the child in east thanet succeed in pass the kent test we need to be able to ensure that those child and other get the maximum opportunity available will the minister reassure i the senior leadership team and parent and child at dane court that the international baccalaureate will still be possible for those child and for future generation 
 i thank my hon friend for her advocacy for her constituent this year per student funding be rise to £ up from £ last year these decision make across the further education system and for form college mean that institution can make the good choice for their student include where appropriate back student to study the international baccalaureate 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the minister to his new role i have be listen to he closely but i have to say that the rhetoric do not match the action in fact the headteacher of ashcroft academy write to the secretary of state say exactly that the ib can not be deliver because the additional funding have be cut the international baccalaureate be recognise globally and allow british student to compete internationally cut funding will mean that those who can afford it will have access to it but those who cannot namely in our state sector will not why be the minister scrap funding for the ib and undermine standard in our state school 
 the system provide the level of funding necessary to to-19 provider the government have make big decision which have not be back by the conservatives in spending review or budgets to ensure that the funding be there for college to make those choice on top of that there be the large programme uplift in that respect we be rightly make the decision to prioritise the vast majority of student who be take more than a level especially in stem subject we be prioritise those subject and we be be frank and honest about that choice the international baccalaureate can be choose by college where that be right for student 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of change to eligibility criterion for free school meal on level of child in poverty 
 as secretary of state i have secure free school meal for half a more child and we be set to lift child out of poverty and put £ back into family pocket alongside our roll out of free breakfast club hour of government fund childcare and best start family hub i be act to deliver labour ’s moral mission on tackle child poverty

 i be grateful to my hon friend for everything he do to champion child and family across his constituency it be fantastic to hear how many child in slough will benefit from the expansion of free school meal it be a policy that be pro learning anti poverty and properly labour of course we want as many family as possible to benefit from it and to that end we be work with school local authority and the wide sector to notify family about the change that be come into effect 
 under the exist criterion for free school meal university math school have an excellent record for widen participation we know that of a level math student across the country be eligible for free school meal compare with of student at university math school will the government consider expand the number of place available at university math school 
 the hon gentleman be very imaginative with his question there and i credit he for that of course we have to take decision about school placement and school place overall across the whole system but if he would like to provide i with more information i will happily provide he with an update 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we liberal democrats warmly welcome the government ’s decision early this year to finally adopt our long stand policy of extend free school meal to all child in household in receipt of universal credit at the time ministers repeatedly refuse to confirm how they be fund this extension research from northumbria university now show that on average every primary will have to find £ and every secondary about £ to do so at a time when they be already cut teaching assistant and extracurricular activity to balance the book give that the secretary of state have make this policy and the rolling out of school breakfast club the centrepiece of her bid for deputy leadership of the labour party will she confirm when she be actually go to fund they

 as part of our plan for change we be determined to improve the send system across the country so that every child have access to the good opportunity we be committed to improve inclusivity and expertise in mainstream school through the early identification of need as well as to ensure that special school cater to those with the most complex need 
 paul and ellie be child with special educational need in a primary school in bramhall their parent like many across cheadle have reach out to i for help their send provision have be suddenly take away paul and ellie ’s parent be now consider withdraw they from mainstream schooling parentkind research show that more than in parent of child with special educational need say that their need be not be sufficiently meet paul and ellie ’s parent deserve much more certainty and clarity so can the minister confirm when they will bring forward the school white paper and with it the crucial information on the send reform for anxious parent 
 i have hear so many story like paul and ellie ’s and i be so sorry about the experience they have have that be why it be so important that we be already take action to invest in mainstream inclusion to improve teacher training and to support early identification and it be why we be invest £ to support school to provide more specialist place   we be already take that action and we be work very closely with parent around the country like paul and ellie ’s to bring forward a wide set of reform 
 what step her department be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability in mainstream school 
 by prioritise early intervention training and inclusive support in mainstream school we be expand the capacity to deliver timely consistent and high quality send provision this will improve support for child and family we be engage with child parent and expert about the challenge in the system and how we can work together to make sure that every child have the right support when they need it 
 i thank the secretary of state for visit golborne all saint during the summer as she see it be a shin example of inclusive education in action as we mark adhd awareness month will the minister outline the potential impact of the curriculum review on child with adhd and how that can become standard for all child with send so that every child can thrive in a nurture environment 
 the secretary of state be tell i just this morning what a wonderful visit she have to golborne all saints catholic primary and pre school and about the amazing practice there i read with interest the report from my hon friend ’s constituent at her recent send roundtable the review be look closely at what affect child ’s learning in mainstream school include those with send adhd and those without a formal diagnosis make sure that every pupil can access a broad and balanced curriculum 
 elstree village school in my constituency be an excellent example of a small and nurture school that specialise in support child with special educational need sadly we have recently be inform that hertfordshire county council be consider close the school will the minister join i in send a clear message to herts county council that they should reconsider that decision and prioritise the need of child with special educational need in mainstream school 
 i have be very clear that we want to invest in early intervention and nurture provision for child with special educational need if the right hon member would send i more detail of the case i would be happy to look into it 
 i recently hold event with professional and with family on the subject of send in my carlisle constituency their concern be very much back up by figure that show that cumberland be spend less per pupil on those with education health and care plan and that there be few specialist education place in and around carlisle and north cumbria than the rest of the country can the minister tell i how i can work with the department for education to increase the number of specialist education place in my constituency 
 of the good part of my new role have be get letter from people across the house who have have conversation with their community they bring story of challenge but also of some of the great practice that be happen around the country i read my hon friend ’s letter about those challenge with interest and i be committed to work alongside she as i set out we have invest £ to increase the number of specialist place around the country i look forward to a conversation about how that can benefit her constituency 
 the previous schools minister   the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell be so excited to hear from i about manor mead special school in my constituency that she undertake to visit it sadly she have to cancel that visit and have now clearly move on to other thing so would the new schools minister like to visit manor mead special school and see the fantastic work be do there 
 i be proud to follow on from the previous schools minister and would be delighted to visit that school with the hon member 
 on friday i attend a meeting in cornwall of the national association of head teachers we discuss the adversarial nature of the send system for all stakeholder as we develop a system that focus on inclusion do the minister agree that a key indicator of its success must be that it drive out the combative environment that be allow to flourish under year of conservative failure 
 my hon friend be absolutely right i have speak to too many parent who have have to fight so hard just to get the support that their child need the support should be available when child need it which be why we be so determined to invest in early intervention and to back parent to get the support they need 
 the number of ehcp be maintain by hampshire county council be rise exponentially but the funding be simply not keep pace with the demand and the cost surprisingly the proportion of pupil receive send support in mainstream school be go down which demonstrate to i that teacher simply do not feel sufficiently support to support those child the last government introduce the oliver mcgowan mandatory training in neurodivergence for all health and care professional i meet the minister ’s predecessor to discuss introduce a similar programme for education professional would the minister look again at how that programme could support teacher who be struggle in some of the most difficult educational circumstance 
 the government have invest an extra £ into the high needs block and we have change the teacher training package to ensure that it include material on support child with special educational need the pins programme partnership for inclusion of neurodiversity in school be work across the nhs and education to provide more training   for teacher on neurodiversity we be absolutely aware that teacher training be a huge issue and will continue to listen to idea from both side of the house 
 as i have make clear in this chamber on numerous occasion in my part of the world there be sadly far too few specialist school place for child with send headteacher across weymouth and portland have make clear to i that only with a new special school will we be able to deal with this problem give the urgent need will the minister work with i behind the scene by hook or by crook to open a new send school at the osprey quay site in portland in my constituency 
 my hon friend have already reach out to i several time to advocate for his constituent and the importance of specialist place i very much look forward to work with he to increase provision in his constituency 
 on friday i meet primary school in my constituency that be accommodate in their classroom child who they be not set up for school have to convert its library for child for whom the main classroom setting be overwhelming and a have to do the same for its it department what reassurance can the minister give those teacher and school that they will get the funding and resource they need to accommodate child with additional need 
 i have visit bespoke resource centre i be recently in a resource centre in southwark that provide that kind of brilliant provision the £ we have set out be exactly to provide more specialist place that allow child to get the right support they need often within mainstream school and within their local community 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i welcome the minister once again to her place send be a huge issue for every parliamentarian in this house but for month parent and child across the country have be leave in the dark with no clarity as to how the government will support child with special educational need there have be much speculation that ehcp might be scrap speculation cause by the labour government and the minister give no answer in the pack westminster hall debate before the recess i write to she after that debate that be over a month ago and i have yet to receive a letter provide any clarity will she give clarity to the parent she speak about confirm when the white paper might be publish and tell we whether the government will be amend the legislation and scrap ehcp 
 the previous government have year to deliver this reform where be any of this urgency when they be in power i run a council in which i see every day the broken system we be leave to operate the that the last conservative secretary of state for education call lose lose lose i can assure the hon gentleman that this be urgent for i i have see the problem and hear story from across the house   about the challenge that we face we be determined to work with family teacher and expert to get the reform right and ensure that we do not make the mistake that the previous government make 
 what step her department be take to help improve the send system 
 what step she plan to take to reform send provision 
 as we have already hear today and in a pack westminster hall debate last month too many child and family be be let down by the current send system we want child to have support when they need it without a battle we be already invest in early intervention and early inclusion there be new support for send in the early year and £ available for specialist place 
 in few than half of education health and care plan be issue within the week limit month be a huge chunk of a child ’s life and parent of winchester tell i every single week about how hard they have to fight to get the support that their child need and be entitle to what step be the government take to ensure that ehcp be issue in a timely manner 
 parent and child should not have to wait for support they should have it when they need it we be work closely with council with waiting list to improve provision and if necessary to bring in specialist send advice we will continue to push on that 
 i welcome the minister ’s response and the £ investment into the sector however although liverpool have improve waiting time for ehcp there remain a shortage of specialist school place and necessary support some child in liverpool now require an ehcp that figure have double over the past year but almost half of they be educate in mainstream school that do not meet their need more child with send be exclude from school and send into inadequate pupil referral unit and alternative provision what step will the government take to ensure that send reform deliver real improvement for family in liverpool riverside and that no child be exclude from education because of a lack of service 
 i recently see some brilliant specialist provision in a neighbouring liverpool constituency but i know that for too many child in liverpool and across the country waiting list be too long for they to get the support they need that be why we have already start invest in early intervention where there be concern about a local authority ’s capacity to make improvement we will help they to identify barrier and put in place an effective recovery plan this year ’s high need funding increase will help mainstream and special school with the cost of support pupil 
 i have speak to many anxious parent whose child have not be in receipt of an ehcp or local authority funding but would historically have benefit from independent education provision because of their send need of their concern be that such provision can no long be afford because of the imposition of vat on those school on behalf of those parent i implore the government to look at that again and do a u turn 
 would the conservatives support cut breakfast club would they support reduce the expansion of free school meal would they sack teacher those be some of the thing be invest in because we make that decision we be determined to provide support for child with special educational need wherever they need it we want child to be able to go to their local school but we will support they with their need 
 i call the chair of the education committee 
 my committee ’s recent inquiry on send find that although support from health service be critical in enable many child with special educational need and disability to access education health be often not represent at the table and there be no effective mechanism to hold health service to account for the vital role that they play what engagement do my hon friend the minister have with her department for health and social care counterpart to ensure that health service play their full part in support and enable child ’s education 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her leadership of the incredibly detailed education committee report which i read with interest i know how much expertise go into that and how many conversation there be with parent there be so much rich information in it i agree that the partnership with health be essential and that be something i be focus on to give child and young people the good opportunity we must work across government to support young people with special educational need

 the construction skill hub in staveley in my constituency be a great example of the value of apprenticeship and this year young people come straight out of school and start a new construction apprenticeship do my right hon friend agree that the only way we will be able to achieve the government ’s ambitious construction plan be by get more people to take on a construction career in welcome the announcement that she be make can she say what more she will do to ensure we get more young people into our construction industry 
 my hon friend be right and i know he have champion this cause for many year to ensure there be strong vocational and technical route include into area such as construction around more construction apprenticeship place will be make available each year thank to our £ investment but that investment come with reform such as new foundation apprenticeship to equip young people with the skill they need and construction technical excellence college in every region work together with business to ensure that we be train the plasterer the electrician and the bricklayer of the future those be fantastic career with great prospect and we must ensure that they be available to more young people include in my hon friend ’s community 
 in my constituency of amber valley the david nieper academy teach employability skill in conjunction with local industry and it have have neet those not in education employment or training at age for the past academic year will the secretary of state join i in congratulate its student and its staff and will she commit to visit to see how by bring the workplace into the classroom it celebrate both the academic and the vocational 
 that be fantastic to hear not least give the challenge that we still see with quite high level across our country of young people who be not   in employment education or training i and the work and pensions secretary be determined to take action on that and i would be more than happy to do my good to honour my hon friend ’s request 
 after the creative reimagining of the government ’s target for hire more teacher it would be helpful to have some precision on the record for the target of third of young people in high learning we know that high learning mean level or above but what exactly be a gold standard apprenticeship do it mean in growth sector with very high level of completion 
 yes that be area we be refocus our target to ensure that there be strong technical and vocational route for our young people as well as the opportunity to go to university go to university remain a strong option for many young people who want that chance i know conservative members have always be keen to do down our fantastic university but the big gap that we have as a country be around level and level especially in technical and vocational education the right hon gentleman spend a long time in the department for education look at that issue this government will tackle it 
 bath college offer more than course up to degree level and be home to learner its alumnus include gold medal winner jason gardener and drum and bass producer danny byrd i hear the secretary of state speak this morning about the vital importance of vocational training what can the government do to support bath college to expand its programme and training course 
 through the spending review from next year we be invest £ in to-19 funding that funding will run alongside the many commitment in the white paper that i will set out around more foundation apprenticeship new v level and well route into technical and vocational opportunity for our young people work closely with business in key area such as defence construction and engineering but there be more to come 
 too many young people be be saddle with huge debt from university with little to show by way of career prospect there be a clear case for the government to slash poor value degree and redirect the saving to the apprenticeship budget double it to say £ a year will the secretary of state explain why she be allow low quality university course to continue unchecked while taxpayer write off billion of pound every year in unpaid student loan 
 in my statement later today on the white paper i will be set out the action that we will be take to ensure that the regulator the office for students have the power to ensure high quality course and good outcome for young people go to university the policy that the hon gentleman have just outline be in the conservative manifesto which be roundly reject by the british people and ridicule for be financially illiterate because the funding system simply do not work in that way the message that i want to   come across loud and clear from this dispatch box be that if young people have get what it take and they have the qualification to go to university that be a good route for they interruption they should not have their prospect and opportunity dismiss in such a casual and snobbish way by the conservative party 
 secretary of state i do not cough for my benefit it be to help you rather than i have to get up i call the shadow minister 
 on high level learning university have spend at least £ since the attack of   october   on additional security for anti israel protest and the clean up operation that follow yet many of the disciplinary case against those disrupt study have be drop will the secretary of state confirm how many student have be expel or discipline for cause criminal damage incite violence and chant antisemitic abuse 
 let i be absolutely clear there be no place on our university campus in our school or anywhere in our society for antisemitism and i send that message loud and clear that be the message that i have extend to university vice chancellor who should be in no doubt that we expect to see action on campus on this very serious issue that be why we be put more funding into training and support include in our university where we expect to see action because there can be no excuse for jewish student feel unsafe on campus freedom of speech do not mean people have a right to harass or intimidate jewish student and university vice chancellor should be in no doubt that they have a responsibility to act to safeguard the wellbeing of all student

 we have cut red tape put in record investment and tilt the system in favour of young domestic talent and the proof be in the pudding apprenticeship start participation and achievement be up up up under this government 
 use funding deliver by the last conservative government work be under way to deliver an incredible brand new purpose build vocational training centre for the neta training group in stockton it will offer youngster the chance to get great skill and job do the minister agree that we should be cap any debt trap degree course that fail to deliver employment opportunity and instead increase the apprenticeship budget maybe even double it to give young people career focus route to success 
 this be where i think the last government get it wrong we can be pro further education pro technical education and pro high education there be absolutely no need to trade they off against another under this government we have new training opportunity up to foundation apprenticeship start and an unprecedented £ be invest in apprenticeship it be great that the hon member and his constituent in stockton be benefit from that 
 last week i meet representative of centrepoint they highlight that some young people in my constituency be not in education employment or training despite have extensive stem skill and a real drive to participate in that part of the economy connect those young people with exist opportunity be a major challenge and i would like to hear how such opportunity be be create through the exciting proposition of technical college and perhaps v level what work be be do to ensure that those thing be accessible to young people in constituency such as mine 
 my hon friend be right to highlight this issue a young people in this country be not in education employment or training which be a moral stain that the government be absolutely committed to do everything they can to address the future of our skill system sit right at the heart of that effort and i encourage my hon friend to be in the chamber for the statement later today to hear what the government ’s further plan be 
 what step she be take to help increase the affordability of childcare 
 what step she be take to help increase the affordability of childcare 
 welcome minister 
 as it be my time at the dispatch box i want to thank my hon friend   the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan and say what an honour it be to build on his work to give every child the good start in life 
 this government have deliver a record expansion of childcare save work parent £ a year and we be work with our fantastic private voluntary and independent sector and new school base nursery to ensure that this expand provision reach every eligible family 
 i thank the minister for her response and welcome she to her place i recently have the pleasure of welcome my right hon friend the education secretary to st anthony ’s catholic primary school in penge where we see preparation for the opening of its new school base nursery st anthony ’s be of school in my constituency of beckenham and penge to be award money for school base nursery in the round of funding the other be oak lodge primary in west wickham do the minister agree that school base nursery such as these be essential for provide the high quality place we need and crucially for tackle early childhood inequality and close the attainment gap before child start school 
 i do agree with my hon friend and i congratulate st anthony ’s and oak lodge as well as my hon friend for be a tireless champion for his constituent this government have deliver place at new school base nursery this year alone with more to come next september i encourage member across the house to get their local school to apply for a phase grant 
 as the minister have say nursery be an important part of the childcare picture last month i visit mousehold infant and nursery school which thank to the funding it have receive from this government have be able to double the number of place it offer to family in norwich north the team there tell i how this will make a real difference as do family will the minister join i in thank the fantastic team at mousehold and expand a bit far on the step be take to ensure that more provision like this be accessible to family in my constituency and beyond 
 absolutely i thank the brilliant team at mousehold who be so dedicated to give every child the help and support they need this government want every child to have the good start in life which be   why we have expand childcare entitlement be support school to open new nursery and after the conservative party dismantle they be bring back family hub in every community in our country 
 my constituent seb tell i how pleased he be when the government extend the role of free childcare but his nursery change the rule so that the free hour can be take only after o’clock and have to be spread over day a week that mean that the previously pay for care be not now free but cost £ more than before we know that this be happen across the country as nursery struggle with the job tax and other excessive cost so what be the government go to do to help those family get what they be entitle to 
 i encourage the hon lady to write to i with the detail of that case because we be absolutely clear that in this rapid expansion of childcare which half a child have be able to access this september those hour should be available and it should not be the case that extras be charge or anything else i be happy to look at the specific of the case 
 the minister be new to the dispatch box so perhaps we can forgive she for suggest that the conservatives cut the number of family hub since we invent they focus on the issue of cost and move away from primary school private provider be find that the job tax and other hit be make it more and more difficult to pay the bill and ensure that that entitlement which we all want to see give to parent be deliver can i invite the hon lady to give any reflection from her early day as a minister on how we can deliver that can she reach out to those in the treasury and elsewhere to make they understand the ecosystem in which those provider sit 
 sure start be of the great success of the last labour government and it drive significant improvement for our child the conservative party systematically dismantle that across our country with significant negative consequence for our child and young people when this government say that we be prioritise early year we be put our money where our mouth be unlike the conservatives who have a pledge with absolutely no plan with £ this year and £ next year to expand childcare and give every child the good start in life 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 the launch of labour ’s good start in life campaign last week mark a watershed moment the conservatives slash family service leave child and family across our country without support but labour be build back that support revive sure start for a new generation it be more than just the best start advert that people have see on the telly and hear on the radio it be brick and mortar too from derbyshire   to darlington and from staffordshire to swindon labour be give local authority the funding they need to open best start family hub so that community service be truly nationwide once again labour demand the good start in life for child grow up in our country that be how we will get a record share of child school ready that be the difference that a labour government make 
 i declare that i use to work as a university lecturer before be elect of my constituent have already pay nearly £ for their french visa just to be able to undertake their year abroad as part of their degree these cost will exclude student from disadvantaged background from vital international opportunity will the secretary of state meet i to discuss the excessive visa cost face by british student undertake international placement

 urgent question to ask the home secretary to make a statement about home office involvement in the alleged china spying case 
 i thank the shadow home secretary for the question and i thank you mr speaker for the opportunity to respond to it today 
 as i have repeatedly set out to the house the prime minister the home secretary and the wide government be extremely disappointed that this case will not be hear in court i have hear the strength of feel right across the house and i share member concern about the threat we face from espionage the witness statement release last wednesday vindicate what the prime minister and other member of the government have state repeatedly the deputy national security adviser faithfully and with full integrity set out the various threat pose by the chinese state to the uk and he do so in order to try to support a successful prosecution 
 this urgent question ask about the involvement of the home office follow the charge decision make in early under the previous government the crown prosecution service advise the witness that he could not share the evidence with other in government the home office ’s involvement follow the charge decision that be take under the previous government be therefore heavily restrict to avoid breach the cps ’s requirement 
 listen to that 
 order i do not need any help from the government front bench this be a very important statement that really do affect member of this house 
 as i have repeatedly make clear in this house ministers and special adviser be not involve in any aspect of the production of the evidence and i stand by that statement today the prime minister have also make clear that he be inform of the cps ’s decision only a matter of day before the case collapse there be nothing that the prime minister or any other minister could have do at that point that would have change the law and the policy under the previous government between and those who have read the dnsa ’s statement will know that they clearly articulate the threat pose by china base on the   previous government ’s policy at the time detail the damage cause by the alleged offence ultimately it be an entirely independent decision by the cps to discontinue the case and the cps have confirm that it come under no outside pressure to do so 
 like member from all part of the house i remain very frustrated that this case will not be hear in court we want to see the trial go ahead i have make it clear on many occasion that the decision not to proceed be an independent decision by the crown prosecution service and the director of public prosecutions have give assurance that there be no government interference in that decision 
 i note that the joint committee on the national security strategy will be undertake an inquiry on the case and intend to hold public evidence session the intelligence and security committee have also indicate that it will investigate we welcome the launch of the inquiry and the investigation with which the government will of course fully co operate i have already set out the range of activity that this government be take to combat the chinese espionage threat and i hope that that be well understand let i also provide the house with the reassurance that the government will take all necessary action to keep the uk safe and secure 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 last wednesday the prime minister tell this house that no minister or special adviser be involve in the handling of the china spy case yet the sunday times have since report that the home secretary have 
 hear that the case might collapse and have make representation to ensure the evidence put forward be as strong as possible 
 so i ask the minister when do the home secretary become aware that the case might collapse and what representation do she or her proxy make about the evidence and to whom why have the house be tell include just now that ministers and adviser be not involve in any way when the sunday times report that they be 
 the sunday times also report on a key meeting that take place on   september a meeting that the government originally deny take place be it true that jonathan powell chair that meeting do that meeting discuss the cps view that the evidence provide to that point be inadequate and the possibility of provide further evidence in the case will the minister agree to publish the minute of all meeting in which this case be discuss and the correspondence relate to it 
 the sunday times report that follow the meeting the attorney general ’s office be ask to speak to the cps do anyone from the ago speak directly or indirectly to the cps after that meeting can the minister confirm that dan chugg from the foreign office be at the   september   meeting and that it be the same dan chugg who approach the lord speaker with a propose deal in which the chinese ambassador would be allow back into parliament the sunday times also report that the dnsa be understand to have acknowledge privately that the decision not to say that china be an ongoing threat be political in nature be that true 
 finally the current government ’s position have be that all the evidence provide relate to the previous government ’s policy but we now know that that be categorically not true in paragraph of matt collins ’s statement from august this year which he copy and paste from the labour manifesto he stress the importance the current government attach to a positive relationship with china weaken the evidence compare with and bring in current government policy contrary to what we have be tell in recent week why have the government be provide this house with inaccurate information and why do minister know what the cps want but refuse to give it to the cps 
 with great respect a lot of what have just be say do not actually relate to the urgent question that be initially ask by the shadow home secretary i have to say the opposition ’s position be confusing they initially criticise the government for intervene then—[interruption i will answer the question i be answer it i think it be important that on these matter of national security we try to debate thing in a reasonable and sensible way that be the approach that this government will seek to take if members opposite—[interruption 
 order i think we have have enough 
 thank you mr speaker 
 the opposition ’s position be confusing they initially criticise the government for intervene then when it become absolutely clear that we have not do that they criticise we for not intervene they ask for great transparency then when we provide it they accuse the government wrongly of hang people out to dry give that this urgent question relate to the activity of the home office i be not at all clear why the shadow home secretary think it be appropriate give accusation that have be make previously about hang official out to dry to name an official in the foreign commonwealth and development office how do that relate to the urgent question that be ask interruption 
 order i think i need to help a little bit it be in order to mention another department you can not ringfence this and not refer to other people it might not be comfortable but the fact be that a question have be ask that be within order and that be what matter 
 i be grateful for your guidance mr speaker i be simply point out to the shadow home secretary that conservative members have previously criticise ministers and the government for to use their word hang official out to dry and now the shadow home secretary have just name twice an official from the foreign commonwealth and development office interruption 
 order i have say to the government front bench that i do not need any chipping in i certainly do not need it from all along the opposition front bench 
 i do wonder whether at any point the shadow home secretary and certain conservative members not all but certain member have consider the need to have some humility and acknowledge their part in this these activity take place on their watch when they be in government and under the legislation of the time 
 do not just read that out answer the question 
 order mr philp you have have the benefit of an urgent question i have have the benefit some might say of listen to you so i want you to have the benefit of listen to the minister 
 the shadow home secretary would be well advise to listen to the point be make i be seek to respond to the question that he and other right hon and hon member have raise i be try to do that in good faith and i would be grateful for the opportunity to do so 
 i remind the shadow home secretary that we be here today only because the previous conservative government do not move quickly enough to fix the glare hole that exist in our national security law the charge in this case as i hope be well know be bring under the official secrets act this antiquated legislation be draw up before the world war and the conservatives begin review it in because it be widely know that it be not fit for purpose but it take year for they to introduce the national security act fortunately the law have now be update with cross party support but not in time to protect our parliament from chinese espionage if the conservatives have act more quickly and the national security act have be in place when these allege offence happen the prosecution would likely have proceed interruption 
 order look i be try really hard people who hold position should know well 
 let i make this point crystal clear no member of this government nor any special adviser be in any way involve in the evidence submit to the cps or the decision by the dpp not to proceed with the case 
 there be an important omission from the shadow home secretary ’s remark as hon member will know the substantive witness statement be provide under the previous government when the right hon member be a home office minister yet neither he nor the leader of the opposition have take the opportunity to say what involvement conservative ministers and conservative special adviser have in the main tranche of the evidence 
 the prime minister have confirm that no labour ministers or special adviser be involve with the provision of evidence for the case last wednesday during prime minister ’s question the prime minister ask the leader of the opposition to confirm whether that be also the case under the previous government i be in the house last wednesday and i think that i hear the leader of the opposition confirm from a sedentary position that she do know the answer to that question but the conservative party have refuse to   confirm if any conservative ministers or special adviser be involve in the provision of evidence under the previous government i wonder if any of the former ministers in the chamber can provide the answer 
 as ministers have repeatedly say from the dispatch box the government be extremely disappointed that the case do not proceed to trial i gently say to opposition front bench members that they need to stop throw mud and start come to term with what happen on their watch 
 the chair of the home affairs committee   the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley and other relevant select committee chairs include i have meet the director of public prosecutions and send he a detailed series of follow up question the chair of the joint committee on the national security strategy my hon friend   the member for warwick and leamington matt western have convene an inquiry and be likely to call a number of relevant witness include government ministers the minister mention that the isc will be look at this matter can he assure the house that the government will co operate fully with those inquiry and response and that that be the good way to take these matter forward in a thorough and timely fashion 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his question and for the role he have play in these proceeding yes i give he the absolute assurance he seek there be an important role for the house to play in look carefully at precisely what have go on that be why on behalf of the government i very much welcome the work that will now be do by the jcnss and the isc both those important committees have an important role and i be sure that hon member across the house will want to make other contribution as part of that process 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 what a mess we have question for the minister what conversation have he have with all relevant parliamentary authority that might include the speaker ’s office about plan to tighten vetting or ongoing monitoring of researcher and staff to ensure this do not happen again 
 secondly in the witness statement release by this government there be a reference to the use by the previous government of back channel to attempt to dissuade   the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat   and   the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns   from raise concern about confucius institute what be the minister ’s understanding base on the evidence statement and any other information available of the meaning of back channel in that context do it refer to the previous government ’s whips office government official or somebody else 
 thirdly give that the prime minister ’s spokesperson still refuse today to say that china be a threat to britain ’s national security would the minister be comfortable with labour mps accept meeting request from representative of the chinese communist party or any nation ally to china 
 i be genuinely grateful to the hon member for the point he have raise let i take they in turn i lead on behalf of the government on vetting and a lot of work have take place in government since we come into office to ensure that the system and process that underpin our vetting be fit for purpose the hon gentleman be right to ask about it although it might seem like a reasonably niche point it be an important because our national security be underpin by our ability to vet those who have access to privileged information he for reason that i completely understand make reference to a link between the work that we be do in government and the importance of ensure that the appropriate vetting procedure be in place for this house i know he will understand that fundamentally that will be a matter for the speaker and for this house but i can give he an absolute assurance that we will work closely with mr speaker the deputy speakers and all those in this place to ensure that we look carefully at what happen and satisfy ourselves that the vetting arrangement be absolutely fit for purpose 
 the hon gentleman ’s point relate specifically to member of this house i do not believe that either of those member be in their place today i be keen to meet they and work closely with they and to ensure that the government be provide the support that they may want or require i be happy to speak to the hon gentleman and to those member about the point that he have make 
 with regard to the hon gentleman ’s final point which be specifically about china i hope he will acknowledge that the government have be crystal clear about our position with regard to china—[interruption right hon and hon member may chuckle but we have have this debate previously if there be member who think that the nature of our relationship with china can be define by a single word then i do not believe that they be serious about the nature of the relationship all member in this house have an absolute responsibility to decide for themselves what meeting they take with great respect to the hon gentleman i do not believe that it be for minister to opine from the dispatch box about whether individual member should take meeting or not 
 personally i be very clear that china remain an active persistent and everyday threat to our country and have do so for many year in the light of this what step be the minister take on behalf of the government to ensure that parliamentarian across this house be much well protect in the year to come from the kind of foreign interference that we see regularly unfortunately on the last government ’s watch 
 i be grateful to my hon friend not only for his question but for his previous service and for the work of his constituent with regard to underpin our national security he make an important point he will know as will you madam deputy speaker that the national protective security authority recently publish guidance design specifically to provide hon member with advice and guidance to ensure that they be well able to deal with the risk and threat that all of we in this house face 
 on the part of my hon friend ’s question that be something that the government take incredibly seriously we inherit the defend democracy taskforce   from the previous government that be a good institution and i have on many occasion pay tribute to all those conservatives members who be involve in set it up the prime minister have renew the mandate of the defend democracy taskforce it be the fulcrum point across government that bring the different departments and law enforcement together alongside member of this house to ensure that we be do everything that we can to address and tackle the threat that we face i have always believe and maintain that that should be a share endeavour right across this house and my door will always be open to member of the house who would like to discuss it 
 i rather think that in a civilised country whether or not someone be prosecute depend on the evidence be it therefore wise for the witness statement to replicate word for word the word of the labour party manifesto and have it ever happen before 
 i always appreciate the leader of the house ’s questions—[hon member father of the house forgive i i always appreciate the father of the house ’s question because he bring a long stand wisdom and perspective to these matter i hope he will understand that in line with the point that he make about civility it be not for minister to critique the decision that be make by the cps the government have make it clear to the house on many occasion that this be an independent decision that be take by the cps and the dpp have be clear about the fact that no special adviser and no minister interfere in that process 
 mr speaker i share your frustration at the collapse of the case question remain top of mind for member of the house and for people in my constituency what be the minister ’s assessment of the risk of spy on mps in this house secondly what be his assessment of the ongoing transnational repression of british national overseas passport holder in milton keynes and elsewhere across the country do it not show a pattern of chinese government activity right across the uk which be a risk to we 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise her concern in the way that she do i hope that she understand as the house do that this government have be absolutely clear that no interference in our democratic process be remotely acceptable and that there be no circumstance under which we will tolerate country wherever they may be seek to cause harm to anybody who be resident in the united kingdom she specifically mention transnational repression that be something that the government take incredibly seriously and we have do a lot of work on it through the defend democracy taskforce let i say again to she and to the house that it be completely unacceptable that china or any other country should seek to harm anybody who live here in the united kingdom
