 i pay tribute to my predecessor mr paul girvan not just for his tenure as a member of this house but for his time as a member of the northern ireland assembly and as a local councillor south antrim have move between paul ’s party and my ulster unionist party on a number of occasion with that i carry the privilege   and honour of return the uup to this place after a year absence and the charge and responsibility of bring a moderate and reason unionist voice from northern ireland in my party ’s tradition of work positively and constructively with all to achieve the good outcome for all our people and of work across this house to strengthen our union and to deliver a union for all 
 i turn now to my constituency of south antrim i want those here this evening to know what a fantastic part of our country it be like so many constituency it have a mix of main town ballyclare and antrim and a range of what be once small village but be grow into large village such as toome doagh crumlin randalstown templepatrick ballynure and many more much of the constituency be a large and productive rural area while part of the expand urban area of glengormley be merge with north belfast in mossley and mallusk 
 south antrim be home to industry research and cutting edge business in large and small employer indeed i look forward to work with the chancellor and her government in far support those business through the bills in the king ’s speech and especially through the national wealth fund south antrim be the base of belfast international airport which i believe have a real opportunity if it get its much need rail link and the further expansion of aldergrove and our royal air force base that be why i believe that we also need a uk air transportation strategy which i may raise later in the adjournment debate if   the hon member for strangford jim shannon   will take an intervention from i 
 south antrim ’s agricultural sector be another pillar of our community and contribute significantly to our local economy our annual antrim agricultural show celebrate that agricultural heritage by bring together farmer producer and visitor from across the country and showcase the good of rural life and promote a strong sense of community it be on this saturday at shane ’s castle and i would encourage and welcome anyone who want to attend 
 loch neagh the large freshwater lake in the british isle be another jewel in south antrim ’s crown but it be currently struggle because of neglect like many of our waterway however the stormont executive ’s new recovery programme be in place and i hope that with national support give the need for action on our waterway loch neagh will once more be a tourism and recreational attraction for visitor from far and wide 
 a number of issue debate over the past few day will have a direct impact on the people of south antrim northern ireland and the united kingdom none more so than the future and support that the government will offer our national health service and those who rely on and work in it the government have the opportunity to reverse the past year of neglect health may be devolve but that do not mean that we in this place can abdicate all responsibility for our national health service we have the excellent antrim area hospital in my constituency but it need resource and support to develop its potential as a former health minister of northern ireland i know that we have plan to deliver well service but change need recurrent resource   which have be lack in recent year i look forward to work with this government to rebuild our national health service 
 i know that i be speak to the converted on how great south antrim be because i have be overwhelm by the number of member from across the house who have approach i to tell i of a relative or friend who live in my constituency indeed i look forward to represent they and all my south antrim constituent in this place 
 thank you mr deputy speaker for call i to make my maiden speech i congratulate   the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins   on a fine speech and a very impressive description of her constituency and her motivation for come to this place 
 it have take i some time to get elect to the house i stand in a general election back in so no can accuse i of be a young man in a rush i be humble to finally be here have do some other thing in party politic along the way i pay tribute to my late mum and dad who inspire i to get involve in politic they give i my labour value and i be sorry that they just miss out on the chance to see i get here i also thank my family for their huge support include lot of campaigning and lot of patience as my speech have come rather late in this debate 
 i thank the elector of north durham for vote for i to represent they in this house i promise that i will always fight for their interest and i could not want to represent a fine constituency i follow into the house the right hon kevan jones he be an extremely tough act to follow and i wish he well both in overcome his health trouble and in his new role have be elevate to the other place kevan be elect mp for north durham in and serve the constituency and this house with distinction for year he be utterly commit to the defence and security of our country serve as a defence minister with multiple stint on the defence committee he be the long serve member of the intelligence and security committee a vice president of the nato parliamentary assembly and a commissioner of the commonwealth war graves commission that be highly appropriate give the number of veteran in the north durham constituency particularly people associate with the durham light infantry 
 i be sure that in the other place kevan will continue to work on defence and other issue such as the sub postmaster campaign for justice his continued work on the horizon redress advisory board will give reassurance to victim kevan will continue to pursue an outcome for sub postmaster who use the capture software in the 1990 which be currently the subject of an independent investigation that be commission by the government early this year many hon member will know that kevan be a keen photographer often capture and share the beauty of north durham countless voter and local organisation have tell i how much they have be help by kevan he be hold in high regard not just across this house but across north durham 
 i have be elect in a long line of labour members all as far as i can discern from the same moderate tradition in the party that i stand in and include distinguish front benchers such as giles radice and jack lawson who serve as attlee ’s secretary of state for war in the closing day of world war the chester le street part of my constituency have a unique distinction in the history of the labour party have return a labour member to the house continuously since so no pressure on i to keep win at all however that long labour history do not mean that north durham be a safe seat in every characteristic other than never have be lose it be a red wall seat   and have be electorally competitive in the last contest indeed this most recent election campaign be rather lively than i would have prefer 
 chester le street be only part of north durham under its current boundary however with the other major town be stanley the constituency be rural surprisingly so aside from the main town there be numerous village i may get into trouble for not list some of they but i will try to list the major one sacriston tantobie tanfield beamish bournmoor lumley pelton pelton fell craghead ouston lanchester burnhope castleside and annfield plain be just some of they i wish to thank   the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden who previously represent lanchester burnhope and castleside in the north west durham constituency in the last parliament and who have be most courteous and helpful in handing over responsibility for those fine community 
 i urge hon member to visit north durham as well as fine town and village it have stunning countryside and attraction include beamish the world famous open air museum that bring the history of north east england to life and durham county cricket club ’s riverside ground 
 kevan always describe north durham as a rural constituency with urban problem and that remain the case mining be at the heart of the history and previous economy of north durham almost every village have a pit wheel memorial many also have memorial to terrible mining disaster and many have lodge banner that be parade at the durham gala the decline of the industry over many decade and its eventual destruction in the 1980s along with the closure of other major local employer leave terrible economic and social scar and a sense that some community in the constituency have be leave behind level up if it reach anywhere do not reach the proud community that elect i 
 that bring i to the local importance of the topic of today ’s debate economy welfare and public service north durham need economic stability and growth it be a travesty that there be so many family dependent on food bank it need new skilled and well pay job in the industry of the future it need investment and project decision by the government to be target at create job where they be most need 
 north durham need a fairer distribution of public spending change to the local government funding formula over the last year have be unfair and remove resource from authority such as durham county council that be deal with the high level of deprivation and hamper their ability to deliver effective local service that urgently need to be change in the next local government funding settlement 
 capital spending on public service be also urgently need on friday i visit sacriston academy a primary school and be horrify to find excellent teacher deliver high quality education but in a setting that be literally fall down with ceiling hold up by scaffold joist and whole classroom build in indeed famous former pupil include bobby robson now unusable due to water penetration through the ceiling and wall local child deserve so much well 
 public transport in the constituency be not fit for purpose we need more frequent and reliable bus and more train stop at chester le street we also need the economic regeneration of local town centre the once thriving front streets of chester le street and stanley be run down and need new life 
 i think the house for listen to i today i look forward to contribute to debate here and to fight tenaciously for the cause of north durham and its people and the wide north east 
 i congratulate everybody who have make their maiden speech in this debate it be a big moment in ’s parliamentary career but you be out the other side and nothing will be quite as traumatic as what you have experience today to go through they very briefly i thank   the hon member for queen ’s park and maida vale georgia gould who tell we that her great grandfather i think come from lithuania to set up a store in the middle of her constituency which be her connection with it   the hon member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman   pay a very generous tribute to mike freer and the danger and intimidation that he face she be also generous to mrs thatcher she be clearly a very generous lady 
 the hon member for welwyn hatfield andrew lewin   pay tribute to grant shapps and his numerous and frequent cabinet position as well as his commitment to ukraine   the hon member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh   pay tribute to the labour woman mp who be now in the house as well as to harriet harman my hon friend   the member for bromsgrove bradley thomas   manage to weave king john and a. e. housman into his speech and inform we that hollywood be not a city on the west coast of the united states but be actually within his constituency if you want to see film star lady and gentleman go to bromsgrove 
 my hon friend   the member for mid leicestershire mr bedford   have the peculiarity of have forebear who be still member of this house he be generous to each of they which show that he be a wise man and will go far   the hon member for hartlepool mr brash   stress the industrial and shipping heritage of his constituency and how it be indeed bombard by the germans in world war but it give as good as it get my hon friend   the member for west suffolk nick timothy   praise his predecessor matt hancock of course focus on racing and horse although not i notice on horseplay as such 
 the hon member for newton aycliffe and spennymoor alan strickland   focus with great pride on the hitachi rail company in his constituency shortly i be afraid to tell he to be seize by the labour party and nationalise as part of its government programme my hon friend   the member for farnham and bordon greg stafford   stress defence spending   the hon member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake   leasehold reform and   the hon member for south antrim robin swann   the importance of agriculture 
 i be out of the chamber for the speech of   the hon member for didcot and wantage olly glover and the whip ’s note simply say he say that there be a cat rub his leg or something to that effect laughter represent a highly rural constituency as i do i know that strange thing do occur particularly late on those dull winter evening 
 the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister   stress the importance of child in care   the hon member for halifax kate dearden   refer to her constituency as the new haliwood so another hollywood reference there i think my hon friend   the member for huntingdon ben obese jecty   give a very witty speech and stress the association with the raf in his commitment to veteran   the hon member for morecambe and lunesdale lizzi collinge   pay tribute to david morris and his support for the eden project and i be particularly pleased to see she do that 
 the hon member for north down alex easton   make i think of the most moving maiden speech that we have hear in this house for a very long time he speak very movingly about his parent and we all know what pride his dad would have have in the fact that he have be successful in his attempt to join we here in the house of commons   the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins   reference the fact that a roman road watle street run through her constituency and speak passionately about the importance of community and tolerance 
 finally   the hon member for north durham luke akehurst   speak warmly of kevan jones whom all of we who have be in this house for a while remember with great fondness and the importance of skilled and well pay job in his constituency i hope that i have pretty much covered everybody and say the main thing that need say 
 let we now turn to the debate itself and it seem to i that   the right hon member for leeds west and pudsey rachel reeves while i congratulate she warmly on be the female chancellor i think that be a huge achievement and be to be very warmly welcome be   i be afraid suffer from some level of amnesia she appear to have forget the legacy that we have bequeath to she inflation which be up at over last autumn be now back to target mortgage rate be soften real wage have be grow in each of the last month and taxis have be come down more recently under the previous government when it come to debt we be on target as we hand over to the right hon lady to see debt fall in line with her own fiscal target at the end of the year and we of course have the fast grow economy in the g7 
 wonder where this amnesia be come from and it be of course nothing more than smoke and mirror it be to cover up the fact that the chancellor be roll the pitch to raise taxis against all the commitment she make during the general election she will be raise those taxis in the autumn it will not be because we have bequeath she something of which she be not aware in advance the ifs have make it very clear that the book be open as paul johnson say for all to see 
 when it come to public service we have a proud record on education we have the good reader in the western world we have be go up the pisa scale for mathematic and science something that do not happen under the last labour government crime have be halve broadly speak across the period from to the present day when it come to work and welfare we have a near record level of employment and we have a low level of unemployment and economic inactivity be low than in every single year under the last labour government what be labour ’s record when they leave office unemployment be double the level that it be today under every single labour government in history unemployment have be high when they leave office than when they come in most disgraceful of all be that youth unemployment be up under the last labour government under the last conservative government it be down by over 
 as for welfare under labour there be people languish on long term benefit for almost a decade on pension we see the 75p pension increase and the gordon brown raid on private pension of £ from which the pension system never fully recover it be therefore no surprise that under labour we end up with the high level of pensioner poverty across europe under labour there be more people in absolute poverty after housing cost there be more pensioner in poverty and more child in poverty under the last labour government than there be today 
 we will be a responsible opposition we welcome the commitment to growth in the king ’s speech we welcome the commitment to building house as long as that be with sufficient local consent we welcome the budget responsibility bill in principle and we welcome the announcement that the chancellor have make regard pension consolidate pension and ensure that we get well return for pensioner and that we invest in long term pension capital 
 but there be too many echo in this king ’s speech of the labour of old the nationalisation of the railway the consolidation of gb energy the long hand of government reaching—[hon member hear hear labour members cheer now but they will not be cheer in a few year time they have short memory i remember   when the railway be nationalise and it be not a pretty situation they be bring forward french style employment law that will lead to less efficient business and to tribunal they will be increase the freedom of trade union who be their paymaster and they will be dispense with minimum service level that will lead to more strike and the inconvenience of the public but certainly not great growth 
 what have we hear in the king ’s speech on welfare of the big challenge of the modern age zip absolutely nothing nada diddly squat absolutely nothing from the labour party they talk about move the national careers service from the department for education to the department for work and pensions well i hardly think that will move the dial their back to work plan be name exactly as our back to work plan be that my right hon friend   the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt   the shadow chancellor and i launch last autumn but it have nothing stand behind it not the billion of pound of support we put in place to encourage people to go into work and to transform life 
 all we have hear from those on the government benches be a denigration of our job centre these be describe as place of fear by the secretary of state for work and pensions and by the minister for employment   the hon member for birkenhead alison mcgovern   as place that do not offer real help what an insult to the ten of thousand of hard work people up and down our country who go into those office to help people improve their prospect and improve their life they be against what they call punitive sanction it will cost hundred of million of pound to remove those and it will result in less engagement with the help that be available and diminish people ’s life chance there have be no comment whatsoever from the government benches on our work capability assessment reform that accord to the office for budget responsibility will see few people on long term sickness benefit they oppose in poetry they have to govern in prose they have not even pick up the pen but let i be clear we make mistake in government and we have pay the price at the ballot box and it be right that my party now face a period of reflection and do so with humility the electorate have speak and we must listen but that be not the same as say that the vision that be conservatism have die even if of late it have be too often obscure that vision still burn bright it burn bright as a beacon of freedom enterprise opportunity and yes stability and hope in the face of

 thank you madam deputy speaker it be a pleasure to follow   the right hon and learn member for fareham and waterlooville suella braverman like other member i be somewhat surprised by her rewrite of recent economic history she have year to fix the problem of child poverty and do precious little to do that i listen today to the chancellor of the exchequer lie out this government ’s plan to restore economic stability and growth to this country that be what will lift million of child out of poverty in the long term 
 it be a privilege to stand here today represent the place where i be bear and raise finchley and golders green i would like to start by pay tribute to my predecessor mike freer although we disagree on many thing mike be dedicate to our area both as a member of parliament and as leader of barnet council   i admire his commitment to public service and in particular his role in secure equal marriage legislation for same sex couple a legacy that he can take enormous pride in but the circumstance under which mike decide not to stand for re election be appalling we should have be able to face each other on the basis of our idea but mike ’s life and office be threaten by those who believe in the bullet not the ballot box it be a stark reminder of the fragility of our democracy both at home and abroad 
 i want to use my time in this place to stand up for the democratic value and process that i believe in witness the dignified and smooth transition of power last week in all part of this house be something we can take pride in we must ensure that we work together to defend the safety of public servant i wish mike and his husband angelo all the good in their future 
 i also pay tribute to the much miss dr rudi vis who hold a special place in the heart of my local community not least as the labour member to represent this special patch of north london in over a century i be only the person from my party to be send to this place by the people of finchley and golders green i be also only the woman some member may remember the when mrs thatcher enter this place she be make to wait whole year to make her maiden speech but in our era of breakneck news cycle and with so much work that i want to do have to wait just week have feel like a very long time have delay long enough mrs thatcher do not waste a when she rise to her foot break convention by make her maiden speech on a private member ’s bill that she introduce 
 this be a maiden speech 
 she say her sonorous tone echo through this hallowed place 
 but i know that the constituency of finchley would not wish i to do other than come straight to the point”.—[official report   february vol c. 
 the people of finchley and golders green rightly remain as demand of their elect official today so i too will come straight to the point like mrs thatcher i be a patriot and i want our community and our country to prosper and be an influence on the global stage but unlike she i fundamentally believe that there be such a thing as society society be not an abstract idea to be bury in sociological essay we can see it in the rich tapestry of community that come together across finchley and golders green i may be the female jewish gibraltarian mp from this constituency but i would not be here without the support of my neighbour and my community the cypriot community the somali bravanese the kosovan the japanese the irish and hindu community the lawyer and the uber driver the charity worker and the campaigner the spurs fan and the fan of some other north london team whereas in recent time some politician have choose to use north londoner as an insult my constituent and i wear it as a badge of pride it symbolise a place that celebrate diversity hard work and look out for your neighbour 
 our diversity come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the history of our area where else can boast the parish where archbishop desmond tutu hone his   ministry in the terrible year of exile during apartheid in south africa and the childhood home of the late and great rabbi jonathan sacks a man who teach we that a good society be that offer all its member equal access to hope it be in east finchley that george michael tinkle on the ivory and amy winehouse take the stage 
 finchley and golders green have a quiet radicalism bake into its history take hampstead garden suburb where i grow up a project drive by the extraordinary henrietta barnett in the early century of the garden city it be a groundbreaking development she also set up toynbee hall in london ’s east end where i begin my legal career as a volunteer at the free legal advice centre i see there just how important the law could be for tenant face eviction and woman suffer unequal pay now i want to take those value of access to justice and a commitment to the rule of law into my new role as solicitor general 
 when in we witness the opening of golders green underground station advert at the time dub our area a place of delightful prospect i can vouch that never a truer word have be speak but this place of delightful prospect have suffer in recent year my community have witness rise level of antisemitism and islamophobia these be a scourge on our society and as long as i be in office i will tirelessly call they out and work to eradicate they 
 our community today be increasingly become a place of busy food bank and empty mansion inequality be writ large stunt people ’s health and potential many across finchley and golders green be struggle with the spiral cost of living this have to change not just in my constituency but across the whole country our nhs be break the prison be full the police can not respond when they be call out and our teacher be not support to deliver we need to get britain back on track and the bills set out in the king ’s speech be exactly what we need to take the brake off the economy and restore and rebuild our public service 
 my constituent be rare to go whether it be the brent cross town development of the large regeneration development in europe or our brilliant high street business and local entrepreneur all we need to get grow be a government who be on our side well we have that government now so to quote my famous predecessor let ’s get straight to the point and let ’s get on with the change that britain truly need 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for allow i to make my maiden speech in this debate it be a privilege to follow the female chancellor in history and to follow inspire maiden speech from the labour benches by my hon friend the members for queen ’s park and maida vale georgia gould and for finchley and golders green sarah sackman it be an honour to sit alongside they on the government benches and their community be both very lucky to have they 
 as hon member can imagine i have give careful thought to my remark today but it be safe to say that this be not the most anticipated maiden speech ever   associate with welwyn hatfield the reason for that be that on   november elizabeth i give her inaugural address as queen from hatfield house in my constituency irrespective of how the next few minute go i think her place in history be safe 
 i be especially grateful to be call in this debate on the economy my constituency be anchor by new town that flourish under a previous labour government hatfield and welwyn garden city be incorporate as new town together under a single development corporation on   may the growth of hatfield and welwyn garden city play an important role in the rebuilding and reimagining of life in our part of the country after the horror of the world war i believe that if we be to succeed in grow our economy we have to rediscover the ambition and the vision that be embody by those who design and carefully plan our great town 
 my predecessor as the mp for welwyn hatfield be the right hon grant shapps who serve our community for year and will be well known to all member of this house in fact he will probably be familiar to anyone who be watch a morning television news programme at any point over the last year before i talk about grant ’s legacy however i want to start with a message of reassurance to the labour whips and my colleague i have no desire to hold quite so many cabinet position as he do and certainly not in such a short period of time 
 i want to reflect solemnly on the personal and professional commitment that grant shapps make to the people of ukraine after the russian invasion in he open his family home to provide sanctuary to generation of a ukrainian family innocent people whose life be turn upside down by putin ’s unprovoked act of aggression in the last parliament more than ukrainians be welcome to our country under the ukraine family scheme and the ukraine sponsorship scheme an initiative that i believe show our country at its good open and welcome in an hour of grave need 
 we serve in this house of commons at a time when our wide political discourse can often be angry and divisive of course we will disagree in the house and passionately so our constituent rightly expect we always to stand up for our community and our value and i will certainly try to do just that but i think we can too easily forget what unite we where we agree let we have the confidence to say so my predecessor be right to champion the people of ukraine and the cause of freedom and democracy i commend he for it and wish he well in whatever come next 
 welwyn hatfield be a constituency rich in history welwyn village and woolmer green be both roman settlement and welwyn be of the few place in the country believe to have be occupy continuously for year nearly year after hatfield be home to queen elizabeth i local people make an important contribution to the defeat of nazi tyranny the royal air force ’s mosquito fighter bomber be develop at the de havilland airfield and aircraft factory in hatfield welwyn garden city also have a unique place in history as the creation of ebenezer howard the father of the garden city movement his immaculately planned and tree line street such as parkway in welwyn garden city be still true to his vision from nearly year ago 
 despite our wonderful history what have strike i when i have walk around our town and village be the impression of too many project on hold and potential go unfulfilled take the iconic shredded wheat silos design by louis de soissons in and a define feature of welwyn garden city for decade the site have lain virtually dormant since the factory close in in central hatfield it be a similar story queensway house consist of unit that be once all social housing in november after a ballot of resident a majority decide that it be time to demolish and rebuild but nearly year later queensway house be still stand and it loom over the centre of hatfield as a symbol of the inertia that have capture our politic for too long i be determined that that must change the centre of hatfield be part of our community that most urgently need investment in good quality housing and social infrastructure and i will be a champion for it in this house 
 welwyn hatfield be a grow and increasingly diverse community in just the last few month i have attend the world street food festival in welwyn garden city the ever diwali celebration in white lion square in hatfield and the ever popular welwyn festival on singlers marsh we be home to prominent national business include tesco and ocado in hatfield and to the thriving university of hertfordshire the university will soon be open its state of the art spectra building for the study of physics engineering and computer science and yes mr vice chancellor as this will appear in hansard please consider that to be my formal bid for an invitation to its opening 
 i believe that a new parliament be a time for ambition and optimism welwyn hatfield blossom when attlee ’s labour government put housing and carefully plan community at the centre of its agenda for change nearly year later we have another majority labour government with a mandate for national renewal this be a moment of opportunity and each of we on these benches have a responsibility to play our part in realise it for as long as i serve in this house of commons i will always do my utmost to champion welwyn hatfield to respect our history and to be an agent for change 
 i congratulate   the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy   on his maiden speech and all those who have speak for the time in the house today 
 it be an honour for i to make my maiden speech as the member of parliament for the newton aycliffe and spennymoor constituency i pay tribute to those who come before i the former sedgefield constituency make up the majority of the new seat in addition we have take spennymoor and tudhoe ward from bishop aukland and coxhoe ward from city of durham i wish to put on record my thank and pay tribute to paul howell and dehenna davison for their public service and to my hon friend   the member for city of durham mary kelly foy   for her continue dedication to her constituent 
 unlike some former member of this house i be not fluent in latin but i be assure that the motto of my hometown translate as not the least but the great we seek this have not only serve as a powerful statement of intent for the new town of aycliffe since but capture the share spirit of the town and village across this new constituency varied in history but unite in a desire to get on to do well to strive for a well future my own family ’s story be testament to this spirit of aspiration that have long define the work people of our country 
 several generation ago both side of my family be draw from mining village across england to the durham coalfield because of their reputation for good wage and reliable work in turn my grandparent move from pit village to aycliffe new town home for year to the late lord beveridge in search of modern housing and well job for their child my parent generation then work hard to give we the opportunity that they never have include high education the chance to work across the country and across the world and personal freedom to flourish this ethos that each generation raise the next that background be no barrier and that opportunity be distribute as widely as talent be the drive force in family in my constituency and a lodestar for this government 
 but make that a reality require strong economic growth across our country we must back the industry of the future such as hitachi rail in my constituency which manufacture world class green train and employ highly skilled worker and another in the supply chain i thank a former member of this house   phil wilson for his tireless campaign alongside the northern echo which lead to the plant be locate in the area some year ago i be also grateful for the public commitment make by my right hon friend the prime minister the chancellor and the transport secretary to support hitachi ’s future i look forward to work with they to secure those job and expand high tech manufacturing more widely that include the innovative work at sedgefield ’s netpark this durham university spin off hub develop innovative product in satellite technology drug development and biological weapon detection which be then export around the globe the creation of job in the industry of the future be particularly important in a constituency with former mining community where ongoing economic development be badly need 
 i do not want the house to think that my constituency be all work and no play we be famous for the sedgefield ball game a historic shrove tuesday tradition not for the faint hearted we be home to excellent football club include newton aycliffe where my parent serve on the committee and spennymoor town spennymoor itself typify our rich cultural history with a heritage trail dedicate to norman cornish of the pitman painter who learn his craft alongside his mining in the spennymoor settlement 
 some of the good brass band in the country can also be find in the constituency they not only keep alive the cultural tradition of our past but provide excellent high quality music education for new generation of young people today we be also home to incredible local produce include artisan chocolate make in coxhoe and award win real ale brew at the surtees arms in ferryhill i have personally quality assure the latter on several occasion on the topic of ale my predecessor tony blair be note for host world leader in pub across the constituency i have yet to find a pub without a photo of the former prime minister and his close nato ally but my diligent search continue 
 finally i be proud of our thrive community organisation the ladder centre do invaluable work to support resident and the cornforth partnership be a lifeline for those look to get back into work just as durham coal power our economy in the past so constituency such as mine can power our modern economy with high tech green manufacturing and research 
 let i return to where i began—“not the least but the great we seek mr deputy speaker in this house let we commit ourselves to seek the great the very good for our constituent for our community and for our great nation i look forward to see the economic measure in the king ’s speech start to spread wealth growth and opportunity to every corner of this united kingdom include the people of newton aycliffe and spennymoor 
 thank you mr deputy speaker for call i to speak i congratulate   the hon member for newton aycliffe and spennymoor alan strickland   on his maiden speech i do not think that we cross over at university but mutual   friend tell i that he be an excellent president of the oxford student union we can tell that his debating skill be hone there and we see that in evidence this evening 
 i want to express my gratitude to the people of the new farnham and bordon constituency for place their trust in i and for allow i the honour to represent they here in parliament i feel that give a maiden speech be a bit like give a good man ’s speech at a wedding as you be surround by disapprove elderly relative who be go to hang on every word but i can assure you mr deputy speaker that none of the joke that i have make before in any good man ’s speech will be give in this house especially as i know that my mother in law be watch on the parliament channel 
 i also wish to thank my family especially my wife caroline and my daughter susannah and lucy who have put up with i a lot over the past year for their patience and support as well as my parent james and theresa 
 other hon member have note that they be not the people in their family to be member of parliament i be not even the sibling to be a member of parliament i pay tribute to my brother alexander who serve the people of the rother valley constituency so diligently in the previous parliament 
 apparently it be also customary to express gratitude to our predecessor in the seat a small political obituary as it be fortunately both my immediate predecessor my right hon friend the members for godalming and ash jeremy hunt and for east hampshire damian hinds be still as member can see very much in their political prime none the less i want to thank they for their generous support and advice since i be select they have both achieve amazing thing for the constituent whom i have inherit campaigning be a sobering affair on the doorstep i be tell oh we do like jeremy or damian do such wonderful stuff for we or you have very big shoe to fill to rub salt into the wound the week before the election the local paper run a story on how much the people of haslemere would miss the shadow chancellor believe i i know my place 
 speak of predecessor the predecessor of my right hon friend the member for east hampshire lord arbuthnot should be praise for his sterling work on the horizonscandal and for bring justice to the sub postmaster so cruelly affect i still hope that those who be responsible by act or omission be bring to justice 
 the newly create farnham and bordon be a county constituency cross surrey and hampshire make the life of a new member of parliament even more complex than it already be more than that the name while reference the large town in each county ignore the other town of haslemere and liphook and the many village that range between the large population centre many argue for and i support a less specific but more all encompass name for the constituency such as the wey valley take its name from the beautiful river wey that run through it clearly they be not romantic in the boundary commission so farnham and bordon stick the only save grace be that its initial spell fab which sum up the area that i represent 
 this fab constituency range from farnham in the north to haslemere and liphook in the south whitehill and bordon in the west and the western village of surrey such as tilford in the east bookende by the north and south down it be an area of outstanding beauty with thrive market town pleasant village and a thrive sport and art scene include the prestigious university for the creative arts it also have a significant military connection most obviously in bordon which be home to the royal electrical and mechanical engineers until and be home to the longmoor range where ukrainian troop be be train military history be everywhere from amesbury school in haslemere and hindhead where montgomery live during the war to the canadian war graf and memorial in liphook and the site of the ever minute silence in this country on castle street in farnham the resident of this new constituency be ever thankful for the role that our armed force have play in keep we safe 
 from arthur conan doyle to jonny wilkinson king john to flora thompson and graham thorpe to   the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice hero and villain have be bear live work and play in this fabulous constituency but it be not the beautiful scenery the historic gem or the famous people who make this constituency the good in the country it be not even the fact that my grandparent run stafford ’s sweet shop in haslemere for many year what little boy would not want grandparent who run a sweet shop it be the current resident business and community spirit that make fab special and a joy to represent every day there be local event charitable occasion and community festivity to get involve with indeed i doubt that anywhere else in this country can rival the number of duck race in the area 
 follow that cook ’s tour of the constituency might be forgive for think that there be no issue to solve a home county garden of eden it of course can not be deny that there be many area of significant affluence but it should not be conceal that there be area of high deprivation and i will champion their improvement the constituency ’s location be both a benefit and a curse within easy commuting distance of london it provide a rural haven for those who wish to live outside but work in the city that also make it rich picking for housing developer who look for any open space green or otherwise to build on i be not against housing development we need home for our child and grandchild but we need the right home in the right place with the right tenure mix and with the support infrastructure 
 conservative run east hampshire district council have do everything that it can to persuade the new government to modify their housing target to make they more appropriate for our area include write to the deputy prime minister i hope that she will respond positively indeed if there be issue that unite the whole of the new farnham and bordon constituency it be that infrastructure have not keep pace with development that be particularly acute in bordon where thousand of house be go up without the support infrastructure the gp surgery the nhs dentist the school the road and the leisure centre all need upgrade and expand rapidly to meet that housing growth   we must not build more house until infrastructure catch up otherwise we will be leave with housing estate devoid of service security and society i be deeply concerned about the new government ’s plan on house building labour ’s change to planning impose top down target and remove the right of local people to have their say on development be a retrograde step that have be meet with anger from my constituent and resolute opposition from i 
 i mention the need for health service in our area have spend most of my career in healthcare latterly work for year in the nhs improve clinical service and patient outcome i know that both locally and nationally thing need to change in the nhs we need to have a grow up and honest discussion with the public about how we be go to deliver provide and fund the nhs and social care go forwards for an age population with increase healthcare need and diminish birth rate that is the people who be go to pay for the nhs we need a cross party discussion that bring all party together to make long term decision on how we proceed with health and social care in this country if i achieve nothing else in my time here start that conversation and hopefully progress it fruitfully will be something to hope for 
 as a traditional common sense conservative i believe that we can not pay for health and social care unless we have a strong economy despite a global pandemic a war in the east of europe and instability in the middle east and regardless of the picture that the government be try to paint in their press release the most recent statistic show that the economy be turn around and be on an upward trajectory i will oppose any measure by this government include the misguided nationalisation of industry and the socialist labour rule that i believe will hamper or reverse that trend 
 equally important be to safeguard ourselves from external threat the rise of a resurgent russia china and north korea be something that we should all be concern about i do not believe that it be hyperbole to say that we be in a pre war era and we need to ensure that our border sky and infrastructure both physical and digital be safe from threat that be why i absolutely believe that we should move to of gdp spend on defence immediately and increase that to when practical 
 in short we must protect our economy healthcare and national security to ensure the prosperity and safety of our country but mindful that maiden speech be not mean to be controversial i shall leave it there and return briefly to the subject of my fab constituency in samuel pepys record that the people of liphook be good honest people give his own moral and motivation i be not sure whether he mean that as a compliment but i assure the house that it be as true now as it be then for the resident of farnham bordon haslemere liphook and our surround village and i pledge to be a good honest servant of they in this place 
 thank you mr deputy speaker and i thank   the hon member for farnham and bordon   gregory stafford   for describe his constituency so passionately while we may strongly disagree on the need for growth and new development in this country we may agree more on the future of our nhs and i look forward to work together on that ambition

 it be fantastic to hear new member on both side of the house speak so passionately and eloquently about their constituency i speak as the new member of parliament for huntingdon since but i be only the member in my lifetime and the member since the world war it be therefore an enormous privilege to have be elect to represent the constituency and i be honour to have be vote for by my constituent to follow such a long serve member of   parliament my predecessor jonathan djanogly serve the house and his constituent for some year in parliament he serve on the trade and industry committee as solicitor general and as a shadow business minister in government he be the parliamentary under secretary of state at the ministry of justice 
 my predecessor ’s proud achievement come from the work that he deliver locally his work on tackle flooding from the river great ouse see significant flood alleviation project deliver in st ives and the hemingfords and far upstream in godmanchester that work have save thousand from the crippling impact of flood damage on home and business i intend to build on that deliver further flooding solution across the constituency for village such as alconbury abbots ripton wistow kimbolton broughton and earith 
 my predecessor be also rightly proud of his work in facilitate the delivery of both the a14 and the a428 road infrastructure project that have transform travel across cambridgeshire and stand to greatly enhance the region in its position at the tip of the uk innovation corridor the development have set the condition for huntingdon ’s future growth offer the opportunity for well job and take advantage of the cambridge cluster and expansion across the region mean that huntingdon can be a business hub in its own right not just a dormitory town for london and cambridge 
 despite the growth that huntingdon have see over the past year via the post war london overspill and now via expansive development the constituency be still characterise by its thrive town and vibrant village from the market town of huntingdon and st ives to our rural village from sawtry to somersham houghton to hamerton covington to colne and pidley to perry and dozen other that will not stretch to my tortured alliteration each have their own character and identity huntingdonshire be a region with a rich history and that it will be a privilege to steward 
 that history extend to some of my other predecessor many member will be aware that huntingdon be the seat of a former prime minister sir john major who be still hold in the high regard across the constituency it be an honour to receive his endorsement during the recent election campaign famously it be also the former seat of the lord protector oliver cromwell cromwell be the member of parliament for huntingdon in for just over a year until charles i dissolve parliament records show that he make just speech in that time so far so equal 
 it be clear that huntingdon expect a certain level of stature from its member of parliament notable as sir john major and oliver cromwell surely be arguably they be not huntingdon ’s most famous product it be not even the celebrated diarist samuel pepys who attend huntingdon grammar school in fact that accolade should be award to a lunch time staple that everyone be familiar with that everyone have a favourite version of and that some member may well have have for lunch this very day 
 john montagu time lord of the admiralty postmaster general and secretary of state be not notable for his political career or his colourful social life john montagu whose family home be hinchingbrooke house in huntingdon be well know today somewhat arcanely by his title and the moniker bestow upon   his favourite snack to consume during long session at the card table such be the popularity of say snack that other card player also wish to order it they would cry i ’ll have the same as sandwich it obvious where this be go john montagu the earl of sandwich be not prepared to break from the card table to eat so would ask his servant to bring he slice of salt beef between piece of toast bread yes among its formidable political alumnus huntingdon can also lay claim to a genuine global culinary revolution describe by the wall street journal no less as britain ’s big contribution to gastronomy huntingdon be the birthplace of the modern sandwich every day be a school day 
 i digress huntingdon ’s rich history be also characterise by an inextricable link to service via its long relationship with military aviation initially through the royal flying corps and subsequently during the world war through raf bomber command ’s pathfinder force and the united states army air force ’s bombardment group on   july the us air force fly the american mission over nazi occupy europe from raf molesworth 
 latterly during the cold war raf alconbury see the us air force provide covert high altitude reconnaissance along the east german border in a new variant of its famed u-2 spy plane in addition to provide battlefield damage assessment in the event of a nuclear strike most of that base be now huntingdon ’s new housing estate alconbury weald surely the only housing development in the country with fully functional nuclear decontamination and washdown facility raf warboys raf upwood and raf brampton have all since disappear but the constituency still retain those link raf alconbury and raf molesworth be still operate by the united states air force and raf wyton be on the cutting edge of our defence intelligence capability those link carry through into the constituency itself and it be strike just how many veteran have make their home within its boundary in household within huntingdon be home to a veteran a staggering number when compare with other constituency and a community that as a british army veteran myself i be proud to represent as their member of parliament even if to many of those raf veteran i be just a pongo 
 i know well how important it be to support our veteran community and to commit to improve veteran welfare have undergo the process myself the transition from service to civilian life have its challenge and there be many story of both success and failure i serve on a veteran advisory and pension committee and know well how important it be to ensure that veteran be able to access the service they need veteran identity card have help to open those pathway for many who would otherwise struggle to evidence their service but i hope the government will look closely at how support itself be provide restructure veterans uk and create a more comprehensive holistic offering ease access via an overhauled veteran gateway could streamline access to the welfare service that our veteran need
