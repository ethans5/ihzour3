i pay tribute to the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi and for kensington and bayswater joe powell who both speak very movingly on behalf of the victim of this tragedy who want to see justice do i venture to suggest that what they want   above everything be to know that nothing like this will ever happen again that whatever happen that night there will be some glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel and that some good will come of it 
 i praise the secretary of state for recognise that it be the system itself that need the most fundamental reform and that the failure of individual whatever incentive exist and whatever conflict be unresolved be system failure the cultural shift will come about as a result of a systemic review a system change 
 hon member might well ask why i be take an interest in this debate i do not think i represent any community in a high rise building with cladding problem in leafy essex the only interest i have to declare be that it turn out that my late mother be live in a block with unsafe cladding so to a very limited and minor extent my family be suffer the loss of be unable to sell her flat that be very small beer but i put that down as an interest i should declare 
 i have long take an interest in safety management system ever since i be shadow secretary of state for transport at the time of the ladbroke grove disaster when i take an interest in what be be submit to the inquiry and make a submission of my own recommend that there should be a systemic approach to the safety system that result in the formation of the rail accident investigation branch of the department for transport with the result that no inquiry into a rail accident have ever take place again 
 similarly as chairman of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee i take a close interest in patient safety because we receive the report from the parliamentary and health service ombudsman we have mid staffordshire and all the maternity scandal and we have public inquiry after public inquiry until somebody suggest that there should be an investigation body accountable and answerable to the secretary of state to look at why thing go wrong in patient care and investigate the cause of incident without blame incidentally to find out what go wrong in order to make recommendation and put it right those be the lesson draw from all the effective safety regime in other industry which should perhaps be apply in this case 
 i co author a submission to the grenfell inquiry with other the be former labour housing and fire minister nick raynsford who at the time be chairman of the construction industry council approve inspector ’s register cicair which relate to the private sector building control surveyor   the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos   speak about i will come on to that conflict which the hon gentleman be very concerned about 
 another co author be kevin savage a lead figure in the building control profession he happen to be a constituent of mine but that be a coincidence the be keith conradi the former chief investigator of the air accident investigation branch of the department for transport who as it happen become the chief investigator for the health services safety investigations body which as a result of the inquiry conduct by my committee be now a statutory body he help set that body up he be now retire he help with the submission 
 keith conradi in particular enable we to understand building safety management as a safety management system the event lead to the grenfell disaster be   not just the random failing or crime of individual where there be culpability prosecution must certainly follow but that be not the main point grenfell and previous fire such as lakanal house demonstrate that there be a comprehensive failure of the safety system that should exist to keep building as safe as possible 
 we make our submission in september after year a disadvantage of public inquiry be that they take a very long time i be disappoint that the inquiry do not really find time to engage with our recommendation it do publish our submission but from the recommendation i think it be fair to say that a number of issue have be hand back to the department to be resolve paragraph entitle implement change simply suggest that the london fire brigade should 
 establish effective standing arrangement for collect consider and effectively implement lesson learn from previous incident 
 that be an odd recommendation when we think about it because the london fire brigade be itself very very severely criticise in the report that it should be leave responsible for mark its own homework and make recommendation about itself underline that the lacuna in the recommendation be the lack of an investigation body there be other paragraph about build control that i shall come to paragraph and those be our urgent priority to be address in our submission 
 by the way i be very grateful to the minister for accept our request for a meeting which the prime minister promise on the floor of the house when he announce the outcome of the inquiry we have a very good meeting with the minister for policing fire and crime prevention i think she be take with our recommendation but i think that they fall to the minister ’s department so i look forward to meet he later this week 
 i completely understand the challenge draw a line between qualifying and non qualifying leaseholder between people who own a property and therefore suffer from thing that have be beyond their control and landlord that be business and therefore have multiple asset will always be a difficult job at the edge where the boundary between qualifying and non qualifying become blur there be some difficult case as a new government we be commit to work with people to understand well how we can go forward on that as for the substantive point on where the liability should lie it be about find the right balance between those who build the building and those who live in it 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step her department be take to increase the supply of social housing 
 what step her department be take to increase the supply of social housing 
 what step her department be take to increase the supply of social housing 
 what step her department be take to increase the supply of social housing 
 we will deliver the big increase in social and affordable housing in a generation the last government ’s affordable housing programme be expect to deliver only between and home although when it be publish in the ambition be for labour be fix that the chancellor announce in the budget an immediate year cash injection of £ into the affordable home programme to deliver new social and affordable home 
 many of my constituent in birmingham erdington be worried about the deteriorate quality of social housing what work be be do to ensure that housing stock be maintain to the high standard so that tenant can live in the safe high quality housing that they deserve 
 i know that housing quality have be a particular issue in my hon friend ’s constituency all social housing tenant deserve to live in a safe decent home we will bring forward awaab ’s law to the social rent sector set new time limit for social landlord to fix dangerous hazard we will shortly consult on minimum energy efficiency standard and a new decent home standard we will direct the regulator of social housing to introduce a new competence and conduct standard and an access to information requirement 
 there be family across bournemouth christchurch and poole on social housing waiting list many in unsuitable temporary accommodation what step be the department take to unlock development site in densely pack constituency like mine so that the council can meet its housing target and family can get the safe and secure housing that they deserve 
 we have consult on change to the national planning policy framework to maximise development on brownfield land and we have invite view on proposal for a new brownfield passport which will provide more explicit guidance on how the   potential of land in urban area can be maximise we intend to publish update on the national planning policy framework by the end of this year 
 in scotland people die while homeless last year those death be a travesty for our country and a damn symbol of scottish government failure my local authority of west dunbartonshire declare a housing emergency this year do the secretary of state agree that as we head into winter it be more urgent than ever that the scottish national party government finally take action deliver a fair deal for council build more affordable social house and offer every scot a safe secure home 
 my hon friend be right to raise this issue people die be absolutely horrendous we face an acute housing crisis while housing and homelessness be devolve i urge our scottish counterpart to grip this issue i completely agree that he give a damn example of the crisis in scotland every single homeless death be a tragedy that be why a sufficient supply of affordable housing and join up support service be essential as we will make clear in our upcoming inter ministerial meeting with our scottish colleague 
 i have another question on the snp ’s failure on housing because it be so bad scottish figure show that new build start be fall in all sector and be at their low level since private sector new build be down since for social housing the figure be even bad they be down by this be devastate the opportunity for family across my constituency to get a home of their own the snp have the large funding settlement in devolution history will it use that to properly fund the social rent sector 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the housing crisis in scotland where too many family be wait for too long for a safe and secure home i completely back all the brilliant work that my friend the scottish labour leader be do and i know that the choice will be stark for people in scotland in may it will be between a national labour government deliver for the work people of this country and a clap out and fail snp government north of the border 
 give that the secretary of state ’s avow goal be to create more social housing can she explain to the house why labour control thanet district council be seek to build a large housing estate on the outskirt of birchington on sea on prime agricultural land there be little demand for those house and little provision of social housing can she have a word with the leader of thanet council 
 in our new national planning policy framework we have set out how we be protect agricultural land but we have also set out the fact that our country face a housing crisis i can not believe that the right hon gentleman ’s constituency do not have a crisis because it be everywhere 
 over the last year under the previous government £ of taxpayer money be hand out to and holiday homeowner in cornwall alone while only half that amount be   spend on social housing for time need meanwhile there be a massive backlog of shovel ready social housing development that have plan permission and be ready to be deliver but be catch by construction inflation surely the government can add the dot to resolve the problem 
 order the house could have be build by now 
 i really hope so mr speaker that be the plan we be take step through the new national planning policy framework and we have new mandatory target for local authority we have also allow local authority to keep their right to buy receipt the government be take a number of measure to ensure that we get the home that we so desperately need and i be determined to get to that figure 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s warm word about improve affordable housing availability do she agree that the affordability of housing be closely related to the bill that people have to pay energy bill in particular will she ensure that all new social housing from this stage forward be build to the high possible standard of energy efficiency to save people ’s bill 
 again we have be look at how we build safe secure energy efficient home that bring down people ’s energy bill the previous government see energy bill go up really high we be introduce great british energy so that we can bring bill down and be build the home that people desperately need 
 i be sure that the house agree that affordable housing be important however my experience in leicester south be that all too often it be provide in new development as home for shared ownership or as similar housing product which be out of reach for the poor in my community what my community really need be more social rent house what be the secretary of state do to promote the construction of social rent home as oppose to other affordable housing product 
 i agree with the hon member that we need more social home that be why we have be put more into the affordable home programme we have make it absolutely clear that under section notice which he mention home need to be affordable that be why we have put affordability test in the nppf we want to ensure that people have those home and we want to build the next generation of council and social housing and we will 
 i call the shadow minister 
 we can see that after just month the government ’s target of new home lie in tatter the national housing federation say that the government will miss their target by without more grant last week the housing minister say the same and now labour run south tyneside council say that the plan be wholly unrealistic with other labour council agree be it not time for the government to admit defeat come back with a   deliverable plan and provide the sector with the certainty that it need to deliver more social home across the country 
 the hon member have forget that his government fail to meet their housing target every single time the government be commit to build home over this parliament under the tories house building plummet as they bow to pressure from their back benchers to scrap local housing target we be bring back mandatory housing target the chancellor have put more money into the affordable home programme and we will build those home the hon member do not know my history and how i work 
 what recent progress her department have make on planning reform 
 what change her department be make to the national planning policy framework 
 what recent progress her department have make on planning reform 
 what change her department be make to the national planning policy framework 
 as hon member will be aware we consult on propose change to the national planning policy framework and other change to the planning system between   july   and   september my official and i have be analyse the over response receive with a view to publish a government response before the end of the year we also intend to bring forward the planning and infrastructure bill announce in the king ’s speech early next year 
 many young family would love to live in my beautiful constituency of north east derbyshire but unfortunately we just do not have the housing for they could the minister assure i that our planning reform will enable we to get the right housing in the right place with the right amenity to complement the beautiful constituency 
 i thank my hon friend for her question the government be determined to increase rate of house building in order to address the housing crisis and boost economic growth but we be equally committed to improve the quality and sustainability of the home and neighbourhood that be build during our period in office in the aforementioned nppf consultation we propose a series of change to realise that ambition include golden rule to ensure that development in the green belt be in the public interest and a vision lead approach to transport planning 
 the dangerous propose reform to the nppf be among the many thing that the labour government have rush through in the past month   how will those reform ensure that village such as kings langley and south west hertfordshire retain their individual character and identity and do not have their green space re band as grey belt concrete over and absorb into an ever increase greater london 
 we be not go to concrete over the green belt the government be commit to preserve the green belt which have serve england ’s town and city well over many decade but we have to move away from the previous government ’s approach to it which be to allow land in it to regularly be release in a haphazard matter often for speculative development that do not meet local housing need this government be commit to take a smart more strategic approach to green belt land designation and release so that we can build more home in the right place and secure additional public benefit through the operation of our golden rule 
 my constituency be fortunate enough to have a number of potential project that be ripe for investment include the port of workington and energy project for new nuclear and other kind of clean energy they be essential project for economic growth but to get they go we need major planning reform not just for housing but for infrastructure project do the minister agree on the urgent need for plan reform for infrastructure and that any legislation that we bring forward must be comprehensive so that we can remove all the obstacle that stand between we and get build 
 it will not surprise my hon friend to hear that i wholeheartedly agree the delivery of critical national infrastructure be essential for economic growth accelerate the uk ’s effort towards clean power by and energy independence the bill in question will include old measure to streamline the delivery of infrastructure and new home furthermore our forthcoming year infrastructure strategy will provide a strategic road map for how we plan for future need and support our commitment by make timely decision on national infrastructure 
 under the housing target hinckley and bosworth will see a increase in housing north west leicestershire will see it go up by but leicester city where there be brownfield and infrastructure will see it fall by that be compound by the fact that the liberal democrat run borough council in hinckley and bosworth do not have an up to date local plan give that there be speculative development in hinckley and bosworth will the minister consider strengthen neighbourhood plan we know that they deliver more housing provide protection for people locally and have buy in from community yet the council suffer without an up to date 
 the hon gentleman will know that we be leave in place the protection on neighbourhood planning he be mistaken if he be suggest that we be skew development towards rural area the propose standard method which we consult on significantly boost expectation across city region indeed across mayoral combine authority area it would see target grow by more than local plan   be the good way for community to control development in their area i be sure that he will agree that hinckley and bosworth borough council need an up to date local plan in place perhaps he can work with i to ensure that that be the case 
 i call the shadow minister 
 minister brief the medium over a week ago about plan for local government reorganisation and devolution when do the government plan to set they before the house so that member represent area across the country can take a view 
 i be not sure how that relate to planning reform which be the subject of the question but my hon friend the minister for local government will set out in due course how our plan for devolution will be take forward 
 apology if there be confusion i be expect to come in on question interruption i be glad to hear it 
 many area of the country stand to lose million of pound from the scrapping of the rural service grant of many local government funding stream that be expect to change when will our council and this house know the full impact of the financial change so that any reorganisation devolution or change to local plan and other council strategy can be deliver with full knowledge of the impact that the change will have on council on the ability to lead locally 
 full detail of the provisional settlement will be set out in the come week 
 what discussion she have have with local government representative on potential future devolution agreement in somerset 
 in july the deputy prime minister invite place without a devolution agreement include somerset to come forward with proposal for their area in order to gauge the approach and form be consider across the country we welcome somerset ’s support for this initiative and look forward to hear its view on the imminent white paper on english devolution which will be release shortly 
 my constituent have have to endure the liberal democrats preside over the transition from level of council which work they balance their book to a unitary council that be on the brink of bankruptcy can the minister assure the house that no new council reform will be force on unwilling area and that local opinion will be at the forefront of his decision 
 i think we have all have to endure liberal democrats so i can reflect on that we be in constant dialogue with local council on our twin pronged approach prong be devolution and make sure that we push power out of this place and into local community the other be reorganisation in case where   council recognise that it deliver more effective and efficient local government the department be keen to hear the conversation that local area be have on that 
 we now come to the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i hope that you will endure we mr speaker dorset council which cover half my constituency have agree to work with somerset and wiltshire all unitary council on a devolution arrangement but resident be already raise concern that top down reorganisation will take decision far away from their home and community they be worried about what a mayoral combine authority might do to they what assurance can the minister give that the town and parish council on which resident rely so heavily will not be expect to keep unitary council afloat and that my resident will not see back door council tax rise as a result of the change 
 central government have say to local government that we want to reset the relationship and work as partner in power and it be not unreasonable to expect that council will do the same at a local level and will work together in partnership we see that across the country local council work in partnership with their parish and town council in the interest of their community whether or not reorganisation take place we expect that to continue 
 what step her department be take to support council in reduce homelessness 
 what progress her department have make on end rough sleeping 
 what step her department be take to support council in reduce homelessness 
 we be take action to tackle the root cause of homelessness funding for homelessness service be increase next year by £ take the total spend to almost £ in we be also abolish no fault eviction and will deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in a generation 
 over the past year we have witness a staggering increase in homelessness in blackpool underline the urgent need for support in our community blackpool ’s homelessness partnership through which the council work with the sector and local charity have do outstanding work to prevent homelessness but we need more support what step will the minister take to support and strengthen local effort to ensure immediate relief and long term solution for some of the most vulnerable in our society 
 this government have already make £ of additional funding available to local authority include blackpool to tackle rough sleeping pressure this winter and we be develop a long term cross departmental strategy the £ rough sleeping initiative will continue to support local authority across england by fund tailor rough sleeping service which include funding of £ for blackpool borough council in 
 as a result of the localism act introduce by the conservative party the ringfence around homelessness funding be remove due to that and despite the good work that the government be do on fund homelessness service tory lead devon county council be consult on cut its entire homelessness support budget which would have a devastating impact on people and on the city of exeter do the minister agree that council should really invest that money in homelessness service and not squirrel it away in other pot across the council 
 we be absolutely focused on tackle homelessness and rough sleeping and their root cause the previous government leave local authority in a dire condition the autumn budget announce £ of additional funding for local authority and service and funding for homelessness service be increase next year but i will look into the point my hon friend raise we be determined that wherever people live they be protect from the risk of homelessness and rough sleeping 
 although in my constituency we have the city of wolverhampton council ’s homelessness prevention strategy which have have some success in tackle homelessness last week i be contact by a constituent flee domestic violence and find it difficult to get permanent social housing for herself and her daughter crisis the national homelessness charity report a increase in child live in temporary accommodation the high on record and we know that issue such as substance misuse and lack of proper employment also cause homelessness will the minister please confirm how her department be help council to deal with the societal and economic issue that can cause homelessness 
 my hon friend raise really important issue about how multiple underlying cause can drive people into homelessness we be determined to tackle the root cause which be why the deputy prime minister be chair the inter departmental taskforce on homelessness and rough sleeping the previous labour government take action and cut homelessness and rough sleeping we be determined to ensure that we tackle the underlying issue which mean reform the support housing that victim of domestic violence need and ensure that local government work with mayor and national government to tackle these issue we be absolutely committed to do that 
 wokingham borough council be under intense financial pressure make the crucial task of reduce homelessness a significant challenge initial estimate be that the budget ’s new funding for local government will be more than swallow up by cost increase in employer national insurance contribution and the national minimum wage let alone the ever grow   demand for statutory service will the minister meet i and the leader and chief executive of our council so we can discuss the future of its finance and what we can do to reduce homelessness 
 i be aware that the minister for local government and english devolution my hon friend   the member for oldham west chadderton and royton jim mcmahon have already meet the hon gentleman but i be happy to look at the specific issue he raise in relation to homelessness to reassure he we be work across government on these very issue look at how different agenda can be bring together to tackle the deep root issue affect homelessness and rough sleeping and how good we can support local area i look forward to engage member from across the house as we develop that very important cross departmental strategy to tackle the deep rooted cause of homelessness and rough sleeping 
 rural homelessness have rise by in just the last year in our community that be massively feed by the fact that average house price be about time above local income as well as insufficient local housing do the minister agree that we need to give planning power to local authority and national park so that they can designate exclusively for social rent housing and development that therefore can not be use for expensive housing for which frankly there be no need 
 as i say we have an ambitious plan for affordable and social housing which fit within the government ’s commitment to build home it be vital to make supply available we be put in funding include £ for the affordable home programme which will build property the hon gentleman be aware of the work we be do to ensure that there be a proper and effective national planning framework to go hand in hand with local work with local authority i hope he can see that we be very much work in the spirit of ensure that we increase supply provide affordable and social housing and tackle the root cause that need to be address 
 some home with planning permission across somerset be wait to be build but nutrient neutrality issue flood risk and the national shortage of planner be prevent or delay the delivery of those much need home what discussion have the minister have with cabinet colleague about fix the issue and ensure that appropriate home be build to help reduce the strain cause by the lack of housing in somerset 
 i can reassure the hon lady that the government be address those issue and will take appropriate action my right hon friend the secretary of state and other ministers be very much engage with this important agenda 
 i call the shadow minister 
 sadly homelessness be project to rise by this year the government ’s break promise on national insurance rise have wreak havoc across the charitable sector with national   homelessness charity warn the chancellor that £ to £ will be lose in the sector and homeless link call the increase 
 the final nail in the coffin 
 for the sector will the minister listen to that warning and what will she be do to convey these concern to the chancellor and change this disastrous policy 
 i welcome the shadow minister to his position may i remind he of the record of his party in government in those year household include child be live in temporary accommodation not to mention the scandal of rough sleeping and the death cause by that government ’s neglect we be invest to tackle those issue and the mess that the hon gentleman ’s party leave behind we have already announce £ in the budget conservative members need to decide whether to back we on the investment we be make to clean up the mess that he and they have leave behind 
 what consultation her department have undertake with staff on the decision to close office 
 my department have set a workforce and location strategy that propose to retain of the exist departmental office this will result in office close over the next year staff engagement on the announcement be ongoing and consultation on implement the strategy be begin this month my department will continue to engage with the trade union and consult with they before the office closure proposal be finalise and implement the department will not make any compulsory redundancy and will continue to help the colleague and staff affect to work effectively in their role 
 there have be a drive across government departments to increase the number of hour that civil servant spend work in the office but the propose closure in newcastle mean that staff work and live in the area who can not work from home will face a mile commute to the office in darlington can the secretary of state assure i that there will be an equality impact assessment before any decision be make to ensure that the need of those with protect characteristic and caring responsibility be fully consider 
 as my hon friend know i be a big advocate of flexible working and make sure that we support our colleague the department prepare an initial equality impact assessment in advance of the announcement of the location strategy which will be develop during the consultation with the staff and the trade union to inform the mitigation that will support the staff who be affect 
 many of we fight very hard to ensure that the department have a location in the city of wolverhampton and i think that all of we on both   side of the house recognise how important it be to get civil servant out of london and right across the country how be the secretary of state look at develop and grow the base in wolverhampton as part of her wide strategy 
 the strategy will create a more coherent office estate that enable strong office community and transparent career pathway for progression and we will continue to be represent across each of the region and nation of the united kingdom 
 what step she plan to take to reform the leasehold system 
 for far too many leaseholder the reality of home ownership have fall woefully short of the dream over the course of this parliament the government be determined to honour the commitment make in our manifesto and to do what be necessary to finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end on   november i make a write ministerial statement to update the house on the step that the government intend to take to implement the reform to the leasehold system that be already in statue and to progress the wide set of reform that be necessary to end the system for good 
 i recently meet people live on the redevelop blackberry hill hospital site in fishponds and they tell i about the excessive and unfair leasehold charge that they face from their property management company firstport what assurance can the minister provide that this government will once and for all free people from the leaseholder system and end the rip off fee 
 i thank my hon friend for his question the government be acutely aware that far too many leaseholder across the country be routinely subject to unjustified permission and administration fee unreasonable or extortionate charge and onerous condition that be impose with little or no consultation that be not what home ownership should entail and it be why we must bring the system to an end in this parliament as i set out in the write ministerial statement to which i refer early the government will act to protect leaseholder from abuse and poor service at the hand of unscrupulous manage agent such as the one my hon friend mention by strengthen regulation in this area 
 may i thank the minister for the answer that he have give i in this chamber and in a write answer at the end of october on the plight of leaseholder who have extra apartment level graft on above the block in which they live i appreciate that he do not want to alter the planning presumption in favour of grant permission to build add on extra level but will he at least consider outlaw any attempt by freeholder to pass on the cost of botched extension to the poor old leaseholder who have suffer enough by have such extension build over their head in the place 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question he will recognise i know he do that those type of development be the result of the expansion of permit development right that be take forward after there be issue with the quality of some of the work that have come through that stream on the specific issue he raise perhaps it might be a good idea if we sit down together i will happily discuss with he how we can protect leaseholder from those type of variable service charge increase 
 battersea be home to a large number of leaseholder many of whom have have to face astronomically high service charge from what we all know be unscrupulous management agent i be very pleased that this government will protect leaseholder give that the last government fail to do so but be the minister willing to meet i and some of my leaseholder so that he can share labour ’s plan to protect they 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i be more than happy to sit down with she or to join a call or meet with leaseholder in her constituency in order to discuss the government ’s plan to end the system in this parliament we fully appreciate the wish of leaseholder across the country for we to act with speed as the ministerial statement set out we also have get to balance that with the need to get these reform right the serious and specific flaw that be leave to we by the previous government in the leasehold and freehold reform act be a warning about what happen when reform in this area be not do properly 
 i welcome the government ’s commitment to continue our work to address issue with the current leasehold system however where we be build new town such as sherford in my constituency resident like other in new build face council tax and service charge with no likelihood of that change what plan do the minister have to address the impact of service charge in new town as part of leasehold reform 
 i think the hon lady be refer to the pressure place on residential freeholder as a result of some of the management estate charge that come through that route there be provision in the leasehold and freehold reform act to provide residential freeholder with additional protection and we need to bring those measure into force we also then need to look more widely at how we reduce the prevalence of private and mixed tenure housing estate which be the fundamental root of the problem 
 what step she be take to far devolve power to local community 
 the english devolution white paper due by the end of the year set out how we will transfer power from westminster to people who know their area well the white paper will also announce measure that will give local place and communitie great control over shape their area 
 library pub football community centre these be the thing that make up a community but in so many place they have vanish over the last year i be delighted to hear plan of a community right to buy what work be the government do to ensure that local authority and community group have the guidance and expertise need to utilise this powerful new right once it be realise 
 in there be the point about devolution and localism structure matter and the framework matter but in the end it be about get the power out to the community who have skin in the game that be why we want to ensure that the community right to buy provide an effective mean for community across the country to take ownership of asset that be important to they we be consider what further support and guidance we will provide to community and local authority to support they in this measure and i know that the minister for local growth my hon friend   the member for nottingham north and kimberley alex norris be fully engage in this endeavour 
 many of my constituent would welcome further power be devolve to their local community they be as keen as mustard to see the right home in the right place particularly social housing but of the thing stop social housing be deliver be the viability calculation that be undertake by developer who use they to say that only expensive house can be build be the government look at review the use of viability calculation 
 that be some way from community ownership but the devolution white paper be of a number of measure that we be take and it will have a clear community strand this do not sit in isolation however it be part of the wide reform that be take place to ensure that community local authority and government work in partnership 
 what step her department be take to support community ownership of local asset 
 the community ownership fund have empower community group across the uk to take long term sustainable ownership of asset that benefit their local community and i know that colleague across the house be eagerly await further news on round of the community ownership fund which will be with they in due course beyond this through the english devolution bill we will introduce a strong new right to buy for value community asset which will help local people to acquire value community space when they come up for sale keep they in the hand of the local community 
 i recently meet the friend of the flying saucer pub a community group in my constituency who be work to bring this asset of community value back into local hand will the minister assure my constituent that the government be commit to support the retention of community asset such as   this and will he agree to meet i to discuss the flying saucer campaign and the broad challenge that community face in reclaim and retain such asset 
 now then mr speaker you know there be no great enthusiast in this place for a local pub than me—[interruption and indeed for fly saucer these be exactly the type of asset of community value we be talk about and exactly the sort of asset that will be in the scope of the new community right to buy of course i would be keen to meet my hon friend and the campaigner on that issue 
 east devon district council have declare seaton hospital an asset of community value and be await news of round of the community ownership fund to see whether we might get funding from that source in the meantime nhs property services might be seek to remove part of that hospital can the minister ask his colleague in the department of health and social care to prevent that 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for that question although i be sad to hear it the asset of community value status really ought to give a degree of protection but i be happy to talk about that far as i have say round of the community ownership fund will be come forward very shortly 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of service charge on resident in social housing 
 the government recognise the considerable financial strain that rise service charge be place on leaseholder include those whose landlord be a social housing provider as the hon gentleman will know variable service charge must by law be reasonable their reasonableness can already be challenge at the appropriate tribunal and the housing ombudsman can investigate complaint about the fairness of service charge make by shared owner as well as tenant of social housing landlord but the government be explore what more can be do to give leaseholder the protection that they need from unaffordable service charge increase 
 many leaseholder in my constituency live in property where clarion housing association be the freeholder this year ’s service charge be on average almost high than the original estimate and for some on the high path estate it be over £ more do the minister agree that leaseholder deserve transparency not shock bill what more can be do to give the housing ombudsman the power to demand compensation payment 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that supplementary question and assure he that i share his deep concern about the pressure on the household budget of share owner in his constituency and other across the country as a result of rise variable service charge in addition to the route to redress i have just set out i draw his and the house ’s attention to the   measure in the leasehold and freehold reform act that be design to drive up the transparency of service charge to make they more easily challengeable if leaseholder consider they unreasonable further detail about our plan to bring those and other provision in the act into force can be find in the write ministerial statement make on   november 
 as the minister will know social housing provider and council operate within a regulated service charge regime that do not allow they to make a profit and the housing ombudsman service be there for any complaint will the minister consider bring in a similar regime for the private sector 
 i have set out the route to redress that be already available and our intention to switch on the measure in the leasehold and freehold reform act but i be more than happy to sit down and have a conversation with my hon friend about what more protection leaseholder in this space require

 we be clear that dangerous building need to be remediate that be why the good thing that any building owner can do be get into a scheme today to unlock the funding and meet those duty they have as building owner when they do that and when they be approve for the grant they would have an inspection at that point so i be surprised to hear that dangerous defect would be lock in as the hon lady say but i be interested in have a conversation with she to understand that far

 council up and down the land but particularly in the south east of england be frustrate by the high level of undeveloped consent it be perfectly possible that the secretary of state will find that come the next election her target have be consent but be nowhere near build will she consider allow council to have a year housing   supply number that include undeveloped consent so that when the number be reach developer have no choice but to build 
 we take step in the propose reform to the consultation on the national planning policy framework to encourage build out not least through encourage mixed use development however we be reflect on what more can be do to encourage that and to ensure that site be build out in a timely manner

 there be grow concern among constituent that planning decision be be sweep aside because of the government ’s new planning reform what assurance can the minister give that there will be meaningful engagement between constituent and their local planning authority and that decision will be respect 
 as i have say the good way to shape development in any give area be to have an up to date local plan in place where such plan be not in place local authority leave themselves open to the presumption in favour of sustainable development and to development via appeal so i encourage the hon gentleman to ensure that his local authority have an up to date plan in place that be the good way for resident to have control we want more resident engagement upstream in those local plan 
 in year the cost of west sussex county council ’s oracle upgrade have rise from £ to £ be that the kind of contract mismanagement that the office for local government can look into

 labour ’s housing target desperately need reform to take into account land availability around protect landscape the government have say that the answer be the costly planning appeal system do the minister think that be a good use of taxpayer money

 the government ’s commitment to build more affordable home be both welcome and urgent however we also need to ensure that register provider be willing and able to take on section affordable home when they be build in recent year a combination of factor have mean that too many home stand empty will my hon friend say what step can be take to tackle the section stand stock scandal

 the propose planning reform mean that town such as tring will see up to more housing build on the green belt what assurance can the minister give that sacrifice that countryside will not have a negative impact on the community and that we will have infrastructure before the occupation of home and truly affordable home for people in the local community 
 we want to put in place a planning system that be gear towards meet housing need in full that be a clear difference between we and the conservative party in bring forward its local plan and look at development every local area should look at densification that be what it can do on brownfield land it should only have to review green belt land if it can not meet the need in that way or via cross boundary strategic planning 
 last week my local council announce the propose closure of the much love prince of wales theatre in cannock despite the council ’s financial pressure local people do not want that theatre to become collateral damage will the minister meet i to see what could be do to explore community ownership and give our theatre the bright future that thousand of my constituent want to see 
 as my hon friend know i be very keen on community ownership and i be sad to hear about the situation in his community i would definitely   steer he towards the asset of community value process in the immediate term and of course i would be very happy to meet he and campaigner on this issue 
 non qualifying leaseholder status get slap on a property in perpetuity long after the require safety work be complete that status mean that it be almost impossible to acquire a mortgage solicitor advise very strongly that purchaser steer clear of such property which be very often flat and the status be inherit by successive owner in perpetuity have the minister consider what this status do for the housing crisis 
 i completely understand the challenge draw a line between qualifying and non qualifying leaseholder between people who own a property and therefore suffer from thing that have be beyond their control and landlord that be business and therefore have multiple asset will always be a difficult job at the edge where the boundary between qualifying and non qualifying become blur there be some difficult case as a new government we be commit to work with people to understand well how we can go forward on that as for the substantive point on where the liability should lie it be about find the right balance between those who build the building and those who live in it.[official report   december vol 3wc correction 
 will the minister commit to work with local authority to use new power to run high street rental auction so that we can end the affront of empty shop this christmas 
 yes high street rental auction which be launch at the weekend be a brilliant way—[interruption indeed they be part of the levelling up and regeneration act which i be sad to say the previous government do not commence as part of the war on woke i believe nevertheless we have commence those auction they be a tool in the hand of local community if there be vacant property let we get they bring back into use 
 i represent tunbridge wells and just over the boundary in wealden district a large housing development be propose wealden will get the house but the infrastructure burden will fall particularly on my constituent who live in tunbridge wells will the secretary of state update i on the reform to the nppf what be be do about this problem of cross boundary infrastructure 
 in the nppf we set out the clear direction of travel towards the universal coverage of strategic planning across the whole of england we have an adjournment debate on that just last week we be determined to put in place the mechanism that will allow effective cross boundary co operation to ensure that the right infrastructure and housing growth take place 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on the impact of the government ’s chagos negotiation on the uk us defence relationship 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman on secure this urgent question the secretary of state have ask i to respond on behalf of the department 
 on   october the uk and mauritius reach an historic agreement to secure the important uk us military base on diego garcia which play a crucial role in regional and international security the agreement secure the effective operation of the joint facility on diego garcia well into the next century the agreement be strongly support by our close friend and ally include the united states it have be support by all relevant us departments and agency follow a rigorous scrutiny process 
 this base be a key part of uk us defence relationship as it enable the united kingdom and the united states to support operation that demonstrate our share commitment to regional stability provide a rapid response to crisis and counter some of the most challenging security threat we face the president of the united states applaud the agreement to quote he directly 
 it be a clear demonstration that through diplomacy and partnership country can overcome long stand historical challenge to reach peaceful and mutually beneficial outcome 
 several other country and organisation include india the african union the un secretary general and other have welcome and applaud this historic political agreement 
 our primary goal throughout these negotiation which start over year ago under the previous government be to protect the joint uk us military base on diego garcia there will be clear commitment in the treaty to robust security arrangement include arrangement prevent the presence of foreign security force on the outer island so that the base can continue to operate securely and effectively the operation of the base will continue unchanged with strong protection from malign influence 
 for the time in year the base will be undisputed and legally secure continued uncertainty would be a gift to our adversary that be why the agreement have be welcome by all part of the us system and other critical regional security partner agree the deal now on our term mean that we be able to secure strong protection that will allow the base to operate as it have do we look forward to engage with the upcoming us administration on this and many other aspect of the uk us special relationship 
 finally hon member can be reassure that the long term protection of the base on diego garcia have be the share uk and us priority throughout and this agreement secure its future we would not have sign off on an agreement that compromise any of our security interest or those of the us and our ally and partner 
 thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question 
 at a time when we face the most challenging military threat for year surely our top priority should be to preserve the strong possible us uk relation give that this be so vital to our national security yet it appear that the government be seek to agree a deal surrender the sovereignty of the chagos island before president trump be formally in post we know that the new us administration be concerned about the government ’s deal because presumptive nominee us secretary of state marco rubio have say that the deal 
 pose a serious threat to our national security interest 
 he have also suggest that 
 it would provide an opportunity for communist china to gain valuable intelligence on our naval support facility 
 let we be clear our military base on diego garcia be a vital strategic asset for the uk in the indian ocean and it be critical to our presence and posture in the indo pacific region in particular it be an especially important base for the united states and we believe that anything that damage its defence posture particularly in relation to china also undermine our national security we understand that the new mauritius government have now launch a review of the deal 
 will the minister therefore confirm that the government ’s policy really be to try to rush through their chagos deal before president trump ’s inauguration do he not see how that would be hugely disrespectful to the new administration and president trump ’s democratic mandate give that we now know it be common for the mod to state the cost of overseas basis will he be transparent and finally tell the house how much we will have to pay to rent back the vital military base that we currently own 
 finally although we would prefer the government to cancel the whole deal at the very least will the minister pause any further ratification until the new us administration be in place and the mauritius government have conclude their review 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and his strong focus on this matter i think he have a bit of amnesia from when the government he be a part of start these negotiation they hold round of negotiation and it take a labour government to conclude they we have do so in the good interest of our national security and the national security concern of our close ally it would not have be possible to secure a deal and the support of the united states if all part of the us security apparatus be not in support of it and as a former defence minister the hon gentleman will know that to be true regardless of the politic he must play today 
 the hon gentleman ask quick question we intend to continue our dialogue with the new mauritian government and our friend in the united states he will be aware of course that it be illegal under us law for we to engage directly with the new administration until they come into place but we will continue to have dialogue with our us and mauritian friend 
 i be surprised that as a former defence minister the hon gentleman be ask about cost he will know that it be usual for we to declare the operating and running cost of overseas basis but it would compromise our operational security and long term relationship if   we be to declare the government to government payment for overseas basis we have declare the operational running cost of our overseas basis and we will continue to do so in response to parliamentary question detail the security payment for government to government interaction be not something that this government do and be not something that his government do either 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 the uk us base on diego garcia be of great significance for defence and have strategic international significance step must be take to ensure that its legal status be secure in the future and of course the voice of the chagossians must be central in any future arrangement it have be report that president elect trump have reservation about the propose treaty and newly elect prime minister ramgoolam of mauritius have order a review into the treaty what further representation have be make to both our partner to ensure that we have the support of our international partner 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the continue operation of diego garcia be in the interest of uk and us national security and this deal secure that operation i congratulate dr ramgoolam on his election in a letter to the prime minister on   november he note his commitment to complete the negotiation and jonathan powell be in mauritius this week to start that process 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 we and all those who care about the resolution of this issue be deeply disappointed about the way we have be lead to this point with round of negotiation under the conservatives and more under the new government just week ago the foreign secretary present his deal to the house now the new president elect and the new prime minister of mauritius be express doubt be it not strike and shocking that it have unravel so quickly do the minister agree that whatever happen next it be vital that the voice of the chagossians be finally inject into the process and that they be able to fulfil their right of self determination 
 whatever lie ahead in these talk the liberal democrats have strongly argue that all treaty should come before the house before sign and i believe that member of the government include who be on the front bench today support that in the past will the minister commit to allow meaningful opportunity for parliamentarian to examine the detailed proposal include the necessary assurance on element of the deal relate to our national security before anything be sign 
 we will follow the normal process for treaty ratification which be that after signature the treaty will come before this house with detail give to colleague and with the ability for full parliamentary scrutiny as would be expect as part of the normal process the hon gentleman be right to raise the chagossians my ministerial colleague my hon friend   the member for   cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty who be sit next to i have be meet chagossian community in the uk he will continue to meet those community this government deeply regret how they be treat and remove from the island originally it be reason why we have make the relationship with the chagossians such an important part of the future of the island as the foreign secretary have previously outline to the house 
 can the minister confirm that the operation of the vital uk us base on diego garcia will continue completely unaffected by the term of this deal separately will he confirm that our commitment to the falkland islands to gibraltar and to the right of the people there to self determine remain completely unaffected by this deal 
 as the minister from the new government to visit the falklands i be able to say clearly that the falkland islands be british for as long as they would like to be the message i give to the gibraltarians be that gibraltar be british for as long as the people of gibraltar want it to be i confirm to my hon friend that this deal secure the future of the uk us base on diego garcia that be something that our us ally have support 
 which be more important for britain ’s vital security to have the approval of the outgoing american president or the approval of the incoming what be there to prevent china with mauritius ’s agreement put listen outpost on other island that could compromise the security of diego garcia 
 there be specific arrangement in the treaty that prevent any foreign power from put security apparatus or security force on any of the outgoing island the right hon gentleman will be able to see that when the treaty come before the house in relation to the support of the united states we would not have sign an agreement if it be not support by our us friend this deal secure the operation of the uk us base on diego garcia well into the next century i expect that when everyone look at the detail of the deal they will back it too 
 chagos belong to the chagossians a quarter of the global population of chagos live within my constituency i be aware of statement make by ministers that they have meet representative of the chagossian community i do not know who those representative be but i know of representative in my constituency who have not yet be consult do the minister agree that before any further dialogue take place the government should engage fully with the community representative in my constituency 
 the foreign office minister beside i my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth have meet a range of representative from the chagossian community and will continue to do so as this process continue i know that he would welcome a conversation with my hon friend to make sure that that dialogue be as complete as it can be 
 may i ask what be the rush why be the minister in such a hurry to get this do may i suggest that it would be to the government ’s advantage if their case be so strong to allow this house to debate the agree text in public before it be sign may i also suggest that it stretch incredulity for he to tell the house that there have be no discussion at all with the incoming american administration can he at least tell the house what informal dialogue there be with the incoming administration about what their view really be can he report that to the house please 
 as a long stand member of this house the hon gentleman will be familiar with how treaty be debate and agree by this house after signature they come forward for ratification this process be start a number of year ago by the government that he support round of negotiation have take place we have secure a deal that be in support of the uk and us base on diego garcia which will continue to operate well into the next century when he and other see the detail of the deal i be sure they will back it 
 it be hard to imagine anything say from that dispatch box over the past month that have survive contact with reality and this be no different in the tripartite relationship between the united states the united kingdom and mauritius of those partner now have doubt about this arrangement so what be the unseemly rush about in the tension between national security and the human right of the chagossians this government as usual have manage to reconcile neither 
 i be not certain whether the snp ’s record on national security really give the hon member the platform that he be pretend to have on this i recognise however that he be try to make a serious point about the deal when the deal be sign it will come before the house in the usual way that will allow parliamentarian of all party to look at the detail of the deal and take a judgment and the house will vote in the usual way as it will do on other treaty 
 what be it in particular that the new regime in mauritius have doubt about it be that they want more money be n’t it 
 i think it be quite normal for any new government to look again at a deal sign by their immediate predecessor—[interruption the reason i say that be that when they look at the deal they will see that the detail be convince just as it will be for our us friend because it be a deal back by the entirety of the us security apparatus that secure the future operation of the uk us base well into the future and deal with the uncertainty around the base that exist until the deal be make hopefully the right hon member will back the deal when the detail come before the house let we see 
 the presentation of what the american administration believe be a fantasy joe biden be go in fact many think that he have go already i have be contact by very senior   official and adviser from the incoming republican administration and every single of they be appal at this deal they know that the leasehold agreement will not survive just as the deal with china over hong kong do not survive have not the time come for the government to admit that this be a rotten deal for the uk a rotten deal for america and an even bad deal for the chagossians if the minister care so much about the sovereignty of the falklands be in the hand of the falkland islanders why not have a referendum of the chagossians and ask they to settle who should have sovereignty over those island 
 as someone who have be in the falklands recently let i say that whip up uncertainty about their future be not helpful for the security of the falkland islanders let we be absolutely clear the falklands be british for as long as the people of the falkland islands want to be british 
 when it come to this deal i be certain that when its detail have be put before this house and before our us friend and other ally they will see that it not only secure the future of the uk us base something that be not the case until the deal be sign but secure it well into the next century when the hon gentleman and i will no long be in this place but the uk us base on diego garcia will still be operate secure our national interest 
 we in this house all know how the people ’s republic of china have be able to use commercial vessel include fishing vessel to impinge on how we operate will the minister set out how large an exclusion zone there will be around diego garcia to ensure that our interest and us interest be properly protect 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his serious question and the way in which he present it it be important that we have certainty about the security of the future relationship that be why the treaty set out clearly security arrangement for the outer island that will prevent foreign nation from put security force or security apparatus on those island the full detail will be in the treaty it be important to note that mauritius be of only african country that do not join the chinese belt and road initiative and maintain a strong relationship with it especially in more contested time be vital that be what the deal help to deliver 
 the minister say that the outgoing biden administration in the us be keen on the deal which may or may not be the case but the british public plainly be not for good reason and they see the payment of a dowry to mauritius as rub salt into the wound if he be not prepared to comment on the quantum that he have in mind will he at least explain the structure of the costing he be apply to come to the figure that he wish to give mauritius for take on these island 
 i thank the former minister for his question as he serve in the department that i now serve in he will know that it be normal to reveal the operating cost for overseas basis but that we do not he do not and we do not reveal the government to government payment that be standard procedure for his government   and every government before and it remain the policy of this government this deal secure the future of the uk us base and i be hopeful that when the detail come out he will be able to understand why it secure that for so long and hopefully he will be able to back it 
 the minister have say that he be not willing to give detail of the financial arrangement although he will be aware that the mauritian prime minister have describe the deal as a sell out can he at least give an assurance that the government will not commit to give yet more money to get the deal through before the new us administration arrive in january 
 we think that this be a good deal when the detail come out other will be able to make their judgment but i think they will conclude that it be a good deal it secure the future of the uk us base on diego garcia which be the override objective when the right hon gentleman ’s party be in power the conservatives set that objective and we be glad that this deal secure the future of the base well into the next century that be an important step for uk and us national security

 all the representative of the us security apparatus who have see the detail of the deal back it it secure the future of the base and it allay us fear around the future of the base there have be some barking from the opposition front bench about this so it be important to say that the base on diego garcia be not currently secure for the long term there be question over its long term sovereignty and people be build support against our sovereignty claim this deal secure the long term operation of that base well into the next century 
 have be of many in this house to have vehemently oppose the ceding of the chagos islands without consult the resident and have stand in solidarity with those who oppose it i be anxious to ensure that the americans take control in turn we must offer they support and allow those resident who consider themselves british to be a part of the equation what step have the fcdo take to ensure that the us be aware of the strength of opposition to this decision from those from the chagos islands 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his serious question this deal not only settle some of the outer island for the chagossian community but allow visit to diego garcia for the chagossian community who be remove in a way that this government so deeply regret the detail of the deal be good to secure our national security and us national security and it take important step to recognise and remedy the pain suffer by chagossian community
