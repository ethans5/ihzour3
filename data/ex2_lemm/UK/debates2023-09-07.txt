the hon lady begin by express concern on behalf of her constituent she be right to raise that i invite she and her constituent to consider the remark of the metropolitan police that the prisoner be believe to be a low risk to the community it be important to stress that in the house 
 it be an overriding and overwhelming priority for i to increase staff number and i be pleased that they be increase of course i want they to go up far but it be positive to note that since   june there have be an increase of more than full time equivalent band to band staff wing officer up to custody manager i accept that we have far to go however it be also encourage that the resignation rate be come down i do not suggest for a that the work be complete it be not and it be perfectly fair for the hon lady to raise those point but we be move in the right direction 
 on the point the preliminary indication subject to the investigation that i have order be that the security post be man in wandsworth at the time of the incident we now need to know give that they be man what go wrong 
 i can think of nothing nice than be wake up by the hon gentleman i can reassure he that we do encourage our colleague in other departments to go far on this we have a range of carbon offset programme in place and as i say our location strategy mean that we try to locate people near public transport hub this be the very essence of a green transport strategy 
 the public authorities accountability bill the hillsborough law would require public authority to admit responsibility follow adverse and mass casualty incident some people die as a   result of hillsborough and a scandalous cover up go on for decade would the hon gentleman agree with i my constituent in the gallery and other constituent in the gallery that it be time to end the cover up and to establish how many people have die prematurely as a result of primodos

 the minister for the cabinet office be ask 
 whether he have hold recent discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the publication of the resignation honour list of the right hon member for south west norfolk and the former right hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip on public trust in a politician and b political institution 
 it be a long stand convention under successive government that outgoing prime ministers can draw up a resignation honours list any name propose be subject to the usual propriety check 
 trust in politic have never be low and this have be worsen by the grubby reality that the former right hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip hand out peerage to his pal and covid partygoer the other former prime minister be the shortest serve prime minister in history but still manage to crash the economy and she will also enjoy the   privilege of ennoble pal and crony do the cabinet office the prime minister and the cabinet feel this be inappropriate in any way do the minister think such a spectacle will help to restore trust in politic 
 we discuss this at length on   june when it be say that if the hon lady be to look at the resignation honour list of the former right hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip she will see many people who conduct a great deal of public service and deserve to have that service recognise we have not yet see the list of   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss but it be worth remember that people who be honour in our system have often contribute greatly to our country 
 before we proceed the house may wish to join i in wish the minister a happy birthday 
 thank you madam deputy speaker what nice way to spend ’s birthday alas i be not 
 whether he have hold recent discussion with cabinet colleague on co operation with international partner on respond to the potential challenge of the use of artificial intelligence 
 the government know the importance of collaborate internationally on the challenge and opportunity of ai that be why in the autumn the prime minister will convene the major ai summit which will bring together major international partner and leader in the technology to discuss the issue that confront society 
 it be great to hear that the international community will be come to bletchley park in november to discuss the principle and core value when deal with ai give that ai be move so quickly with the like of chatgpt already impact thing like the work of school kid what more can the government do to make sure each department be take full account of the impact of ai 
 my hon friend ask a pertinent question the cabinet office which be home to the government digital service and the central digital and data office take a lead role along with the department for science innovation and technology in co ordinating work within government so that we can take advantage of the extraordinary opportunity ai present and guard ourselves against potential disadvantage 
 it be nice to see you in the chair thing in the morning madam deputy speaker i thank the minister for his response constituent all around this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland rely on employment to make end meet and survive have he have discussion with international partner as to how ai will impact on people ’s livelihood and job that be so important 
 the hon gentleman make an excellent point as potential risk of ai be that it displace employment however across government we be look at the risk and opportunity we see a future in which human work with ai create all sort of great new opportunity for our economy and for individual 
 it be a pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker let i also say happy birthday to the minister he have just tell the house that the cabinet office be responsible for the government digital service quite rightly the government could be make well use of ai to improve government service for example we be lose £ a year to benefit fraud and error under this government we have lose £ to that since that be £ a be they go to use ai to deal with benefit fraud and error or should we assume that this be another example of how nothing work after year 
 i welcome the hon gentleman to his place and look forward to debate these and other issue with he in future he will be delighted to hear that over the past year the government have save billion of pound use the late technology 
 no they have n’t 
 i can assure the hon gentleman that they have i can see he be new to the brief and he have some reading to do interruption he have be move from his previous brief to this he may be interested to discover that we regularly convene meeting with group such as evidence house and 10ds which contain some of the fine technical experience in government to ensure we be take advantage of the late technology to make saving for taxpayer he talk about money lose but the money that the government and the treasury have save through implement the late technique be far in excess of the number he give 
 what step he be take to help ensure high standard of propriety in public life 
 what step he be take to help ensure high standard of propriety in public life 
 as the prime minister set out when he enter downing street this government will uphold the high standard of integrity and propriety in july we announce a wide- range programme of reform act on recommendation from nigel boardman the committee on standards in public life and the public administration committee 
 we have all hear that the former member for mid bedfordshire fail to speak in this house for more than a year and that her farcical resignation which be to have immediate effect take nearly month but what about the year when there be no constituency office list for people to make representation   to with no regard to standard in public life it be clear that the tories have sell my neighbouring constituency down the river do the secretary of state agree that the good people of mid bedfordshire deserve a hard work full time labour mp such as alistair strathern instead 
 the people of mid bedfordshire deserve a hard work member of parliament who live and work in the constituency and in festus they will find exactly that i have every confidence that they will return he to this house in the by election next month 
 at the conclusion of prime minister ’s question yesterday my hon friend   the member for manchester central lucy powell   make a point of order pick up on a statement make by the prime minister that she describe as categorically untrue this be about the or time this year that we have have to make such point of order about the prime minister how can we have any confidence that we be go to get high standard in public life if this keep happen 
 that be simply not the case if the hon gentleman have listen to the exchange he would have hear that the prime minister answer comprehensively every question raise by the leader of the opposition and demonstrate a far great understanding of the detail of this than that demonstrate by his opposite number 
 i call the spokesperson for the scottish national party 
 last year the prime minister say that his government would do everything we can to recover covid fraud loss yet the crony ppe vip lane help tory link business owner over small and medium sized business mean that £ of taxpayer money be waste on useless ppe the public accounts committee find it unacceptable that the government be not prioritise recoup misuse money with only £ only 2%—recovered from fraudster what step be the secretary of state take to fulfil his government ’s pledge to reclaim misuse taxpayer money or be that like the prime minister ’s promise of integrity and accountability another fail vow 
 what we see during the crisis be the prime minister who be then chancellor act decisively and rapidly to save the economy and million of job since we have pass out of the covid period we be take action to recover fraud and error loss as set out by my hon friend in the past year alone we have recover more than £ i would gently say to the hon lady that people in glasshouse should perhaps not throw stone give the experience of her party ’s leader be frogmarch by the police to investigate the misuse of fund by her own party 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the remit of the independent adviser on ministerial interest 
 the prime minister ’s independent adviser on ministers interest sir laurie magnus work within established and robust term of reference to provide impartial advice on matter relate to the ministerial code the power and status of the role be strengthen in and sir laurie have say he be very comfortable work within his term of reference 
 it be an understatement to observe that the ministerial code have be more honour in the breach than in the observance during the last few year and trust in our politic have suffer as a direct result it have take the government year to respond to the report of the committee on standards in public life and they have fail to accept the most important recommendation in it include increase the power and transparency of the work of the independent adviser on ministers interest why 
 we have already reform the role of the independent adviser it be now the case that the independent adviser can initiate investigation with the presumption that the prime minister will approve they that be the appropriate balance but we have to respect that the prime minister must be the ultimate upholder of the ministerial code because it be an important principle of our parliamentary democracy that the prime minister be able to appoint whomever he choose to ministerial post 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help ensure that service provide by the government meet the need of veteran and their family 
 this government be deliver on their commitment within the veteran strategy action plan to support veteran and their family our plan which be back by an additional £ announce by the chancellor in this year ’s budget contain commitment across government include support for health provision housing and employment the majority of which have be deliver or be on track 
 that be great and we all support those measure but he will also know that the independent review of the uk government welfare service for veteran find that the current system be overly complex and suffer from 
 a lack of cohesion of strategic direction and single oversight 
 it also find that veteran regularly receive poor communication from government and be leave overwhelmed by the system do the minister accept responsibility for those failing and what be he do to fix they 
 i initiate that review when i come back into office under this prime minister that review have now complete it be due to report before christmas but i have pull that forward and i want to see a response from government to the review by the end of september or the beginning of october the   review highlight change that have be overdue for some time and i look forward to have more to say to the hon gentleman on that matter when the response come back 
 what step he be take to ensure cyber security across government departments 
 the government ’s cyber security strategy set out our plan to strengthen the resilience of the government ’s critical function against cyber- attack a key milestone in our plan come early this year when i launch govassure this be a new approach to cyber resilience in which department review their cyber security and take the necessary step to meet the risk that we face 
 these cyber attack which be often totally devastating have be increase in both severity and frequency not only against government departments but against many of our major business with potentially devastating consequence for livelihood and job what be we do in government to take the expertise that we have acquire within government to protect government departments and to spread it across the economy to protect the private sector as well 
 my hon friend be totally correct that the external risk landscape be increase all the time not least because of the conflict in russia and ukraine which have mean that the united kingdom after ukraine and russia be the most cyber attack nation we be take a whole of government approach which be why we create the national cyber security centre work with gchq and the cabinet office to ensure that we have robust standard in government and that we also work with business to improve their standard and indeed with private individual 
 what recent step he have take to implement the interim recommendation of the infected blood inquiry 
 what recent step he have take to implement the interim recommendation of the infected blood inquiry 
 it be a privilege to appear before the infected blood inquiry on   july you madam deputy speaker refer to birthday early and i believe that that be the birthday of the right hon lady but she share it with we in the inquiry she be there in person for the hearing at the inquiry i share the work the government be undertake to consider the interim recommendation and i look forward to receive the final report in the autumn 
 it be good to see the paymaster general the prime minister the leader of the house and the chancellor at those reconvene hearing sir brian   langstaff make it very clear that his interim report on compensation be the last word that he be go to make on compensation the government have also accept the moral case for compensation what progress have now be make on sir brian ’s recommendation on extend the interim payment to those who be not include in the tranche of interim payment last year 
 as the right hon lady know we be work through this there be more work to be do it be a mammoth undertaking as she know and we be look forward to the final report and put our response into that context 
 work through this be not good enough several family in my constituency have lose partner or parent as a result of the infected blood scandal and they be frustrate by the delay and obfuscation of my constituent tell i 
 the lack of transparency be cause great stress and anxiety to those of we at the heart of this nhs treatment disaster who have already wait decade for our loss and suffering to be recognise 
 person be die every day this be become urgent will the government commit to a full compensation scheme as quickly as possible 
 we commit to respond as soon as we can to the final report the hon gentleman be right that we have accept the moral case for compensation after the final report come through we will be bring out our response as swiftly as we can 
 what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the progress make on move afghan people from hotel to settle accommodation 
 what recent discussion he have hold with cabinet colleague on support afghan people who have be resettle in the uk to access independent accommodation 
 hotel be not and never be design to be long term accommodation for afghans resettle in the uk i be therefore pleased to say that as of   september in line with our promise no legally resettle afghans remain in bridge accommodation as i tell the house on   july there be a small number for whom time limit contingency accommodation will be provide include where there be a need to bridge the short gap between the end of notice period and settle accommodation be ready for they to move into and in case of medical need where a family member require continue attendance at a specific hospital 
 will my right hon friend join i in welcome the new afghan family to north devon and thank everyone locally who be work to ensure that their resettlement be as smooth as possible and to give they a true devonian welcome 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and pay tribute to all those work locally in her constituency to prepare to welcome afghan family to the area north devon be steep in military history i be pleased to see her long stand support for veteran extend to those who assist the uk in afghanistan as well 
 i record my admiration for and thank the many public and voluntary agency and individual in fife for the dedication and compassion that they have show to the afghans they have host over the last year sadly those afghans be become victim of the big mass eviction that scotland have see since the highland clearance when we remember that those people be here because they risk their life for we they risk their life in afghanistan for democracy why have the government not even consider a homes for afghans scheme similar to the homes for ukraine scheme that make such a difference to desperate ukrainian refugee 
 largely because these be different cohort ukrainians be look to return to ukraine in the future the afghan cohort be stay here and will be in this country for an indeterminate period we be look at all way that we can continue to assist those who have come over from afghanistan i too pay tribute to all the home office liaison officer and all the staff in the department for levelling up housing and communities and in the ministry of defence who have work hard to get this over the line i say that we would honour our commitment to the people of afghanistan and we will continue to do so 
 the minister will be acutely aware as i be that around afghans who be entitle to the afghan relocation and assistance policy be stick in hotel in islamabad i know that he have see the letter that go to the prime minister which i sign along with other colleague what be the plan to get those arap entitle afghans into settle accommodation 
 the hon member know that this have be a long stand concern of mine both before government and in government my area of specific responsibility in term of get people here and into hotel and accommodation have be complete that be a home office area and i have not have discussion on it so far but everybody be aware of our commitment to the people who serve in afghanistan and the government will follow through on their commitment to those people 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to a recognise the contribution of nuclear test veteran and b support the roll out of the nuclear test medal 
 while hollywood remember the work of oppenheimer the government be commit to recognise the contribution of veteran and civilian staff across the uk and the commonwealth to britain ’s nuclear test   programme the office for veterans affairs be invest £ in project to commemorate and build further understanding of their experience i recently visit the worcestershire medal service in birmingham ’s jewellery quarter to see the nuclear test medal start roll off the production line 
 will my right hon friend update the house on the progress of application for the nuclear test medal and whether the medal will be ready to be award by remembrance sunday 
 of course last time we be here i make a commitment that we would do everything possible to get these medal on chest by remembrance sunday we be in line with that commitment we will meet that commitment this have be a year project and campaign by these individual i totally respect that for some it be not fast enough and for some it be not enough to be do we be strain every sinew to bring recognition to this cohort and we will continue to do so we will have those medal ready for remembrance sunday this year 
 i be pleased to hear that continue commitment to ensure that medal be with nuclear test veteran in time for remembrance sunday our nuclear test veteran serve our country with pride and distinction but give the uncertainty cause by the government ’s previous comment that the medal would be award by late summer and then that they would be ready in the autumn can we have some clarity and will the minister tell the house what recent discussion he have have with nuclear test veteran and their representative about a formal medal ceremony can he guarantee that nuclear test veteran will be award their medal in a manner befit their brave service 
 the hon member will be aware that remembrance sunday be come up which be a timeline that campaigner want to meet that give we a narrow window to do the sort of ceremony that i would think befit these individual it be a balance between get the medal on people ’s chest for remembrance sunday and at the same time ensure that they be award in a manner that be in keep with their service that be simply the art of the possible and what can be do i be proud of what the government have do on nuclear test veteran her party when it be in power do not award nuclear test veteran in fact she sign early day motion to campaign against nuclear weapon so i will not take any lesson on this i be proud of what we have do and i look forward to see medal on chest for remembrance sunday 
 how many day of sick leave due to mental health be take by civil servant in 
 civil service sickness absence datum be publish annually the late datum indicate that an average of work day be lose per staff year due to mental ill health for the year end   march 
 i understand that nearly quarter of a civil service working day be lose due to alleged stress and mental health reason and that that figure be up on the year before of course those with genuine mental health need need appropriate support but give that many civil servant enjoy pay and pension package way in excess of what many people can get in the private sector what step be the government take to ensure that only those with genuine mental health condition be grant a leave of absence 
 i know my hon friend will be aware that there have be in both the private and public sector a large spike in all sickness absence this year because of course the comparative datum be with the pandemic period the good news for he be that the most recent figure from the office for national statistics show that sickness absence for all form be low in the most recent period in central government departments than it be in the private sector we work with people who be unwell use occupational health and employee assistance provision to ensure that they get the support that they need we continue to wish to drive down the number of people who be off for ill health and to ensure that those who be unwell get the support that they require but we work with they 
 what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of the border target operating model on the price of a meat b fresh produce and c other foodstuff 
 in april the government publish a draft british border target operating model and on   august   we publish our final border target operating model confirm its introduction on   january   next year it outline our new control regime use well technology and co ordination to reduce friction and cost and will provide a simple yet secure experience for trader move good across the border 
 small business up and down the country have spend countless hour and million of pound prepare for these change only to find that the government be delay implementation for the time how do the minister expect business to have any confidence in make long term investment and supply chain decision when this government have such a long list of u turn and policy blunder 
 the hon lady be right that we have push the date back several time because of covid secondly because of ukraine and thirdly to ease the pressure of the cost of living crisis we be now work in line with business readiness have have regular engagement with people across the sector we have now set out as she will have see from the statement i make to this house in write on   september   and the write document publish on   august that we have a final time schedule 
 the office for national statistics have find that more than of people be pay more for their food shop what be the government ’s plan to bring down inflation quickly to ensure that people can feed their family 
 i be try to glimpse the british border target operating model within that question the government have take a range of measure in order to help bring down the cost of live for people notably the very considerable help we have give people with the cost of fuel 
 i call the shadow minister 
 thank you madam deputy speaker it be great to see you in the chair so early in the day member will be aware that the government attempt to sneak out in the summer that announcement about the utter chaos they have create over the border target operating model i say to the minister that inflation be of central relevance to this matter because the cat be out of the bag the government ’s own document concede that these measure when introduce will have an impact on inflation and will make the cost of food even higher can the minister set out what assessment have be make of the waste money and the cost to taxpayer and business as a result of the government ’s chaos on this issue 
 i welcome the right hon gentleman to his spot and i look forward to debate with he on this and other issue i do not quite accept his categorisation of we as sneak out a document by publish it and share it widely on social medium as i explain to   the hon member for richmond park sarah olney we have delay implementation in response to the challenge the country have face we be now ready to move forward with a brand new border target operating model which have the support of business of vet and of those deal with sanitary and phytosanitary check it will be a very good thing for the country and will help we to secure our border in new way 
 well that be announce when the house be not sit and to describe something that the government concede will increase price as a good thing be quite extraordinary and show how out of touch they be 
 let i turn to another area of the government ’s incompetence the january deadline for the rule of origin provision be now rapidly approach unless this matter be deal with it will devastate our car industry it should have be anticipate by the government can the minister tell we when an agreement for an extension to that deadline can be secure and what contingency plan be in place if the government fail to do that 
 on the right hon gentleman ’s point the document be publish when it be ready it be not hastily snuck out during recess on his point about readiness for the trade window in the car industry that matter be be take seriously by my right hon friend the secretary of state for business and trade who i be sure will be ready to say something shortly 
 what step his department be take to maintain public service during industrial action 
 cabinet office ministers have through cobra be assist departments in their response to industrial action when there be a spate of industrial action across the public sector which cause huge disruption to our constituent it be particularly important that we act together and the cabinet office assist departments in their planning 
 like many of my constituent i commute to london daily via rail and have have to deal with another summer of disruption cause by aslef and the rmt while student be apply for job with unconfirmed grade from unmarked exam paper and junior doctor continue to strike what be the minister ’s department do to end the strike and get those people back to work so that we can continue to clear the backlog and reduce the inflation that they claim to be strike against 
 my hon friend be right it be outrageous that his constituent can have their life totally upend by strike and by militant union we will of course respect the right to strike but we have a duty to protect the life and livelihood of the british people that be what our minimum service level legislation aim to do it be a pity that the labour party will not support it 
 the labour party govern in wales and the tories be in charge here in england while scotland be the only place in the uk to avoid any strike in our nhs that be because scotland have have and will continue to have the fair and good pay deal in the uk thank to the scottish government the scottish health minister recently offer to mediate in the fresh talk between the uk government and junior doctor have the minister consider that approach give the incompetence of his colleague 
 we will take absolutely no lesson from the snp on how to govern country i do not know whether the hon gentleman look at the news about what be go on in scotland or hear about it when he visit his constituency we have in this country a government of whom we can be proud i be not certain that that be the view of the scottish people 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to help ensure value for money in public procurement 
 the uk government already award contract on the basis of most economically advantageous tender furthermore we be currently take the procurement bill through parliament which be an opportunity to streamline procurement process and ensure that value for money remain central to the uk ’s procurement regime 
 it be important that taxpayer get value for money when public service be outsource over recent year the home office have give vast sum of taxpayer money to clearsprings ready homes yet the accommodation that it have contract out for housing asylum seeker have be unfit for human habitation partly because so much taxpayer money be be skim off by unaccountable intermediary before it reach the hotel or food provider what be the cabinet office do to stop that sort of thing happen in outsourced service 
 i be unable to comment on the specific of that case but on the broad point the procurement bill cover a range of issue include how we can improve quality within our supply chain perhaps the hon lady will join we for ping pong next week 
 i welcome the recent announcement that a grow number of small and medium sized enterprise have secure government contract but business with a social purpose and female own business be still under represent in public procurement opportunity will my hon friend meet i to discuss what can be do to remedy that 
 i would be very happy to meet my hon friend about this and other issue she will know that the procurement bill mean we be now look at the most advantageous tender which mean that value for money remain central but that those seek to strike up procurement can also look for other factor when decide which contract to sign we be very much on the same page 
 what progress his department have make on strengthen national resilience 
 strengthen our national resilience be a key priority for i and for the whole government last month we update the national risk register this be the most transparent approach ever take by any government design to help the whole of society make the most resilient plan possible we have also publish guidance clarify lead government department responsibility for risk assessment preparedness response and recovery 
 i thank my right hon friend for his response can he tell the house what discussion he have have with the department for energy security and net on ensure that we have strong security of energy supply as we progress through the energy transition 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that security of energy supply be critical to our national resilience and we have make significant progress on this we be move from often import fossil fuel to clean home grow energy source and i look forward to work with the new energy secretary on this very important issue 
 whether he be take step to encourage department to use environmentally sustainable transport 
 the green government commitment prescribe all departments to address the matter of environmentally sustainable transport management by reduce and refine their need to travel through hybrid working and the current location strategy departmental location where possible be all within minute walk of a major public transport hub 
 will this team wake up they have huge potential in the cabinet office to influence every department of state from my perspective as a passionate supporter of sustainable transport and particularly the revolution that be come in hydrogen power i see an inert department not push other departments to do well could they wake up and do something about this 
 i can think of nothing nice than be wake up by the hon gentleman i can reassure he that we do encourage our colleague in other departments to go far on this we have a range of carbon offset programme in place and as i say our location strategy mean that we try to locate people near public transport hub this be the very essence of a green transport strategy.[official report   november vol c. 3mc 
 what step his department be take to help prevent public sector fraud 
 i be delighted that in its year of operation the public sector fraud authority be expect to surpass its initial target as part of the overall £ recovery of fraud over the last year refer to by my right hon friend the secretary of state more widely the government have invest £ in fraud and error reduction since and we continue to be recognise as a world leader in combat public sector fraud 
 we know that whistleblower be responsible for uncover almost half of all fraud fraud that cost the public sector an estimate £ a year yet our law to protect and support they be not work if we want to tackle public sector fraud we need to encourage more people to come forward will my right hon friend agree to meet i to discuss how we can well support whistleblower and tackle this vast expense to the public purse 
 i be very happy to meet my hon friend or of my ministerial colleague will i can reassure she that we do wish to support whistleblower it be important that they be support in do what they do we certainly respect and be grateful for information share by whistleblower it be just part of the system   though and it be important that we continue to use ai to ensure that we can track down fraud across the public sector 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 tomorrow mark the anniversary of the passing of queen elizabeth ii and it be of course right that as a country we honour her late majesty ’s legacy as a step towards that the government jointly with the royal household have establish a new queen elizabeth memorial committee that committee will develop proposal for a permanent memorial to the late queen and a broad legacy programme that will enable everyone in the nation to commemorate her life of service to we 
 the cabinet office play a critical role in strengthen our national resilience and over the summer we publish the most comprehensive edition of the national risk register to date that important piece of work will help the government and the whole country prepare for the challenge we face 
 the cabinet office be currently carry out a review into homes england and my concern be about the help to buy scheme which help people to get on to the housing ladder the government outsource that service to lenvi early this year and since then my constituent have face huge delay in get their application process be the minister proud of create a help to buy scheme that be do the exact opposite of what it say on the tin 
 of course it be incumbent on ministers to drive efficiency in arm ’s length body such as homes england i be very happy to pick that up with my relevant ministerial colleague 
 can my right hon friend tell we anything more about the government ’s plan for the late queen elizabeth ii ’s memorialisation 
 i have already meet with lord janvrin who will be lead the committee he of course have decade of experience in service to the royal household include as private secretary to her late majesty the aim we be work towards be that the committee will report by which would have be her late majesty ’s birthday 
 i begin by associate myself with the secretary of state ’s comment on mark the anniversary of the death of the late queen 
 the responsibility of the cabinet office include the national security council and co ordinate the government ’s response to crisis last night we learn of a major breach of security with the escape from wandsworth prison of daniel abed khalife a terror suspect who be accuse of gather information that could be useful to a hostile state can the secretary of state update the   house on the search for mr khalife and whether in the light of his department ’s responsibility for national security and resilience he have ask why such a terror suspect be be hold at a low security category prison such as wandsworth in the place 
 may i begin by welcome the right hon gentleman to his new position it be wonderful that the great tradition of ginger across the dispatch boxes continue although if he do not mind should perhaps describe he as a legacy ginger he bring a wealth of experience to the role and i look forward to our exchange 
 the right hon gentleman be of course right to raise this case as he will know the lord chancellor have ask for an urgent investigation work with the prison service to find out the exact circumstance of what happen in respect of this escape clearly the initial law enforcement response will be lead by the home office but i will be work with the lord chancellor the home secretary and other to ensure that we rapidly apprehend this individual and learn the lesson of what lead to this escape in the place 
 i thank the secretary of state i can only say to he that the hair may go but the skin remain the same so in solidarity i wish he well in the current heat 
 it be report that mr khalife manage to escape by cling to the underside of a food delivery van this be obviously an extraordinary situation give the strict procedure that be suppose to govern the entry and exit of vehicle on the prison estate so can the secretary of state outline how those procedure will now be review what other aspect of prison security will also be review and over what timescale and when the public and parliament will be inform of any change make as a result of this very serious breach of security 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely correct to raise all of these question and that be precisely what my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor be oversee with an examination into that right now if the individual escape in those circumstance that clearly should not have happen i know that my right hon and learn friend take it very seriously indeed and will of course update the house on the outcome of the investigation of course the home secretary will update the house alongside the lord chancellor on step to apprehend the individual 
 over the summer i once again visit rolls royce and meet some of its brilliant apprentice and last year with the armed force parliamentary scheme i be shadow our royal navy it be clear that some of the challenge on nuclear skill be mirror in the military and the private sector what be the cabinet office do to bring together extra work and extra career path so that those who have nuclear skill can transition between the 
 i thank my hon friend for his very important question alongside a lot of the support mechanism we have introduce operation fortitude operation courage operation restore and operation nova we have a   series of mission or sector initiative for accelerate veteran who have come out of the military with specialist skill into a job and make sure those skill be not go to waste have a job remain the no factor in improve the life chance of veteran veteran employment be at 87%—it have never be high but there be more to do and i look forward to work with my hon friend in the month ahead 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 it be clear from their action that the tories want to privatise our health service sell datum from england ’s nhs to a trump back business palantir under a £ datum deal this be do without a competitive tender not only that but they also accept a £ donation from a rich health tycoon this week do the deputy prime minister not agree with i that the only way to guarantee protection and integrity for scotland ’s nhs be to keep it out of westminster tory hand and keep it in the hand of the people of scotland 
 the hon lady will know because she sit on the procurement bill committee that we have a new procurement regime come in but in the case she refer to it be my understanding that everything be above board and in line with due process 
 madam deputy speaker may i join you in wish my hon friend the minister a happy birthday 
 give that the constitution be reserve to this uk parliament and give that there do not appear to be much in the way of anything new in the programme for government set out this week do my hon friend agree that the minister of scotland would do well to focus on the real issue that matter to the people and business of scotland rather than obsess with break up the united kingdom 
 as ever my hon friend have his finger on the pulse i be lucky enough to be on a work trip to edinburgh and glasgow just before the summer break and all the people i meet there be interested in employment skill the state of the health service and law and order not person raise a referendum with i which be because it be not among people ’s priority in scotland people ’s priority be the same as those of the westminster government 
 ipsos recently publish its annual poll on trust in politic which reveal that only of respondent actually believe what a politician be say the low level in year will the minister look again at my elected representatives codes of conduct bill which be aim specifically at restore trust and confidence in politic and politician 
 i be very happy to look again at the hon lady ’s work our general belief be that it be our action in this place and outside it as elect representative that will restore trust in politic rather than legislation and that be a job for all of we 
 the cost to government of ill health run into hundred of billion the economic impact of obesity alone be estimate to be over £ account for the cost to the nhs and social care lose productivity workforce inactivity and welfare payment do my right hon friend agree with i that it be time for a taskforce to look holistically at health and societal challenge and to develop early intervention strategy on a multi departmental basis 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight those challenge the health service i have see this in my own constituency be come up with innovative model to look at wide public health and to address exactly that issue we want to get more people back into the workforce and we need to deal with some of those long term challenge 
 although the police datum leak in northern ireland be cause by human error it raise wide concern about cyber security and datum for our public service worker i have be approach by constituent who work particularly within policing they would like some reassurance that the cabinet office be work with force across england and wales to ensure that those type of data breach do not happen again and that the cabinet office will do more work on secure people ’s personal datum particularly when they be work in service such as the police force 
 the hon gentleman be right to say that this issue be local to the police service of northern ireland but he be also right i fully acknowledge this that there may be question to learn across government about how we make certain that people ’s data be secure it be critical that individual work and provide a service to the country know that their data be secure i agree with he on that and i have have discussion with official about what we can to do ensure we can give that reassurance 
 will the cabinet office convene an inter ministerial committee between the department of health and social care the department for levelling up housing and communities and the treasury to consider what to do where we have build ten of thousand of house but section money have not be allocate for adequate health facility this be a problem across our country and on both side of the house i hope we will solve it for the future with what we be do with the levelling up and regeneration bill and the infrastructure levy but there be a legacy problem that need the attention of the cabinet office give its co ordinating role in government that would be a very useful thing for the department to do and an extremely necessary 
 that be an interesting proposal if we be to get public consent for the number of house we need to build we must be able to reassure people that the infrastructure be in place that be precisely what the levelling up and regeneration bill seek to do i will look at my hon friend ’s proposal for an inter ministerial group i be always a little cautious about set up   more inter ministerial group unless i can be sure that they will actually deliver some further outcome but i take his proposal seriously 
 cleaning and security staff in whitehall departments be now strike over a poverty pay offer by the outsourced contractor iss what be minister do to help resolve that dispute with the public and commercial services union and to end the race to the bottom for the pay and term and condition of vital worker due to outsourcing 
 i be sorry that strike action be ongoing ultimately this be a matter between the employee and their employer 
 will the minister for veterans affair update the house on the northern ireland legacy legislation 
 yesterday the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation bill pass this house legacy be an incredibly difficult issue victim have be let down for many year veteran have be let down this government make a commitment that we would see through our promise to both those group and that be what we do yesterday i be disappointed that the opposition vote against it again but politics be about choice and i be proud of what this government have deliver 
 far to the question on the infected blood inquiry from my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson why will the government not get on with extend the interim payment now as they could do and as be recommend by sir brian langstaff it be absolutely shameful to delay that any long and there be no excuse 
 i have hear many time from the hon lady about this subject and about her constituent she speak about it passionately in this house and have do so for a number of year i come back to my early answer we pay interim compensation last year as the house be aware and the interim report have come through i be expect the final report in the autumn put we in a place to respond as swiftly as possible once it be receive 
 yesterday mark a year since the prime minister ’s predecessor take office and as you may remember madam deputy speaker a lettuce end up outlast she due to tory economic mismanagement that same lettuce would now cost around more the cost of food might not be an issue for the prime minister who be the rich    mp in the house of commons but it be a concern for my constituent what discussion have ministers have with cabinet colleague on tackle food insecurity 
 i know that the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs and the chancellor of the exchequer engage regularly with supermarket food provider and other to make sure that we continue to keep price low it be the case that since the prime minister come to office we be now see inflation fall and we have see a record upward revision in growth number which now show that we recover fast from covid than any other european country contrary to the repeat assertion of the party on the opposition benches 
 i be go to have another go why be it that   the minister have not be able even to implement recommendation of the interim report which be to set up a bespoke psychological service for those infected and affect when other nation of the united kingdom have be able to do that why have england be leave out why have the government not be able to do that 
 that issue be be take forward as the right hon lady know by the department of health and social care i know it have make substantial progress on exactly such a scheme and i look forward to it make an announcement in due course 
 the forthcoming by election in rutherglen and hamilton west will be the in scotland under the new requirement for voter identification we know that thousand of voter in england be disenfranchise at council election because they do not have a passport or drive licence what specific step be the cabinet office take to make sure that the voter of rutherglen and hamilton west who want to turn out in their thousand to elect katy loudon as their mp be not prevent from do so because they be too poor to own a passport or drive licence 
 i hope the hon gentleman be not suggest that people can only vote if they have a passport or driver ’s licence if he do not know that that be untrue he now do we have have a widespread publicity campaign to ensure that people understand the identity requirement at election at the local election despite considerable scaremongering from opposition party the disruption be minimal 
 that conclude question i pause for a moment to allow the change of dramatis personae on the front bench there be quite a lot of movement this morning

 i thank the leader of the house for that update she have put this job on the world stage and i look forward to work with she may i also welcome my deputy my hon friend   the member for blaenau gwent nick smith fresh from the public accounts committee i also welcome the new member to their place particularly my hon friend   the member for selby and ainsty keir mather 
 i be delighted to take up this important role and i put on record my thank to my hon friend   the member for bristol west thangam debbonaire who be a great shadow leader of the house i also thank some of her predecessor too for their advice all of they say that this job be vital for uphold truth and democracy and for ensure that the government be hold to account by his majesty ’s loyal opposition i fear that this be now need more than ever 
 after year of this government our politic have increasingly be drag into disrepute by cronyism scandal and as i be afraid always happen with a tory government sleaze i be sorry to say that this house our sacred seat of democracy have become an afterthought to a press release a place for ministers to avoid at all cost if they can disrespect and disregard by disinterested ministers 
 in this place where ministers use to regard it as their duty to be candid we have see rule breaking evasiveness and spin despite mr speaker ’s valiant and often successful effort to the contrary minister do not seem to know what their power be for anymore with 
 a zombie parliament where nothing meaningful have happen the government be adrift 
 that be not my verdict but that of the former member for mid bedfordshire 
 the writ be move this week for more by election add to the slew of other they speak volume about this rotten government today we hear that the people of tamworth can finally get an mp they can be proud of 
 sometimes these session be an occasion for levity let ’s be honest there be plenty of material just this week we have the education secretary ’s hot mic interview but quite frankly it be just not funny anymore it be tragic it be tragic to see this country ’s reputation and potential trash by a tory government that have linger too long 
 the debate and statement this week have bring no real answer about fix crumble school after a decade of under investment parliament and parent need answer so can the leader of the house provide they will she lay before parliament the advice give to the prime minister before the spending review that cut funding to school rebuilding can she tell we exactly when the new evidence of the imminent danger be give to ministers will she guarantee that the list of school publish yesterday be correct and pledge that ministers will come to parliament to update it will she confirm that of the school affect have building project cancel in will she lay before parliament a full list of all public building affect by reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete 
 may i advise the leader of the house not to repeat the nonsense we hear during prime minister ’s question yesterday indeed will she correct the record of the prime minister ’s claim the leader of the opposition have raise school building safety many time include through opposition day motion which the leader of the house vote against labour ’s programme which be aim at secondary school be the big capital investment in school for a generation and her government scrap it immediately on take office before criticise it again today she might want to be remind of the fact that the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have since say that scrap it be his big mistake 
 finally we have have no mention of this week ’s anniversary which conservative members might want to forget it be year since   the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss   become prime minister in the interest of parliamentary accountability it be an important event to debate as her week tenure leave a crippling legacy for mortgage holder with million now pay hundred of pound a month more thank to her reckless decision all of which the leader of the house defend and support at the time the leader of the house say that the right hon member for south west norfolk have a bold economic plan will she now apologise for put she in office and for the price the rest of we be pay for her kamikaze budget will she bring forward legislation to stop the house be bring far into disrepute by the former prime minister ’s elevate her crony to the house of lords we have have no contrition 
 it be the leader of the house ’s job to uphold the integrity of this place and its member include former prime ministers in the eye of the public how will she ensure that parliament can do this 
 i add my voice to the many who have pay tribute to the lionesses for their incredible achievement we be all so proud of they not just for the brilliant football they play but for their conduct and the solidarity they have show with the spanish team 
 i do wish to commemorate an important anniversary but a different from the that   the hon member for manchester central lucy powell   mention many right hon and hon member will be think of her late majesty queen elizabeth ii on the anniversary of her death which be this week and i anticipate many tribute to her service strength and devotion to duty in the come day 
 i also pay tribute to   the hon member for bristol west thangam debbonaire   for her service to this house i very much enjoy work with she i welcome the hon member for manchester central and her team to this place i hope i can say congratulation to she but i understand if commiseration be in order the clock have strike midnight and she have have to leave the glitter ball that be the culture medium and sport brief go be the growl engine of silverstone the champagne flute of the royal opera house and the peel grape of bbc hospitality ascot ’s horse have turn into house of commons mouse and she be in the scullery with i for company i thank she for the meeting we have already have for my part i will do my good to make sure that it be productive and enjoyable and i look forward to work with she and her team 
 i must reject the hon lady ’s characterisation of both this parliament and this government in this session government bills have achieve royal assent amount to page of legislation we have be very busy indeed and i thank all member of this house for their attention to that i also reject her characterisation of this government she focus on correct the record and i take what she say seriously and genuinely all credit to she she admit when she have get thing wrong she admit that she be wrong to support   the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn interruption no 
 i think the hon lady be wrong about the prime minister ’s comment but i understand that she will not take my word for it so i suggest she look at the times analysis of yesterday ’s exchange which back the prime minister both on the building programme and that he do not cut the budget i would be interested in how many time she raise raac as an issue in this house when she be shadow education secretary give her commitment to the fact will she admit that labour have get it wrong on the economy labour have be wrongly talk this nation down but it have now be demonstrate that we have have the fast recovery from the pandemic in the g7 that be vindication of the prime minister ’s furlough and bounce back loan scheme 
 the hon lady understandably focus on the situation of school infrastructure i remind she that labour ’s building school programme exclude of school and be poor value for money and highly ineffective on a personal note when i get my seat in my school be so bad that a secondary school be shut because it be too dangerous to teach in and have legionnaire bacteria in it it and another in my patch have now be rebuild and we have a new university technical college 
 the hon lady criticise secretaries of state for education but what they have deliver mean that across england we have more good or outstanding school nearly additional teacher and the good literacy outcome in the western world the current education secretary put the safety of child in contrast to labour in wales which have not act so swiftly despite similar warning the health and safety priority of the labour government in wales appear to be focus on people buy meal deal as oppose to a lump of concrete fall on a child ’s head that go to show that labour ’s priority be wrong in bankrupt birmingham politically correct street name trump pay woman a fair wage good stewardship of public fund be trump by utter incompetence on an epic scale as a leak memo from labour headquarters say 
 budget cut and the size of the city be use as reason to explain the situation however this do not hold up under scrutiny 
 our prime minister recognise that for we to be worthy of public support we must focus on the public ’s priority the safety and education of their kid in particular a strong grow economy low debt and inflation great accessible healthcare and border control where labour be in power and in its support of strike and vote against our legislation it show that it can not and will not deliver on those priority of the british people 
 i will close by give the hon lady on her outing some advice from this pompey supporter to that man city supporter opposite in politic as in football the blue team be always good 
 this house as the leader of the house be aware take a dim view of bullying unless it be by i she will be shock to learn that britain ’s bad water company have now resort to thuggery and strong arm tactic to silence parliamentarian and the press i refer of course to the pennon group which include the nation ’s filthy and leaky supplier south west water its chairman gill rider who work for the cabinet office and so be use to leak i suppose have hire city lawyer to threaten the press and parliamentarian if we speak out against the company she be run a mob that have conviction for pollute river pay its top gun criminal bonus and despite the wet july on record still have a hosepipe ban it be operate like a mafia this be absolutely appalling may we have an urgent debate in government time on these ruddy water company who be blackmail their customer and parliamentarian to stop the truth come out 
 my hon friend have raise issue relate to that particular company many time in business question and the whole house can sense his frustration and anger with what be happen i suggest that he may wish to raise the matter with the relevant secretary of state on   october he be an experienced parliamentarian and will know how he can achieve a debate 
 i too welcome the shadow leader of the house to her post and i pay real tribute to her predecessor 
 it be a bit of a surprise to we all that the leader of the house herself be still in post hang on against all the odd especially give the way her government be   unravel day by catastrophic day during summer recess we all see she on her late leadership tour in scotland madam deputy speaker she can not stay away from the place visit in year it must be a record for a tory minister speak at a fringe event she characterise scotland as a fierce and powerful nation be hold back by the bile and hatred of the snp in her reflection on her visit the leader of the house mount a defence of the union base on our poem our rivalry and our blood and our brotherhood madam deputy speaker we have no interest in be fierce whatever that mean we just want the power to govern ourselves like any modern democratic country and build a fairer green and more prosperous nation 
 i think i know why the leader of the house be so keen to head north of the border it be because when she be there she see a very different country i could not put it well than the respected oxford professor danny dorling who say last month 
 scotland be show we the route to a fairer society and be help to prevent britain from become a failed state 
 professor dorling add 
 scotland already have a low proportion of child live in poverty than the most affluent region of england which be the south east further progress 
 on inequality 
 have be achieve through the scottish child payment raise to £ a week 
 and finally 
 scotland show we a well way forward 
 in contrast he have describe the reaction of politician in england to address inequality as be to promise 
 only minor remedial action with short term impact 
 the leader of the house call i delusional when i point out to her previously scotland ’s fast economic growth our low unemployment and our low rate of child poverty than the rest of the uk and when i tell she that not a single day in the scottish nhs have be lose to industrial dispute and that we have the well pay teacher in the uk the next time she come back from a day trip to scotland can we have a debate on what she have learn from we 
 well i have genuinely miss these exchange where the hon lady blame everyone except the scottish government who be of the most powerful devolve administrations in the world she invite i to tell the house what i learn on my very pleasant trip to scotland over the summer i learn that scotland have slow economic growth than england i be shocked to learn that victorian disease such as ricket have return to certain city in scotland and that glasgow ’s rat problem be now so bad it be preclude binman access certain street because it be too dangerous for they i discover that the bill to scottish taxpayer for the smelting business debacle stand at £ i discover that £ which be ringfence for scottish farmer have go awol i also learn that the scottish auditor have only be able to give a qualified sign off to the snp ’s account 
 i tour other part of the uk as well in manchester this may interest   the hon member for manchester central lucy powell i discover that greater manchester police have be force to issue a crime reference number follow a complaint about the snp   give constituency seat in return for cash i also learn that there be a £ black hole in the scottish programme for government which be announce this week i thank   the hon member for edinburgh north and leith deidre brock   for invite i to put that on the record 
 the hon lady seek to blame everyone else for this situation i the uk government and anyone else who be around except the scottish government this summer a former colleague of hers even try to blame agent of a foreign power for infiltrate the snp and make all these terrible decision the snp be never short of a grievance but it be now run out of excuse i look forward to hear next week what other excuse there may be the execution of mary queen of scots the highland clearance the year war 
 the grotesque chaos and appal public service from which the hon lady ’s constituent and the rest of the scottish people be suffer be entirely down to the snp they be now a sad spend force and be no long the uk ’s separatist party that dubious honour now go to the labour party in wales 
 the leader of the house may be aware of a tragedy that strike a chord of sadness and anger among my constituent in the wide black country nationally and indeed internationally 
 the building know as the crooked house pub be build in it be symbolic of the region ’s industrial heritage and be home to ten of thousand of individual personal memory soon after its sale the crooked house be subject to an arson attack follow by unlawful demolition notwithstanding the local council ’s instruction that that should not be do this be an ongoing trend across the country may we please have a debate in government time to see what this place can do to well protect such heritage pub 
 hear hear 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important issue and i hope the approval for his question that i have just hear across both side of the house be audible to other i believe that this appalling incident be still subject to a police investigation but it appear that road lead to the pub be block to prevent emergency vehicle from reach the fire i hope i speak for all of we when i say that this be an appalling and disgraceful situation i be encourage by the statement from andy street that it would be deal with and that if it turn out that there have be foul play people would be hold to account i be sure that if my hon friend apply for a debate it would be extremely well attend and that he have the support of everyone in this place 
 i thank the leader of the house for announce next week ’s business i note that she do not announce the business for monday and   tuesday september but i understand that the government intend to award the tuesday to the backbench business committee if that be the case we would propose a pre recess general debate on matter to be raise before the forthcoming adjournment the that take place before the summer recess be very well subscribe and time limit be impose and i be sure that this would also be a popular debate 
 i now need to declare an interest in that i be the chair of the governor of a maintain primary school and a member of the board of trustee of an academy trust aspect of the government ’s management of the crisis over reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete in school be on the face of it bizarre if not perverse and wasteful namely the fact that move furniture from an affected school to an empty building would apparently fall under revenue cost and would not be allowable under the government ’s current proposal if the school decide not to move furniture but to buy brand new furniture for an empty building that would be allow to fall under capital cost 
 that seem to i to be a very strange decision on the part of the department for education could the leader of the house perhaps check to see whether that be indeed the case and if it be could she persuade the department to change its mind about support revenue cost give that that would be wasteful and unwise 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his always helpful advert for forthcoming backbench business opportunity he know that i wish to give he as much notice as possible and i will continue to do so when we have lock in the time 
 i be all in favour of gumption be apply and i will make sure the secretary of state for education who be also in favour of gumption be apply have hear what he have say today and make sure all member know the fact 
 we have manifesto commitment to ban the live export of animal for slaughter and to crack down on the illegal smuggling of dog the animal welfare kept animals bill would have deliver those promise but it be withdraw when will the government produce new legislation to keep those important promise 
 i thank my right hon friend for raise this important point we have a great track record on improve animal welfare and our animal welfare legislation be now world lead we be still committed to those manifesto commitment and my committee be busy look at these issue she will know that further business will be announce in the usual way but she should be reassure

 i thank the hon lady for raise this matter foreign commonwealth and development office question be not until   october so i will write on her behalf to make sure that minister have hear her concern 
 i want to praise the rush skatepark team and star such as edith bowman tom smith andy burrows and katy pearson for organise an incredible fundraising event at the sub rooms on friday night young people be sadly still devastate by the council ’s decision to close rush skatepark a few year ago but we be work to rebuild a brand new even well skatepark for they i urge everyone in the district to support it will my right hon friend agree to look into how often sport such as skating scooting and bmx get attention in this place and see whether she can find time for a debate on this life change set of sport and their popularity among young people

 osteoporosis affect about of the uk population especially woman early diagnosis be vital and could lead to many thousand of preventable death the royal osteoporosis society be base in bath and i be sure the leader of the house and everybody here will join i in congratulate it on its excellent work the royal united hospital in bath have a specialist fracture clinic but only half of nhs england trust provide such clinic can we have a debate in the house on support for fracture liaison service and on people live with osteoporosis 
 i thank the hon lady for raise this issue and for the work go on in her constituency on this important matter the next question to the secretary of state for health and social care will be on   october and i will therefore draw to his attention the good good practice in her constituency osteoporosis and brittle bone be a key cause of fracture if we could reduce pressure on the nhs by make sure we alleviate those condition that would be good too

 the record police officer in bedfordshire achieve under the leadership of chief constable trevor rodenhurst and the police and crime commissioner festus akinbusoye be very welcome however we face a serious problem with shoplifting with a low proportion of police turn out when shop notify they and an even low number of conviction i have some shop locally where store manager be tell the shoplifter to take what they can so long as they do not hurt the staff this be simply unacceptable in a cost of living crisis when poor people and all of we have to end up pay more may we have a debate in which we can raise these issue and make clear to the home office this house ’s view on shoplifting and the action that the police need to take 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important point and he be absolutely right in what he say small shop be lifeline for community it be a sorry state of affair if they be not able to thrive and be disincentivise from continue their business he will know that leave aside fraud and computer crime we have halve crime since on roughly the same slightly more resource that be a tremendous record but there be more to be do with a particular focus on antisocial behaviour and these kind of crime he will know that the home office recently say that every crime of this nature need to be follow up and investigate i will make sure that the home office have hear what my hon friend have say i think such issue will be the focus of many colleague in the come week
