the secretary of state be ask 
 what step he be take to ensure scientific evidence be use to support his net policy 
 this government ’s approach be found on the bedrock of the good scientific evidence which accord to the intergovernmental panel on climate change say that net by be essential to limit global warming to ° that be why we support baroness may ’s decision to put net by into law that be base on advice from the climate change committee that decision be right for the climate for energy security and for the job and growth that it can bring to our country 
 this government ’s mission to make britain a clean energy superpower be not only deliver against climate target but deliver job and investment in place like durham and the wide north east where around renewable energy company already employ around people in good quality job a figure that be set to rise to those who take a stand against climate action would put that growth at risk do the secretary of state share my concern that the fearmongering by some in this house about the cost and safety of renewable be not only misguided but fundamentally against our national interest and will he work with local team to provide suitable knowledge and education as suggest by retrofit reimagined 
 order i think the secretary of state have get it 
 my hon friend be absolutely right unfortunately the climate change act be now an issue that divide this house i think rain newton smith the director general of the cbi put it very well recently when she say 
 the climate act have be the bedrock for investment flow into the uk 
 rip up the framework that have give investor confidence that the uk be serious about sustainable growth through a low carbon future would damage our   economy seek to abolish the climate change act be not just a betrayal of young people it be anti job and anti investment 
 may i gently remind the energy secretary that it be his job to answer question from mps on behalf of their constituent i will ask the same question that i ask he last time if the uk become net tomorrow by how much would it reduce the earth ’s temperature 
 i will give the hon gentleman the answer i give he last time action by the uk make a difference here of course we be of global emission but our action mean that other country act where be the evidence for that well it actually happen when the climate change act pass other country pass their own version of it net be sign into law in this country and now of global gdp be cover by net that be the difference the uk make i believe in britain the hon gentleman do not 
 i call the chair of the energy security and net committee 
 lord stern remind we just today that 
 investment in climate action be the growth story of the century 
 while expect growth from fossil fuel be 
 futile because the damage it cause end in self destruction 
 the office for budget responsibility confirm the same thing in the summer refer to the huge cost of not take climate action be it not the truth that the energy transition be essential not only to address climate action but to exactly how we deliver economic success 
 the chair of the select committee speak very wisely on this matter the net economy grow time fast than the economy as a whole last year this be the growth opportunity of the century now we could let china or india take that opportunity but i say that we need that opportunity for britain 
 the climate change act force ministers to meet rigid legally bind emission target regardless of the economic consequence do the secretary of state accept that this law have directly contribute to high energy bill the loss of british industry and decline competitiveness and that the only sensible course of action be to repeal it 
 no and british business roundly condemn the conservatives when they come out with that argument the hon gentleman should have a word with   the right hon member for east surrey claire coutinho sit on the front bench who say just in march last year life come at you fast mr speaker that britain be the poster child for net she be laud everything associate with that and now she want to abolish the act that make it possible 
 what plan he have to assess land use change in application for new energy infrastructure 
 we be deliver a strategic spatial energy plan to support a more actively plan approach to energy infrastructure it will consider wide demand include food production water supply and nature recovery the departments for environment food and rural affairs and for energy security and net will ensure that the strategic spatial energy plan and the land use framework work together 
 resident in my constituency be concerned about a propose site for a battery energy storage system on agricultural land in the green belt with tale of similar storage system catch fire there be understandable fear in the community would the minister meet i to discuss make local fire service statutory consultee for certain type of battery storage planning application and to hear my resident concern and will he reassure they that they will not be guinea pig for new or untested technology 
 the hon lady be right to say that public confidence in the safety of all infrastructure be incredibly important battery technology be no more unsafe than any other technology but if there be a public perception that it be then it be right that we take action to deal with that that be why i be host a roundtable to look at what more we can do around safety and it be why the department for environment food and rural affairs be do work on some of the regulation in this space this be regulate closely by the health and safety executive but i be happy to meet the hon lady to discuss what more we can do 
 i thank the minister for that answer in my constituency several planning application be pende and have already be grant in the village of wilsden and cullingworth for battery storage and onshore wind in the wide area can the minister explain how constituent with clean energy infrastructure in their area can benefit from both cheap bill and community funding 
 my hon friend be right to highlight that building renewable infrastructure be how we will bring down bill for everyone in the long term it be incredibly important that we can store cheap electricity include through battery storage so that we can deploy it in the system far more regularly than we be currently deploy gas which be what be drive up people ’s bill we also want the community that host the infrastructure to benefit directly from it they will benefit from cheap bill as well as from direct community benefit we have be consult over the past few month on whether those should be make mandatory and whether we should raise the expectation on developer 
 what step his department be take to tackle fuel poverty in greater manchester 
 ensure that everyone have access to a safe and warm home be our priority from this winter we estimate that an extra family in the north west will receive £ off their energy bill thank to decision take by this government through our warm home plan we will bring down bill for family right across the country 
 accord to national energy action adult in the north be more likely to ration their energy this winter and in my constituency almost people be in fuel poverty and at risk of poor living condition illness and suffering a balance must be strike to deliver both clean heating and a people approach after serious delay will the minister finally bring forward a warm home plan and explain how it will achieve that balance and ensure that low income household in cheadle be guarantee clean affordable heating for the winter to come 
 we will bring forward the warm home plan this year in march we allocate around £ to local authority and social housing provider through the warm home local grant the hon member may want to direct his constituent to the greater manchester combine authority which receive a settlement of £ of devolve capital funding for building retrofit they can access that through the retrofit portal which have an eligibility checker so that household can check whether they qualify for free or discount home upgrade 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of extend the warm home discount on level of fuel poverty 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of extend the warm home discount on level of fuel poverty 
 from this winter an additional household across the uk will receive £ off their energy bill which make a total of nearly low income household receive this vital support that be the difference that this government be make to our community 
 i be delighted that thank to this government and the warm home discount eligibility extension thousand more rochdale family will be eligible for £ off their bill this winter it will ensure that young and old alike get more help with their bill this winter i would like to raise the case of my constituent keith gumbridge who have his cavity wall insulation botch under the previous government and who be leave with huge legal bill after so call no win no fee law firm pure legal go bust mr gumbridge ’s case have be with the legal ombudsman for nearly year do the minister agree that that be far too long to wait for justice 
 i pay tribute to my hon friend for all his work championing cause for his constituent he will know that an extra household in the north west will be eligible for the warm home discount and that household across the country will be help this year i would be more than happy to meet my hon friend to discuss the case of mr gumbridge ensure confidence in the insulation system will be crucial to roll out the warm home plan 
 i congratulate the minister on be free from the government whips office and welcome he to his position on the front bench i commend the government on extend the warm home discount to a further low income household but there be much more to do with that in mind will the minister find time to meet i so that we can discuss how we can keep people in newcastle under lyme alive safe and warm in the colder month ahead 
 i thank my hon friend for his comment on my liberation from the government whips office i know that he be a champion for his constituent in newcastle under lyme and i be always happy to meet to discuss these important issue he will know as i do that with wholesale gas cost high than before the russian invasion of ukraine we must get people off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel price and on to clean home grow power 
 nearly household in the uk live in fuel poverty at the same time a recent report from the common wealth think tank tell we that energy company profit average about a quarter of everybody ’s bill in the last few year £ have be pay to shareholder instead of be reinveste or use to help tackle fuel poverty will the minister commit to tackle those energy company profit by tax they fairly and reinveste the money in the urgent work that be need for example through the warm home plan to tackle the scourge of fuel poverty in our country 
 the cost of energy have to come down and of my job as minister for energy consumer be drive down the cost of bill but we must also remember that the government introduce a windfall tax on the oil and gas company and we have the price cap on energy which cap the profit of energy company we will continue to take that action 
 despite the oil price be at a month low this week energy price remain stubbornly high give the onset of winter what further step will the minister and his department take by way of a warm home scheme 
 we be take action through the warm home discount which be be provide to an extra household across the country and the warm home plan which we will roll out before the end of the year 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of trend in the level of energy price on economic growth 
 high and volatile energy price be bad for growth take money out of consumer pocket and make our business less competitive through our mission to achieve clean power by we be take the country off the rollercoaster of global fossil fuel price and have set a route to home grow cheap and green energy 
 the minister and i come from of the most energy rich part of europe yet its consumer have among the high energy bill in europe that drive up fuel poverty and hit the cost of living crisis he will be aware of that labour promise to bring down bill by £ they will have go up by about the same amount do the minister understand why people be so frustrated with the government 
 like the hon member i understand people ’s frustration when they look at their energy bill each month interruption that promise stand that be why we be take concert action through the warm home discount which be provide household with support this winter and the warm home plan which we will roll out this year 
 economic growth be a key driver for all our constituent what be the government ’s estimate of the number of job that will be create in the uk by be it true to say that it will be triple the number in the old economy 
 hundred of thousand of job will come from the clean power revolution that be why it be so important that we push ahead with it and do not adopt the tactic of the conservative party or their friend on the back benches we need to push ahead with clean power in order to unlock those hundred of thousand of job across the country 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i welcome the new ministers to the front bench on the day of recess away from scrutiny the labour party publish the price for its allocation round of the renewable auction labour use to say that renewable be time cheap but the price that the secretary of state have say he be willing to pay be high than the current cost of electricity they be the high price in a decade and he have extend the contract length to year those be not just the price that we will be pay they be the price that our child will be pay will the minister explain how lock we into high price for long will cut bill by £ 
 the right hon lady ’s comparison be absolute nonsense and she know it she compare the cost of build and operate new renewable which be what the contract for difference relate to with the cost of operate not build gas plant once we make a fair comparison the truth be that renewable be cheap to build we will take no lesson on energy policy from the conservative party which abandon its commitment to clean energy at its party conference 
 what step great british energy be take to help public service use more renewable energy 
 what step great british energy be take to help public service use more renewable energy 
 what step great british energy be take to help public service use more renewable energy 
 early this month great british energy jointly fund new community energy project in scotland include an island solar farm a community ice rink and a small community wind farm great british energy be also help public service in england with their energy bill through its solar for all programme which benefit school and hospital in this way gbe be transfer money from the pocket of energy company to local community and frontline service 
 many leisure centre such as the tryst in cumbernauld which be build and open in be desperate to decarbonise but face huge cost and the practical challenge of retrofit renewable technology into old building will my right hon friend set out how great british energy will support vital community facility of that kind in make the switch to clean energy and in reduce their bill 
 my hon friend speak very well about these issue gb energy be already take advantage of the huge potential of clean energy and hundred of school hospital and nhs site across the country be already benefit the statement of strategic priority make it clear that gbe will work collaboratively and in partnership with scottish public body and the scottish government to increase investment in the local community energy sector in scotland organisation such as my hon friend ’s leisure centre sound like ideal candidate 
 thank to great british energy and this government queen ’s hospital in burton will get solar panel which will save the trust money that can be plough directly into the frontline and be spend on patient do the secretary of state agree that there be significant opportunity to expand that programme to other public building and be he explore that with his department 
 my hon friend be right and i hope that the massive expansion to school and hospital that we have already ensure in month be welcome across the house 
 they do not need gbe to do it 
 the hon gentleman say that we do not need gb energy to do that but the conservatives never do it not in year it be precisely through a   publicly own energy company that we be do this to the benefit of citizen across our country i agree with my hon friend   the member for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier   that there be huge opportunity here and we intend to expand the plan 
 i for welcome the announcement that the publicly own great british energy will roll out solar panel to more school and hospital in the come year what benefit will that bring to our community and what can place such as luton south and south bedfordshire do to take advantage of the clean power transition 
 this be really important public institution face significantly high energy bill because of the legacy of the last government gbe with its programme be cut those bill that be a transfer of resource from energy bill to frontline public service   the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie   be chuntere from the front bench he should visit some of the teacher and nhs staff who think that this be a brilliant programme 
 my constituency of esher and walton be home to the uk ’s large float installation of solar panel there be on the queen elizabeth ii reservoir help to support public service by power a thames water treatment plant it be a fantastically innovative renewable project but very few of my constituent know about it how will the government use great british energy to argue more effectively for the benefit of renewable for community and public service across the uk 
 the energy minister say that he go on a profile raise visit to the programme week ago so many more people now know about it thank to that indeed even more thousand million will know about it as a result of watch this question time the hon lady make an important point about how gb energy can roll this out across the country and float solar have real potential as well 
 over a year ago the uk government promise that there would be hundred of job for gb energy in aberdeen a year on the oil and gas industry in aberdeen be haemorrhage thousand of job and we be barely into double figure for gb energy job when will that promise be keep 
 i have to say that i do not agree with the hon gentleman about the work that gb energy be do when i talk to industry representative they say that gb energy now play a crucial role there be investment come into the supply chain a supply chain fund of £ thank to the spending review which the conservatives would abolish because they do not seem to want job in britain there be £ in the supply chain and gb energy be roll out community energy project in school and hospital in england as well as the one in scotland that i have talk about gb energy be partner with the private sector this be all part of the clean energy workforce plan which we will publish soon for extra job as a result of our clean energy mission 
 by prioritise partnership with school we will help to protect their budget i draw the secretary of state ’s attention to school in maidenhead and specifically furze platt senior school where i happen to be a governor which recently partner with maidenergy to install solar panel on the school ’s building thereby do right by its budget and by the environment and set a great example for the student teach there 
 i congratulate the hon gentleman on be a school governor and on the work the school be do we can talk about the tangible benefit but the wide point be that young people want we to act on these issue and that be part of have an education system that teach they about the benefit of move towards clean energy when i go into school there be massive enthusiasm for that kind of initiative 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of his department ’s net policy on the manufacturing industry 
 i be delighted that my outing at the dispatch box be to answer a question from my hon friend and on a topic that we have work on so much over the past year we on the labour side know that net be the great economic opportunity of our generation unlike the previous conservative government which allow industry to wither we do not accept that decarbonisation mean deindustrialisation through our modern industrial strategy we be work with business to help it to invest grow and meet our climate ambition 
 i congratulate the minister on his well deserve elevation to the front bench he have work quite hard with the ceramic sector on this issue energy intensive industry such as ceramic be at the mercy of an international gas market over which very few country have direct control but of the thing that could help be look at electricity cost may i therefore encourage the minister in his new role to consider expand eligibility for the supercharger scheme so that energy intensive industry such as ceramic can benefit from the support available until the supercharger scheme come online in 
 my hon friend raise an important point about the scope of the supercharger which we be go to look at in he will be aware that some part of the ceramics supply chain can access the supercharger but i too be concerned about the impact of high energy cost on the ceramics sector i will meet the head of ceramics uk this month i be chair a meeting of the energy intensive users group and i look forward to further engagement with the sector in the new year 
 i welcome the minister to his place talk about industry the lindsey oil refinery in lincolnshire be in receivership and be currently be sell but thousand and thousand   of job be at risk and the worker there be desperately concerned that the department for energy security and net and the official receiver be not run a proper process frustrating potential bidder for the whole site will the minister in his new job commit to help ensure that the whole site be sell to a successful bidder 
 the hon member say that thousand and thousand of job be at risk in this country they be at risk from the climate deny policy of reform the institution of chemical engineers report last week that there be job in the green economy in this country thousand and thousand in the constituency of every single member in this house and the hon member ’s party be put that investment at risk 
 i call the shadow minister 
 how many job have to be sacrifice on the altar of this secretary of state ’s vainglorious eco zealotry before the government acknowledge the utter destruction of the uk ’s industrial base that be be wreak by policy drive by an out of touch green lobby that have capture what be laughably still call the department for energy security 
 it be no wonder that there be so much laughter around the chamber because the policy of the previous conservative government see industry decline they be prepared to let industry decline because fundamentally they do not believe in industry and now we find that they do not believe in climate science we on this side of the house know that we can achieve decarbonisation in this country by win investment from industry investment that be come in from all around the world our policy be give industry the confidence to invest in create job here in the uk 
 on their watch oil refinery have close in just year with jim ratcliffe warn of a job loss to come thousand be be lay off in the north sea as company divest themselves of asset and investment dry up factory be close and plant be shut down it be no wonder that the head of unite the union be call for the secretary of state to be sack we know that the prime minister try to do that but fail so short of that will they instead consider our plan which would save industry and job scrap the climate change act scrap the levy scrap the windfall tax and put cheap energy 
 i would like to thank the minister for remind the house of the litany of error that we have to pick up when we come into office my portfolio be fill with company that have struggle so much over the past year but those company now find that they have a partner in government who will work with they to attract the investment to build job in the uk if the opposition do not like those job they can continue as they be 
 what step he be take to improve grid infrastructure 
 we be build a resilient grid for the future after decade of under investment we be halve the development time for new transmission infrastructure include through reform to planning regulation and supply chain and deliver the grid capacity need to deliver clean power by and the economic growth that this country need 
 in january when storm éowyn hit the uk hundred of thousand of people across scotland be without power for several day that include thousand of my constituent in rural village such as oakley and blairhall and a number be reliant on power for critical medical equipment engineer perform heroic work to restore power as quickly as possible but that be delay by outdated grid infrastructure as the new winter storm season have already begin this year what step be the minister and the department take to ensure the future reliance of the grid to withstand worsen storm how can that be do to protect vulnerable people in my constituency and across the uk 
 my hon friend ask an incredibly important question i would like to thank all the engineer and customer service staff who work through the recent storm amy to ensure that people be reconnecte as quickly as possible include in some incredibly difficult circumstance they do a fantastic job we be try to ensure that the uk ’s grid remain as resilient as possible that require investment and those who oppose the building of new infrastructure to improve our grid ’s resilience will need to explain to their constituent why they want they to be much more at risk of disconnection in those storm 
 secondly these storm be become more common because climate change be impact all our life the answer be to move more quickly towards clean power and to recognise that climate change be a problem not to bury our head in the sand and fail to deliver the necessary investment 
 proposal for mile of pylon from grimsby to walpole in my constituency would have a major detrimental impact on rural area due to the scale of the infrastructure the loss of high quality farmland and the proximity of the infrastructure to home do the minister understand i do not think he do why local people say no to pylon will he get national grid to look properly at undergrounding or offshore to reduce the impact on these community and ensure that if the proposal do go ahead community be properly compensate 
 i could not have organise that well if i have try immediately after i say if you be against grid infrastructure you be against economic growth up pop the hon gentleman to make exactly that point his party be against build the future of this country and we be not go to follow that path at all decade of under investment have lead to the issue   we face today they hold back economic growth across the country this infrastructure have to be build somewhere we be determined that community benefit from that by introduce what the previous government fail to do community benefit for the community who be host the infrastructure 
 i call the shadow minister 
 on grid infrastructure the chinese wind turbine manufacturer ming yang have say that it be look to set up a wind turbine factory in scotland our security service have warn we about the risk of chinese state sponsor hacker try to infiltrate and destroy energy system in the west and hide kill switch have be find in chinese solar installation technology in the united states can the minister provide the house with a very clear assurance that neither ming yang nor the chinese state will be able to remotely control our energy infrastructure yes or no 
 i will take no lesson from the party that bring chinese investor right into build our nuclear power station this government be deliver a nuclear power station with british government funding not chinese funding so i will take no lesson from the conservatives on that many company want to come and invest in the uk and we absolutely welcome investment into this country but every single decision and investment obviously have to pass stringent national security test i will not engage right now in what those test will be but we will say very clearly that no decision we make will ever compromise our national security 
 what step he be take to ensure the forthcoming carbon budget delivery plan include measure to financially support people on low and middle income 
 welcome minister 
 thank you mr speaker i thank the hon lady for her continued advocacy on this agenda i have enjoy work with she from the back benches and hope to continue to do so in this new post i be excited to share with she and the whole house the carbon budget growth and delivery plan later this month what i can say now be that ensure that low and middle income family can benefit from the energy transition be absolutely central to our mission it be why we be roll out the big home upgrade scheme in a generation and why we be move away from expensive fossil fuel towards cheap clean british power in home and community across our country 
 i welcome the minister to her new position and thank she for her answer i know how much she will want the new carbon budget delivery plan to reflect the scale of ambition require while ensure that the poor be not ask to pay the price and also to signal that it be an absolute priority across government can she assure we that the new plan will not just be slip out but will be launch properly and crucially with the prime minister 
 it be slightly above my pay grade to determine the prime minister ’s diary but i can assure the hon lady that we will proudly launch the carbon budget growth and delivery plan later this month 
 what step he be take to increase co operation with other country to tackle climate change 
 what discussion he have have with his international counterpart on tackle climate change 
 in the good tradition of the uk we see it as our duty to work with other country to tackle the climate crisis and protect future generation it be british leadership that see the climate change act emulate in country across the world and it be the leadership of the uk at cop26 that now see of global gdp cover by net we will maintain that tradition of leadership into cop30 in brazil and beyond 
 the amazon rainforest be the lung of the earth but it be gasp for breath i be pleased that cop30 will be in the heart of the amazon ella a school student from my constituency would like to know what step the government will be take to stop deforestation and back nature base solution on behalf of ella may i urge the secretary of state to go as far as possible and do all he can 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and ella for her interest in and enthusiasm for this incredibly important issue deforestation be a terrible thing for the planet but it be also terrible for the people who be affect the indigenous people who live in the forest nature base solution and solution that put indigenous people at the centre make a huge difference this be a cop in the forest and i think the brazilian presidency deserve congratulation on that emphasis it be develop a number of initiative include the so call tfff the tropical forest forever facility to finance the prevention of deforestation and we be work with it on that 
 young people in my constituency of wolverhampton west be particularly concerned about protect the environment and the future of our planet i have be contact by student at wolverhampton girl high school and st edmund ’s catholic academy and recently i be proud to attend a climate justice art exhibition prepare by pupil at st teresa ’s catholic primary academy what step be we take to encourage international awareness of the danger of global warming and the need to recycle and limit plastic waste thereby also reduce marine pollution 
 plastic waste be something that my colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs work on i think my hon friend ’s wide point be important there be a global context to this and sometimes that context might not actually be as it appear which be that when we look across the   world we see that country be still act on these issue why because they recognise that it be in their national interest economically and in the long term for future generation there be no future if people bury their head in the sand and say we ’re not go to act 
 cop30 begin next month in brazil the uk must play a lead role on the world stage to tackle climate change at home however somerset council be hamper in its attempt to achieve net by an escalate financial crisis follow the maladministration of its previous conservative administration what step will the minister and cabinet colleague take to support council in their net transition 
 part of what we be do be devolve more of the funding around warm home for example so that local authority can play a lead role i congratulate local authority on the interest that they be take in this the hon lady raise the wide picture of cop30 which be important this be a crucial moment the uk have already show leadership in the past month include by publish our nationally determine contribution at cop29 last year 
 i thank the secretary of state very much for his answer the fact be that we be all in this together we must understand that world country have a role to play just as the united kingdom do but we be the rich country i be conscious that it may not always be financially possible for world country to do the thing that we ask they to so what assistance can we give they to ensure that when we approach the task of do this together we actually achieve it together 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s question part of the answer here be that the economic have change so get private finance into develop country can make a massive difference the baku to belém road map be be produce as part of the cop process it be a $ road map and most of that be about private finance we can see across the world the effect of private finance in develop country in pakistan for example solar have go from play almost no part in its electricity system to be the top part of that system in only or year because it be in pakistan ’s economic interest that be what we be see across the world we need the private and public sector to play their role 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the climate change committee ’s report entitle progress in reduce emission 
 i thank my hon friend for repeatedly raise these issue in the house i know that climate change be of huge concern to she and her constituent i be proud that britain have lead the way with our independent committee on climate change   establish under the climate change act which have work effectively for nearly decade under leadership from labour and the conservatives i sincerely hope that we can re establish that consensus we be grateful to the committee for its scientific recommendation to the department obviously it be for the department now to consider they and we will report back on our decision at the end of the month 
 i welcome the minister to her place it be good to see she among the line of man on the treasury bench i have just finish chair a meeting of the housing communities and local government committee issue that we discuss be decent home standard emission from home be another key area that we need to bear down on give the government ’s priority of improve minimum energy performance certificate standard by i appreciate that the minister have be in post for only a few week but what discussion have she have with colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that the private rented sector database will contain information on epc rating so that all our resident can live in warm secure and safe home 
 home and home standard be absolutely key to decarbonisation for a variety of reason include the health benefit for resident we will consult on the warm home plan and the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for inverclyde and renfrewshire west martin mccluskey speak about the warm home discount early we be work with mhclg on bring forward the future home standard 
 a major gap in our ability to make progress in reduce emission be the disconnect both literally and figuratively between small renewable energy scheme and the community in which they be situate i think in particular of the coniston hydro scheme which face resilience and sustainability issue relate to the removal of rock be the answer to this not the creation of local energy market to reduce the gap between service user and energy producer will the government back the urgent delivery of p441 to make local energy market a reality save coniston hydro scheme and service the local community 
 in this role there be a lot of acronym i have to say that i do not know p441 until i sit on this bench but i understand from my colleague that we be look into that we support local community project and we will be look at that project and will come back to the hon member on p441 
 what step his department be take to support brewery to reduce carbon emission 
 we want to make sure that business benefit from our clean energy mission especially those in vital industry such as brew our forthcoming carbon budget and growth   delivery plan and our refreshed industrial decarbonisation strategy will help to provide further clarity for such business include on how we intend to support they to electrify 
 of the many brand of woking base asahi be cornish orchards which have recently decarbonise and cut its emission by by invest in renewable energy do the minister agree that that be exactly the sort of innovation we need what further step will his department take to ensure that the brewing industry can decarbonise and use renewable electricity a lot more than it do currently 
 i commend asahi which i know be an important employer in the hon member ’s constituency for its work on decarbonisation and also for be my favourite japanese beer in a previous life i work as a fitter ’s mate in a brewery and i know how difficult it be to decarbonise the process there maybe it be something i should learn more about and i would be very happy to come along to asahi if i be invite 
 what step he be take to support green energy company to build onshore wind turbine 
 the government have publish an onshore wind strategy to remove barrier to help company build more onshore wind with action across several area include planning aviation workforce and route to market 
 the uk be commit to grow our wind energy manufacturing capacity but this require investment in innovation to develop the next generation of product that could be make in the uk use expertise that exist in place like my constituency of isle of wight west can the minister assure i that the government be do everything possible to provide the funding to not only create job but provide sovereign ownership of blade technology and development in the uk so that we become a true energy superpower 
 my hon friend be right to recognise the importance of the industry in his constituency vestas be a key part of the uk ’s wind supply chain the isle of wight be already a successful centre for wind blade manufacturing and research and development i can assure he that we be do everything we can to work with partner and right across government on the proposal and that include the agreement in principle between vestas and the government to support the factory ’s repurpose to make onshore wind blade save job 
 energy company of any kind whether oil and gas or renewable need certainty to plan to invest whether it be onshore or offshore the government ’s consultation on the north sea ’s energy future close on   april almost month ago and the industry be still await an outcome the only guidance on timing on the government ’s website be to 
 visit this page again soon to download the outcome to this public feedback 
 the ongoing delay be cause huge uncertainty for sector of all type of energy investment can the minister confirm when the outcome of the consultation will be publish with a date or a week not a vague timescale 
 on the substance of the hon member ’s question we launch the future of energy in the north sea consultation with a detailed set of question which we be analyse at the moment we will publish the response to that as soon as possible but i be sure she will understand that we want to make sure we have it absolutely right i have engage with industry to tell it about the timeframe for that throughout the process 
 let i just say thing the hon member talk about uncertainty what could be more uncertain than the leader of the opposition come to aberdeen and talk down the investment in offshore wind hydrogen and carbon capture the very thing that will retain the supply chain in the north east of scotland uncertainty be what the conservative party bring to this

 the government believe that our mission to deliver clean power by be the good way to break our dependence on global fossil fuel market and protect bill payer permanently we recognise that we need to support household struggle with bill while we transition to clean power that be why we be expand the warm home discount to around an additional household 
 i recently visit st bartholomew ’s church in hyde which have serve the resident of winchester for over year as part of its give to go green day which raise £ to support its effort to decarbonise the church and reduce energy bill will the minister join i in congratulate the congregation and the community volunteer for the leadership they be show in this area and will he outline what step the government be take to support faith and community group in decarbonise historic building while preserve their heritage 
 i join the hon gentleman in praise the whole congregation and community at st bartholomew ’s in winchester for support those effort such effort by community and faith group across the country show the support that exist for take the right action not just on clean power but on insulation the warm home plan and other plan that the department will publish before the end of the year will address some of the issue he talk about in respect of historic building 
 carol from harpenden be of many constituent who be worried about energy cost at she stress that she never imagine that she would have to scrimp and save in the way that she do just to get by the warm home discount be a temporary lifeline so will the government commit to long last solution to end fuel poverty include an emergency home upgrade programme that will include incentive to install heat pump that cover real cost 
 we be currently consult on extend the warm home discount beyond i would encourage the hon lady to look at that consultation and feed back her view the warm home plan be the route to some of the action that she have outline and we will be publish it before the end of the year 
 in my constituency of frome and east somerset approximately of household use oil central heating compare with nationally give the high volatility of oil price that place my constituent in a particularly difficult position as we approach the winter month will the minister confirm what measure will be take to ensure that home that be reliant on oil heating can be heat more affordably so that my constituent do not have to suffer unnecessarily 
 since i become a minister week ago i have receive a lot of correspondence on this issue and i be look at it closely we have consult on the issue and hopefully we will be publish the result of that consultation before the end of the month 
 half the battle to reach net be use less energy which be why work to insulate home be so important calder valley be famous for happy valley and now riot women and have occasionally be call wet and windy with of our home fall below energy performance certificate band c that mean many family live in home that leak heat today ’s national audit office report find that in of home that have insulation instal under the last government the work be faulty risk damp and mould what action will this government take to ensure that future insulation effort help family rather than hinder they 
 i share my hon friend ’s concern about the finding in today ’s national audit office report obviously we inherit this situation from the previous government and we be clean up their mess it be important that we have robust protection in place for consumer so that they have confidence when instal these measure the warm home plan will address that include through the consumer protection that we will outline as part of it 
 the cbi say that of the good route to bring down bill and deliver growth be invest in clean power job include the such job that we currently have in tees valley a number that be scale up every year do the secretary of state agree that invest in these industry be of the good way to redevelop our region and to deliver job and growth year into the future 
 i agree with my hon friend hundred of thousand of job will come as a result of our sprint to clean power by not just in his constituency but across the entire country what will not take we to those hundred of thousand of job be the conservative party abandon its commitment to the climate change act from hug a husky to burn the climate change act that be not the transition that we expect 
 i call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party 
 i welcome the new ministers to their place i look forward to work with they and i congratulate the secretary of state and the minister for energy on hold on to their post which we be glad to see 
 of the good way to bring down household bill be to help homeowner and small business make their property cheap to warm and to power the liberal democrats have put forward a plan to do that by introduce a windfall tax on the big bank which have see billion of pound in unexpected profit as a result of the quantitative easing programme by the bank of england more than a decade ago do the secretary of state agree with the liberal democrats that we should instead use those excess profit to fund green affordable loan of up to £ for household and up to £ for business and community group and cut people ’s power bill for good 
 have be in this job for only and half week i be always in the market for good idea whichever part of the house they come from the £ warm home plan will do exactly what the hon lady want we to do safely insulate home and get people to take the action we need they to take to achieve clean power importantly the plan will create home business and property that be warm and affordable power by sustainable clean energy 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since the last oral question in july we have reach a final investment decision for sizewell c create job and surpass the historic milestone of approve enough clean power for home after just month of this government from next month nearly family will receive £ off their energy bill through the warm home discount that be what it mean to deliver on our clean power mission 
 the national energy system operator be currently assess whether tidal range technology can help we meet our clean power mission in fleetwood we have a huge opportunity for a tidal range project which could bring desperately need job and investment will the minister meet i to discuss that opportunity and the outcome of the report to ensure that blackpool north and fleetwood feel the benefit of the government ’s clean power energy mission 
 my hon friend raise the important issue of tidal energy i be very aware of the assessment that neso be conduct obviously our department be work with it on that assessment the minister for energy chair the marine energy taskforce and be happy to meet my hon friend 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the carbon tax on electricity push up the cost of gas wind solar and nuclear in this country it do not need to be there the secretary of state could axe the carbon tax tomorrow to instantly cut bill for every single family in this country why will he not 
 i be afraid that the right hon lady ’s question be economically illiterate and that be put it politely the eu emission trading scheme and the carbon border adjustment mechanism mean that exporter will pay the carbon price in any case quite extraordinarily her policy mean that they would pay it to the eu not to the uk government i do not think that be a very good deal that be why uk business welcome the link proposal that we make include uk steel the cbi make uk and the energy intensive users group 
 the secretary of state be try to conflate emission trading scheme he do not want to talk about the carbon tax on electricity because he have increase it by since the start of the year push up everybody ’s bill in the process he be make electricity more expensive at the same time as tax ban and bribe people into electric car and electric home heating that be totally backwards he be the bad enemy of a decarbonisation agenda in this country our cheap power plan would instantly cut electricity bill by the secretary of state could do so tomorrow what be he wait for 
 dear oh dear i will be honest i think it be sad what have happen to the right hon lady when she be in government for a time she be the great eco champion at cop26 she be tell people follow claire ’s lead be a great eco champion now she have suddenly discover that she be the anti net warrior all it do be show how desperate the conservatives be and the more desperate they become the more irrelevant they become 
 air pollution increase the risk of develop condition include asthma and lung cancer and have be link to thousand of death in london hard work by our mayor sadiq khan have see the level of nitrogen dioxide fall to within legal limit for the time since regulation be introduce in my constituency we want to know that the government be commit to work hard to end that link between air pollution and death so can the secretary of state set out what step he be take to deliver that 
 my hon friend make a really important point and not only about what the mayor have do and the effect it have have on the health of londoners there be a wide point here which be too often overlook about what the shift to renewable and away from fossil fuel can do to help save life and tackle air pollution 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 frighteningly the earth have already reach its climate tipping point link to global warming we be now see warm water coral reef go into irreversible decline which be threaten nature and million of people and their livelihood the climate crisis be a global emergency and need leadership and when britain lead other follow can the secretary of state finally confirm that the prime minister will attend cop30 and lead from the front 
 i will give the answer that be also give by the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for leeds north west katie white which be that the prime minister ’s diary be above my pay grade we will be play a very active part at cop30 the wide point that the hon lady make about tipping point and the recent report be important anyone who look at that report will see where the science be take we and any political party in this house that see that as a reason to then abandon the climate change act as the leader of the opposition have do be anti science and anti young people it be a betrayal of the future 
 come on secretary of state do you not want your own back benchers to ask question 
 we have the vw scandal and now we have dieselgate with multiple manufacturer accuse of fake it and emission up to time the legal limit can minister update we on the department for transport ’s inquiry and promise swift action when it be out 
 i share my hon friend ’s concern regard those report this government be focus on make transport greener include by cut air pollution to improve health and the environment we also need to ensure that people be abide by the rule the responsible body the driver and vehicle standards agency be pursue the potential diesel emission non compliance use its procedure and the tool available official at the dft have assure i that the finding from these investigation will be publish in a timely and appropriate manner as an impatient politician i can assure she that i will continue to press for a prompt and thorough interpretation of timely 
 accord to the national audit office some of the home fit with external wall insulation under government scheme in recent year now need urgent repair to correct fault that lead directly to damp and mould what plan do the secretary of state have to remediate those affected property and what do he have to say to the resident of surrey heath living today in fuel poverty to give they confidence 
 order climate change will have happen before you conclude 
 let i be absolutely clear no family should ever have have to go through this it happen because of the systematic   failing of the system put in place by the previous government and we be clean up their mess we will do that at no cost to consumer and i be happy to meet the hon member to discuss any case that he might have in his constituency 
 in his letter to gb energy ’s ceo last month outline his strategic priority the secretary of state rightly state that reindustrialise our industrial heartland 
 with good job and strong trade union representation 
 go hand in hand with tackle the climate crisis will he take the opportunity to reiterate that our investment in tackle the climate crisis and produce clean energy will deliver secure long term employment and will be to the benefit of work people in airdrie and shotts and across the uk 
 yes i will my hon friend make an important point about the role of trade union in the renewable industry too 
 the hundred of worker at lindsey oil refinery will have note that in response to an early question the minister do not attempt to respond on the future of the refinery at least investor be look to take over the whole site if they prove satisfactory can the minister assure i that the government will back the project 
 i be happy to have further conversation with the hon gentleman i know that the refinery be in his constituency and that he care deeply about it a process be under way lead by the official receiver because it be an insolvency process it be consider a number of bid to make sure they be viable and will conclude in the come week so that there be certainty for the workforce we have say throughout that we want to support as much investment in that site as possible 
 ofgem ’s late price cap rise mean high bill for million of household this winter with the average annual cost now over £ for family who be already struggle even a small increase can push they into hardship while the expansion of the warm home discount to more than home be welcome standing charge have also rise and energy debt now exceed £ can the minister outline what far target protection be plan for vulnerable household this winter more broadly what be the government ’s plan to bring down bill especially for those on low income 
 as the minister for energy consumers i be totally focused on how we bring bill down ofgem have already release information about how it will be provide a low stand charge tariff from january we will also publish the warm home plan before the end of the year the warm home discount which i encourage my hon friend to encourage her constituent to apply for be provide additional support to household 
 this week a conservation charity have indicate that the creep of wind farm in scotland—17 tree have be cut down to provide for they be destroy the highland while in england of prime agricultural land be to be use for renewable energy project at a time when we produce only of our food do the secretary of state not recognise that his policy be destroy tourist area will make we more dependent on foreign import for food and will put up electricity price 
 there be a decade disagreement between the right hon gentleman and i on these issue the big threat to the countryside be the climate crisis that be why this government be tackle it 
 while the leader of the opposition be rubbish contract for difference and call for they to be scrap the government be get on with the job of increase renewable energy generate energy security and deliver job across the country will the minister reaffirm his support for contract for difference and will he seek to work with industry to provide long term clarity by set out a timescale for the future auction round 
 my hon friend be absolutely right allocation round deliver a record number of renewable project and the job and investment that go with they will deliver job in constituency throughout the country include her we have reform the scheme to ensure that allocation round be a success at a good price for consumer and also that it deliver not only value for money but the clarity and investment for renewable project that be essential to our energy security and to future investment 
 will the minister confirm that there be now a timetable to ensure that everyone who have a radio teleswitch meter will have it replace without lose their electricity heating or hot water 
 since take up my post week ago i have be deal with the issue of radio teleswitch i be more than happy to meet the right hon member to discuss the plan and will soon be organise a roundtable with member on both side of the house to discuss they far 
 before we start the statement i want to say a few word about our former colleague lord campbell of pittenweem well know to we as ming who die during the conference recess 
 ming be universally like and respect across the house regardless of people ’s party allegiance unflappable kind principle incredibly active and hold in great esteem by all party ming achieve success as an olympian as a lawyer and as a formidable politician in both houses of parliament as well as leadership of the liberal democrats he be of westminster ’s most authoritative voice on foreign affair particularly in articulate his party ’s opposition to the invasion of iraq in 
 on a personal level ming be a loyal friend to i and to my family he serve with my father on the trade and industry committee where they conduct many inquiry most notably into the iraq supergun affair the often vent their frustration about the thwarting of their effort to get ministers official or even fellow member to appear before their committee but despite that they pursue the inquiry fearlessly in order to get to the truth some thing have never change 
 i know that ming be hit especially hard by the death of his wife elspeth they be of course marry for more than year courage wisdom and integrity be ming ’s hallmark we have lose a dear colleague and for many of we a wonderful friend our thought be with ming ’s family his friend and his ally across the political party 
 on a point of order mr speaker may i thank you for that generous tribute to our dear friend ming 
 i want to let the house into a secret about ming campbell he be obsess with sport as might expect from someone who be the captain of the scottish man ’s team at the commonwealth game i remember he talk about how he have be captivate by the london olympics at the age of listen to it on the radio with his mother and how he have decide back then that he want to run at a future olympic game it be a dream of so many young boy and girl but ming thank to his determination drive and work ethic actually make it happen he represent our country at the tokyo game in 
 for a man once know as the flying scotsman who set a new british metre record at second and who be probably the fast person ever elect to this house ming be never to brag about his sporting accomplishment in fact he be such a gentleman and so averse to boastfulness that it could be hard to get he to talk about they at all i remember when wayne rooney break a metatarsal in his foot ahead of the world cup ming have tell we a story about how he have suffer an injury before the olympic game and how hard he have work to overcome it we be all beg he to go on the radio tell that story and encourage wayne rooney a rare chance for the liberal democrat leader to break into the big sport story of the day but ming would not do it i have to admit that   it be frustrating at the time but it be also a mark of why he be so respected and admire that level of modesty be rare in anyone especially in a politician but those of we who know ming know that it be simply the kind of man that he be 
 it say a lot about ming ’s many and varied accomplishment that his extraordinary sporting achievement be britain ’s fast man and represent his country at the olympics will not be what he be most remember for nor will he be most remember for his law career though he excel at that too he be even offer the chance to become a judge on scotland ’s high court in but he turn it down because by then as he put it politic have get into his blood and so what ming will be most remember for be his enormous contribution to british politic a parliamentary career span decade include year represent north east fife 
 i get to know ming early during his parliament when i be the party ’s economic adviser base in our whips office even then he already have so much gravita he be so charming so thoughtful and so respected ming be among those few mp who be genuinely grandee from the day they be elect but his calmness reasonableness and intense decency mask a radical politician a man who never forget his root after grow up in a glasgow tenement and who be drive by a deep commitment to social justice he say it be his role and the role of the liberal democrats to rattle the cage of british politic and he do especially as you say mr speaker when it come to foreign affair and defence on which he lead for our party for over year include of course in the lead up to and after the iraq war 
 i remember how difficult a decision it be for we to oppose that war it feel like we be not just go against the government but take on the full might of the british state and the united states too the way ming tackle it with his typically steady forensic and lawyerly approach give we both the confidence and resolve to speak up strongly for what we believe he make our position firmly rooted in respect for international law at a time when the world be in turmoil follow the horrific terrorist attack of   september ming provide principle leadership with his trademark combination of morality courage and wisdom and he continue to do so whether as leader of our party as a respected member of the intelligence and security committee and of the foreign affairs committee or in the other place 
 i benefit greatly from ming ’s advice and guidance over more than year and turn to he often about foreign affair in my own time as leader i will miss his wise counsel as i know many of we will but more than that he be an incredibly warm and caring friend a colleague with such generosity and humour he call his late wife elspeth his rock and she be always by his side mostly with a cigarette they be such good fun and such great company 
 it be once say of ming that he 
 run the risk of give politician a good name 
 well he certainly do that his passing be a moment for we to consider how we be all view as politician and what change we could make both individually and collectively to further the cause of good decent hopeful politic something that ming embody entirely 
 ming campbell be a dedicated public servant a tireless champion for fife st andrews and the united kingdom and a true liberal giant i know all of we in the liberal democrat family and across this house will miss he terribly 
 far to that point of order mr speaker everyone in this house know what an honour it be to represent our country but for most of we that appreciation come from the rather sedentary position on these bench not from the international running track where lord campbell of pittenweem represent great britain at the olympic game in tokyo in he remain quick on his foot as a barrister before become an mp where i be tell he make the most of his talent by sprint door to door while canvass ultimately of course he become a respected voice on foreign and defence affair become leader of the liberal democrats this be despite many overture from of my predecessor his old glasgow university friend john smith to join the labour party as a young man no ming as many come to know he be determine and he know his own mind 
 ming campbell be authoritative on the subject that he be passionate about so it be no wonder that he have the respect and admiration of colleague across the house who recognise his wisdom and unfailing kindness over year of service as a member of this parliament today we remember his commitment to scotland and in particular of course to fife champion its industry from fish to in his case fly as well as become chancellor of the university of st andrews where he speak of his joy at meet student and young people full of hope for the future a future he have do so much to shape it be a full life well live alongside elspeth his beloved wife of more than year we be all enrich by his sense of duty and commitment to this country he stand in the fine tradition of this house so it be a privilege on behalf of the labour benches to pay tribute to the flying scotsman may he rest in peace 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 far to that point of order mr speaker on behalf of the conservative party i would like to add my voice to the tribute pay today to lord campbell i have the pleasure of meeting sir ming campbell as he be then just once backstage before any questions?”—and he be very courteous very curious and very earnest we all know how well respected he be across this house not least because of the effort he make to work cross party especially on international matter he be a man with a clear sense of right and wrong commit to do the right thing even when it be difficult or unpopular so i very much hope that his legacy of careful thought integrity and public service endure on behalf of myself and my party i extend heartfelt condolence to sir ming ’s family his party and all those who know he and love he 
 far to that point of order mr speaker for those of we on all side who be here during the debate on the iraq   war i want to thank ming for the legal advice that he provide and the way that he address that debate because he do so without seek any party advantage he simply set out the legal principle on which he be make his decision and he do so with compassion and with the recognition of the moral duty that we all have many of we agree with he and vote with he and many do not but everybody respect his judgment as a result i believe he be a model mp always speak and vote on the basis of his conscience and the interest of his constituency and the country overall he will be greatly miss but i think his lesson will remain with many of we throughout our own parliamentary career 
 i call the father of the house 
 far to that point of order mr speaker as a conservative i want to join our liberal friend in pay tribute to such a gallant and charming gentleman his least successful period in this house be probably as leader of his party perhaps he be just too nice perhaps he could see both side of the question but what a great man and what a great foreign affair spokesman follow on from   the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell the whole episode of the iraq war be so difficult for we in this house particularly for those of we who break with our party to oppose it he give we leadership and rigour and he have be prove right of course there be no prize for be prove right but history will prove he right 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i stand here as a friend of ming ’s but also as the current representative of his seat i know how much he feel the privilege of be elect to this house for year as the representative for north east fife i also know the very high regard in which he be hold in the constituency all i have have both myself and the msp for the constituency willie rennie who be previously a member of this place be very kind thought from constituent and story about ming that we have take to our heart 
 he stand for parliament in greenock in greenock be my hometown i be quite reassure when i be engage with ming that we at least have something in common what the prime minister say be right he have the opportunity to switch to other party but he choose not to although he stand in it take until before he be elect in north east fife that show the spirit and determination he have as an individual but also the work he do to build the constituency and build the local party 
 i have have lot of thought from the local party too of they i think would be worth share with the house shortly after his election which be a close contest against the sit conservative mp they decide to take a celebratory boat trip out to the isle of may to see the puffin unfortunately the boat break down on the way ming and elspeth keep everybody calm it be interesting that even people who do not vote for he come out and rescue the boat laughter that be the respect with which he be regard 
 in his tribute my constituency colleague willie rennie say that ming have have career politic law and obviously sport he be a parliamentarian he be a   kc he be an olympian and he be a companion of honour if any of we can aspire to the great height that ming reach that be worth aspire to the prime minister also mention his chancellorship of the university of st andrews which he hold for year i know that those at the university be very sad at his loss and passing indeed my right hon friend   the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey   and i visit the university last week to meet they and discuss ming 
 i will finish with some personal memory he be a great support to i but i do remember when i be run for the selection in that there be a constituency lunch in north east fife of the member who be supportive of my candidacy make sure that i be sit at the same table as elspeth because i be assure that if i could get elspeth onside ming would surely follow since i be elect we would meet every so often every month we would have a cup of tea and a scone in the pugin room and he would tell i all the thing that i need to be do the secretary of state for defence be not here but ming would always ask i right up until the last time i see he about leuchars and what the strategic defence review mean and talk about how important defence be for he and the constituency 
 there be no doubt that the loss of elspeth be devastating and he be never quite the same i think everybody would accept that when we see he here but really up until those last week he although very frail be absolutely still there and we have many great conversation i see he just the week before he die and it do feel like a goodbye conversation i know that he will be much miss across this house and i be very grateful for all the tribute that have be pay to he 
 hear hear 
 far to that point of order mr speaker ming campbell be a good friend of mine there be a body call the nato parliamentary assembly which have not be mention yet today ming campbell be a member for over year only really pause when he become leader of the liberal democrats when i join that body in the respect with which ming campbell be regard across the entire alliance indeed by so many partner country almost across the world become apparent almost immediately it do not matter if we be meet president prime ministers or even royal family ming would come into the room and greet say the king of spain in the same way he would greet somebody in the tea room and the respect shine through 
 i remember very clearly when he be the chairman of several of the assembly ’s committee sometimes ally in those committee maybe do not quite see eye to eye and get into some really heated argument ming simply hit the table and say enough and the silence fall that be the level of respect he have during the coalition year he be able to be appoint as leader of the united kingdom delegation to the assembly when i have the honour of take on that role i do not think many week pass when i do not call ming on his mobile phone and say ming i need some advice on this difficult situation that be especially true during the covid year when we be try to work out how   we be go to make the annual and spring assemblies work online ming be always there with sage advice on how to lead our delegation 
 thing that be true about serve on an international body be that we spend an awful lot of time in airport especially when flight be delay ming always have a story and they be genuinely fascinating his legal career have be mention there be particular story that i like because it show his quick wit and his ability to move swiftly on his foot which be an important ability for a kc he say he have be prosecute a defendant charge with cause affray and drunken disorderly behaviour he put the question how much have you drunk apparently the defendant say oh only or pint he pause and say be you mean to tell this court that you drink a gallon of beer and you do not consider that to be very much he say that at that point he know he have he he would tell so many story he be very proud of his time in san francisco where he train to be a top sprinter he say academically it do not go quite as well as it should have do i think i just spend far too much time at the track 
 he be as i have say enormously respect across the world he be a great friend to i and a great sage his politic be clear but his party allegiance do not matter when it come to important role of state and the intellectual rigour that have to be bring to important issue i will miss he and i know a great number of people in this house will miss he he truly be a giant of british politic 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i have the distinction of succeed ming campbell in this place he probably be not unhappy that i be not his current successor he speak so highly of his current successor but i have to say how highly i think of he i have hear so many nice story today about his role globally but as   the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain   reflect so beautifully more important than that be that he be so highly regard locally when i take over from he it be difficult to go to any of the community in his constituency where there be not a story or somebody who have be help and at the university of st andrews he be an outstanding chancellor and colleague i want to pay tribute to somebody who i may not have agree with but when we have that precious relationship between a constituency and the member of parliament nobody well replicate that in his day to day work i want to pay tribute to a european and an internationalist but more than that an outstanding local representative 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i wish to add my word of tribute to my friend ming campbell he have an impact on i long before i meet he the general election i be active in be no offence to any other liberal mp at the time none of they be present here but i be very impressed with ming campbell he strike i as not be like other liberal mps he look like he could actually run the country laughter he have gravita i be pretty sure that be what i say to my mother in the early hour of i think   june when he gain north east fife from the   conservatives you look the real deal you look incredibly competent and of course in the year that follow he demonstrate that 
 we have talk about the iraq war what ming campbell do yes apply his legal expertise and insight into international law as well as the law of this land be to make the connection in what be often think of as the esoteric business of human right that human right be about human duty they be about make sure that nobody be above the law no prime minister and no president he make that clear and make it crossover into public consciousness in a way that be really very remarkable 
 i then realise i have a connection with ming when i meet my wife rosie in the 90 it turn out that she now sadly late father mark cantley open the bowling with ming at glasgow hillhead they have not speak to each other for odd year until ming come to do a talk at the university at ambleside shortly after i have be select and the of they continue a friendship until mark ’s pass just year ago 
 in the year i be elect the late great charles kennedy be mean to be do the constituency visit to westmorland but his son be bear the night before ming get draft in at the last minute and do visit for i when you win by vote every single thing count so i have he to thank for that 
 when ming become leader in i have the honour of serve as his parliamentary private secretary what insight do i get during that time he be obsess with sport and run and despite the fact that this be a man who could run metre in second he be incredibly generous in hear the story of somebody who be a rate fall runner 
 in my time as leader ming be a great source of advice and wisdom after that time he and his wife elspeth who we have mention would regularly go on holiday in ullswater and they would always make a point of do a visit in westmorland whether we ask they or not laughter my recollection be of ming talk to the local newspaper or tv station and elspeth with not simply a fag but a pink cigarette holder look every bit a real life lady penelope from the thunderbirds 
 of our predecessor the late great jo grimond once say that the good liberal candidate should dress to the right and talk to the left ming campbell bear all the air of an establishment figure and be a radical to his die breath he be kind wise decent talented and loyal he be my friend and i miss he 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i would like to state that sir ming campbell as he then be be the perfect example of how it be possible to disagree with another parliamentarian on a key issue and yet work side by side on other issue without any rancour or reservation 
 my dealing with ming do not get off to the good start as we be generally on opposite side of a debate about the replacement of trident submarine and the replacement of continuous at sea deterrence by part time patrol nevertheless once we get to know each other well on the intelligence and security committee we   find ourselves make common cause on such issue as the safeguarding of the vital bbc monitoring service for the future the need to enhance spending on defence with an improved defence budgeting priority and above all the folly that could have happen of britain intervene militarily in the syrian civil war 
 in short ming bring courtesy style courage and grace to public life to the benefit of society as a whole 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i would also like to pay tribute to ming campbell whom i meet personally in later year but whose political influence have hang over my entire adult life 
 as an year old student at the university of glasgow i hear about these great figure of british politic who have study together and be great friend donald dewar who become the minister of scotland john smith whose legacy as leader of the labour party be well respect and of course ming campbell i find that his persona his influence his attitude to politic and his integrity influence i it be of the thing that pull i towards the liberal party as it then be 
 the time i come across ming personally be year later about a year after he have step down as leader when i make my maiden speech to the scottish conference i discover that i be speak on a motion propose by ming campbell which be of course this will come as no surprise to many about raf leuchars its future and what we need to do to defend it that be a thread that run through 
 in when i be stand in edinburgh west ming come to launch my campaign in fact he help i up on to a chair so that everybody could see i he be there to be supportive i learn a lot about his kindness and thoughtfulness a few week later when my husband die and ming take the time to take i aside and make sure i be okay and that i have the support i need to get through the campaign 
 most of all though i enjoy my chat with ming on a monday in the departure lounge at edinburgh airport he always have a tale to tell and he always have a kind word about my column in the scotsman my team in the office be endlessly amuse by how pleased i be that ming campbell have even read my column never mind agree with it 
 ming be in many way with the integrity kindness and thoughtfulness that everyone have speak about an example that we should all aspire to and try to live up to there be a certain restaurant in pimlico which i be sure my colleague be aware of that many of we be introduce to by ming campbell i be sure we think of he every time we go there as i think we will the next time we go we may make a point of go there and raise a glass to someone who be an example not just of what we should be but perhaps of what the world need now more than ever among its politician 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i think it be appropriate that on behalf of the democratic unionist party and indeed on behalf of all northern ireland parliamentarian i extend our condolence to the liberal democrats and to the colleague who know mr campbell well than i do i come across sir ming when i be at school   and he become leader of his party when i be at university it be not his prowess his intelligence or his ability to launch an argument that strike i but his name ming i know of no other mings than ming the merciless laughter]—and yet we get to know ming the merciful we get to know ming the politician who stand and achieve the respect of colleague right across this house he be a sincere unionist an avow scot and a true parliamentarian i would like to take this moment to pass on our respect for his life and pay tribute to his legacy 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i be sure that ming would have be delighted with the tribute pay to he today by the prime minister my right hon friend   the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey   and many other just as importantly i think elspeth would have be equally delighted she would have be raise a glass of champagne in celebration 
 ming be remember as a brilliant and successful athlete and an accomplished distinguished advocate he be a real fixture in this house utterly authoritative on foreign policy and defence matter for more than decade less well remember be the fact that it take he election and a decade to be elect to represent fife a seat he then hold for year he be therefore sympathetic and hugely supportive of my similarly numerous effort to win in wokingham for all that patrician charm he deploy to win over judge in court he be also a savvy street campaigner his opponent underestimate at their peril on of his many visit to wokingham a local journalist ask he why he visit so often he reply i have invest so much in this young man”—it be only year ago!—“that i be determined to see he succeed he be delighted when that investment pay off last july 
 ming be very generous with his time and his advice he be a warm and generous friend to i and my family to many colleague and to the many many friend he make in wokingham along the way he will be fondly remember by everybody who know he well and by wide agreement as be probably of the nice people to ever lead a political party in the uk 
 far to that point of order mr speaker it be an honour to follow the tribute of so many across the house ming campbell be an inspiration to i and to many other who admire his integrity courtesy and tenacity i be lucky to have know ming all my life and i know how much his death will be feel by his family and the many friend who love he i share their grief 
 ming ’s athletic achievement show a man determined to work hard and make sacrifice to push himself to the limit his international success have already be mention but i remember he in his mid-40 at that point say with some feeling that the annual school sport day have become a major focus since he be the the other dad want to beat in the father race behind that gracious façade be a true competitor 
 ming be of that remarkable generation of glasgow university debater from all party who strove for a well society across a lifetime in politic he maintain close friendship with those of other party yet he be clear on his politic ming ’s tenacity be show in his dedication to scottish liberalism work hard to win the north east fife seat at his general election 
 ming serve our party for many year as foreign affair spokesperson with his distinctive eloquent delivery and his disarm courtesy ming could easily be underestimate by some as an orator not an actor yet his principled approach to the iraq war demonstrate his courage and steel he do not shirk from do the right thing for ming international liberalism be not an abstract ideal but a set of practical moral obligation 
 as we say goodbye to a much love parliamentarian we also remember a private man ming ’s marriage to elspeth be the anchor of his life the last time i see ming he speak with love and feel about elspeth he be continue his life ’s work in parliament but it be clear he feel acutely that he be continue it without his life partner theirs be a truly devoted partnership 
 ming campbell live an incredible life as an athlete advocate political leader and love husband he be a lifelong liberal whose principle drive his choice he be rightly remember with admiration and affection today across the house he will be sorely miss 
 before i update the house on the peace process in the middle east and my trade visit to india i want to put on record my utter condemnation of the vile antisemitic terrorist attack at the heaton park synagogue in manchester which kill jewish man adrian daulby and melvin cravitz 
 antisemitism be not a new hatred here in britain jews have have to deal with the shameful reality that their building their way of life and their child need extra protection we must also be crystal clear that while this be an attack on jews because they be jews the islamist extremism that motivate this sick individual be a threat to every citizen of this country it be an attack on british value british security and the british decency that hold our community together 
 moreover we can see clearly that antisemitism be on the rise in britain once again we will scale up the protection we provide for jewish people we will set out new measure to prevent hatred abuse the democratic right to protest we will stop at nothing to root out antisemitism the same apply to the arson attack on the peacehaven mosque an attack on british muslims be also an attack on we all so we condemn this despicable crime and the poison of anti muslim hatred we will fight against hate in all its form 
 i now turn to the middle east and to word i have long to say in this house for a very long time the survive hostage be free the bombardment of gaza have stop and desperately need aid be start to enter as a result of the peace plan lead by president trump we have the chance it be a chance to bring a terrible chapter in history finally to a close it be a moment of profound relief for the house this nation and indeed the whole world but it be temper of course by the knowledge that for the hostage and their family the love one of those kill on   october   and the innocent civilian in gaza the dead the bereaved the starving this have be year of live hell
