i think the climate change committee be actually say that its most ambitious scenario which we should be aim for be for we to cut the use of gas by be we go to carry on use north sea oil and gas the question for the hon gentleman and for the whole house be this do we choose for the future to carry on drill every last drop that be the government ’s policy in contravention of all the scientific advice which be that we will end up in a ° world need billion of pound of taxpayer subsidy to bring about that investment through persuasion and divert investment from the private sector personally i do not think that that be the right choice 
 the lesson of this crisis be that the government should have learn and that other country around the world have learn the only way to get energy security be to sprint for clean power that be why the government ’s onshore wind ban be such a disaster that be why their offshore wind auction be such a disaster that be why their energy efficiency failure be such a disaster this bill neither protect we on price nor give we energy security 
 here be the thing the bill be not motivate by million of people lie awake at night worry about the cost of living crisis it be motivate by a prime minister lie awake at night worry about the conservative party crisis the interesting thing be that this bill be plan well before   the right hon member for east surrey claire coutinho   become energy secretary it be the last desperate throw of the dice by what we might call the no galaxy brain to use climate change as what they call a wedge issue they say this to the newspaper all the time series of this new strategy be air in september when the party of churchill and thatcher become the peddler of wacky conspiracy theory they find on the internet abolish the mythical bin end the imaginary threat of compulsory car sharing say no to invent conspiracy theory on minute city and fight the fictional meat tax and now we have a sequel no long a few throw away conspiracy theory this be now the central strategy of their legislative programme 
 member should not take my word for it it be what the prime minister ’s adviser brief to the paper day after day paper i read on monday report that the prime minister want to weaponise climate change   as a wedge issue where the british people see an energy crisis force up their bill the government see a wedge issue where the british people ask how they can have liveable town and city with good transport the government see a wedge issue where the british people worry about the effect of the climate crisis on their kid and grandkid the government see a wedge issue the point be that the government can not really deny it because they know this be what they be say every day we think there be a big opportunity for the conservative party to try to create division on climate change that be why the prime minister use word like eco zealot it be all very transparent they be lock in the boot of a strategy whether they agree with it or not that be what be happen 
 certainly and i will come on to just how much funding have be make available i draw the hon gentleman ’s attention to the national lottery heritage fund which have provide £ recently to a couple of project moreover the department for levelling up housing and communities through levelling up funding have provide more than £ to another couple of project that be perhaps an area that my hon friend could also look into i know very well that he have previously be incredibly successful in secure level up funding as a champion of the morecambe eden project i understand that £ have be raise through the levelling up project in his area so i be well aware of his capability in that field 
 in response to   the hon member for reading east matt rodda let i say that i would be delighted to look into funding opportunity specifically around access i will write to he about that because i be not familiar with what might be available at this time 
 on the wide funding for canal and inland waterway we know because my hon friend have just explain how important these national heritage asset be provide many public benefit i be also fully aware of how important it be to have access to water and green space for our physical health and mental wellbeing not to mention the benefit that they provide for nature those benefit be set out in our environmental improvement plan halt the decline of nature by and increase its abundance thereafter be the apex priority follow the environment act canal and waterway river lake coastal area and stream be fundamental to that people enjoy be by canal and waterway and use they for leisure and recreation as well as in the case of canal for their historical value they form an important part of our natural environment by provide the green corridor along which biodiversity can flourish as well as contribute to the growth of local economy such as through domestic tourism 
 the canal river trust report that there be nearly visit to its canal last year many of which be repeat visit with around individual user each month that give we a real sense of the scale and popularity of our canal 
 i pay tribute to the canal river trust for the work that it do day in day out to look after the network our navigation authority have an important role to play into the future as well because they will make sure that our nation ’s key infrastructure be resilient to climate change as we have set out in our national adaptation plan of how we will mitigate and adapt to the risk set out by climate change committee these waterway may suffer the consequence of climate change more than other 
 importantly the work that the navigation authority do will help we meet our net target through sustainable transport and energy generation and help to achieve water security through flood mitigation measure and water transfer 
 i will write to my hon friend the member for morecambe and lunesdale with the specific of any funding analysis that have be do as i say i be not the minister responsible for inland waterway but i will take the time to write a detailed analysis if i can i may require further information from the volunteer and the partnership that he mention 
 the canal river trust and the environment agency be the body that receive direct funding and it be important to be clear that we will continue to provide significant funding the canal river trust be set up in as a charity independent of government the idea be to replace the publicly own british waterways and free it from public spending constraint the trust own and manage a network of some mile of canal and river in england and wales the original endowment in be £ but it be now worth £ from £ be propose to be grant over a year period we will continue to support the canal river trust but we certainly encourage it to work with other to make the most of the commercial opportunity as well 
 now that the trust be free of public sector financing constraint it can source alternative revenue stream include charitable donation and legacy charity tax relief party project funding and borrowing on the financial market while continue to receive a substantial government grant the trust be also endow by the government with a significant property and investment portfolio from british waterways as i say it be originally worth £ and be now worth over £ that be the result of sound investment management by the trust to provide further support and financial certainty for the trust while it be become establish the government agree in to provide a year grant of around £ 
 an important part of the transfer from british waterways be the memorandum of understanding sign by the department for environment food and rural affairs and the trust which contain a clear objective that the trust would progressively move towards great self sufficiency and reduced reliance on public   funding through its £ property and investment portfolio and freedom from public sector financial constraint follow a government review of current grant funding that be announce in july this year a further substantial grant funding package have be announce that will provide £ across the year period from importantly that will bring the total amount of government support for the trust to around £ since 
 i also want to discuss the funding for the environment agency as i mention there be body that look after the network of canal and river the environment agency ’s mile of navigation be fund in the form of an annual grant in aid for the year period from to that amount to £ i hope i have set out that this government really have support canal and river whether through the canal river trust or the environment agency but that there be other way in which those organisation can bring in additional funding as we have hear 
 to focus on the project that my hon friend be progress which be the most important thing i can not commend too highly the volunteer and their ambition for their area the project have such importance for the local community because it will not only bring back something that be last use in but will bring benefit such as tackle climate change improve people ’s physical and mental wellbeing and support biodiversity that be absolutely what we should be do it support the target of the environmental improvement plan and the work of group such as sustrans public right of way and national trail we all recognise the benefit of be near water and appreciate nature and goodness i we all need to get a little bit more active 
 i confirm that i will write to my hon friend with the detailed analysis of the funding for the project so far and i will take a look at other funding stream as well most importantly i look forward to visit he perhaps in kendal to congratulate the volunteer on their hard work and success to date it be brilliant to end today ’s sit with some wonderful good news about a really successful big society mission 
 question put and agree to 
 house adjourn 
 urgent question to ask the home secretary if she will make a statement on the operational independence of the metropolitan police 
 about a month ago hamas perpetrate a sicken terrorist attack in israel murder innocent people often in horrific circumstance about people remain held hostage by hamas a terrorist organisation and i be sure that the thought of the whole house be with those hostage today we have also see in the united kingdom thousand of people demonstrate in recent week thank to the tireless work of the police those incident have largely pass without significant incident however a number of arrest now nearly have be make where people have commit disorder racially aggravate crime or assault on police officer it be right that police officer have act robustly in those case 
 it be also right that the police be operationally independent of government that be a fundamental principle of british policing as the prime minister make clear yesterday the metropolitan police ask protester to postpone their plan protest this weekend but the request be refuse the prime minister meet the commissioner yesterday to seek reassurance that remembrance event will be protect of course remembrance event play a special part in this nation ’s long and proud history and it would be a grave insult if they be to be disrupt in any way it be for the metropolitan police to decide whether to apply to the home secretary to ban any march as of this morning no such application have be receive but the home secretary will of course carefully consider should it be make i reiterate that the police retain the confidence of the prime minister home secretary and myself in use all the power available to they under terrorism legislation and public order legislation to prevent criminality and disorder and hate speech 
 let i say to the house that i have be contact this morning repeatedly by member of the jewish community who be deeply apprehensive about what this weekend may bring and i want to put on record that we expect the police to protect those member of community in london include the jewish community who be feel vulnerable this weekend there be comprehensive power in place to do that hate have no place on london ’s street and we expect the police to ensure that the law be uphold there be power in   place to deal with people spread hate or deliberately raise tension through harassment and abusive behaviour the police can impose condition on march as indeed they have do to prevent pro palestine protester from approach the israeli embassy to give example the police have also use section 60aa condition to require people to remove face covering but the use of those power be of course an operational matter for the metropolitan police service 
 this weekend should and foremost be about remember those who give their life in defence of this country any disruption to remembrance service would be completely unacceptable and an insult to their memory i have confidence that the metropolitan police and other police force will ensure that this weekend pass off peacefully and without disruption 
 where be the home secretary she have send the policing minister here to refuse to repeat her word we have see her word this morning she have be attempt to rip up the operational independence of the police attack their impartiality in the crudest and most partisan of way deliberately undermine respect for the police at a sensitive time when they have an important job to do and deliberately seek to create division around remembrance which the policing minister rightly say should be a time for community to come together and to pay our respect she be deliberately inflame community tension in the most dangerous of way she be encourage extremist on all side attack the police when she should be back they it be highly irresponsible and dangerous and no other home secretary would ever have do this 
 remembrance event be really important to all of we those event need to be protect that be the job of the police to enforce and respect the law while maintain public safety tackle hate crime and extremism and respect right in law to peaceful protest they have to follow the law and the evidence whatever politician think not be the operational arm of the home secretary because whether she like it or not that be the british tradition of policing and i for be proud of it 
 we know what she be up to claim homelessness be a lifestyle choice pick fight with the police to get headline but the job of the home secretary be to keep the public safe not run an endless tory leadership campaign cabinet colleague refuse to agree with she and former police chief be line up to condemn she so i have question do this government still believe in the operational independence of the police and how can they do so while this home secretary be in post and do the prime minister and no agree to the content of the article either the prime minister have endorse this or he be too weak to sack she if he can not get a grip on her conduct it mean he have give up on serious government and he and the home secretary should both let someone else do the job 
 i thank the shadow home secretary for her question as always she ask about where the home secretary be it may have be wise to ask that privately rather than publicly but she be with a close family member who be have a hospital operation this morning i have the home secretary ’s permission to say that to the house in the event that somebody raise it as the shadow home secretary have do so i be pass that message on to the house 
 as we consider this topic the house should keep in mind the fact that many of our fellow citizen be feel deeply uneasy about what be go on in the middle east and the domestic repercussion we have see a spike in islamophobic offence there have be arrest in the last week for islamophobic offence we have see a surge in antisemitic offence there have be arrest for antisemitic offence in the last week 
 i have be contact this morning by member of the jewish community who be deeply uneasy about what this weekend will bring i do not think it be acceptable that our fellow citizen feel scared or uneasy walk about the street of london it be reasonable for politician the prime minister the home secretary and other include i be sure some on the opposition benches as well to raise those concern and make sure that the police be protect those community it be not acceptable to have fear and hatred on our street let that message go out from this house today 
 in relation to the question about operational independence yes of course the government resolutely back operational independence as the prime minister make clear yesterday after his meeting with the commissioner at no but the prime minister also say after that meeting that he would hold the commissioner to account as politician be suppose to do police and crime commissioner include the mayor of london as london ’s ppc do that and so do we as members of parliament that be perfectly proper and perfectly right 
 in term of the approval process with no i be afraid i do not have any visibility on that at all but let we keep in mind that we be see a humanitarian crisis unfolding in gaza there be people be hold hostage some people be slaughter by terrorist and member of our own community be feel scared this weekend let we keep that at the front of our mind not party political point scoring 
 of course there be a principle of operational police independence but i be concerned that the metropolitan police commissioner keep say he have no power to stop the march or arrest people in these march he certainly have power under section and of the public order act and under section and of the terrorism act do my right hon friend agree that the commissioner ’s predecessor certainly feel that they have the power to ban march by the english defence league in and under the same legislation that we be talk about now do he also agree that the home secretary have a power under section of the police act that say that where the home secretary feel that the police be fail to exercise their discretion reasonably she can demand special measure to take action herself 
 i thank my right hon and learn friend for his question his knowledge of the law in this area as in all area be immaculate the commissioner do have power under i think section i3 of the public order act to ban march in certain circumstance as my right hon and learn friend say it be last use about year ago so it be quite a rarely use power it apply when the police think that they be unable to deal with disorder that may break out that be   quite a high threshold the metropolitan police have so far not make a request to the home secretary under that section but if they do so it will be consider very carefully indeed 
 as my right hon and learn friend say the police have a wide range of power that they have be exercise under anti terrorism legislation that legislation make it an offence to glorify promote and incite association with proscribe organisation which of course include hamas section i think of the public order act make it an offence to use threat to incite racial hatred there be a wide range of offence and they be be use so far during these protest people have be arrest for hate crime in relation to glorify hamas incite violence and apparently praise the appalling terrorist atrocity that be commit and we expect that wide range of power to continue to be use 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 let i make it clear that the evil of antisemitism and islamophobia should be condemn wherever we find they 
 more than muslims fight for the british empire in world war to assert freedom liberty and an end to fascism in europe use war to end all war and promote peace through armistice the protest for peace be far from the cenotaph and start later that day the grandson of winston churchill nicholas soames have defend the right of people to march do the minister agree with he do he empathise with the contribution of muslims for peace then and now 
 armistice day have turn into armistice weekend and a lot of discussion be focus on the palestinian ceasefire march when the police be more concerned about counter protest from the far right such as the english defence league and football hooligan such as football lads alliance will the government also be look to cancel the premier league game schedule this weekend or the lord mayor ’s parade that overlap the minute silence 
 finally the former met assistant commissioner say this morning that this be 
 the end of operational independence in police 
 after the government seek to pressure and exert control to ban saturday ’s peace march say that they be on the verge of behave unconstitutionally do that not mean that the home secretary be unfit for office and should be sack 
 as i have say very clearly i do not agree with the suggestion that operational independence be in any way compromise the prime minister make that clear follow his meeting with the metropolitan police commissioner yesterday none the less i think that politician on both side of the house both member of parliament and police and crime commissioner be entitle to comment on matter of public policy and public order as they have do over recent year i do not think that offer comment undermine operational independence which as have be quite rightly say be a sacrosanct principle of our system 
 the hon gentleman mention sentiment in the muslim community in the united kingdom i be sure that like i he have meet the community in his constituency   we understand i be sure that there be huge concern not just in the muslim community but beyond about the humanitarian crisis in gaza that be why this government be provide additional aid that be why they be call for a humanitarian pause to allow aid to get in that be why our prime minister have work closely with other include president sisi of egypt to make sure the rafah border crossing be open to allow aid in and certain citizen out it be why our prime minister have renew his public commitment to a durable state solution those voice for peace be hear as well 
 let i repeat what i say at the start operational independence of policing be a sacrosanct principle and this government will not interfere with it 
 i know that the police be in a really difficult position and that their power to ban march be constrain by law but i have to say that i be deeply trouble by this march on saturday in all the many year that i have know the jewish community and in represent they in chipping barnet for year i have never know such fear and anxiety as i have see over the past few week do the minister agree that it be absolutely right that member of this house and ministers hold the police to account to insist that they deploy the full force of the law against any offence of hate crime and antisemitism at these protest 
 my right hon friend be a tireless campaigner for the jewish community in barnet and beyond we of course expect the police to protect the jewish community across london and across the whole country at a time when they feel deeply uneasy in fact describe the sentiment that the jewish community be feel as unease understate it as i say early i have receive message this morning from member of the jewish community express fear about this weekend and i will raise those fear with senior police officer later today to ensure that the met be aware of they and be police that appropriately there be no excuse for harassment there be no excuse for incite racial hatred that have no place in a civilised country such as this and we will not let it happen 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 the home affairs committee have spend many month scrutinise police for a report that be due to be publish tomorrow that scrutiny have include the principle of police by consent and the operational independence of the police free from political interference in uphold the rule of law as set down by parliament on protest and other matter alongside that the committee have be brief on the policing of protest and will be look to do more shortly however give the comment from the home secretary the principle of operational independence of police date back to and the police protocol which the home secretary agree in june this year can the minister confirm that if there be to be any discussion of these long stand policy principle of policing parliament be the place to do it possibly include the use of a royal commission we should certainly not have these matter debate on the front page of newspaper at a time that be very challenging for community in this nation 
 i thank the right hon lady for the work of her committee i look forward to read her report greatly i will give it close attention as i always do scrutiny of action by the police or indeed any other public body be not the same as interference scrutiny be healthy and appropriate interference be a different thing entirely there be a distinction between scrutiny and interference the operational independence principle be not that we plan to revisit but we look forward to discuss these question both with the right hon lady ’s committee and in this house 
 on this home secretary ’s watch every day crime across england and wales go unsolved so do she trust the police to do their job or not if the purpose of her article be to say that she know well than the commissioner of the metropolitan police she should say so and she should say so here in this chamber if not what possible motive could she have for seek to undermine public confidence in the police in this way 
 we do have confidence in the police but it be perfectly reasonable to scrutinise the police and hold they to account for their action as police and crime commissioner do every day and as member of this house do every day as well in term of confidence in police more widely accord to the crime survey for england and wales on a like for like basis crime be now low than it be under the last labour government 
 this morning a former chief constable of durham warn that the storm be whip up by the home secretary be divert resource away from a very serious threat that might arise do the minister not understand that the home secretary ’s incendiary and inflammatory comment ahead of what will be a really complex and sensitive policing operation for the met this weekend be make their job even hard be this not a deeply irresponsible way for a home secretary to behave 
 i do not accept the hon lady ’s characterisation the home secretary and other politician on both side of the house be perfectly entitle to hold policing to account but of course this government as the prime minister say accept indeed embrace the principle of operational independence 
 we all know that many people will be on the march on saturday the organiser and participant have tell i that they will be participate in ceremony of remembrance and that their march have be organise in such a way that it will not impact on that the truth be that the government be attempt to draw the police into take political side in a very contentious matter in the country there be million of people who want a ceasefire we be on a dangerous slippery slope because the operational independence of the police to protect the right of assembly the basic english right of liberty be be challenge by the home secretary she be not fit to hold that post be she 
 i do not accept that characterisation i be sure all of us—[interruption excuse i mr speaker i have a bit of a cold this morning we all accept the   right to protest which as the hon gentleman say long predate the european convention on human right there be limit to that right concern public order incitement to racial hatred and so on and it be for the police to police those law but it be reasonable for politician to hold they to account for do that as many politician on both side quite rightly do 
 the fact that only conservative mp have turn up to defend the home secretary show that she have already lose the support of the house the minister be absolutely right when he say that there be no place for hate on our street but be not the truth of the matter that there be no place for hate in the home office either and the problem with the present home secretary be that she be the person incite hatred in this country the minister be right that it be perfectly fair for we to have scrutiny of the police but that normally come after an operational event not before it be it not the case that this home secretary be really try to command the police which breach every single understanding we have historically have of the operational independence of the police 
 i be slightly concerned that the hon gentleman say that there be only conservative members in the house when it be clear there be a great deal more than that—[interruption give his 
 order i do not want to get into a tizzy about count i will help with a little clarification there be more conservative members here but only have speak i think that be the point 
 that be not quite how it come across from the hon gentleman ’s comment but i will move on 
 order we all have a judgment and i have make mine 
 which of course i accept without hesitation or reservation as i always do 
 i agree that hatred have no place on our street and i have say that repeatedly but this be an unfold event the hon gentleman talk about what happen after the event but these protest have be go on for week now the home secretary be not comment entirely before the event she be also comment after event that have be unfold over the last week which have include arrest and a number of community both muslim and jewish but particularly the jewish community feel very uneasy it be reasonable for the home secretary to try to ensure that community feel safe and protect and that be what she be try to do 
 when woman be treat brutally and unjustly by the metropolitan police in this city in the wake of the sarah everard murder member come correctly to criticise the police inside this house and out for their failure and for their brutality i remember people on the opposition benches call on the government to be more brutal on the police at that point the hand wring hypocrisy and   the pant wetting that we be see over someone correctly criticise the police be amazing i have witness irish nationalists and republicans who the home secretary refer to in her article run too quickly to the support of hamas to colombian terrorist to hezbollah and a whole host of other the home secretary be correct to call that out and to say it as she see it and this house be right to back she 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his word he be right to point out those example where member of this house particularly on the opposition benches have in the past criticise the police no on those occasion claim that those criticism impinge on the operational independence of the police they be simply hold the police to account as politician on both side be entitle to do i be grateful to he for remind the house of those previous occasion when opposition member have exercise their prerogative to hold the police to account 
 i be think of the number of time i have speak to criticise and call out the police for their behaviour in thing that they have get wrong but we be see the home secretary blatantly interfere with the operational day to day decision of the police we have to call that out the police have to be independent i have lose count of the number of people our home secretary have demonise be they lgbt people homeless people or minority why why be there so much hate spew from she the organiser of the march have say that it do not coincide with remembrance day will the minister correct that and stop conflate the issue 
 i do not accept the hon lady ’s characterisation it be both unfair and unintentionally inaccurate there be all kind of risk that the police will have to manage on saturday if the march go ahead include the risk that group break away which do in fact happen last saturday a group break away and end up in trafalgar square where they set off firework and police officer be assault those be the kind of risk that will have to be manage by the police on saturday that be not an easy job but i be sure that the police have the house ’s full support in do it 
 the shadow home secretary ’s question be whether the minister could confirm that the home secretary ’s intervention to undermine the operational independence of the police be sign off through the normal no process and therefore have the support of the prime minister the minister say that he have no sight of that so what will he do to furnish the house with an answer to that question 
 i be afraid that communication between other member of the government be not a matter for i i be responsible for police deliver record police number and fall crime that be my job and i be do it 
 do the minister agree with the home secretary that 
 senior police officer play favourite when it come to protester 
 it be up to the police to apply the law it be important that the police apply the law even handedly and that be what i be sure all member of the house want they to do 
 word matter so in the home secretary ’s absence can the minister explain in what way protest march in the uk relate to israel and gaza be disturbingly reminiscent of ulster and do he agree 
 that be not directly germane to the protest on saturday we have see all kind of protest in ulster over the year dissident republicans among other what we need to do be ensure that london ’s street be safe and that we do not have an atmosphere of fear or intimidation and that be what we expect the police to deliver 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make a statement on the effectiveness of the implementation of the uk sanction regime against russia and belarus 
 the sanction regime be deal with by the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my right hon friend   the member for berwick upon tweed anne marie trevelyan but i shall do my good to answer this most important question pose by   the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty 
 sanction be an important tool that we use to weaken putin ’s war effort and to underline our unyielding support for ukraine britain alone have sanction more than individual and entity under the russia sanction regime more than of which have be sanction since putin ’s full scale invasion although i can not comment on individual case we be pleased that the high court have in recent week recognise the foreign office ’s expertise on decide which person should be sanction to ensure maximum effect 
 we have freeze over £ worth of russian asset through designation and over of russia ’s central bank foreign reserve asset that can no long be funnel back to russia to fund its war machine rather than the surplus that the russian government predict for russia suffer an annual deficit of £ the high of the post soviet era its budget remain in deficit in despite tax increase we have also target those who have enable sanction person to hide their asset in obscure and complex financial network and we be work to crack down on phoenix company which continue to operate after sanction be impose or which be develop front to avoid sanction 
 just yesterday we impose further sanction target individual and entity operate in and support russia ’s gold oil and strategic sector critical source of revenue for the russian war machine those sanction include russia ’s large gold refiner as well as international network prop up russia ’s gold oil and finance industry 
 our co ordinated sanction work in line with our g7 partner be have an impact without our sanction and those of our partner we estimate that russia would have over $ more to fund its war machine we be starve putin of the resource he need to fund his illegal war on ukraine sanction be thwart russian access to western component and technology russia ’s budget remain in deficit our oil price cap have contribute to a fall of in russian oil revenue between january and september compare with the same period in and our export ban have starve russia of thousand of product need for the battlefield 
 his majesty ’s government be fully aware as member will be that sanction be not static we be constantly monitor to see where and if they be be circumvent   alongside our international partner we be close loophole and tackle sanction evasion as putin desperately scramble to restructure the russian economy and smuggle good in through back channel we will continue to isolate russia ’s financial system and support business that be seek to divest from their link with russia we will bring forward further legislation in the come week to deliver on our g7 commitment and far deprive russia of lucrative remain revenue source include ban import of russian diamond and end all import of russian copper aluminium and nickel 
 order i have try cough i have try different way of indicate that the minister be almost a minute over we need to get speech well time in future to minute i be sure he be come to the end immediately 
 thank you mr speaker 
 finally we will continue to combat circumvention and seek to degrade russia ’s military capability by come down hard on sanction evader and closing loophole 
 for the record i want to say that we have a bit of drift over early we be back in a new session the rule be quite clear the time limit be minute for the minister and for those who have table the question it be minute please adhere to it do not take advantage of the chair because you be take advantage of the people i represent they be call back benchers 
 i thank the minister for his response he will know that there be unity across the house in stand with ukraine but there be serious concern about the effectiveness of our sanction regime almost year have pass since putin begin this phase of his illegal and barbaric invasion of ukraine but on monday it be reveal by the times that a british company have allegedly continue to ship semiconductor to russia since putin ’s war begin and that these have be identify within at least russian tank deploy in the conflict against ukraine it also report that the company only stop ship to its russian distributor after the bank refuse to process payment for these export there be clearly serious deficiency in the implementation of our regime that must be address i have these raise with i on my recent visit to kyiv and i draw attention to my declaration of interest 
 i would like clarity from the minister on a number of key point can he confirm whether there be loophole within our regime that continue to allow for material to be export to russia and belarus that could be use in the production of military item why do those omission still exist and what step be be take to deal with they 
 secondly can he set out what assessment have be make by the foreign commonwealth and development office and the treasury of the existence of allege loophole that allow indirect import into uk market of russian or belarusian origin steel or indeed russian origin crude oil that have be refine in country these be very serious allegation 
 thirdly city am reveal this week that nearly uk company have admit breach russia relate sanction as a result of a freedom of information request by the law firm pinsent masons it be good that those company have come forward voluntarily but it show the scale of the problem 
 finally accord to the office of financial sanctions implementation only financial penalty have be issue regard a sanction breach within the russia and belarus sanction regime since february and only penalty have be publish across all uk sanction regime since june that compare very unfavourably with the united states and other ally which have be issue fine and deal with this issue labour stand unshakeably with our ally in provide military economic diplomatic and humanitarian assistance to ukraine in the face of putin ’s illegal invasion but that must include a robust sanction regime 
 i thank the hon gentleman very much for his comment i know the revelation in the british medium to which he refer at the beginning of his remark i will write to he today on some of the technical point he have raise give he a very specific answer on the general point he have make i can tell he that britain have prohibit the export to russia of thousand of product include semiconductor and our trade with russia be down over from pre invasion level we be also provide advice to uk business on how to identify method of circumvention and have share a list of product of particular concern that could end up on the battlefield 
 i thank my right hon friend for the update but he will probably be aware that there be backdoor route that be lead to technology end up in russia the most prevalent of those be british university supply technology to iran that end up on drone which be then use by russia to attack the brave ukrainians will he undertake to investigate this practice and put a stop to it and to apply appropriate sanction accordingly 
 my hon friend accurately identify danger to the sanction regime that can cause they to be circumvent we be i think good at identify and close down such danger but i should make it clear to he that uk sanction prohibit a range of activity relate to the movement of prohibit item to and from russia both directly and indirectly in that context i will consider carefully the point that my hon friend have make 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 i thank the minister for his answer the snp welcome the extension of sanction against the russian regime but we still think more need to be do for example be there any plan to extend the sanction that be currently in place against hamas and other terrorist organisation operate in the middle east which we know be forge close and close link with putin and his criminal terrorist network in particular the united states have already sanction a number of hamas representative and people close to hamas operate in different country   in the middle east do the minister and the government have any plan to follow suit and sanction those same individual 
 the foreign affairs committee recently describe the uk government ’s effort to sanction individual and organisation link to russia ’s wagner terrorist group as underwhelme in the extreme what action do the government intend to take in response to that report so that organisation such as wagner and those who run they be effectively sanction we know that ukraine have impose sanction on the former kgb intelligence officer alexander lebedev do the uk government have any plan to follow suit 
 i thank the hon gentleman very much for his comment we do not give routine update or a running commentary on sanction but he may rest assure that we be look at hamas in every respect he draw attention to the foreign affairs select committee ’s report as he will know we recently announce sanction both direct and indirect against wagner while we be careful not to discuss specific case we take all potential breach very seriously and all business that be register in the uk be bind by law to comply with the russia sanction regime 
 the minister have give we a very informative statement i be very interested in this business of intellectual knowledge get to russia via party can i take it that his majesty ’s government have contact and speak with the vice chancellor and principal of our academic institution the length and breadth of the uk to advise they how this must be stop

 monday november conclusion of the debate on the autumn statement 
 so there we have it confirmation that the government have give up on governing the prime minister ’s and likely only king ’s speech and what should be his moment of maximum power and authority yet it be not because he be too weak he have no burn agenda he can not escape his government ’s own record and he certainly can not be the change the country be cry out for the verdict be in thin gruel damp squib dull as ditchwater a series of gimmick and a prime minister who have 
 already check out his wheelie be at the door 
 those be not my word but those of conservative members the leader of the house know it and they know it yet another fail reset they be out of idea and out of road—“drifte to defeat as have put it today 
 the programme be so thin it be embarrassing of the few bills announce be carry over be barely long than a page we have see before and the flagship crime bill have already be shelve despite the big issue face our country the government ’s answer   be so small there be nothing to tackle the cost of living crisis just a prime minister delude that everything be go great and even get his own figure wrong there be nothing on nhs waiting list or mental health despite a bill be promise many time education have be consign to lofty ambition year away there be nothing of substance on transport despite network north be the prime minister ’s last big reset another flunk however the government have find time for the regulation of pedicab and a bill to make it easy to sack doctor do the government really think that sack doctor be the solution to an nhs crisis 
 other bills be political stunt not fix problem take north sea gas and oil can the leader of the house confirm that we already have regular north sea licensing and that it have not prevent the bad cost of live crisis in generation can she also confirm that in the midst of that crisis drive by energy bill the grand offer of this king ’s speech be a bill that by the admission of the energy secretary will do absolutely nothing about bill the only way to bring down bill and get energy security be by go far and fast on cheap renewable instead this government be retreat and spend billion subsidise gas the price of which be set globally anyway it be politic country 
 then there be the so call flagship crime bill a bill that have have to go back to the drawing board the prime minister be too weak to stand up to his home secretary who want to criminalise give homeless people tent because she think it be a lifestyle choice despicable we all know what she be up to it be naked instead of sack she the prime minister cower next to she he be cower next to she today too she be out of control she be utterly irresponsible undermine the police while stoke up division ahead of a difficult and important weekend she be unhinge do the leader of the house agree with the home secretary that police officer be play favourite in this case but the prime minister be so weak that he can not rein in the home secretary he be so weak that he could not even get his own idea into his own king ’s speech 
 order i do not like the term unhinged i understand that tension be run very high but i want we to try to moderate our language 
 i will withdraw that mr speaker and i will ask my question instead 
 nutrient neutrality have be drop to avoid another embarrassing defeat whatever happen to the motorist bill brief several time as the prime minister ’s big idea it be nowhere this week the ban on conversion therapy drop 
 of the prime minister ’s pet project do make it into the king ’s speech though a bill on autonomous vehicle but the joke be make on the tory whatsapp group be that it be their own government that be the driverless car i can tell the leader of the house that labour be rev up there be much that we would do we would bring in a fiscal responsibility lock so that mortgage payer never again pay the price of conservative failure we would ban water boss bonus and clean up our river end non dom tax break and have more doctor and teacher change plan law to build   more affordable home levy a proper windfall tax and set up gb energy we would make work pay legislate for proper leasehold reform and right for renter tackle crime and violence against woman and girl introduce a skill and growth levy and pass real rail and bus reform the list go on 
 the prime minister be right about thing this country need change but his programme offer more of the same weakness failure political stunt and division this government have give up on govern and be prepare for job in opposition but take it from i opposition be not all it be crack up to be it be a privilege to have the power of government and a majority in this place be not the big travesty of all that they do not even want it any more 
 i start by thank you mr speaker all member and all staff of this house for make the state opening and the king ’s gracious address to parliament so successful 
 i know that many right hon and hon member will be take part in remembrance service across the nation and overseas this weekend medal proudly wear by our veteran be not just thank from a grateful nation they be a message for the rest of we we should remember their service and sacrifice but also the lesson that make their service and sacrifice both necessary and possible this weekend as we attend service and lay wreath beside memorial we should reflect on how good to honour they and the freedom we enjoy because of they and protect their precious legacy 
 the shadow leader of the house start by talk about the cost of living i be sorry that as she do so she do not recognise that this week we have pay out £ in cost of living payment and that of household eligible for the cost of live payment have already receive it from this government i disagree with the hon lady because i do not think that our cost of living issue be remotely help by lessen our energy security which be why we be bring forward the bill and why i ask her party to support it it be not at all incompatible with invest in renewable energy and clean technology 
 the hon lady be rather fond of criticise both our record and our plan for this session so it might be helpful to get the score on the door she believe that our bills statutory instrument and record number of private member bills—24 pass in the session of this parliament be a shabby record i point out to she that only in of the parliamentary sessions between and be more bill put through than we put through in the last session in the last sessions of labour administrations the average number of bills bring forward be the hon lady can not justify her charge against we about the amount we have get do she might be rely on the time it take we it do take we less time than we have allocate to pass a lot of that legislation and to do government business but that be not really a problem for those on the government benches it be a more a problem for those on the opposition benches although i have no complaint about that those on the government side of the house have be pull their weight even in opposition day debate in debate on school safety and animal welfare for example there be more conservative speaker than opposition speaker 
 let i go into the specific point that the hon lady raise on tent the home secretary have no plan to ban millet we be not do that the government have make the large investment ever in tackle homelessness and rough sleeping provide £ to accelerate its mitigation and prevention include prevent people from become homeless in the last year 
 on conversion therapy we have a manifesto commitment and it be still a manifesto commitment the secretary of state will keep the house inform on the work she be do on this important matter 
 i be surprised to hear the hon lady raise nutrient neutrality i have hop she would support our measure but the secretary of state will no doubt update the house on the further work he be do in that area however we be bring forward many measure that will assist more development to happen include reform at the valuation office 
 at the heart of the charge the hon lady present be value and the question of who be fit to govern for the people of this country and i would ask she to undertake just a little self reflection she mention doctor but of the medical doctor in the house sit on the government benches while of the veteran in the house sit on these bench so i do not think there be a problem with our value our service or our duty 
 yesterday outside this place just stop oil activist hold up an ambulance on waterloo bridge it be government legislation pass in this house that enable the police to arrest of those protester and get the traffic moving legislation that the hon lady block along with reform to protect the public from strike action 
 the hon lady support the regressive tax policy of the london mayor and the tax and spend policy of the shadow chancellor which would saddle every household with an additional £ of tax per annum the time party of education education education be now the party of tax education education education”—the hon lady should think about that for a moment and about the value it represent 
 i will take no lecture from a labour party that put politic before people labour member talk of change but i be afraid that the labour party have not change at all 
 yesterday i host the ever parliamentary reception for yorkshire cancer research a fantastic charity that have be work for nearly year in the fight against cancer and not just in yorkshire it be a significant funder of research and we have some very fine research institution in the north however institution in the north as a whole the north east and the north west as well as yorkshire can do more please could we have a debate about research funding and the process by which it be allocate 
 i thank my hon friend for the work he be do he raise an important point and if he be to apply for a debate i be sure it would be well attend the department of health and social care invest about £ a year in research through the national institute for health and care research and that institution welcome funding application on any   aspect of health research its expenditure on cancer research in the last financial year be over £ i thank my hon friend for raise this important matter and i shall draw the attention of the secretary of state for health and social care to what he have say 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 before her rapid rise to her current role as the leader of the house the right hon lady briefly serve as minister for women and equalities there be believe it or not still such a role in this tory government i raise that because recently there have be some absolutely shocking insight into the government ’s attitude to woman and equality that give we an opportunity to assess her government ’s record and spoiler alert for she it be grotesque 
 we have the stomach churn misogyny in language and behaviour describe by witness at the covid inquiry i imagine that even the leader of the house would find it hard to defend the routine and disgraceful attack on woman in a government she serve it tell we so much we then have the united nations rapporteur on extreme poverty and human right oliver de schutter tell the right hon lady ’s government that their record on poverty be simply not acceptable and be violate international law that surprise no who see the effect of her government ’s cruel policy day in and day out then a former tory chair join the fray by say that there be rot at the heart of the party she be once so proud to be a member of a rot at the heart of government 
 what we be talk about be the tory government ’s value and those value be not scotland ’s value their value suggest that the way to help the homeless be to ban charity from supply tent to rough sleeper it be a lifestyle choice to be homeless be it not those comment be so misjudged that even the prime minister be embarrassed they have the value that say we do n’t care if we break international law on poverty and the human right of the poor and that woman can be dismiss in the foul way imaginable as a part of normal behaviour simon case the country ’s most senior civil servant say that he have 
 never see a bunch of people less well equip to run a country 
 he should know 
 can we have a debate on the tory government ’s value and what year under this brutal and useless government have do to progress woman and equality and the interest of the most vulnerable among we in this far from united kingdom 
 i thank the hon lady for her question the powerful word this week of susie flintham of covid-19 bereaved families for justice should give we all pause for thought that be why the government have place professionalism and care of each other at the heart of what we do we be the government to have set up a ministerial human resource function in whitehall it be shameful that previously that do not exist that be also why we be focus on more training and support for mp ministers and official and it be why in my evidence to the standards committee i say that the only way we will make the nation proud of our conduct here be to recognise the responsibility and duty   of care we have to each other across the hundred of organisation that make up the political landscape parliament political party and whitehall the government and i as leader of the house take these matter incredibly seriously 
 the hon lady talk about value and language i hope that she will have a word with some of her party ’s activist who have intimidate those who stand against she or stand up for their own principle i point out that despite by election loss the government do arrive back here with a new mp who sit on our bench a little self reflection about some of the reason why that mp make that transition would be appreciate 
 the hon lady want to talk about value on woman and equality issue it be the snp that have tear the social fabric of the uk with its plan on gender recognition reform it be the snp and the labour party which back the snp on that that have back the anti free speech bill that the scottish government have be so keen to push the party be in coalition together at a local level labour would give the snp power on foreign affair and have indulge the minister of wales ’s separatist agenda 
 the hon lady often come here to say that the government do not respect devolution we do respect devolution it be part of our value since the turn of the century the uk government have legislate for scotland more than time with the scottish government ’s consent it be the snp that do not listen to local voice the party that do not respect local people and local decision making be the snp which overrule of council on planning appeal do not consult local authority regard its council tax policy and do not pass on funding from the uk government that be design for scotland ’s local authority i think that our value be fine the hon lady should look to her own party if she want some improvement 
 some of the ukrainians house in mid derbyshire under the homes for ukraine scheme be worried about their future as their visa be start to expire they include school pupil who be uncertain about whether they can continue their education here attend british university and receive home student fee and funding will the government make a statement outline the future of the homes for ukraine scheme and how student will be affect 
 many members be host ukrainian refugee and we be acutely aware of how difficult it be for they to plan their life in the situation that they find themselves in we will give they as much certainty as we can so that they can start to make decision about study or where they might go in a year ’s time my understanding be that they must be give a year ’s notice so many will be give information next spring i will write to both relevant departments to flag the point that if we can do anything early it would be appreciate 
 the word economy be mention only once in the king ’s speech give that the country face the high tax burden since the world war not to mention the   long squeeze on wage in year do that not speak volume about the government ’s lack of a long term plan for our economy 
 the hon lady will know that the big way we can help household be to curb inflation that be the chancellor ’s priority and it be why we have exercise restraint on spending i be sorry that the hon lady do not support we in those effort but she will not have long to wait for the chancellor ’s autumn statement which i announce in the business statement 
 could we have a debate on the volunteer who support the royal british legion i be lucky enough to be the honorary president of the royal british legion in hinckley year since its formation and my predecessor but be also its honorary president i have see the work of the like of elaine ward who have be collect for the poppy appeal for year i will be there in hinckley on friday could we have a debate about how magnificent this charity really be 
 i be sure i speak for all member of the house by thank the hon gentleman for enable we all to send our thank to the royal british legion and its army of volunteer who assist all year round not just during the poppy campaign if we be to have a debate it would be well attend and very long because the work it do be tremendously diverse help family as well as veteran and serve member of the armed force 
 this summer i welcome to parliament teacher from oldfield park infant school and twerton infant school they tell i how they be struggle with staff shortage underfunding and an increasingly unmanageable workload in the south west teacher vacancy have rise by in the last year so far the government have commit only to a fraction of the recommend £ need for catch up education can we have a debate in government time to get to the bottom of the considerable underfunding of school 
 as the hon lady know we have protect the school budget and increase the number of teacher substantially i think we have an additional since clearly recruitment be an issue in certain part of the country there have be a number of campaign through local authority to attract teacher from particular discipline into area that do not have enough of they i will write to the secretary of state on the hon lady ’s behalf and ask she whether she and her department could share some good practice with the hon lady and her local authority 
 the leader of the opposition recently say that he would bulldoze local protest and opposition in order to build million more home which have folk in my patch worried be there some way of find government time to have a debate to show that there always need to be local consent and engagement to build the home that we need we need those home to be affordable proportionate sustainable and appropriate 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important point it be important to respect local decision making we know from the neighbourhood plan forum we help to establish that quite often they be more ambitious about build home in their area than their own local authority we be on track to meet our manifesto commitment of new home in this parliament since we have deliver over home with million move into home ownership through the levelling up and regeneration act we be also improve the planning process at the heart of it i be very happy to say we still have local people and local decision making 
 last saturday i have the privilege of attend the launch of the north east field of remembrance run by the royal british legion in saltwell park in my constituency will the leader of the house join i in thanking and congratulate the royal british legion on an excellent ceremony saltwell park be a massively brilliant venue for our north east field of remembrance i be also wonder how soon we might get an announcement that will lead to the recommencement of the backbench business committee in this session of parliament 
 of all i be very happy to join the hon gentleman in congratulate the royal british legion in his constituency on all the work they do all year round but particularly at this time of year i have be prod my colleague with regard to his request and i hope to have some news for he this afternoon 
 this weekend the nation will fall silent to remember those who make the ultimate sacrifice in the great war the world war and other conflict next weekend at the cenotaph the association of jewish ex servicemen and women will conduct its annual march that will be a really important security operation for the metropolitan police last year my right hon and learn friend   the member for cheltenham alex chalk   become the ever minister to lay a wreath at that service will my right hon friend allow a debate in government time on the contribution make by jewish ex servicemen and woman and will she prevail on the defence secretary or a defence minister to attend the service and lie a wreath 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that very important point it be right that we mark the contribution of all ex servicemen and woman he mention the i think jewish serviceman who fight in world war with our british armed force these be incredibly important event and   november   coincide with mitsvah day a day when the jewish community around the country will be support local charity and community another example of the service they give to their community and this nation i be very happy to ensure that there be ministerial attendance at that event that tradition should continue i can not tell he which minister but i shall make sure that all relevant departments remember the request 
 the leader of the house have assure the house time and again that it be the intention of the house of commons commission and herself to bring forward measure on   risk base exclusion which we be mean to debate before the summer recess it be now november i be sure the right hon lady be bored of be ask this question but not as bored as i be of have to keep ask it with yet more recent report allege serious misconduct while measure to address they appear to be kick into the long grass when will time be find to discuss how to ensure parliament be a safe workplace and to restore our reputation with the public 
 when either the committees of this house or the commission bring forward proposal to be debate on the floor of the house we find time very swiftly usually within a week we do debate the proposal before the summer recess and there be some very legitimate comment from member the hon lady take part in that debate herself if i remember correctly the commission be consider these thing and as soon as it have finalise a proposal we will just as we always have bring it back to this house 
 since my election i have liaise closely with the environment agency and city of doncaster council to ensure that we never again see as many flood victim as we see in storm babet result in the flooding of property far more be flood in while that be an undoubted success and a testament to the hard work of the agency and the council we in doncaster be now be penalise for that success for those household who do suffer flooding it be still a disaster so may we hold a debate on my proposal that the government ’s excellent compensation scheme for flood victim should apply to all area not just those where a minimum of property be affect 
 i be very sorry to hear about those household and my sympathy go out to all who have be affect i be pleased to hear that the flood have have less impact than in previous year that be a very good development but of course it be of no comfort to those who have suffer i would encourage my hon friend ’s local authority to contact the department for levelling up housing and communities if it think that it be able to meet the criterion for support i understand that the department be open to listen and work with council so that they receive proper support and i think they have until late january next year to provide information on those criterion but i will certainly ensure that the secretary of state have hear my hon friend ’s advocacy for the flood household in his constituency 
 the overwhelming majority of people in yorkshire be proud and patriotic love their family and work hard how can it be then that family have to approach food bank time last year in order to feed their child that be shameful and doubtless it be in the un rapporteur ’s mind when he say that our country be in breach of its international treaty obligation under the international covenant on economic social and cultural right may we have a debate about child poverty in government time and will the leader of the house arrange for a government law officer to be present to tell we what their legal defence be for the position in which the government have put we 
 this be an important matter and that the government take extremely seriously that be why we have a package of more than £ to support people through these cost of living strain and it be why we be work to combat and mitigate the cause what be happen internationally have place immense strain on our fuel price and so forth i think that we should debate these matter and i hope that we debate they in all part of the uk i be sure that if the hon gentleman apply for a debate it would be well attend he might also like to read the senedd ’s report on the welsh labour government ’s track record on child poverty which be out this week i think he would find it an eye opening read 
 speeding and antisocial driving continue to blight chalkwell and leigh on sea with boy racer use illegal exhaust hurtle down our seafront at all time of the day and night even our local legend linda catling who despite be partially sight regularly knit woollen postbox topper and have now create a speed camera topper be consider move out of marine parade owe to the dangerous driving give that road crime include speeding kill more people in essex than all other crime put together may we please have a debate in government time on speeding and antisocial driving

 last weekend the home secretary turn her damaging and divisive rhetoric on the homeless describe homelessness as a lifestyle choice and suggest that her government should prioritise strip homeless people of their tent and fin the charity that provide they with that shelter although i be relieved that this disgraceful proposal do not make it into the king ’s speech could i ask the leader of the house to take this opportunity to apologise for her colleague ’s callous remark 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question i have already give some statistic on this government ’s record on tackle homelessness in term of finance and how many people we have prevent from become homeless our homelessness reduction act have already ensure that more than people have be prevent from become homeless i be here to answer for the government ’s record and the government ’s agenda and i have

 can we please have a statement from the paymaster general to explain to the house why the very clear and final recommendation make by sir brian langstaff in his report publish in april month ago set out the need to extend interim payment and to set up a compensation scheme this year have effectively be trash by the government be it not shameful that after set up a year public inquiry and run a parallel compensation review so that the payment of compensation would not drag on for far too long and with very clear recommendation from a well think of esteemed former high court judge the government have decide not to implement any of those key recommendation 
 i thank the right hon lady for her diligent campaigning on this matter she rightly note that the compensation study be set up to run concurrently in order to save time i know that the paymaster general be plan some engagement in the come week with the group that be campaign have raise this at a previous business question the right hon lady will know that i have also raise it with the paymaster general i will make sure that he hear what she have say again today i can tell she that he be committed to act as swiftly as possible to ensure that all people include those who should receive interim payment do so

 a recent ruling by the inner house of the court of session in edinburgh put beyond any doubt that the ill conceive gender recognition reform scotland bill of the scottish government impinge significantly on the equality act the sex base right of woman and the same sex right of lesbian gay and bisexual people we have have a debate in westminster hall to discuss redefine and have precision in law about the word sex will the leader of the house discuss this   matter and the possibility of bring in legislation to clarify the definition of sex in the act in the future with her equalities and justice colleague 
 i know that the secretary of state be very across this issue and i think that that judgment be a helpful thing to have take place we deeply regret the lack of understanding on these matter about the need whatever the governments and administrations in other part of the uk wish to do to bear in mind the social fabric of the uk tear at that social fabric what it be to be a citizen and the value and norm that we live under be a bad thing we also need to ensure that we be uphold what be in the act i shall make sure that the secretary of state have hear what the hon gentleman have say 
 i would welcome the leader of the house ’s advice on how to expedite a response from the foreign commonwealth and development office for my constituent who be desperate to return home from kyiv with their newborn son who be bear in september in ukraine through surrogacy and for whom they be seek an emergency travel document i totally understand the importance of complete the passport application process but my constituent have a vulnerable baby who need to be care for at home and a year old back here in the uk who desperately need her parent back

 wick harbour in my constituency suffer damage in the recent storm if that be not deal with very fast indeed it could jeopardise the future use of the harbour in the same storm a section of sea defence beside the main railway line from inverness to the far north fall away so we have no train which be a vital transport link for a length of time the leader of the house might say these be matter for the scottish government but i would argue that they be strategic to the united kingdom far to her previous answer will she encourage official at the department for levelling up housing and communities to speak to the scottish government and possibly the highland council about these issue so we can get they put right as fast as possible 
 i be sorry to hear about that situation the hon gentleman be right that unless these thing be take care of and mitigate future bad weather will exacerbate the situation i will make some inquiry on his behalf the department for environment food and rural affairs may well be able to assist he more than some other department in time of great crisis we always ensure that the scottish government and local authority across the uk be able to make a request for military aid to the civil authority in order   to get assistance from uk armed force to keep our community safe i will make some inquiry on behalf of the hon gentleman and contact his office 
 this week after year of threaten journalist at the guardian and elsewhere with legal action wealthy business tycoon douglas barrowman and michelle mone finally admit that they be indeed behind the dodgy covid company ppe medpro ltd. the government have repeatedly promise to outlaw the practice of dodgy lawyer and dodgy client use the threat of legal action to prevent the freedom of the press from report the truth in the public interest will the leader of the house clarify which of the bills announce in the king ’s speech will fulfil that promise and outlaw the practice once and for all 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that important point as someone who have be subject to such threat myself i think these matter be very important we do work on this in the previous session there be ongoing work in the ministry of justice and other departments to ensure that people be able to whistleblow in other part of government we have move to protect individual who find themselves in different but similar set of circumstance particularly relate to issue of employment and sexual harassment 
 i thank the leader of the house for answer the business question 
 with permission madam deputy speaker i shall make a statement about the government ’s artificial intelligence safety summit 
 today i update the house about a turning point in our history with of the world ’s population we have build the large ai sector we have rocket ourselves to a increase in ai company base themselves here in less than a decade and uk ai scale up be raise almost double that of france germany and the rest of europe combine but the sudden and unprecedented growth in the speed and power of artificial intelligence present unlimited opportunity along with the potential of grave risk which we can not ignore 
 i truly believe that we stand at a crossroad in human history to turn the wrong way would be a monumental miss opportunity for mankind which be why last week present such a watershed moment we convene leader ministers developer scientist and academic from across the globe to discuss for the time the risk and opportunity of frontier ai although the collection of country and organisation that come to bletchley park be unprecedented our goal from the start be to leave with tangible outcome let i briefly outline a handful of action that have result from the summit 
 country and the european union represent the majority of the world ’s population sign up to an unprecedented agreement know as the bletchley declaration despite some claim that such a declaration would be reject by many country in attendance we agree that for the good of all ai should be design develop deploy and use in a manner that be safe human centric trustworthy and responsible we agree on the protection of human right transparency and explainability fairness accountability regulation safety appropriate human oversight ethic bias mitigation privacy and data protection 
 we also agree to measure monitor and mitigate potentially harmful capability and the associated effect that may emerge in particular to prevent misuse and issue of control and the amplification of other risk and that ture prize winner yoshua bengio credit as be of the godfather of ai would lead on a state of science report to ensure that collectively we stay on top of the risk of frontier ai 
 country with differ world view and interest include china sign the same agreement some have say that china would not come to the summit but it do they say that if it do attend china would never sign an agreement but it do then they say that if china do sign the agreement it would not agree to continue collaborate in the long term but it do that as well that alone would have make the summit a watershed moment in the history of ai safety but we go far 
 we surpass all expectation by secure an agreement on government lead testing pre deployment of the model this be truly a game changer to help ensure that we can safely harness the benefit of frontier ai while mitigate the risk to facilitate it the uk announce that the world lead frontier taskforce will morph into the   world ’s permanent ai safety institute which will bring together the very good ai mind in the world to research future risk and conduct party testing of model 
 this be just the start of the journey on ai safety which be why we have also confirm funding for the institute for the rest of the decade and secure future ai safety summit to be hold in the republic of korea in month time and in france in year ’s time ensure that the extraordinary pace of international action set by the summit last week be maintain into the future 
 none the less the summit be just piece in the uk ’s overall approach to ai safety our white paper publish early this year be praise for ensure that the uk can be agile and responsive as risk emerge i be sure that opposition members will call for a size fit all snapshot in time piece of legislation but we must ensure that we deepen our understanding of the problem before we rush to produce inadequate legislation 
 we also need to ensure that we be quick enough to act which be why we have take the step to ensure that we can keep pace with the development of the technology with the next set of model be release within month ai be the fast emerge technology that we have ever see and we need a system that can identify evaluate and understand ai to then allow we to mitigate the risk with the right guardrail that be why it be such an achievement to agree the pre deployment testing of model we should not underestimate that achievement 
 company need to do more too which be why before the summit we manage to go far than any country ever have we secure the publication of the main ai company safety policy along with a catalogue of the possible policy ensure transparency and a race to the top complement by the recent us executive order it be also why i have be advocate for responsible capability scaling which i often refer to as a kind of smoke alarm for ai developer 
 the release of chatgpt not even a year ago be a breakthrough moment for humanity we be all surprised by the progress we see the acceleration of investment into and adoption of ai system at the frontier make they increasingly powerful and consequential to our life these system could turbocharge our public service save life in the nhs and tailor education to every child ’s need they could free people everywhere from tedious work and amplify our creative ability they could help our scientist to unlock bold new discovery open the door to a world where day disease such as cancer will no long exist and there will be access to near limitless clean energy
