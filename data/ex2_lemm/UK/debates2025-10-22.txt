 with permission i will update the house on the step this government be take to realise the benefit of expansion at heathrow airport have invite proposal for a runway early this year 
 today i be launch a review of the airport national policy statement britain want to fly and this government will act to meet public aspiration our review of the anps will ensure that while we unlock long term capacity for more flight at the nation ’s only hub airport we will also meet our obligation to passenger community and the environment today be a step forward for uk aviation and infrastructure support growth in the economy and enable a modern efficient transport system that harness international investment boost connectivity and strengthen uk competitiveness 
 we be committed to make a decision on a runway at heathrow within this parliament and we be clear in our ambition to see flight take off on a new runway in we say we would get on with this and we have when the previous government set up the davies commission it take they year to publish the original draft anps we will get to the same point in month with the process complete by the end of show our commitment to deliver progress swiftly but robustly when we say we back the builder not the blocker we mean it 
 but this be not a blank cheque expansion at heathrow must minimise cost for passenger and customer the taxpayer must not be expect to foot the bill that be why the scheme will be privately finance both the core project and the related infrastructure improvement extra staff and passenger must be able to get to and from the airport without turn the m4 and m25 into europe ’s large car park crucially the expansion must align with our legal environmental and climate commitment start the review of the anps be critical to deliver expansion and will provide the basis for decision on any future planning application 
 the world have change since the last anps review in which be when it be designate new environmental and climate obligation have be introduce and pattern of travel have change however pretty much every uk airport see its busy summer on record we could put our head in the sand and pretend this be not the case but we would be do a disservice to our economy and to the next generation that be why in carry out this review we will consider how any propose scheme must meet clear test that it contribute to economic growth across the country that it meet our air quality obligation that it be consistent with our noise commitment and crucially that it align with our legal obligation on climate change include net 
 we will seek the independent opinion of the climate change committee which i will write to shortly to request this advice while a runway at heathrow have be factor into carbon budget it be right that we update our modelling and seek the view of the ccc give heathrow ’s national importance we will also consider name the airport as critical national priority infrastructure in line with our approach to low carbon energy project we be far consider   whether to name a statutory undertaker as an appropriate person to carry out the project under the planning act provide additional clarity to stakeholder and the local community it be clear that this be a large and complex programme that require a thorough and evidence lead approach over the come month my department will develop analysis on economic and environmental impact of expansion we will also undertake an appraisal of sustainability as require by statute alongside a habitat regulation assessment and other necessary technical work if amendment be need to the anps as a result of the review we expect to consult on an amend policy statement by next summer community will be able to have their say and we will shortly publish an update stakeholder engagement approach to ensure transparency and fairness throughout the process 
 early this year we invite potential promoter to submit proposal for deliver a runway at heathrow proposal be receive and be consider by official from the department for transport the treasury and expert financial and technical adviser follow that assessment potential scheme remain under active consideration a proposal from heathrow airport limited and a proposal from the arora group we know that we must provide as much clarity and certainty for community investor and user of heathrow as soon as possible so we be seek further information on the propose scheme with a view to reach a final decision on a single scheme to inform the remainder of the anps review by the end of november 
 when make that decision we will consider the interoperability of the propose scheme with exist infrastructure the plan for transport to and from the airport and associate road scheme the land take and impact on surround home and community the evidence that the scheme can be privately finance and the economic benefit of the scheme this government be commit to move quickly but we will also do this properly 
 to deliver the scheme on time the government be also press ahead with a series of enable reform the planning and infrastructure bill will streamline the delivery of major infrastructure include heathrow that include fast consent route and more proportionate consultation on judicial review we have announce that we will work with the judiciary to cut the amount of time it take for a review to move through the court system for national policy statement and nationally significant infrastructure project we be establish the uk airspace design service to deliver modernised airspace that will initially prioritise airspace design for the london region support both heathrow and the wide network and will also make flight path more efficient so that plane spend less time over london we will initiate slot reform to ensure future allocation maximise benefit of an expand heathrow as well as approve growth at gatwick and luton for passenger local community and business 
 expand heathrow will be of the large infrastructure project in the uk rigorous and effective cost control will be essential to its success both in minimise any impact on airline charge and cost to passenger and in maintain credibility with financial market the government will therefore work with the civil aviation authority to review the framework for   economic regulation for capacity expansion at heathrow ensure the model provide strong incentive for cost effective delivery we expect the caa to publish a work paper in november with a view to that work complete next summer 
 this be a landmark opportunity for heathrow for the aviation sector and for the uk economy the government remain fully committed to ensure the expansion be deliver in a way that be timely cost efficient and environmentally responsible i commend this statement to the house 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of change to inheritance tax relief on scotland ’s agricultural sector 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of change to inheritance tax relief on scotland ’s agricultural sector 
 this government appreciate the role of farmer and everyone involve in our agricultural sector and i have be delighted to meet representative of the national farmers union of scotland and other stakeholder on numerous occasion on each i have reiterate that the government want to strike a fair balance between support farmer and fix our public finance and the public service on which our rural community rely as both hon member will be aware the vast majority of farmer will not be affect at all they will be able to pass the family farm down to their child just as previous generation have always do only the rich estate will be ask to pay not small family farm and that be a policy that we on this side of the house be proud to support 
 i welcome the new ministerial team to the dispatch box and particularly the secretary of state who be back as secretary of state for scotland after nearly year farmer watch that response will be think what a load of tosh what representation have the secretary of state and the minister make to the chancellor on behalf of farmer in scotland ahead of the budget 
 as i mention we be in regular dialogue with farming stakeholder and we regularly consider the evidence that be present to we i would stress that while we will always give evidence due consideration indeed the prime minister say that from this very dispatch box last week at prime minister ’s   question we will not deviate from our policy objective which be both to raise revenue and to introduce great fairness to our tax system that be exactly what this change do 
 it be clear that scottish labour and this government do not care and do not understand our rural community if we have no farmer there be no food will the minister listen to the voice of rural scot nfu scotland and communitie up and down this country and ask the chancellor to rethink this ruinous inheritance tax reform 
 i myself be a representative of rural scot as indeed be the secretary of state for scotland who be meet farmer representative in his constituency this very week we be in ongoing dialogue with our constituent and with farming stakeholder i reiterate that what we say in the course of those dialogue be that we must introduce great fairness to the system and that quarter of farmer will not be impact   at all 
 there be many factor that make family farm viable include the ability to work the land and carry out what be a very physically demanding job do the minister agree that tackle the fundamental problem in our nhs and the grow waiting list in scotland must be a priority when balance compete pressure give that poor access to healthcare disproportionately affect those work in scotland ’s farming and rural constituency 
 i could not agree with my hon friend more since the election the uk government ’s plan for change have deliver an extra £ to the scottish government funding that can be use to improve the performance of devolved public service such as the nhs in june an additional £ of funding for the scottish government be announce in the spending review so rural community like my own be right to ask when they will see improvement in their access to healthcare i would also like to take the opportunity to commend charity such as the farm safety foundation and its brilliant yellow wellies initiative for the work that they do to support the mental and physical health of farmer and all in our rural community 
 the propose change to agricultural property relief in scotland   will ensure that by still provide full relief for the   £ of asset farmer continue to benefit   from government support far beyond that which be   available to other asset give that of claimants—117 claimant receive fifth of all agricultural property relief at a cost of some £ do the minister agree that this government ’s reform be essential not only for fairness but to help fund vital public service in rural scotland 
 our reform mean that the majority almost quarter of those claim the relief will not be affect only the rich estate will be ask to pay more this be a fair approach that balance fix our public finance with maintain support for small family farm and business 
 rise 
 order it say scotland in the title for these question they be not link to northern ireland i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the agricultural sector be weave into the fabric of community across scotland it employ thousand and contribute million annually to the economy but farmer across scotland have be leave in fear for their family future and their way of life because this government want to tax they out of existence despite the clear message from the farming community support by the nfus this government be plough on regardless and completely ignore the damage they be do the truth be that they do not understand and bad because those people do not vote labour they do not care do they 
 i will reiterate it in case the shadow secretary of state do not hear i both myself and the secretary of state represent semi rural and farming constituency we be in ongoing dialogue with constituent we absolutely understand the pressure they face which be why we have say that we will support family farm and that only the very rich will be affect our constituent rely on public service and they require investment in those public service and that be exactly what this tax change be design to do introduce fairness but also raise revenue that will benefit all our community include rural scot 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 archibald young a foundry in my constituency manufacture component that be vital to our national security yet it now face a devastating blow from labour ’s tax change we be hear that food production another cornerstone of national security will also be decimate by these measure this issue go to the heart of the protection of our country do the minister agree that scottish business that be essential to national security must be safeguard and will she commit to meet i and other with similar concern to discuss that 
 i would be delighted to meet the hon lady and i welcome she to her new position food security be indeed national security and national security be the no priority of this government we be try to safeguard it in a number of way include through our commitment to food security and indeed energy security i would be delighted to discuss it with she far 
 what assessment he have make of the contribution of north sea gas and oil to energy security 
 oil and gas from the north sea will remain part of our energy system for decade to come as a government we be strengthen our energy security and as part of that effort we be invest in home grow   clean power and energy through great british energy we be committed to a fair and orderly transition next week i will be in aberdeen to meet energy company from across the north east 
 we all know that the government ’s energy policy be unsustainable it have even be report that the department for energy security and net be look at authorise tieback to access new oil and gas well use exist infrastructure in the north sea will the secretary of state acknowledge that if we want to increase energy security and reduce energy price for household and business we must expand the use of the energy resource available to we include north sea oil and gas 
 as i seek to reflect in the answer oil and gas will be a central part of our energy mix in the united kingdom for decade to come but it be also right to recognise that there be a transition that need to be manage and there be an abject failure by the previous government to manage it that be why we see ten of thousand of job go in the north sea without the level of investment that we be now see from gb energy to manage that transition effectively 
 do the secretary of state agree with i that the conservatives have get a cheek some job drift out of the north sea under their government and they do not lift a finger this government along with the scottish government invest £ in a transition fund to help oil and gas worker move into energy job that will be an uneven transition but it be an inevitable do the secretary of state agree that that be what come from have a government with an industrial strategy that put worker 
 i find myself in agreement with my hon friend from the western isles the north sea have provide decade of good job not just for people from the western isles and across scotland but from the whole of the united kingdom the last conservative government do not believe in industrial strategy it be as basic as that it be not just a difference of policy it be a difference of philosophy we believe in open market and an active state that be why we set up gb energy that be why there be a transition fund and that be why people can rely on labour 
 i welcome the right hon gentleman back to the dispatch box as secretary of state for scotland after his sabbatical over the last or so year the messianic zeal of his colleague the energy secretary to see the destruction of our oil and gas industry be have real life consequence scottish worker be be make unemployed in their thousand while this government ban the drilling and exploration of oil and gas in british water and import more gas from norway which get it from the very same sea that we be prevent from exploit come on secretary of state it be all a little unhinged be n’t it 
 where to begin we have a government that have invest in gb energy and that have a transition fund up against an opposition that abjectly fail in   their responsibility towards the north sea we just hear from my hon friend   the member for na h eileanan an iar torcuil crichton   that job be lose that be the record that they own and we will continue to point it out 
 the secretary of state for energy be not the messiah week after week i come to this chamber to ask energy ministers and scotland office ministers why they be content to sacrifice of this country ’s great national asset and allow highly skilled worker to go on the scrap heap or go overseas as scotland ’s man at the cabinet table the secretary of state know that his job be to speak up for those people who be lose their job today not to defend the secretary of state for energy will he explain that to the people of aberdeen when he visit next week 
 i gently remind the shadow secretary of state that there be a difference between abuse and argument and in relation to his substantive argument of course i be happy to be scotland ’s voice at the cabinet table that be why only next week i will be meet a range of energy company base in aberdeen and listen directly to they that dialogue have already start i think we can do well than his question 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to support regeneration in scotland through the pride in place programme 
 what step he be take with cabinet colleague to support regeneration in scotland through the pride in place programme 
 the scotland office be back scotland ’s community with our £ pride in place investment the plan will support grassroots movement that restore local people ’s power boost national pride and help people get on in life it will revitalise our high street create job and improve safety and security more than that it will give expression to this government ’s core belief that community be powerful and that in every corner of our country we find million of so call ordinary people do their good and do their bit to transform the place they love for the people they love 
 the uk government be invest more than £ of funding in my constituency include the recently announce pride in place award that will unlock the potential of my west dunbartonshire constituency match the level of ambition i have to regenerate our town centre and community and make they fit for the future do the secretary of state agree that this be in stark contrast to the snp which have give up on our community right across scotland and in west dunbartonshire 
 i commend my hon friend on his ambition for his seat and his sterling advocacy for it he be right that this funding will help revitalise our high street create job and improve safety and security in   scotland he be also right that the snp be desperately out of touch with its squabble over independence while service across scotland be at break point 
 since the election last year when labour come to power our constituent in scotland have see their friend in england and wales see real improvement in their community and public service while they look on and wonder what the snp government be squander scotland ’s share on do the minister agree that key to the success of the pride in place funding and project include the £ come to lanarkshire be that we be put power directly in the hand of people to make decision about investment in their own community 
 my hon friend be right that both her constituent and mine look with some envy to the other side of the border where million of extra nhs appointment have be secure while waiting list in scotland go up and up local community be at the heart of scottish life which be why we be give they control over hundred of million of pound of investment to revitalise their high street take ownership of important local asset and build thriving and prosperous place to work live and visit 
 the government ’s pride in place initiative their equivalent of level up should be great and should be feel across scotland but unfortunately we be feel the opposite in north east scotland because of the government ’s energy policy our high street need regeneration after a decade of disastrous decline in the sector whether that be from snp or labour policy how will the government act to ensure that our high street in north east scotland will not be far decimate 
 i remind the hon lady that of course her constituent benefit from a city region and growth deal there be investment go into her area if she have complaint about the decline of her constituency i suggest that she look at her colleague and hold they accountable for year of catastrophic economic mismanagement by the conservatives 
 as long as i get any opportunity i will continue to ask why perth and perth and kinross be not get penny from the current allocation why have perth and kinross never have single penny from any government allocation why do this labour government take away the £ that we finally get from the conservative finally when be perth and perth and kinross go to get its fair share 
 the allocation under the pride in place programme have be evidence lead base on datum and on a formula that be progressive and put money into the pocket of those who need it most if the hon gentleman be worried about where money in perth and kinross have go i suggest he ask the minister of scotland who be from his own party and have receive more than £ his constituent like mine will be ask where ’ the money go john 
 what step he be take to help ensure that people do not pay disproportionately high energy price in scotland 
 this government be take action to support vulnerable family this winter include by expand the warm home discount scheme which mean that more than household now benefit from that £ payment in scottish household 
 will the minister acknowledge the unfairness that my constituent in skye and indeed people all across rural scotland and rural great britain be pay time as much to heat their house use locally generate renewable electricity often while look at wind turbine outside their window than those in city who heat their house use import high carbon gas which be largely due to the fact that the environmental tariff fall wrongly on the renewable and not on the carbon fuel gas 
 community can feel tangible benefit but those community benefit be largely voluntary at the moment the hon gentleman make an important point however that be why this government be consider mandate the provision of community benefit fund for low carbon energy infrastructure across the united kingdom we will have more to say in our plan when they be set out later this year 
 it be estimate that more than household in glasgow live in fuel poverty the uk government ’s extension to the warm home discount will mean that many of those family receive money off their energy bill can the secretary of state outline how people can access that support 
 the good news be that those in receipt of pension credit that top they up to a minimum weekly income will continue to receive the discount automatically the scheme be open again this month anyone who think they may be eligible in glasgow or elsewhere across scotland should contact their energy supplier 
 what his policy be on hold a referendum on scottish independence 
 what his policy be on the holding of a referendum on scottish independence 
 i be elect on a very clear manifesto which make clear that this uk labour government do not support independence or another referendum if after year the snp be not prepared to run on its record that beg the question what kind of record have they leave after year in power behind the smokescreen   it have try to create by talk about independence we know the reality in of we on waiting list rise violence and fall standard in our school frankly scotland deserve well 
 i thank the secretary of state for his unequivocal rejection of separatism he will always find on the conservative side fellow colleague who treasure this united kingdom and want to shout about the most successful alliance in political history what specific step can he take to prevent more taxpayer cash be squander as the snp pursue its doom dream 
 as my hon friend the parliamentary under secretary of state for scotland make clear we have commit £ to the scottish government this year the large settlement in the year of devolution there be a very basic question that we scot be ask where ’s the money go john the reality be that our service be get bad not well and we see industrial level waste from the snp that be why it be time for a new direction 
 i too welcome the secretary of state to his place although it seem that his appointment have not be universally welcome indeed i hear that the daily record have ask his labour colleague for their opinion fear an asterisk shortage particularly caustic comrade say 
 if i have a pound for everyone who like douglas i would have 50p 
 but rest assure mr speaker his appointment be welcome with open arm on the snp benches and i have to admit to have a grudging admiration for he as someone who care not about the opinion of other people but with labour tank in the poll and independence the majority view in 
 order mr o’hara this be mean to be a question not a statement 
 well mr speaker the quality of the snp ’s contribution do not seem to have improve since and neither have its argument in the face of fail school and hospital and the inability to build ferry in the hon gentleman ’s own constituency what do we see once again dreary document about independence the reality be that the snp have let scotland down and scotland deserve well that be why we be up for the fight in may 
 the snp ’s renew chatter on independence be understandable because it want to distract from its abysmal record of run down our public service give that its plan for defence in an independent scotland include give up the nuclear deterrent and replace it with little more than a scottish navy comprise the waverley and the vital spark do the secretary of state agree that vladimir putin will be rub his hand with glee at the snp ’s late outburst 
 i be a great fan of para handy the vital spark and the waverley but i would not want to offer they in the face of vladimir putin as an approach to euro atlantic security the reality be that we have student gesture politic from the scottish national party   i meet with the major defence company in greenock last friday and they be very clear that we be forgo industrial opportunity now there be a real cost to the incompetence and student naiveté of the scottish national party 
 business in my constituency and across scotland need stability certainty and opportunity do my right hon friend agree that that be what they be get from a labour government which stand in stark contrast to the instability and uncertainty of the snp and its obsession with independence 
 return to the dispatch box as the secretary of state for scotland i think it be strike that the snp ’s answer be no well than they be in or i simply ask what be its policy on a scottish currency what be its policy on foreign reserve what be its position on a scottish pension it be no well at answer those question now than it be year ago 
 may i join other opposition members in welcome the secretary of state to his place i wish he well in that job 
 my hon friend   the member for argyll bute and south lochaber brendan o’hara   be not the only with a quote that might be of interest to the secretary of state i have another here can he tell we who say this if there be a majority”—an snp majority—“it have get to be look at in westminster who say that 
 i sense that it might be myself we would take seriously any snp majority but if the snp be return to office i hope it will do well than it have do over the past year i assure the hon gentleman that we on the government benches be not anticipate defeat we be work for victory 
 well this might get just a little bit awkward the quote be not from the secretary of state although i welcome his contribution it be actually from his boss the leader of the labour party and the current prime minister who be about to turn up that be very awkward indeed—[interruption there he be will he stick to that commitment or will we see labour break yet another promise 
 not least because he have just turn up let i say that i always agree with my boss the reality be that we be clear and unequivocal that we do not want the break up of the united kingdom as scot we make our choice in and that be for a well future within the united kingdom 
 what recent discussion he have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on fiscal step to reduce the cost of live in scotland 
 this government be work tirelessly to reduce the cost of live in scotland we have introduce   a national living wage deliver a generational upgrade to worker right and help the bank of england to cut interest rate time put money into people ’s pocket across scotland furthermore thank to our stewardship the international monetary fund forecast the uk to be the fast grow g7 economy this year 
 scotland be the only part of the united kingdom where child poverty be fall and it be also the only part of great britain with a non labour government i be sure the minister agree that the rest of the uk deserve well so will she be call on the chancellor to scrap the child cap in the upcoming budget 
 a child poverty strategy be on the way and will be release in due course i can underscore our commitment to fight child poverty with every breath we have that be what labour government have always do and it be what this labour government will do too 
 this weekend thousand of people will march in edinburgh to say that scotland demand well we be right to do so because the poverty alliance say that in adult in scotland around people be live in food insecurity what be the scotland office and the wide labour government do to end food insecurity for scots 
 our commitment to end poverty be clear we have have a clear focus on living standard work be increasingly now pay and we be focus on ensure that none of scotland ’s child be subject to the poverty that the hon member so vividly describe 
 before we come to prime minister ’s question i be sure that the whole house will know that this weekend the rugby league ashes return for the time since i place on the record my very good wish to the england team who will make the major rumble in london this weekend the of match against australia 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday october 
 on sunday we unveil labour ’s plan to recruit hundred of thousand of worker into clean energy create quality well pay job in every quarter of the united kingdom on monday we announce the new v level qualification to make sure that every young person have the skill to realise their potential on tuesday our ever regional investment summit in birmingham secure £ of investment and today we be announce tough   new penalty to end the scandal of pollution in our river and sea that be national renewal with a labour government 
 yesterday i meet claire throssell who be with we in the gallery today her young son paul and jack be murder year ago this week by her abusive ex husband after a family court order that he should have unsupervise contact with they claire ’s bravery and her campaign be humble and today i be pleased that we can announce that we will repeal the presumption of parental involvement put child ’s safety 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 i associate myself with the prime minister ’s sympathy extend towards claire and i commend she for her bravery 
 i regret to inform the house that yesterday there be a very serious breach of national security when my prime minister ’s question be photograph head into no in a transparent folder the nation can rest easy as on this occasion no state secret be reveal however it do make i wonder whether this government can be trust with a digital id scheme that be mandatory in all but name laughter i like to keep the prime minister on his toe will he reverse this misguided scheme or will he persist with a plan that make all of our personal datum vulnerable to hack and attack 
 i thank the hon member for her question the whole point of digital id of course be that you can not see it so that should at least deal with her concern it be important that we make access to public service as easy as possible for people we all know the difficulty that so many people have with accessing service and digital id have be show in other country to help i do think this be an important step forward i also think it be very important as part of our plan to tackle those who be enter our country illegally 
 the number of household in cornwall in temporary accommodation have increase by in year so i be delighted that this labour government be invest £ in social and affordable housing in cornwall we be develop a strategy to provide housing at site such as pydar in my constituency which need support from homes england will the prime minister arrange for we to meet the housing minister at our homes cornwall launch next month to accelerate discussion on a strategic partnership for cornwall so that we can build the right home in the right place for local people 
 i know that the housing minister will be delighted to meet my hon friend to help unlock new home for her constituent we be work closely with local authority through our small site aggregator to build new affordable home on brownfield site my goal be to restore the dream of home ownership which be steal by the opposition when they be in government 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 may i pay tribute to the former conservative mp oliver colvile who have very sadly pass away after a long illness colleague will remember he for his love of cricket and of course hedgehog he will be very much miss 
 victim on the rape gang survivor panel have resign and they have resign because they have lose all confidence in the government ’s inquiry so i be give my question to of they to fiona she say 
 be dismiss and contradict by a minister when you ’re tell the truth take you right back to that feeling of not be believe all over again 
 fiona ’s question be simple 
 what ’s the point in speak up if we ’re just go to be call liar 
 i thank the right hon lady for raise that on behalf of fiona let i give fiona and the house my answer the grooming scandal be of the bad scandal of our time woman and girl be abuse and exploit by predatory gang of man and survivor have be ignore for many year include by the state which of course be suppose to protect they my vow to fiona and to they be that this national inquiry will change that 
 i do acknowledge that in recent day some member include fiona have decide to step away from the panel should they wish to return the door will always be open but even if they do not we owe it to they to fiona and to the country to answer the concern that they have raise the inquiry be not and will never be water down its scope will not change it will examine the ethnicity and religion of the offender and we will find the right person to chair it 
 i can tell the house today that dame louise casey will now support the work of the inquiry and it will get to the truth injustice will have no place to hide 
 i doubt that fiona will be satisfied with that answer the prime minister say that they could return to the panel if they wish to why would they do that the government have be engage in a briefing war against survivor elizabeth—[hon member shame they say shame why do they not listen to what elizabeth have to say elizabeth who be abuse in rotherham from the age of have this to say about the government 
 it have create a toxic environment for survivor 
 they be look for answer from the prime minister and what they have hear be labour mps say shame at their word 
 yesterday the safeguarding minister   the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips say that elizabeth be wrong who should we believe the prime minister ’s safeguarding minister or elizabeth 
 let i put on record my respect for all the survivor who have be through the most awful ordeal and i want to thank those who have be involve so far for their work in the process what we be try to do be to get this right and to have an inquiry with survivor at its heart as the safeguarding minister tell the house yesterday that be obviously not   easy they have all come with difficult experience there be a wide range of view understandably and every survivor do bring their own painful experience to this the survivor meet the prospective chair this week and we want they to have the chance to engage i want survivor to be at the heart of this i want an inquiry that can get to the truth these be the hard yard i accept that but i want to press on and get this right 
 the prime minister say that he want survivor to be at the heart of this but in his pmq this year he say that we do not need a national inquiry when he do all of these labour members cheer they be nod their head include the safeguarding minister they vote against the national inquiry time interruption yes they do they vote against the national inquiry time so the victim do not believe they they can say no as much as they like but it be on the record they do not like it but it be true now of the victim have quit contrary to what the prime minister have just say and what the home secretary write this morning the victim believe that the inquiry will downplay the racial and religious motivation behind their abuse be the victim not right when they call it a cover up 
 let i reassure the victim and the house that the scope of the inquiry will not be dilute and we will not shy away from cultural or religious issue it be i who commission baroness casey in the place she give i her recommendation in relation to a national inquiry and we have in the month since then finalise the panel and be try to get the leadership of this inquiry right with survivor   at the heart in that period we have also reopen historical closed case i have long argue that the criminal route where it can be pursue be the right route for perpetrator 
 we have introduce mandatory reporting of child sex abuse which i happen to think be a vital safeguard i have be campaign for that for over a decade i ask the last government to introduce it and that fall on deaf ear that mandatory reporting of child sex abuse be something that each and every conservative member vote against early this year we have give victim and survivor the power to seek an independent review of their case but in relation to this inquiry i want to go as fast as we can to get the justice that be deserve and i want to ensure that survivor be involve in that we be balance the to get this right and   i will continue to do so 
 the prime minister be talk about mandatory reporting i will remind he what fiona ask what be the point if the victim be not go to be believe what would be the point of mandatory reporting all of this be happen now all that he be say be because of those victim resign from the survivor panel if they have not do that the government would have continue with the watering down which we all know they be carry out so yes the victim be right to be worry 
 the prime minister also talk about look for a chair it have be month since we call for   a national inquiry—10 month it be shocking that the   government still do not have a chair of the final candidate have pull out leave a former police officer who the victim do not want what they do want be a judge they deserve a judge we be talk about the industrial scale rape of woman and girl unlike most of the inquiry go on why be it that this inquiry do not deserve a judge 
 can i answer that it be a serious point because whether the inquiry should be judge lead be look at by louise casey she decide against that for a reason and her reason be twofold i will spell they out the be the speed with which we could do this and it would have been—[interruption they ask the question the reason be the speed with which we could do this the be really important i be absolutely determined that criminal investigation would go on at the same time as the inquiry of the problem that judge lead inquiry run into i have see and experience this myself be that they be often hold back until the end of the criminal investigation and i be determined that we would be able to run the together it be because of that that we have be able to reopen historical case at the same time 
 the leader of opposition ask what be the point of the mandatory reporting that she vote against i do not think she understand how it work this is—[interruption this be mandatory reporting of those who have have allegation make to they and there be clear enough evidence that they have not then pass that on that be a fundamental problem in the system that be why we have change the law the conservatives should hang their head in shame for have vote against that vital protection 
 the prime minister should hang his head in shame for call this a far right bandwagon when we raise this issue the deputy leader or the future deputy leader we all know who be go to win call this a dog whistle 
 what we need to think about right now be the victim and the survivor i speak to of they yesterday let we remember that these be victim who waive their anonymity an incredibly difficult thing to do and they believe that the safeguarding minister have lie to they and about they of the survivor have say 
 jess phillips need to be remove because i do not think her conduct during this have be acceptable for the position that she hold 
 interruption those be not my word those be the word of a survivor it be a shame that labour mp be drown that out the hon member for birmingham yardley have clearly lose the confidence of the victim do she still have the confidence of the prime minister 
 order can i just say that even if we be quote somebody else we should not quote a direct allegation against a member of this house i be sure that that be not what be intend 
 i respect the view of all the survivor and there be different view i accept that but i think the safeguarding minister have probably more experience than any other person in this house in deal with violence against woman and girl and alongside she will be louise casey these individual   have spend decade decade stand up for those who have be abuse and sexually exploit and i absolutely think they be the right people to take this forward 
 the safeguarding minister do not have more experience than the survivor the fact be that just a few week ago the prime minister be stand there tell we he have full confidence in the good friend of a convict paedophile so it be no surprise the people have no confidence in what he be say the victim have say that she should be sack we on this side of the house believe that she should be sack because this be about labour failure labour never want this inquiry we demand it it have be labour run council trafford bradford blackpool that have try to suppress the truth it be labour ministers attack the victim we be stand up for they how be it that whether it be rape or chinese espionage when the prime minister be in a position to do something about it it be always someone else ’s fault 
 my priority be listen to and stand up for the survivor that be why we be do the work on the inquiry why we have reopen the criminal case and why we bring in mandatory reporting i would gently remind the conservatives that they have year in office and they barely mention this issue and where there be inquiry they fail to act on they we have do more in the time we have be in office than they do in long year 
 mental ill health affect in of we and it cost this country up to £ a year so will the prime minister join i in thank the staff at maghull health park who do a brilliant job in look after those suffer from mental ill health will he wish they well with their plan to set up a world lead research and innovation centre which will make an enormous contribution towards this government ’s state aim of give mental and physical healthcare equal priority 
 of course i join in thank the staff at maghull health park we be invest £ to bring down mental health waiting list vital in continue to drive down inactivity and help people to get the care that they need in the upcoming multi year capital budget we will enable nhs trust to accelerate decision on local priority and that could include development like the mental health digital research centre that my hon friend champion 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i agree with the prime minister ’s word about claire throssell i agree with he that it be right that we change the law and i hope that it be name after her son jack and paul 
 give the revelation about royal lodge do the prime minister agree that this house need to scrutinise the crown estate properly to ensure taxpayer interest be protect the chancellor herself have say that the current arrangement be wrong so will the prime minister   support a select committee inquiry so that all those involve can be call to give evidence include the current occupant 
 it be important in relation to all crown property that there be proper scrutiny i certainly support that 
 i hope the house can look at that properly and that all people can be summon to the relevant committee 
 turn to the economy i know labour members be relieve they be finally allow to say that the conservatives brexit deal be a disaster but that can not just be a political ruse to attack   the hon member for clacton nigel farage however much he deserve it even bad give that we still have the high inflation in the g7 it must not be a smokescreen to raise taxis on ordinary people it must be a call to action will the prime minister act now to repair the brexit damage by negotiate a new uk eu custom union to boost britain ’s trade and grow our economy 
 no i do not think that be the way forward what we have do be to have a much close relationship with the eu recognise the damage do by the flawed brexit deal that the conservative party negotiate we have also strike deal with india and the us secured record investment into this country and have the fast grow economy in the g7 in the half of this year 
 this summer i visit every road across the bexleyheath and crayford constituency report pothole to ensure that the £ give by this labour government to the conservative control council in the london borough of bexley be spend however the conservative council cabinet member responsible for road write to our local newspaper ask that i stop report pothole because it be cause work for the council will the prime minister join i in urge my conservative council to get on and spend that money to make road such as mayplace road east safe to drive on 
 so this be a local conservative council tell my hon friend not to point out pothole in case it have to fill they that be outrageous just like the record of the last year we know how problematic dangerous and costly pothole be to driver that be why we have deliver record investment to maintain our road and fix pothole that be £ that money have be give to council but it come with string my message to the council to reinforce that be clear use the money fix the road and show how you be carry out repair or lose the money it be council that should get on with the job of fix our road   i will make sure the roads minister follow up with my hon friend 
 give that the tuc have calculate that the wealthy of household in the uk hold more wealth than everyone else in the country put together do the prime minister agree with i that it be inequality not immigration that be a threat to our country 
 we need to deal both with level of immigration and with inequality and that be what the government be do as we get on with try to boost our economy may i gently point out that if we want more equality and if we want our economy to be strong the hon lady ’s party need to start vote for some of the measure that will make it necessary 
 in march i give birth to my son by emergency c section both my son and my life put at risk by a fail maternity service in nottinghamshire we know fail maternity service far too well with harm cause to mother baby and father over family involve in the donna ockenden inquiry do the prime minister agree that grief must be the engine of change and that where previous government have fail it be imperative that this government transform maternity service so that every birth be an informed birth and every birth be a safe birth 
 i extend my gratitude to my hon friend and to all those who speak in the baby loss debate last monday for their powerful and move story i be at the pride of britain award on monday night and very many people come forward to i have hear some of the speech from this house particularly the personal testimony so i assure she that those story really do have power in make the argument we do need to fix what need fix so we will fix maternity service improve safety and make sure every mother be hear and get high quality care 
 my constituent have so many question they would like to ask the prime minister but i will settle for today can the prime minister define when grey belt be really grey 
 let i give the right hon lady a simple example we have an example of green belt land that be in fact a car park where building do not take place and non green belt land that be an open playing field where building do take place that do not make sense to i that be why we have our policy 
 year old millie blair from oundle join we today in the gallery along with her mum gemma her sister jessica and her dad gordon on millie ’s birthday she be diagnose with a rare bone cancer which lead to her leg be amputate millie attend prince william school but she can not access the low playing field because the slope be too steep her parent the school and i have ask the east midlands academy trust to put in a ramp but it have refuse claim that it be not subject to certain part of the equality act do the prime minister agree that the trust have an absolute moral obligation to make those adjustment to give millie full access to all the school so that she can play and thrive with all her friend 
 i welcome millie to the gallery i appreciate that member on the opposition benches can not see she but she be look down at we and    smile with the courage and positivity that i know be everything to she we absolutely salute that we be humble by it hon member hear hear i really do find it hard to understand how a school trust could make a decision like that in relation to the ramp rather than berate those in the trust from the chamber i would just implore they on behalf of everybody here and millie in particular to look again and hopefully with the endorsement of the whole house to reconsider that decision put in that ramp and match the positivity and the courage that millie have show all of we i thank my hon friend for raise that campaign 
 have report that local election across the country will be delay for a year in a row the leader of my local authority surrey county council have have to go on the record to say that he have not call for election to be cancel but other conservative clearly have can the prime minister give i a cast iron guarantee that my constituent in woking and other across the country will not lose their democratic right to vote 
 the hon gentleman know that we inherit a situation where local council be underfunde and million be waste on duplication by reform the system which be what we be do we will save money and reinvest that in improved public service in response to the hon gentleman ’s question we expect the election in surrey to be for the new unitary council and we will be set out the plan timetable very shortly 
 central to grow our economy be deliver major event that drive footfall and investment do the prime minister share my disappointment that since reform take over the running of durham county council it have slash funding for durham pride which bring in people a year reform member can not cope with accountability mr speaker reform have also cancel the lumiere festival which have bring nearly people into county durham since it start this will undermine business and community do the prime minister agree that if reform can not run county council it certainly can not run scotland wales or our united kingdom 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to point out what voter in durham can see what people get if they vote reform be total chaos and broken promise council have a vital role in our community it be not just durham where reform be do this i think councillor in kent have just be suspend for bring the party into disrepute which be quite something for a party whose welsh leader accept russian bribe to spread putin ’s propaganda 
 weston hospicecare provide an invaluable service for constituent with a terminal illness the hospice now face an increase national insurance bill of £ a year as a result of the chancellor ’s job tax the prime minister will know that the money he have announce for capital expenditure can not be use for day to day running expense and that the money he have announce for child ’s hospice    will not benefit weston hospicecare so what help can he offer the hospice as it struggle under the tax burden impose by his government 
 we be put in the support that we can for hospice and the money we put aside at the budget for the nhs be absolutely crucial in relation to that the nhs be underfunde for long year we have now put in the funding that the nhs need to do its work 
 december will mark the anniversary of the storm desmond flood that devastate my constituency and force thousand of people from their home despite promise we new flood defence previous conservative governments leave they unfinished with climate relate rainfall forecast to increase in the north west over the next decade do the prime minister agree that the climate change sceptic policy peddle by some opposition party be both reckless and dangerous and will he assure the people of carlisle that this labour government will defend our great border city 
 my hon friend be right that the tories leave our flood defence in their bad state on record we be build they up again invest over £ to protect home and business we have deliver over flood scheme in our year and i want to see even more rapid progress my hon friend be a superb champion on this issue and we have provide £ to complete the feasibility study for strong defence in her constituency 
 as last week ’s urgent question highlight jhoots the pharmacy non provider be effectively de facto bankrupt and possibly even insolvent too last week we discuss at great length the impact that be have on patient secure their prescription it be now become increasingly evident that while his majesty ’s revenue and customs be be tell by jhoots that staff be be pay they be not lana olivia gulston and blake horwood in my constituency have not be pay since july they be resort to the kindness of friend and the support of food bank to make end meet 
 the minister for care the hon member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock be do fantastic work to try to drive forward modernisation of the regulation but this situation be now impact the work of the department for business and trade hmrc and the department for work and pensions could i urge the prime minister to convene those departments alongside the department of health and social care to secure a well fair deal for patient and for those who be currently trap in employment not be release by be make redundant and not be pay 
 i thank the hon member for raise this serious issue as he have do on a number of occasion it affect both his constituent and other across the country it be simply unacceptable that customer and staff have be so badly let down i know he will be meet the relevant minister but let i update he now in a couple of respect official be currently review whether the integrate care board and general pharmaceutical council need additional power to address   pharmacy business that do not play by the rule i think that be exactly the point he raise that could include power for the council to go after business owner in addition to the pharmacy professional more detail will be provide when the hon member meet with the minister but i think it helpful to give those indication 
 well over youth club have close in this country since have a huge negative impact on our young people this be despite the fact that youth club have a long positive history of help young people to mature in a healthy fashion in particular phab club help disabled and non disabled people to build friendship in an inclusive environment the phab charity be here in parliament later today to gain support for its work will the prime minister commend its work and consider how good to support the youth club movement to help the next generation of young people grow into well adjust adult 
 i thank my hon friend for his question he be a credit to his community i know at hand that he have do so much hard work to help to heal to rebuild and to look to a bright future for southport i welcome the phab charity to parliament it do fantastic work to help break down barrier i be proud that labour be back our youth club with £ of grant funding double the number of youth hub and provide a youth guarantee with earn or learn guarantee for our young people our national youth strategy will be set out in the autumn 
 last week i invite the prime minister to match the conservative pledge to scrap business rate for our   high street however he decline instead he point i towards the small business strategy since then business have be in touch to tell i that the strategy will make little or no difference to their future with high street business expect to close this year alone and with retail business in my constituency face a doubling of their business rate when will the labour government deliver on their commitment to reduce business rate give that they be unprepared to accept our policy of scrap they altogether 
 our small business plan be draw up with small business i send the hon member a copy online i hope that she share that with the small business in her constituency that show what we be do hon member rubbish well conservative members shout rubbish but this be what small business ask we to do there be £ of additional lending to small business and £ extra for small business to scale up and we be deal with late payment in the big reform for year 
 as britain face peril in world war winston churchill take a radical step he change the clock to shift extra daylight into the evening as the clock go back this weekend will the prime minister take a look at the evidence on trialle churchill time again to cut carbon   reduce bill improve road safety boost the hospitality industry and be the prime minister who will brighten up all our life 
 i thank my hon friend for her question we will look at the relevant material 
 many in glastonbury and somerton be force to travel hundred of mile to see an nhs dentist   or suffer in agony fall into debt to pay for private treatment or turn to diy dentistry like jennifer who extract of her tooth over the weekend they simply can not wait for the consultation on the broken nhs contract they deserve immediate action will the prime minister outline what measure he be take to end the dental desert in somerset for good 
 i thank the hon member for raise that add to the list of shocking thing   the last government leave we be the shocking state of   nhs dentistry break like everything else under the last government we be roll out extra urgent care appointment in somerset the integrate care board be expect to deliver over extra dental appointment   this year i will give she more detail in due course we be also reform the dental contract which will shift focus on to retain nhs dentist 
 ahmad al ibrahim be only year old when he be fatally stab in huddersfield his life be cruelly take away in what the police describe as an unprovoked and motiveless attack follow a visit to netherhall learn campus in my constituency last week i know how important this issue be for young people will the prime minister commit to redouble effort to tackle serious violence and knife crime through more visible policing strong prevention and investment in youth service 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that devastating case my thought and i be sure those of the whole house be with the family and friend through our crime and policing bill we be increase penalty for the illegal sale of knife and give police new power to seize knife likely to be use for violence or cause harm we have also launch a coalition to tackle knife crime to bring together campaigner and community leader to tackle the root cause of knife crime and help protect the next generation 
 with permission i will update the house on the step this government be take to realise the benefit of expansion at heathrow airport have invite proposal for a runway early this year 
 today i be launch a review of the airport national policy statement britain want to fly and this government will act to meet public aspiration our review of the anps will ensure that while we unlock long term capacity for more flight at the nation ’s only hub airport we will also meet our obligation to passenger community and the environment today be a step forward for uk aviation and infrastructure support growth in the economy and enable a modern efficient transport system that harness international investment boost connectivity and strengthen uk competitiveness 
 we be committed to make a decision on a runway at heathrow within this parliament and we be clear in our ambition to see flight take off on a new runway in we say we would get on with this and we have when the previous government set up the davies commission it take they year to publish the original draft anps we will get to the same point in month with the process complete by the end of show our commitment to deliver progress swiftly but robustly when we say we back the builder not the blocker we mean it 
 but this be not a blank cheque expansion at heathrow must minimise cost for passenger and customer the taxpayer must not be expect to foot the bill that be why the scheme will be privately finance both the core project and the related infrastructure improvement extra staff and passenger must be able to get to and from the airport without turn the m4 and m25 into europe ’s large car park crucially the expansion must align with our legal environmental and climate commitment start the review of the anps be critical to deliver expansion and will provide the basis for decision on any future planning application 
 the world have change since the last anps review in which be when it be designate new environmental and climate obligation have be introduce and pattern of travel have change however pretty much every uk airport see its busy summer on record we could put our head in the sand and pretend this be not the case but we would be do a disservice to our economy and to the next generation that be why in carry out this review we will consider how any propose scheme must meet clear test that it contribute to economic growth across the country that it meet our air quality obligation that it be consistent with our noise commitment and crucially that it align with our legal obligation on climate change include net 
 we will seek the independent opinion of the climate change committee which i will write to shortly to request this advice while a runway at heathrow have be factor into carbon budget it be right that we update our modelling and seek the view of the ccc give heathrow ’s national importance we will also consider name the airport as critical national priority infrastructure in line with our approach to low carbon energy project we be far consider   whether to name a statutory undertaker as an appropriate person to carry out the project under the planning act provide additional clarity to stakeholder and the local community it be clear that this be a large and complex programme that require a thorough and evidence lead approach over the come month my department will develop analysis on economic and environmental impact of expansion we will also undertake an appraisal of sustainability as require by statute alongside a habitat regulation assessment and other necessary technical work if amendment be need to the anps as a result of the review we expect to consult on an amend policy statement by next summer community will be able to have their say and we will shortly publish an update stakeholder engagement approach to ensure transparency and fairness throughout the process 
 early this year we invite potential promoter to submit proposal for deliver a runway at heathrow proposal be receive and be consider by official from the department for transport the treasury and expert financial and technical adviser follow that assessment potential scheme remain under active consideration a proposal from heathrow airport limited and a proposal from the aurora group we know that we must provide as much clarity and certainty for community investor and user of heathrow as soon as possible so we be seek further information on the propose scheme with a view to reach a final decision on a single scheme to inform the remainder of the anps review by the end of november 
 when make that decision we will consider the interoperability of the propose scheme with exist infrastructure the plan for transport to and from the airport and associate road scheme the land take and impact on surround home and community the evidence that the scheme can be privately finance and the economic benefit of the scheme this government be commit to move quickly but we will also do this properly 
 to deliver the scheme on time the government be also press ahead with a series of enable reform the planning and infrastructure bill will streamline the delivery of major infrastructure include heathrow that include fast consent route and more proportionate consultation on judicial review we have announce that we will work with the judiciary to cut the amount of time it take for a review to move through the court system for national policy statement and nationally significant infrastructure project we be establish the uk airspace design service to deliver modernised airspace that will initially prioritise airspace design for the london region support both heathrow and the wide network and will also make flight path more efficient so that plane spend less time over london we will initiate slot reform to ensure future allocation maximise benefit of an expand heathrow as well as approve growth at gatwick and luton for passenger local community and business 
 expand heathrow will be of the large infrastructure project in the uk rigorous and effective cost control will be essential to its success both in minimise any impact on airline charge and cost to passenger and in maintain credibility with financial market the government will therefore work with the civil aviation authority to review the framework for   economic regulation for capacity expansion at heathrow ensure the model provide strong incentive for cost effective delivery we expect the caa to publish a work paper in november with a view to that work complete next summer 
 this be a landmark opportunity for heathrow for the aviation sector and for the uk economy the government remain fully committed to ensure the expansion be deliver in a way that be timely cost efficient and environmentally responsible i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state for transport 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for her statement and for advance sight of it 
 the statement should have be bring to the house month ago the secretary of state surely recognise that today mark a delay and an acknowledgment of that rather than a decisive move forward the truth be that this whole process have come about the wrong way round recent announcement on gatwick and heathrow rather than be any clear plan for the future of british aviation be not drive by plan and prepared work but by a clear attempt to divert attention from the government ’s grow list of crisis scandal and cover up however we on these benches welcome the fact that this statement have finally be bring forward to the house because both the aviation sector and passenger deserve clarity as do the local people who will be affect and we hope that they will see sensible mitigation to these proposal 
 can the secretary of state confirm what assessment the government have undertake so far of the total cost of heathrow expansion give that of the central estimate now stand at almost £ exclude an extra £ for further surface access work those figure would quadruple heathrow ’s current asset base which be already responsible for some of the high passenger charge in the world if britain be to remain competitive on the global stage those cost must be keep down not drive up 
 crucially how will the government ensure that the cost be minimise not maximise i be sure that like i the secretary of state do not want those cost directly pass on to airline and then to their passenger in high fare because affordability must be at the heart of any credible aviation strategy maintain affordable flight be crucial for passenger so can she assure the house that the heathrow expansion will not result in significant pass through cost especially with the government ’s rise in air passenger duty the job tax and now real concern over how business rate will affect the aviation sector 
 i understand that the chancellor have claim a runway will be operational by something the secretary of state have reflect today and that she want to see spade in the ground during this parliament of course we welcome the reform that will enable this to happen those reform will not have any tooth however unless the government commit to back our plan to scrap the climate change act otherwise   heathrow expansion will face judicial review after judicial review bogge down the process drive up cost and deliver further delay even labour ’s mayor of london have say that he would not hesitate to launch legal challenge against a runway can the secretary of state commit to ensure that her own labour colleague include those she work for previously and ally will not be the one who prevent this important project from ever see the light of day can the secretary of state also commit to ensure that the associated road and rail link not just into london but to the south be include so that the expansion deliver genuine economic growth and connectivity for the whole of the united kingdom 
 the conservatives would end the constant threat of judicial review and eco lawfare to ensure that infrastructure across the country could finally be deliver on time on budget and in britain ’s national interest it be great to hear the secretary of state ’s word on this from the dispatch box but will those reform relate to the judiciary come into force before the decision on heathrow and the development consent order be make or will they be subject to the current situation we be face 
 we on these benches recognise that great competition be the most effective way to deliver value for money and reduce cost to consumer and i be grateful that the secretary of state acknowledge in her statement that heathrow expansion must minimise cost but the only way to achieve that be through real and genuine competition heathrow ’s current structure have the potential to create perverse incentive that reward high spending rather than efficiency push up charge for passenger and airline i note the commitment that the caa ’s review into economic regulation will begin in november but that review must look seriously and fundamentally at how to embed competition and reverse perverse incentive how do the secretary of state and the caa intend to bring competition to the heart of deliver this project she say that the review would be deliver in the summer of next year will it be before the summer recess so that the house will have time to scrutinise it 
 while this government continue to splurge cash hike up taxis and debt and tie britain up in eco lawfare with their green ally only the conservatives would restore confidence break that cycle and deliver a strong economy with world class aviation at its heart sadly under this government taxis have rise to historic high they have impose a punish job tax and borrowing have soar to the high level since outside the pandemic with £ in annual debt interest payment a runway alone will not shield the country from the consequence of labour ’s economic mismanagement but it be a project that must be deliver correctly and responsibly and put passenger at its heart 
 i be interested in the right hon gentleman ’s comment about our pace of delivery and i roundly reject his criticism on this we be the party that be accelerate heathrow expansion today set out this swift and robust review of the anps to help we determine application swiftly previous work to get a final airport national policy statement by the last government take more than year this government will do it year fast we be get on with the job and take the important and sometimes difficult   decision to get britain building i gently remind he that when his great ally and mentor boris johnson be prime minister he go to such length to duck decision on this issue that he end up in afghanistan 
 the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to care about consumer and cost control and that be precisely why we be review the anps and why we be start the work via the civil aviation authority on the model of economic regulation if we fail to plan for future capacity price will rise and choice will shrink this review will be integral to keep the uk competitive and connect by ensure sufficient capacity sustainable growth and fair competition between global hub airport i agree with he that consumer deserve affordable fare and greener aviation and that be what we be work to deliver 
 the right hon gentleman also ask about climate change service access and our reform to judicial review on service access i can be clear with he that we expect this project and associate infrastructure improvement to be privately finance through the anps review we will be look holistically at public transport requirement be that southern rail access western rail access or how people get to and from central london he will recall that in the spending review we set out the big investment in london ’s transport for over year with £ enable transport for london to buy new rolling stock on the piccadilly line and extra elizabeth line train we will work closely with our colleague the mayor of london and tfl to ensure that appropriate infrastructure be in place 
 the right hon gentleman talk about the change that we be make to judicial review and i would simply say to he that we be act where his government have their head in the sand i be confident that the caa will look carefully at competition issue in the work that it be do i be also confident that ultimately we could create job through expansion at heathrow we could boost economic growth as well as open up new opportunity for trade tourism and travel we will do this properly and that be what we be do by launch the anps review today i look forward to answer further question from other hon member 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i thank the secretary of state for her statement i look forward to the work she do on this anps come to our committee in due course a runway at heathrow combine with all the other agree or likely to be agree expansion of capacity in london and south east airport would involve an increase of passenger which would be more than the number of passenger in london and the south east from i look forward to the climate change committee ’s response to the proposal because it have say that a increase in capacity would be the maximum that would keep the uk compliant with our international legal commitment 
 to return to the specific of the statement the secretary of state say that she seek to minimise cost for passenger and customer but give that the cost of a runway will be between £ and £ how exactly   will that cost not be pass on to the airline and therefore the passenger if the treasury be not go to fund those cost which we know it be not on surface access ever since the building of the terminal the local authority all around heathrow have be push for southern rail access to heathrow heathrow airport have long say and have clarify recently that it will not pay the cost of southern rail access so how do she expect that to be fund if the m25 and m4 be not to grind to a halt and if passenger and worker from the west and south of the airport be to be able to get in and out of the airport how be that to be achieve 
 my hon friend be entirely right to raise these issue we will give very careful and thorough consideration to they in the airport national policy statement review which will take place in the come month she refer to the climate change committee ’s opinion on capacity expansion we be make rapid progress in clean up the fuel that be use in plane and we be make huge effort to reform our airspace so that we can have clean and more direct flight the carbon intensity of flying have to come down if we be to have more plane in the air she be also right to highlight the importance of the regulatory model that be why we have ask the civil aviation authority to do this piece of work over the come month it be align with the review in the airport national policy statement we will say more on that in due course 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the secretary of state for her statement which make the government ’s intent of support the propose runway at heathrow very clear it be good to hear her recognise the complexity of all that will be need to deliver it include major diversionary work on of the country ’s busy motorway we liberal democrats continue to support the right infrastructure in the right place which be why we have always support scheme such as east west rail and northern powerhouse rail however we need the right infrastructure to tackle the right problem and there be many unanswered question about the heathrow runway 
 the new economics foundation have be very clear in its analysis that the environmental impact of airport expansion will erode a lot of our carbon emission reduction plan and many study have question the economic case for heathrow expansion i would be interested to hear from the secretary of state about the danger of rely solely on the private sector to fund large scheme as happen in the case of the channel tunnel which remain an enormously underuse asset partly because of the cost that result from the decision to fund it only through the private sector 
 it be welcome that the secretary of state have make her support for heathrow expansion subject to test but i detect perhaps a slight hint of cognitive dissonance and a contradiction in the government set out timeline for deliver something that they say be subject to test the secretary of state say that she would hear the independent advice of the climate change committee if the ccc decide that the preferred option for    the heathrow runway be incompatible with our carbon emission and our net target will she drop her support for the runway 
 i start by congratulate the hon gentleman on his appointment he refer to new economics foundation research i should be clear with he that the government be absolutely committed to reach net for the whole economy by and that we will meet our climate change obligation as set out in the climate change act we have also be clear repeatedly that any airport expansion proposal will need to demonstrate that they will contribute to economic growth and can be deliver in line with the uk ’s legally bind climate change commitment we will engage with the ccc in the anps review 
 heathrow be only part of the process the expansion of heathrow luton gatwick and bristol airport be factor into carbon budget and the hon gentleman will know that the government will publish our update delivery plan for carbon budget to in the come week we should not see economic growth and our climate change commitment as be inconsistent with each another i believe we can go far fast on clean fuel and technological development but people want to fly and i do not think that this government should get on the wrong side of public aspiration 
 i of all express my sympathy for the secretary of state she know from past experience that this be like watch a car crash in action and it have be thrust upon she by the chancellor she know that heathrow have make the clear commitment that it will not pay for the infrastructure that landing charge will go up and passenger will pay for it and that there be no way that we can meet our climate change target if the expansion go ahead that be why i express my sympathy she have be give an impossible task 
 i have a constituency interest as the secretary of state will know because heathrow be in my constituency she mention that the stakeholder engagement process will be publish shortly could she be a bit more precise on the timescale and on what measure will be include in that the house need to know that in my constituency home will be demolish or render unliveable people will lose their home we will lose school and whole community will go my constituent want to ask where be they go to live where will their child be educate and what will their happen to their community we just need some certainty now and from my point of view it be certain that this be a white elephant it be almost like watch high speed all over again 
 i be sure it will not come as a surprise to my right hon friend to hear that i reject his characterisation of the work i be do i see the expansion as an opportunity to improve our connectivity as a nation to improve uk competitiveness and to ensure that we deliver for business and passenger all across the uk i understand why he raise the interest of his constituent who live close to the propose expansion he ask i for more detail about the consultation timeline if we make change to the anps through the review a consultation will take place on   that next year and we be work on a timeline that would see a new anps designate by the end of next year i give he a commitment to meaningful engagement and consultation in the document that i refer to in my statement we will set out a new stakeholder engagement approach so that people will be treat with fairness we will act transparently throughout the process 
 rise 
 i ask colleague to keep their question short so i can get everybody in 
 i sympathise with   the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell my spelthorne constituency be on the southern side of heathrow airport and the resident of stanwell moor a village of some home be half a mile away from the southern perimeter they have put up with a lot include appal behaviour by uber driver holiday parking and noise pollution in the consultation will the people of stanwell moor be engage with directly i also ask that we measure air and sound pollution and use current level as a baseline so that we can determine the impact of the heathrow expansion 
 in the anps there will be a very thorough review of the noise requirement and mitigation be set out in that document i can give the hon gentleman a commitment that there will be meaningful engagement with his constituent 
 can the secretary of state confirm that this be not a do deal as part of the anps review process will there be a full and independent analysis of the economic cost and benefit the environmental effect and demand in london and the south east give airport expansion elsewhere as she say the world have change since can my constituent who will be seriously detrimentally affect by any further expansion of heathrow be assure that the government have their good interest at heart 
 we will do this properly as secretary of state for transport and as the person who may ultimately be the decision maker on any future planning application i assure my hon friend that i will approach this issue with an open mind and will apply the high standard of professionalism and probity to the process that i be oversee 
 egham in my constituency be mile from heathrow and it be not the fact that it be overflow that i want to ask about today the shadow secretary of state for transport my right hon friend   the member for basildon and billericay mr holden visit the patch on monday and we wait minute while level crossing barrier be down in pooley green the secretary of state do not mention whether train would be part of the consultation will they be within scope if the expansion go ahead we will desperately need to deal with our level crossing and we will need well rail access from egham to heathrow to make this work 
 i agree that we need to deal with the issue of level crossing on the rail network we will look holistically at rail requirement in the anps review 
 i thank the secretary of state for her statement and be pleased to hear that this will be a thorough and meaningful consultation because even though my constituency be not near the airport my constituent in camberwell stockwell and brixton write to i regularly to say that they be suffer from air and noise pollution the secretary of state talk about infrastructure a key point will be ensure that more people use public transport to get to heathrow the reality be that some upgrade to the airport have not have the funding over many year as the chair of the select committee my hon friend   the member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury highlight i want to tease out more from the secretary of state on private funding because in a number of case developer commit to something but then the viability issue come up and the money never seem to appear will she ensure that there be fund to secure the transport infrastructure that will be vital if there be any new airport runway 
 how people get to and from an airport be as important as the number of plane landing and take off so i can give my hon friend an assurance that we will look at these issue closely i point out that transport for london be buy a new fleet of piccadilly line train that have high capacity it be part of a large fleet replacement programme and new elizabeth line train be also be build we will look at the whole issue of how people get to and from the airport because i agree that it be absolutely vital 
 the chancellor have stake her economic credibility and growth strategy on a runway at heathrow the secretary of state say that she be committed to see flight take off from it in yet at the same time she talk about take an evidence lead approach put this project to her test take the advice of the climate change committee and do a thorough economic and environmental impact assessment could she clarify a point for the house because i fear my hon friend   the member for didcot and wantage olly glover   do not get a straight answer if the evidence show that the environmental cost be too great and the economic benefit be too little will she and crucially her chancellor be prepared to do a u turn and can this whole project 
 we see the huge opportunity and benefit associate with expand capacity at heathrow and have a runway there there will be a thorough process which we be start today by review the policy framework in which any planning application will be judge the planning inspectorate will look at that and consider all the issue to do with economic need air quality noise and carbon and then a decision will be take we have an ambition to see plane take off from the runway in but that do not mean that we will not have a thorough process we be committed to that and that be what i be set out today
