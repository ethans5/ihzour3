 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of introduce free school meal for all primary school pupil 
 our government be drive an agenda to break down barrier to opportunity and reduce child poverty around £ be spend annually on free lunch for over pupil this include all child from reception through to year and we have commit to introduce free breakfast club in state fund primary school as with all programme we will keep our approach under continued review 
 knowsley an area in my constituency have the high proportion of obese and overweight child in england accord to nhs datum knowsley council ’s director of public health recently describe to i how this be an issue of poverty and deprivation we know from research into universal free school meal in london that such a policy can reduce obesity rate by up to early this month i get unanimous support from the council when i suggest that knowsley could be a perfect test bed for the roll out of universal free school meal will the minister meet i and the leader of knowsley council to discuss that possibility 
 over pupil in knowsley be support with a healthy and nutritious free meal at lunch time through the department ’s free school meal and universal infant free school meal programme unlike the conservative party we be on the side of parent in make a child centre government a reality my hon friend be a real champion on these matter and i be happy to meet he to discuss they far 
 because the previous government widen eligibility in child could get a free school meal in compare with in in that be despite the fact that few child be grow up in workless household and that the proportion of people on low pay have halve will the minister commit that this government will maintain those level of eligibility 
 the department recognise the valuable role that free school meal play and encourage all parent eligible for the entitlement offer we will continue to review our approach and take a consistent approach go forward 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 both in government and in opposition the liberal democrats have a proud record of championing free school meal for all those who need they however even today too many child from some of the poor eligible family be miss out lib dem lead durham county council have automatically enrol child for free school meal this academic year result in over additional child get a meal at lunch time and an extra £ in pupil premium funding for the county will ministers finally commit to automatically enrol all eligible child in england the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill be the perfect opportunity to do so 
 as i mention we will keep our approach in all government programme include eligibility for free school meal under continued review we be aware of local measure on auto enrolment being trialle and be supportive of the overall aim of such scheme 
 if her department will provide form college with the funding require to support a pay award for teach staff 
 the government do not set or recommend pay in further education however in the midst of tough decision take at the budget to fix the foundation after have be leave with a £ black hole by the conservatives we have reprioritise an additional £ for further education 
 i declare an interest because my husband work at luton form college although this question do not affect he i be proud to have luton form college and barnfield college in my constituency place where young people develop not only their education but their ambition excellent form stay that way only by attract and retain the good staff however with the funding shortfall leave by the last tory government i be concerned that it be our young generation who will feel the loss will the minister outline how form college can use their fund to deliver the deserve pay rise for teach staff 
 i recognise the vital role that form college play include luton form college and i agree that high quality staff be what help to make they great as well as our amazing student that be why we announce an additional £ for further education in the budget and it be why we be release £ of that funding in this academic year so that college can respond to priority include workforce recruitment and retention and use those fund as they see fit 
 balcarra school in my constituency have calculate that if its funding for its form have increase by just over the past year it would now have more than £ extra to keep its school run the head warn i that the   sector be now at break point do ministers recognise what be go on in the sector after the year of underfunding we have have 
 i reiterate that the off £ grant will enable college to respond to current priority and challenge as they see fit include workforce recruitment and retention it be up to those college and form to choose how to use that funding to good meet learner need i invite the hon member to write in if he would like some further information 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the hon member for luton north sarah owen   have ask a very important question the government fund the pay award for school and academise form college but unlike last year not for stand alone form college that decision have already lead to day of industrial action after threat of judicial review the department for education offer some additional funding but only £ of the £ that be need that funding gap have lead to a pay gap and as a result the national education union have more strike plan and the nasuwt be also ballot what be the government ’s plan to end the dispute and end the damage that be be do to those student 
 the hon member will know that industrial relation be a matter for form college themselves in co ordination with the sector lead national bargaining arrangement through the national joint council we encourage open and constructive dialogue by all party in the good interest of staff and student during this critical transition period 
 what step her department be take to encourage read in school 
 get more child read for pleasure be a key part of our plan for change and of our work to drive high and rise standard across education by give all our child the good start in life early this month i be pleased to join the prime minister as he unveil a landmark partnership between school here in the uk and in ukraine base on the power of reading and back by legendary child ’s author include michael morpurgo 
 accord to the libraries for primaries campaign in state primary school in the uk lack a dedicated library or read space and that figure rise to in in the most disadvantaged community as we know read for pleasure be essential to a child ’s academic success and mental wellbeing thousand of primary school still need library do the minister agree that library be vital for child development and what further step can the government take to ensure that every primary school have a library 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the power of reading we all know that reading broaden horizon and nurture creativity and i want more child to experience that joy although sadly   we also know that more and more child in our country be not enjoy read for pleasure under the tories in child be leave primary school without meet the expect standard in reading it be little wonder that they be unable to enjoy read in the way they should through our plan for change we will drive high and rise standard to make that a reality 
 do the secretary of state accept that the use of phonic as the basis of teaching reading have be thoroughly vindicate 
 i do accept the absolutely essential role of phonic it be a labour government who start the roll out of phonic in we need all our child to reach a brilliant standard in reading but as i have just say in currently do not meet the require standard there be so much more that we need to do to ensure that all our child get a firm foundation in those subject and yes enjoy read as well 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 we know that smartphone in the classroom have a negative impact on read and on the educational attainment of child in general when in government we issue guidance to try to ban smartphone from the classroom but the late evidence be clear that they be still far too prevalent in school to fix the problem the guidance need to be put on a statutory footing do the education secretary agree that child ’s educational outcome be negatively affect by smartphone and if she do will she back our amendment to ban they from the classroom for good 
 i agree that phone have no place in the classroom it be entirely right that school take firm action to stop their use and i know that be what the vast majority of school already do as the right hon lady say last july the conservatives say that they do not need to legislate in this area nothing have change in this time i back the approach that they take in july in this area this be yet another headline grab gimmick with no plan to drive up standard in our school 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on support for artificial intelligence research and development in the high education sector 
 the labour government be at the forefront of change and as i say to the bett conference last week we be determined to ensure that 
 ai will be a positive radical modernise force for good in the life of work people 
 the department for education be a member of the ai working group collaborate across government to share thinking and expertise as we develop future policy 
 many of my constituent and local academic have express concern about the cancellation last year by this government of what would have be the uk ’s only exascale computer at edinburgh university   that be not mention at all in the ai opportunitie action plan it would have be a major beneficial development in this sector what discussion be the secretary of state have with cabinet colleague to ensure that this take place and can she reassure the public that the benefit of ai will be spread to university across the uk 
 i appreciate the hon lady ’s interest in this area she will know that the propose exascale supercomputer be programme that the government be consider we be currently assess the good way to take this forward the previous programme be announce under the last government for which full funding be not allocate we be committed to develop a strategy set out a year plan for our country ’s need that plan will be publish in the come month alongside the spending review but i will ensure that official in the department for science innovation and technology pick up her concern and that she receive a full response 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help retain clinical academic in university 
 as autonomous institution university be responsible for their staffing decision include recruitment and retention where the tories leave university on the brink we have act decisively to secure the future of the high education sector we remain committed to restore university as engine of growth opportunity and aspiration 
 the number of clinical academic be in worrying decline these be the people who teach our doctor in university and be conduct groundbreake research consultant clinical academic contract with university give they pay parity with the nhs however the university do not have the funding to match the cost of the new nhs pay structure for consultant i have hear that unable to retain they out of medical school in the country be offer voluntary redundancy to their staff and sometimes not voluntary do the minister agree that we must do all we can to support medical education and research in this country 
 i be aware that my hon friend have extensive knowledge in this area and i seek to reassure he that the government recognise the vital role that clinical academic play in research and education in the nhs although university be independent and therefore responsible for decision on pay we be commit to work closely with education partner to ensure that clinical academia remain an attractive career choice for all include student from disadvantaged background 
 the new pears medical school at the university of cumbria and the lancaster university medical school among other be struggle to recruit and retain medical academic staff in no small part due to the last government ’s somewhat masochistic decision to undermine of britain ’s good export namely the income we receive from overseas student will the minister undo this   nonsense and allow britain ’s brilliant university especially the medical school to help boost the quest for economic growth 
 student be incredibly important to our university and we have some world lead university i will ask my hon friend in the other place to respond to the hon gentleman ’s question 
 what step her department have take to help keep family hub open in kent 
 labour ’s plan for change will get a record share of child ready for school hit key developmental target by the age of family hub will play a crucial part in that we be invest £ in family hub target support where the money will make the big difference to child ’s life chance 
 in deal blossom child ’s centre have be close and the new merged service do not offer the level of service require for to year old and be not fit for purpose what can be do to reopen that much love and sorely miss community asset 
 local authority must engage with family to co design service and ensure that those service meet their need we be invest £ in family hub start for life and through our plan for change this government aim to get a record proportion of child hit key developmental target by the age of if my hon friend would like to write to i on any particular issue i would be happy to take it up departmental official be aware of the case he raise and be work with kent county council to continue to deliver service 
 rise 
 i have not realise that strangford be in kent 
 the issue be in kent and in strangford mr speaker the minister be right to respond on the importance of disability and family hub in kent and in northern ireland we have a commitment to the very same process have she have an opportunity to discuss the way forward here with those in northern ireland so that we can share experience and the good way 
 do the minister wish to answer that question because it be definitely not link 
 i assure the hon member that the secretary of state have have such conversation and will continue to do so 
 what step her department be take to support school require specialist facility for send student 
 what step her department be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability 
 what step her department be take to improve special educational need provision 
 what progress she have make on improve support for child with send 
 what step she be take to improve send service 
 this topic be of interest to many colleague across the house the previous conservative education secretary label the special educational need and disability system that she leave behind as lose lose lose and the shadow minister say that the previous government should hang their head in shame over their record just last week a schools minister of year say that they have let down thousand of child we agree wholeheartedly that be the system we inherit but there be light at the end of the tunnel as this labour government work hard to reform and improve the system 
 some of student at dorset studio school in my constituency have special educational need which be well above the national average and be in receipt of education health and care plan a funding agreement between the treasury and the department for education in february to upgrade the school ’s facility include a new school hall a canteen and specialist teaching facility aim to bring the school up to purpose yet there have be no progress since may will the minister outline what step the department will take to get the ball roll if she do not know will she please meet i so that we can get thing start as soon as possible 
 i appreciate the hon gentleman ’s question and his concern about make advancement improve capital provision for child with special educational need and disability be a priority for this government which be why we have allocate £ of additional investment to create those additional place in mainstream and special school i be more than happy to look at the case he raise indeed it might also be for the under secretary of state for education my hon friend   the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan to look at 
 in oxfordshire the high need of our accumulate deficit be expect to rise to £ by the end of and across england it be expect to rise to nearly £ in the same period do the minister agree that in the long term a shift towards inclusive education early intervention and enhanced support in mainstream school be essential to create a sustainable and effective system that meet the need of all child and young people and will she commit to deliver it 
 the hon gentleman ask an important question and we absolutely need to see a more inclusive mainstream system with an education health and care plan process that get child with special educational need and disability the support they need by do so we will improve the mainstream inclusivity of our school as i have outline we have allocate capital funding for that but we be look at reform on a range of level to ensure that child can be educate in their local community as far as be possible 
 i draw attention to my declaration in the register of members financial interests since i be elect i have hear countless time from parent across broxbourne that the special educational need system be too difficult to navigate and all too often just do not work what action be the minister take to improve the confidence of parent in the sen system 
 i recognise the story that the hon gentleman tell indeed it be tell by many family up and down the country he should recognise that this legacy be leave by the last conservative government for many family and many child let they down we be work incredibly hard to reform our system with a curriculum and assessment review with capital investment and by work with local authority to improve the education health and care plan process and the timeliness of assessment we will continue to do that to clean up the mess 
 i recognise what my hon friend say she have inherit an appalling situation from the last government a recent public accounts committee report bear that out can she give a little more information on how she will reduce the number of family not get timely assessment how will she address the doubling of demand for assessment 
 my hon friend be right to refer to the worrying finding of the public accounts committee on the situation we be in as she rightly identify it be our ambition that all child receive the right support to succeed where possible within mainstream school that will need education health and care plan to be process more effectively but also for mainstream school in and of themselves to be support to become inclusive so that child and their family be not leave wait that will help to reduce the cost of transport because far too many child be be transport to other local authority over great distance and time as they can not be educate locally all these measure will not only drive down the challenge for family but get much well outcome for the money be spend 
 at a recent surgery a constituent tell i that she have fight tory lead hertfordshire county council to carry out an ehcp assessment for her son for well over a year since it conclude she have be force to go to tribunal time in the past year she inform i that she meet resistance from the school and the council throughout after year of neglect by not only the previous conservative government but conservative local council i welcome the step the government be take to reform the send system what assurance can the minister give to my constituent and other in hemel that ehcp assessment will be a priority 
 i be sorry to hear what my hon friend say about his constituent we need to see education health and care plan assessment progress more promptly and we need to ensure that plan be issue as quickly as possible so that child can begin to benefit from the support the department be work closely with local authority that have issue with timeliness there be without doubt a lot more to do but we be determined to improve the situation for child and their family 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 there be child with special educational need and disability in every school across the country often they face unacceptable barrier to participation include school building that be not inclusive or fully accessible what be the minister do as part of the government ’s welcome commitment to inclusive mainstream school to ensure that all expenditure by the department for education on new school building and building refurbishment help to make school more inclusive 
 my hon friend raise an important point we want every teacher to be a send teacher and every school to be an inclusive school we be make progress by invest £ into send and £ into create more inclusive specialist place in mainstream school and undertake the adaptation that may be require in mainstream school to make they more accessible 
 what step she be take to strengthen safeguarding for child 
 the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill be the single big piece of child protection legislation in a generation it will stop more child fall through the crack through landmark reform no more empty word but real action to keep child safe it be a shame that the conservative opposition have play silly game on this subject 
 last week the leader of the opposition dismiss safeguard measure in the children ’s wellbeing and schools bill as a distraction interruption 
 order mr timothy you have be a bit loud recently and i be sure you do not want an early cup of tea today 
 after the tragic case of star hobson arthur labinjo hughes and sara sharif will the secretary of state remind opposition members why those measure be vital if we be to protect child 
 opposition members might not like it but that be what the leader of the opposition say the conservatives have year to stop vulnerable child fall through the crack now be the time for action no more empty word or lesson learn labour have bring forward the single big piece of child   protection legislation in a generation but the conservatives refuse to back it to label the measure a distraction be a new low i encourage the shadow secretary of state to distance herself from those shocking remark 
 the secretary of state should consider what she just say the bill have specific clause about home schooling i know that the labour government do not like any form of education that be not in state run local authority school but those who home school have significant concern that the bill will put unfair burden on they and will change the relationship between those who be lawfully and legally educate their child at home and the state will she meet home schooling representative to discuss their concern and to ensure that while the bill contain the relevant safeguarding those who home school be make to feel that they be contribute to their child ’s welfare 
 parent who choose to home educate their child be within their right to do so those who provide a safe love environment and a good standard of education have nothing to be concern about in the legislation we be concerned about the grow number of child of whom we simply have no visibility the bill will ensure that where there be serious concern about child protection and safeguarding such as where a section investigation be under way the local authority must consent to home education i be stagger that the hon gentleman find those straightforward measure to keep child safe such an outrage they be about protect child 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to ensure that send provision be adequately fund 
 despite have to make tough decision at the budget to fix the foundation key education priority be protect that be how we be able to provide a £ high need budget to help local authority in school support young people with send as i say we inherit a lose lose lose system but we be determined to reform it and restore parent trust the secretary of state and i regularly meet ministers from other departments on special educational need policy to ensure that we take a whole of government approach 
 every headteacher in dorking have tell i that early intervention be vital for our special need child the london business school tell i that hire people with special educational need can be a source of competitive advantage for company do the minister agree that those principle could be the basis of a more financially sustainable and compassionate special educational need system and could avoid tragedy such as that of my constituent jennifer chalkley who tragically lose her life age due to inadequate send provision 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his thoughtful question we absolutely recognise the role of early year education in identify need and   provide timely support we have launch the new send assessment resource and child development training and be identify and support communication need through the early language support for every child programme along with nhs england we will continue to work across government to ensure that child with send get the right support at the right time i be very sorry to hear the tragic circumstance of the case the hon gentleman outline 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests of the big pressure on send funding in stoke on trent be the independent alternative provider that charge ten of thousand of pound for single place often with huge profit margin for themselves we be subject to a safety valve arrangement could i therefore ask the minister to meet a delegation of provider and teacher in stoke on trent who be hungry for a new way of deliver send provision to ensure that our young child get the education they deserve 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about the challenge and pressure on the budget i have identify the need to improve the situation with school transport by educate child locally and to provide more inclusive mainstream place where special school place be require we need to ensure they be in the right place and available for the child who need they i would be happy to meet my hon friend to hear the idea of his friend 
 what step she be take to support free speech in educational setting 
 it be a labour government who enshrine freedom of expression in law and labour be to this day commit to freedom of speech and academic freedom that be why we be press ahead with a robust rigorous and workable high education freedom of speech act and take common sense decision in the national interest 
 unfortunately a minority of teacher subscribe to the sort of dog whistle divisive politic sometimes hear from those on the government benches and from those down here on the liberal democrat benches by the way this have put some child in ashfield off express their own opinion during sensible debate in schooltime do the secretary of state agree that while in the classroom teacher should remain politically neutral 
 i have have the privilege of visit hundred of school across our country and i can tell member that child in the school i visit be usually never backward in come forward with their opinion i would hope that be the case in the hon gentleman ’s constituency too of course school have a duty to promote fundamental british value and be subject to long stand legal duty that prohibit they from promote partisan political view 
 what step she be take to increase the number of apprenticeship 
 what plan she have for the future of apprenticeship 
 the government have a mission to break down barrier to opportunity and we want to rebalance opportunity in favour of young people who have the most to gain from apprenticeship where start have fall by almost we be introduce foundation apprenticeship to give more young people a foot in the door at the start of their work life 
 we be fortunate to have some great apprenticeship provider in aylesbury such as the buckinghamshire college group and buckinghamshire new university when i join pupil from the grange school at their career fair i see at hand their excitement about the apprenticeship option on offer we know that apprenticeship be a win win for young people and for sector face recruitment challenge such as health and social care and construction what step be the minister take to expand and strengthen apprenticeship and to ensure that all young people who choose to go down that route be able to do so 
 my hon friend be a real champion for student at buckinghamshire college and indeed for young people across aylesbury i know the area she represent very well after the conservatives leave we with a collapse apprenticeship system and other skill shortage labour be listen to employer and redrawe the system through skills england a new growth and skill levy and new foundation apprenticeship that be how we will unlock opportunity and drive growth 
 back in the autumn the new government announce plan to reduce the financial support available for level apprenticeship do the secretary of state understand that curtail high level apprenticeship will make it hard to access graduate level skill and qualification in rural area such as north devon where there be no university nearby 
 the government have an extremely challenging fiscal inheritance and tough choice need to be take on how funding should be prioritise to generate opportunity for all employer will still be able to offer and invest in level apprenticeship where they feel they provide a good return on investment we have take advice from skills england which engage with employer on funding for level apprenticeship over the autumn the department expect to make a final decision on affected apprenticeship shortly 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the government have say in answer to write question that they have a forecast for the number of apprenticeship but that they will not publish it for member to see which be a shame at the last oral question the secretary   of state say it be still the government ’s policy to allow employer to spend of their apprenticeship levy money on other thing be not the reason the government will not publish their forecast for the number of apprenticeship that their policy will lead to a sharp reduction in the number of people start apprenticeship 
 we be very confident about what the government be do with apprenticeship our levy fund growth and skill offer with apprenticeship at the heart will deliver great flexibility for learner and employer in england align with our industrial strategy create route into good skilled job in grow industry as a step that will include short duration and foundation apprenticeship in target sector 
 what step she be take to ensure that disabled child have access to specialist teacher 
 high quality teaching be the most important in school factor for improve outcome for all child include those with disability that be why we be commit to deliver our step of recruit new teacher to drive high and rise standard in our school in both mainstream and specialist setting we be do that by bolster pay and condition and restore teaching as a respected expert profession 
 research in june find that only of teacher in mainstream school feel confident about support child with a special educational need or disability today that mean many child include in my constituency be still miss out on learn and leave school without the skill they need do the minister agree that we need more specialist teacher include those for multisensory purpose and for child with visual impairment to ensure every child have the opportunity to fulfil their potential 
 all teacher be teacher of special educational need and disability high quality teaching be central to ensure that pupil with send be give the good possible opportunity to achieve in their education to support all teacher we be implement high quality teacher training reform which begin with initial teacher training and continue through early career training to middle and senior leadership these change and reform will ensure that teacher have the skill to support all pupil to succeed include those with send 
 on friday i have the opportunity to visit manor mead special school where member of staff look after the pupil many of whom have the most severe learning disability and autism i be absolutely blow away by the care of the staff and i be particularly grateful to be show around by the adorable luchia of the pupil will the minister join i in thank all our special school teacher for the amazing commitment they show and on manor mead ’s behalf may i invite she to visit and see that work at hand 
 i thank the hon gentleman for that question and for celebrate teacher particularly in our special school but also throughout our school system who work tirelessly day in day out to support pupil particularly those with special educational need and disability to succeed i will certainly take away his very kind invitation 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill on the early year sector 
 as a government we have have to take tough decision to get the public finance back on track in the entitlement budget will be over £ with a furth £ to support the sector in this pivotal expansion year we have also announce the large ever uplift to the early year pupil premium early year be central to our mission to give every child the good start in life 
 early year provider be be hammer in many case their national insurance cost per staff member be almost double a large number be small business in the private sector while other be school that be take child before they go into reception class all of they both primary school in the state sector and small private provider be worried about the extra cost be impose on they can the minister assure my constituent and indeed people throughout the country that family will not face high cost and that those childcare place will still be there can he assure the house that we will have more childcare place at the end of this parliament than we have at the start of it 
 unlike the conservative party we be on the side of work parent and high quality education will be available to every child as for the hon gentleman ’s substantive point it would help if the conservatives be honest they would not reverse the rise 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the decision not to compensate nursery for the national insurance increase have already push provider to the brink accord to the early years alliance and many in school include school with nursery be worried that they will be next local council receive a bill of £ as a result of the national insurance increase but receive compensation for less than a of that because the indirect cost be not cover can the minister reassure the house that compensation for the increase will cover all the cost to school not just the direct cost 
 the government have announce that public sector employer will receive compensation for the increase in their national insurance contribution include school base nursery and maintain nursery school but in line with the arrangement for other area there will be no additional nic funding beyond that 
 what step she be take to increase the number of child achieve the early learn goal 
 child grow up in our country deserve the good start in life nothing less through our plan for change labour will get a record share of child school ready we will make that a reality through open new school base nursery roll out childcare early intervention speech and language support help for parent of child with special educational need and disability and wide send reform that be rightly ambitious and we be determined to deliver it 
 as a jewish person mr speaker may i take this opportunity to thank you for everything you have do to help the house to remember my ancestor and those of other jewish people whom we remember today 
 welcome funding be announce for abram bryn gates school in bamfurlong in my constituency in the last free school funding round but the school have just be tell that that funding have be pause possibly until it be a really important school because it provide support for kid to stay in mainstream education even when they have leave when can my constituent expect a decision to be make on the funding for this school 
 my hon friend be right to raise that issue on behalf of his constituent i would be more than happy to meet he to discuss it far we be work rapidly through the whole free school pipeline to ensure that we be create place where they be require that include specialist provision and that there be a strong case and good value for the taxpayer 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 today mark the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz birkenau as the year slip away our duty to remember only strengthen i have have the privilege in recent month of listen to the powerful and deeply move testimony of holocaust survivor in person include renee salt and mala tribich it be vital that the world hear their voice hear what happen to they and their family and what happen to jewish man woman and child during the holocaust that be especially important give the shocking rise in antisemitic abuse that we have see since   october the government could not feel more strongly about this which be why we have confirm that the holocaust will be a compulsory topic in all school follow the completion of our curriculum and assessment review 
 i recently launch an exciting new reading initiative across dover and deal call tapp into reading we tour the school and the child read theatrically from a ve day text this will end in may at a theatre will the education secretary join the judging panel then 
 that brilliant initiative show what a champion my hon friend be for his constituent and i will consider his request seriously i would certainly be happy to visit his constituency soon and to work with he perhaps also on how his local school might be able to join the uk ukraine school partnership programme which be base on the power of reading 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i associate myself with the right hon lady ’s word on holocaust memorial day 
 just today another voice come out against the disastrous academy proposal in the government ’s children ’s wellbeing and schools bill the children ’s commissioner say in a scathing letter that end the academy order to turn around fail school will mean 
 child spend long in fail school 
 the secretary of state ’s own back benchers have say that end the academy order would be a huge mistake and would weaken standard instead of run all her policy past union which be more interested in their own power than in teacher pay will the education secretary listen to the children ’s commissioner her own back benchers and headteacher up and down the country when 
 order interruption these be topical question if the hon member want to ask long question she should do so under a substantive question it have get to be speedy punchy question and sharp answer member have to help i 
 it be a labour government who create the academy movement and a labour government will ensure that they continue to flourish the conservative government leave a fail school that continue to let down more than child year after year we will intervene more rapidly and more effectively to turn that around the opposition have nothing to say on school standard they be more interested in their own record than the good outcome for child 
 the education secretary do not understand that her bill will make thing bad not well the legislation be in total chaos at the dispatch box she say that pay will not be cap by the legislation yet we now know that it will be the government can not even do a u turn correctly last week the prime minister tell the leader of the opposition to read the pay amendment but day later the government have still not table it can the secretary of state tell i when it be go to come 
 there be an awful lot in that but very little about how we deliver high standard for our child and that be what the bill be all about the only people in hock to vest interest be the conservative more interested in defend school uniform racketeer and the private school lobby than invest in our state school 
 widely accessible violent pornography be fuel a culture of extreme misogyny and the normalisation of sexual violence and be warp the perception and attitude of both young boy and girl to sex and healthy relationship   what step be the secretary of state ’s department take to encourage school to be proactive in combat the influence of online pornography and the harm experience by young people as a result 
 i strongly agree with my hon friend ’s concern and i be determined to tackle the scourge of misogyny she bring experience to this place 
 order sorry about this secretary of state please member have to sit down they can not just remain stand up when the question be be answer do we all understand great 
 my hon friend bring real expertise to this matter from her experience in education we be review the relationship sex and health education guidance to ensure that school be able to teach what child need to know in the modern world our school staff have a crucial role to play in tackle this issue as well 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson

 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on the impact of government fiscal policy on defence 
 the government ’s plan for change say that we will 
 set out the path to spend of gdp on defence in the spring 
 i be genuinely grateful to the hon gentleman for ask this urgent question it give i the opportunity to reiterate what the prime minister have say what the defence secretary tell the house on wednesday last week and what the minister for defence procurement and industry repeat in the house on friday which be that this government have a cast iron commitment to spend of gdp on defence and that we be already deliver for defence by increase defence spending at our budget we announce an extra £ on spending on defence in the next financial year 
 thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker before i turn to the specific i hope you will indulge i and allow i to say on behalf of his majesty ’s opposition that we join all colleague today in mark holocaust memorial day may we never forget or be complacent about the lesson 
 last wednesday the defence secretary stand at the dispatch box and lay bare the extent of the russian grey zone threat this be not a distant threat but that have be lurk in our own water threaten the united kingdom and our critical infrastructure i hear what the secretary of state say and respond by confirm that he have our full support in stand up to the russians i say that this show why we urgently need to increase defence spending but there be big problem the rest of we be listen but the chancellor of the exchequer be not despite all the evidence before our eye of the grow threat we learn this weekend from multiple source that spend will be delay beyond can the minister disown such talk and specifically confirm that we will hit during this parliament 
 the treasury be not just fail to back more defence spending it be hit our armed force with high taxis on death in service benefit and education the secretary of state confirm on friday that the application of inheritance tax to death in service benefit for the armed force would go ahead we understand that to be cause deep alarm throughout the force community 
 as for the education tax we know that the continuity of education allowance would not be uprated to of the vat impact leave many service personnel thousand of pound out of pocket so since the summer i have call for a full exemption for child of armed force family however in a write answer to i in november on the continuity of education allowance and school vat the minister for veterans and people say that 
 the new vat policy do not offer any exemption 
 yet on friday we learn that child of us armed force family serve in this country and attend british independent school be exempt from vat on   their uk school fee i do not begrudge they that us force be base in our country to defend we but we want the same treatment for our people 
 finally can the minister confirm that the secretary of state will bang on the door of no to demand that the tax on death in service benefit be drop and secondly that british force family be treat the same as their american colleague and grant a full exemption from education vat be it not time that labour back our armed force with action rather than just word 
 i agree with the hon gentleman ’s word about holocaust memorial day his majesty the king have be in auschwitz for the anniversary and he speak for the nation when he say that we will remember this evil long after the survivor of the holocaust have pass 
 i have set out clearly that in the spring we will lay out a path to spend of gdp on defence we will also publish a strategic defence review set out what we will spend the money on and how we will respond to emerge threat as the hon gentleman will know from the defence secretary ’s statement last week we will make it absolutely clear to those who threaten we that we will use the formidable capability available to we to defend the uk and our ally 
 we inherit a situation in which during their entire time in power not a single conservative government spend of gdp on defence the last time that of gdp be spend on defence be under the last labour government we have inherit fall morale a retention and recruitment crisis service personnel live in mouldy broken home and a hollow out and underfunde military that be what the sdr will seek to fix and i hope that the hon gentleman will be able to give we his full support 
 have listen to last week ’s debate the hon gentleman will know that those who die on active service be exempt from the inheritance tax provision he will also know that the defence secretary have uplift cea support to for those who privately educate their child while serve in the military we will continue to support our armed force renew the contract between the nation and those who serve we will publish the defence review in the spring when we will also set out our path to spend 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 we live in an increasingly volatile world so i thank the minister for his clarification on defence spending surely the cost of fight a war notwithstanding the human cost be significantly high than that of have a credible deterrent force the prime minister recently tell i at the liaison committee that the strategic defence review have to be complete before the path to can be plot so why have there be discussion about the timeline for that path before the sdr have be publish 
 we have say that we will publish the strategic defence review in the spring and we will also set out a path to spend of gdp on defence in the spring i do not recognise the publication timeline suggest by my hon friend but he be right that   deter a war be cheap than fight that be why we be continue to support our ally in ukraine and make sure that we have a nato defence policy to deter aggression face the united kingdom and our ally and if necessary to defeat it with formidable capability 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the government ’s commitment to spend of gdp on defence have be shroud in delay and uncertainty at a time when europe face its grave security crisis in decade this be unacceptable promise without a clear path be hollow and the government should commit to set out by easter a detailed and credible plan for reach 
 we must also make the right spending decision and the house of lords international relations and defence committee have raise concern about the capability of the british army what plan do the minister have to reverse the previous conservative government ’s cut to the army he mention retention which be another critical issue improve the live condition of our armed force must be a priority if we be to attract and keep the talent we need 
 finally the ongoing problem of inefficient defence procurement undermine our readiness so what be the minister do to tackle those long stand problem the government must stop drag their heel set out the pathway to and end the uncertainty 
 i have a lot of time for the hon lady but we have be very clear and consistent that we will set out a path to spend of gdp on defence in the spring i remind she that when her party be in government instead of increase defence spending by £ as labour do the liberal democrats and the conservatives budget cut defence spending by £ and cut it by across the parliament in which her party be in power i support the hon lady in want a well deal for our force but i remind she to look in the rear view mirror occasionally 
 order while we be talk about mirror can the hon gentleman look at i occasionally so he be not just star way 
 it be interesting that member on the opposition front bench seem to have forget that when they leave office they leave we with the small army since napoleonic time a lack of ship and aeroplane some of the poor equipment and many problem with procurement it be important that we keep to the timetable on the sdr but give the rumour we be hear and the story in the press will the minister provide an assurance that he will keep this house fully inform on progress on the sdr not provide that information through the press 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that our armed force be hollow out and underfunde over the past year of conservative government but the defence secretary will come to the house to report the strategic defence review and announcement will be make by government about the path to of gdp   i understand the enthusiasm especially that of conservative members to listen to anonymous briefing but we have be clear that this government will treat the house with respect we will be in the house to make announcement on the sdr and on the path to of gdp to be spend on defence 
 i have a simple question would it be compatible with the military covenant to make compensation payment to former member of the ira 
 that be not a matter for the ministry of defence and it be not within my portfolio but if the hon gentleman write to i i will ensure northern ireland office official respond to he however i do not think there will be strong support for such action from much of the house 
 on our journey to increase defence spending it be crucial that we keep the public on side especially give our dire financial inheritance from the conservative party and the hollow out state of our armed force as conservative members have acknowledge that be why i welcome the government ’s break from tradition in inform this house and the british people about their step to deploy a nuclear submarine to respond to yantar the russian spy boat along with the plymouth base rfa proteus what step will the government take in the future over the come week and month to keep the british public inform so that they stay on side as we increase defence spending to respond to the threat from russia 
 i thank my hon friend and constituency neighbour for his question he be right that last week we declassify information about the activity of the russian spy ship yantar include reveal detail of the surfacing of a royal navy submarine to deter the yantar ’s activity loiter above our critical national infrastructure it be absolutely right that this government make the case that warfare have change especially when it come to the protection of our critical underwater infrastructure make the case that we have formidable ability but also be clear in the sdr about how we will invest in those capability alongside our ally be essential the sdr will be publish in the spring when i be sure he will be able to see more about that 
 i be go to surprise the minister and say that i think he be right that the armed force be not big enough when we leave government and that every chancellor since the end of the cold war slash spending because it be the easy thing to do once the ukraine war start because of russia ’s illegal invasion we put ten of billion of pound into the response so my question to the minister be simple if the strategic defence review suggest that we have to spend more money be we go to spend that money or will it be direct to ensure that the amount do not rise above 
 the right hon gentleman be certainly right that the force be hollow out and underfunde which we be seek to address by increase defence spending we have provide £ in the budget   and the path to move from to will be lay out in the spring the sdr will set out what capability we need to have to meet the threat environment against that pathway to spend of gdp on defence 
 the last conservative government do not spend of gdp on defence at any point during their year of power unfortunately the increase that will come will have to address a lot of the damage that that government do to our army our navy and our air force do the minister agree that it take a labour government to deliver those spending commitment 
 it be certainly true that the last time this country spend of gdp on defence be under a labour government the tories cut defence spending as a percentage of gdp over their time in power it be important that the strategic defence review win cross party support when publish i hope that the shadow defence secretary will be able to offer the government a common position so that what be publish will be not just labour ’s defence strategy but britain ’s defence strategy and we can be strong at home as well as secure abroad 
 if labour colleague be go to insist on reiterate that the last time of gdp be spend on defence it be by a labour government i suppose i have to point out that the last time be spend by any government it be by a conservative government and the last time be spend by any government it be by a conservative government both those figure be some time after the fall of the berlin wall when the berlin wall be still up under the present accounting system we be spend up to on defence so please can everyone stop obsess about and when it will come in because we need a lot more 
 i have a lot of time for the right hon gentleman he do not plug his shift the goalpost defence committee report which clearly set out change in gdp spend on defence i believe that he use the report to argue for more defence spending when his party be in power now that we be in power we be do it we increase defence spending by £ in the budget and will lay out a path to in the spring 
 today be holocaust memorial day do the minister agree that this solemn day be a reminder of what we be fight to defend and the need to always protect our value and freedom 
 today be a day when we remember not just all those who be kill in the holocaust but those kill in genocide since it be a day when there be unity and cross party support for tackle hate in whatever form and wherever it come from it underline why we must stand with our friend in these difficult time why we need strong defence and why we need to root out hate wherever it rear its ugly head 
 let i reiterate what the minister be not quite say we be look forward to a defence review that will set out what we need it will not then be circumscribe as a percentage of gdp by some artificial ceiling the   government will spend whatever be necessary arise from the defence review and his department will send a defence review to the treasury untrammelle by any spending constraint we need to address the desperate threat situation that the country be in 
 lord robertson be conduct the externally lead strategic defence review base on the term of reference that be agree with the secretary of state for defence and the prime minister lord robertson will publish it in the spring i hope that the hon gentleman be look forward to it as much as i be 
 under the last government only out of major defence project be be deliver on time and on budget will the minister set out what the government be do to get to grip with the financial mismanagement and fail procurement system that we inherit in defence 
 it be certainly true that we inherit a broken defence procurement system i think broken be the word that the shadow defence procurement minister   the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois use when he be on the defence committee it must make for awkward team meeting give that the man responsible for the break procurement system   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge be sit in those meeting as his boss we have set out clearly that as part of our defence reform work we will create a new national armament director the new defence industrial strategy will be publish in due course which will set out how we will spend more with british company support not just the prime but small and medium sized enterprise in all part of the united kingdom 
 let i try to help the minister understand where the opposition ’s concern be come from it be because of the realisation or suspicion that the arbiter of when and how be realise be not the secretary of state for defence but the chancellor this be a chancellor who scarcely understand the fundamental of economic much less the fundamental of defence and the threat environment that these island face what will the path to look like be there a date or be it when certain criterion be meet also the minister be clear on who the final arbiter will be be the treasury say when you need it or when we decide it 
 the hon gentleman invite i to make the announcement that i be say will come in the spring to answer his concern i point he to the fact that the path to will be set out in the spring 
 during my recent visit to britannia royal naval college with the armed force parliamentary scheme i see the vital role that investment in defence play in support our armed force and create skilled job do the minister agree that unlike the conservative inconsistent defence strategy this labour government ’s £ investment in rolls royce show a clear commitment to strengthen our national security and grow our economy 
 the armed force parliamentary scheme be a brilliant scheme that introduce member across this house to the important work do by our armed force   as a navy brat myself and the proud mp for devonport in plymouth i know the importance of a strong royal navy royal marines and royal fleet auxiliary the £ announcement last week be an important part of secure our nuclear future back job across the country and support job across the entire supply chain it make britain strong 
 the armed force covenant be a promise a promise that together we acknowledge and understand that those who serve or have serve in the armed force and their family include the bereaved should be treat with fairness and respect how be the imposition of inheritance tax on death in service payment of some family of deceased soldier fair and consistent with that 
 it be certainly true that we have a manifesto commitment to put the armed force covenant fully into law that will come forward in the armed force bill in due course we set out from the dispatch box last week that the inheritance tax do not apply to those member of our armed force who die on active service the other area be subject to a treasury consultation and the treasury will make an announcement in due course 
 be it not the reality of the past year that we have few soldier and few navy and air force personnel and that in an uncertain world we need to reverse that trend and grow our military force to deal with those threat 
 it be certainly true that this government inherit an armed force that as world class as they be be struggle with fall morale poor housing and capability gap thank to year of underfunding and hollow out the strategic defence review will set out what capability we need to meet the threat and the path to will set out what will be spend on those capability we also need to improve how we spend because the defence procurement system be break something that be well highlight by   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge   and   the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois   when they be in government that will be fix and we will ensure that we have a strong set of armed force able to deter aggression and defeat it if necessary 
 the minister say the strategic defence review will be announce in the spring but be that the astronomical spring which he will note end on   june or the meteorological spring which end from memory on   may he talk about a pathway to that be a carefully craft phrase from the dispatch box be the pathway short or long can he not give an answer to a straight question when will we hear about when will it be announce what be the date and the year 
 the strategic defence review will be publish in spring this year and the path to will also be announce in spring this year 
 i be grateful to the minister and his department for set out the need for increase defence spending because like so many here i believe we be live through a change   of era where the assumption of globalisation and multilateralism be be refute by reality and it demand the renewal of our modern productive power in defence and the civil economy the simple reality be to that build strong alliance we must maintain and build our autonomy be it not the case that the key fact about all this be that to maintain a good relationship with the united states we will have to spend more on defence 
 i agree with my hon friend that we have to spend more on defence i think everyone in this house agree with that and that be why this labour government be spend more on defence an extra £ as announce in the budget and a pathway to spend of our gdp which will be announce later in the spring 
 it be the minister ’s assessment of cost that drive the decision to decommission bulwark and albion but if the brazilians be go to buy they they can not have be that bad can they 
 let i say very clearly to the right hon gentleman that we inherit a position where it be not plan that albion and bulwark would go to sea for a single day before they be decommission that be the plan we inherit from the conservative government we be look at new capability as part of the strategic defence review and the defence secretary have also commit from this dispatch box to the multi role supply ship project to provide littoral and land capability for our brilliant royal marines who have a bright future in the strategic defence review 
 i think both side of the house can agree that our peace and security be found on strong armed force will the minister therefore welcome the fact that we be spend £ more on defence this year as well as our firm commitment to get to of gdp 
 i agree that it be important that we spend more on defence that be why the chancellor lay out from this dispatch box that we will spend an additional £ on defence in the next financial year it be also why the government have lay out our plan to renew the contract between the nation and those who serve this be about not just kit and equipment but people address fall morale and poor quality defence housing matter to our armed force and that be why this labour government be address those issue 
 a trained and skilled workforce be central to a successful defence policy and i see that at hand during my visit to raf valley where i meet babcock apprentice who attend grŵp llandrillo menai the babcock programme support young people to develop skill so can i ask the secretary of state to ensure that any increase in defence spending include significant investment in training and apprenticeship 
 as someone who have a large babcock premise in his own constituency in devonport i understand the importance of make sure that there be investment in skill it be absolutely right that just as we invest in the skill of our armed force personnel we also   invest in the skill of the civilian who support they that need to happen not just in the prime but across the entire supply chain and that be what be be set out in the defence review and the defence industrial strategy which will be publish in due course 
 i be a strong supporter of make sure that we reach of gdp on defence however may i remind conservative members that of the thing this government do be to scrap a £ contract with a helicopter company that transport conservative ministers around the country do the minister agree that that will help to ensure that our defence spending go on defend the nation not on assuage the ego of conservative members 
 the shadow defence secretary be certainly a regular user of the helicopter so he will be able to advise colleague whether they be good value it be true that the government need to demonstrate our support for our armed force we be do that by make sure that we invest more in defence and we have also give our armed force the large pay rise in year recruit pay be up under this labour government and we be create a new direct entry to cyber to make sure that we can get the people we need in the future it be not just the kit and capability but the people that this government be invest in and we will continue to do so i expect to see more of that in the defence review publish in the spring 
 i would like to see slightly more humility from all political party on the subject of defence spending interruption thank you the minister be right that defence spending be cut under the coalition but we be in a different world now with a great power attack europe i would also like to inform he that of my good friend captain david hicks mc be kill in afghanistan in in part because of the atrocious level of military kit provide to our armed force there so i think all political party need to reflect on their record 
 i think that the whole house will want to pass on its condolence to the hon gentleman and the family of captain hicks it be right that of the government ’s objective be to have a strategic defence review that be also the nation ’s defence review that be not just labour ’s defence policy but that can be support cross party for that reason i have lay out clearly the path and the timetable for our publication of the sdr and the pathway in the spring when that happen i hope we can have a debate about how those capability match the threat and how we can support the sdr as a cross party back defence review that give our troop and our industry the direction and support they need to keep our nation safe 
 on the floor of the house today the minister have state that he wish to have more money for the armed force and he have be very critical of previous procurement exercise by the former government can i therefore ask he whether he agree that give away the chagos   island and pay to do so be a bad deal and that that money would be well spend on invest in our armed force 
 the hon gentleman might have miss the debate in which it be set out clearly that the deal we have secure to ensure the long term future of the chagos island begin under his conservative government—11 round of negotiation under the conservative party i think it be the uk us base on diego garcia be strategically important which be why it be absolutely vital to secure its long term future free from any constitutional threat that be what the deal do and i hope that when it come before the house the hon gentleman will be able to back it just as i will 
 which come the strategic and operational need of our armed force or fiscal parameter set by treasury bureaucrat 
 the strategic defence review will set out clearly what threat the nation be face and what capability we need i would expect to see renewal of our capability because we have see from the war in ukraine that warfare have change some of the assumption about how we structure our armed force and how we fight have be challenge by the experience of warfare in ukraine and that be of the reason why this sdr be so important it will set out the evolve capability that we need and how we will deliver they to keep our nation safe 
 give that the vast majority of the ministry of defence supply chain be in the private sector for example bae systems in fylde at warton and at samlesbury with job across lancashire and that those private company have see significant increase in cost follow the chancellor ’s budget squeeze their payroll cost as well as increase regulation through the employment bill and in other area we will be able to buy considerably less kit for at the end of the defence review than at the start of it as the government go through the defence review process be they cut the shopping list or plan to go above 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question and i support the work of the private sector business that do so much to support our armed force the need of our armed force will change and be change that mean change capability but it also mean a change in how we buy our kit certainly if we look at some of the absolute procurement disaster under the last government only of defence procurement project be on time and on budget we see that we need not only to buy the right kit but to buy it well that be something that the last government clearly fail to do the shadow defence procurement minister himself the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford describe the defence procurement system as break we need to take step forward and the sdr and the defence industrial strategy will set out how we will improve defence procurement 
 i call the new member for kent jim shannon 
 thank you very much mr speaker i be the new member for many place
