it be a delight to welcome you to your new position madam deputy speaker which i be sure you will fill with great aplomb as you have do other position that i have see you in over the past few year in this house 
 i congratulate   the hon member for lowestoft jess asato   on her maiden speech it be very interesting to hear about her background in the charity sector her tribute to former member who be inspiration to she and who have pass away be very moving i know in what high regard tessa jowell be hold particularly by those on the labour benches it be also very nice to hear her tribute to peter aldous he be a calm and quiet man in some way but he be also a very kind man who really do stand up for his constituent on many of the important issue that she mention he will be miss by those on the conservative benches 
 of the thing that i do when i be a new member be try to speak to constituency neighbour from other party those conversation can be incredibly helpful and revealing and can ensure that you work together on local issue that should really transcend party line i speak just yesterday with   the hon member for north durham luke akehurst who have take an area of my former constituency i hope the hon lady do that and take advantage of the all party parliamentary group of my good baptism be with   the hon member for neath and swansea east carolyn harris who be superb on the appg for gambling relate harm we work together cross party with mps from northern ireland the liberal democrats and the snp so i urge the hon member for lowestoft to delve into the appg she give a fantastic maiden speech 
 thank you very much for call i to speak madam deputy speaker i want to touch on a couple of point that have be raise already and then touch on a few local issue for my constituent as well as make slight mention of a couple of national issue the previous government ’s record be clear we start with of our electricity come from renewable source and end with that be a good move for the long term interest of the country however as the committee on climate change say and as i mention in an intervention there will still be a need for oil and gas in the long term in our country there be a manufacture base for deliver that which often work symbiotically with our manufacture base for new offshore wind i really hope that the government think about and recognise that when it come to our energy security i do not want our country at the mercy of foreign power i urge   they to really think about the impact that not press ahead with new oil and gas in the north sea be have on constituency particularly in the energy heart of our country around aberdeenshire in scotland we will require it so i think that be a mistake i sort of understand politically why they might have go for that but i really urge they to think again in the national interest 
 since there have be over £ of investment in our energy sector from the private sector whatever we do it will be private sector lead the relatively small investment figure that the government have be talk about have be reflect on i just urge they to ensure that whatever happen be private sector lead and deliver the really good long term job and growth for the country that we have be talk about and have secure over the last few year 
 i want to pick up on a few thing that the government have say my right hon friend   the member for east surrey claire coutinho   mention the £ a year but the minister do not cover that could he provide clarity on that issue it be something that constituent up and down the country will think about 
 the minister talk about community own energy company similar to great british energy there have be experience of that there be robin hood energy in nottingham which end up cost taxpayer a huge amount of money in the long term i be interested to know whether the government be invest in the bit that the private sector will not invest in how can they guarantee the return that the minister be talk about and how can they guarantee that the policy will not cost taxpayer more in the future as a former member of the public accounts committee i do not want to see when i look into this in a few year time that taxpayer be leave on the hook when the private sector would not step in 
 on the overall cost of the net plan in the run up to the general election the labour party drop its commitment to spend £ a year on move towards the target i really could do with clarity from the government on the figure that they be look at give that in the month precede the general election shadow ministers talk about it potentially cost hundred of billion of pound to get to that target 
 as i mention in an intervention on the liberal democrat front bencher   the hon member for bath wera hobhouse on energy infrastructure the impact would be on community such as billericay bearsted and laindon in my constituency where there would be foot pylon right down the centre of an area of unspoilt countryside i really would ask the government to reflect on that particularly as germany be move to an underground approach if the germans can do it i do not see why we can not it be in the conservative manifesto 
 thank you madam deputy speaker and congratulation on your new role i also congratulate   the hon member for east thanet ms billington with whom i work before we both come to this chamber through uk100 and elsewhere on local climate action which i will speak much about today i also congratulate the minister and the secretary of state for energy security and net 
 it mean a great deal to i to make my maiden speech during a debate in which the new government be set out green energy policy and plan to get we back on track with our climate pledge here at home so that we can once again contribute on the international stage towards collective global action close to home government research show that local climate action would achieve net for half the cost of the national approach and deliver time the financial return but we need a clear framework between the national and the local and for how council fit into the national plan for net include community energy initiative 
 let i say how proud and humble i be by the faith the resident of beautiful south cambridgeshire have put in i they want change and this be a truly historic result the liberal democrats win all cambridgeshire seat turn they from blue to yellow for the time form a golden ring around the constituency of the minister of state department for environment food and rural affairs   the hon member for cambridge daniel zeichner i congratulate he on his appointment as the minister for farming we have a golden ring or rather a golden doughnut with red jam in the middle and it be thank to family friend and activist many of they here today that that happen 
 i be a lass from hull whose dad be a gp and mum a nurse from an early age i accompany my dad on his home visit to patient and it be those root in the nhs that foster in i a deep sense of community service as well as an insight into the link between inequality child poverty and poor health outcome that be why i be proud that the liberal democrats put the nhs and social care at the forefront of our campaign after year of conservative chaos and neglect leave the nhs on its knee i will continue to campaign to get fair funding for our gps in cambridgeshire because the unfair funding formula in cambridgeshire be leave gps struggle to keep their head above water 
 inequality be a cruel determinant in the covid pandemic and lead to many avoidable death south cambridgeshire help avoid more it be here that the quick deciphering of the covid virus ’s genetic code allow for the vaccine to be develop straightaway that partly explain why they be available in record time the researcher then continue to detect the variant as they emerge it be truly lifesaving that be part of the reason why semi rural south cambridgeshire be fast change it be now home to world lead innovation with europe ’s large biomedical centre and the wellcome genome campus as well as more than start up and business most of which be small or medium sized enterprise 
 our world lead tech and life science sector be among the big contributor to the country ’s economy and i invite the government to recognise that they be the goose that lay the golden egg which be why their future need to be shape carefully with and through the local authority give local people a voice and tackle affordable housing the water supply transport and grid infrastructure gap in a way that allow community business and nature to thrive 
 that be why i would like to pay my respect to my predecessor anthony browne who work hard to raise those issue he support the call on government to tackle the water crisis and i look forward to continue   his work support the campaign for the new cancer and child ’s hospital too i also pay tribute to his predecessor heidi allen who be still remember fondly by many resident sadly heidi stand down from politic as a result of the abuse that many mp mainly woman face in her word 
 of course public scrutiny be to be expect but line be all too often regularly cross and the effect be utterly dehumanising 
 heidi have become an mp to stand up for the vulnerable and for those who have no voice now more than ever i want to continue their work by help to ensure that there be a positive and inclusive vision for all in south cambridgeshire where no be leave behind it be distress that of child in my constituency be live in poverty with increase number dependent on food bank and free school meal isolate in village with no public transport 
 this inclusive vision must include our unique and precious chalk stream that connect we our blue vein the silvery thread weave together our village we have the granta that twinkle through stapleford linton and balsham the river shep that start in fowlmere nature reserve and flow through shepreth and barrington village the river rhee that flow through haslingfield and harston the mel that rise in melbourn and flow through meldreth and the fulbourn and wilbraham chalk stream resident be rightly outraged at the dumping of raw sewage in these stream and river i urge the government to get tough with the water company together with the government i will champion breathe new life into the chalk streams protections bill i have work professionally for many year with government around the world to integrate climate and nature into growth plan mediate agreement where benefit can flow to local community 
 what motivate i most be how young people see their future a recent study on young people find that too many have climate anxiety their most use word be fear anger frustration and worry there be main reason why they feel this way they do not think that decision maker listen to they and secondly they think that decision maker do not care or take the right decision for their future i have meet many young people in south cambridgeshire who feel this way and they want action on the twin climate and nature emergency i speak to they now i want what we do in this chamber to restore your faith and give you agency so that together we can be the change that we want 
 i congratulate you on your election madam deputy speaker 
 i congratulate hon member on discharge their responsibility and deliver their maiden speech particularly my hon friend   the member for na h eileanan an iar torcuil crichton i be sure he will correct my pronunciation and give i some honest feedback i also welcome the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks to the front bench it be timely that i be make my maiden speech on a day when we be discuss how scotland might shape the energy need of these island for many decade to come 
 i thank and pay tribute to my predecessor chris stephens for his dedicated service to our community over the last year his commitment to social justice and worker right be inspirational and will leave a last impact i be particularly thankful for his advice and counsel during the handover process that be currently take place 
 glasgow south west be a synthesis of many different community each with recur contribution to the year old city of empire if you will allow i madam deputy speaker i will give the house a short synopsis of the place where i live work and play 
 we start in darnley deaconsbank and pollok much of it occupy the old pollok estate the laird of which sir john stirling maxwell be a member of this place and found the national trust for scotland in in more recent time these area have demonstrate the transformative possibility of their co operative spirit through the rosehill housing co operative and the pollok credit union 
 move north the ruin of crookston castle come into view build by the stewarts of darnley in the 1400 it be the only medieval castle stand in glasgow and it be possibly where mary queen of scots be betroth to lord darnley it remain an underutilise community asset but i commend the friend of crookston castle for their effort to bring this space back into the service of the people of glasgow 
 a short distance from the castle the wonderful community of mosspark dumbreck and cardonald be nestle around the great expanse of bellahouston park which have play host to numerous music concert papal visit and the empire exhibition of 
 as we head far north we come to ibrox which be synonymous with rangers football club now i must stress madam deputy speaker that other glasgow football club be available my hon friend the member   for glasgow north martin rhodes and for glasgow east john grady can take you for a tour around they govan be the birthplace of sir alex ferguson a footballe legend but also a friend to member on the labour benches he have often give wise counsel to my party it be also the location of the queen elizabeth university hospital formerly know as the southern general of britain ’s large hospital and the place where i hone my skill in surgery and practice as a transplant surgeon my research lead i to conclude that i be the transplant surgeon to be elect to this place 
 govan ’s shipyard history be of course world famous and the fairfield heritage trust and govan workspace have bring that to life more importantly it continue to serve the defence of our realm even in the modern day and to be part of glasgow south west ’s story we have bae systems and thales alongside fintech and medtech company such as barclays and cohesion medical as well as award win tv and film company such as firecrest films we can see the kind of high quality job of the future that can be available to local people these be the kind of job i want to grow as part of this labour government 
 as we head towards the edge of the constituency we find the bbc scotland headquarters the bbc have an important function in the fabric of our national life not only in informing educate and entertaining but as a beacon of our soft power on the world stage something i wholeheartedly support just as national broadcasting be important so be the local and nothing encapsulate that well in glasgow south west than sunny govan radio station it provide an eclectic mix of music but also more importantly run sober story and be a source of comfort on some of the challenge in our community 
 we end our glasgow south west journey in pollokshields an area my hon friend   the member for brent west barry gardiner   know well it be a true melting pot of culture and idea and the place where my father ’s month road journey from pakistan end in april he would go on to drive bus in the city and then black cab he be in his 80 and he still do 
 in the undergrowth of this rich history and potential however there be some worrying signal there be the weariness of work ever fast and long just to stay still the anxiety of wonder how secure that work be and the trepidation at the end of a day of work that you may not be able to pay for the odd treat that make life worthwhile or even the essential it be against that backdrop that we on the labour benches be send to this place to make the economy work for work people and to restore the intergenerational covenant the promise that the life of the generation after we will be well in every sense than our own politic for i be not therefore about the indulgent combative tweet or even the theatrical amendment it be the about see the world through the long lens it be about have the stamina for diligent analysis the patience to articulate policy and then when in power the discipline to deliver endure change that have always be the labour way 
 every member elect to this place recognise electoin for the singular honour that it truly be but it also take a village to be elect to this place that include of   course the tireless staff and activist who be in many way the dna of our democracy but there be also for all of we those who shape our life and now shape our politic when i reflect back i think of my parent and my extended family who from a cradle in a govanhill tenement instill in i the raw ingredient to do my utmost in every walk of life i think too of my teacher and my mentor who mould those ingredient into the art and craft of a widely practise surgical career and of my wife and child who keep i connect to the earth and in contact with reality particularly when it be much need 
 out of all those people i think of my maternal aunt matloob mohammad who stand out she have no child of her own and consider we her child like too many in our labour family she be take by glioblastoma as be my father in law tony in her patient journey through our nhs inspire i to become a doctor and then a surgeon she also in many way inspire my political journey she quite inadvertently introduce i to this place year ago after queue outside we find ourselves in the strangers gallery watch a combative leader of the opposition by the name of tony blair take on the then prime minister if she be here today in that gallery she could not fail to notice the change in the make up of this parliament reflect back up at she 
 we have our challenge in modern britain but it be important to be unashamedly proud of the fact that we be demonstrably the most successfully ethno religiously diverse legislature in the world in these volatile time i believe the world look to we in this place the mother of parliaments for guidance and for the solace that democracy can still deliver i be confident that it will 
 i congratulate you madam deputy speaker on your appointment and it be an honour to follow   the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith   and to hear so many other maiden speech today they make faraway place such as east thanet and lowestoft with which in fact my constituency have old herring connection seem close to we it have also be a pleasure to hear so many maiden speech this week from my fellow new scottish labour mps i realise that that number somewhat bracket the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks who blaze a trail for we i be delighted to see he on the front bench just as i be delighted to see my hon friend   the member for inverclyde and renfrewshire west martin mccluskey   bar the door so that everyone have to hear what i be about to inflict upon they 
 with your indulgence madam deputy speaker and my translation i begin mar urram dhaibhsan a thànig romham agus iadsan chleachdas i as mo dhèidh tha mi togail mu ghuth nam chànain fhèin airson na h eileanan an iar in honour of those who become before i and those who will surely use my native language after i i raise my voice today for the people of the western isles 
 the commonest question i be ask in this house apart from how to pronounce the name of my constituency be how i manage to travel from westminster to the western isles of course the easy answer be by tardis but the honest answer be that here we be a mere hop and a skip away from glasgow and then i travel by a small jet on schedule hopefully to stornoway as i board that small tubular jet i feel almost like a character in succession but i know that there be gold at the end of the flight 
 of course we be connect we be not in the middle of nowhere but at the heart of the atlantic we have the wealth of wind that will deliver the benefit of job growth and energy security for this country in year to come those atlantic island and the western seaboard be what will give gb energy meaning and reality in that transition from east to west away from the north sea and away from the myth that we will not be there in another generation generation of my constituent have earn energy security for this country from the north sea and generation more will continue as we make that just transition to renewable 
 that will be do with the heft of government the uk government and the scottish government and will require the muscle investment and expertise of commercial developer vitally it must involve the consent involvement and power of community just as the labour government of establish from the pre devolution scotland office a community land unit enable community to have the mean and wherewithal to take over their own land set in chain the land reform revolution in the highland and island i be encourage that this labour government be open to idea such as a community energy unit to enable community such as mine to take their stake in that wealth of wind and create a template that can be use across the whole of britain these be theme to which i will return alongside the unfinished business of land reform i read today that a highland estate be for sale at £ with carbon capture and the ponzi scheme of peat restoration attach and i know that that be unfinished business 
 of course wild weather and radical land politic be not the only thing that the western isles have to offer the united kingdom there be deep connection to the country and to this place itself the tide of the thames that rise and fall outside mark by mary branson ’s new dawn high up there in st stephen ’s hall be the same tide that cover and uncover sheol an iolaire a tidal installation that i instal in stornoway harbour along with my good friend malcolm maclean to mark a wartime tragedy and the loss of a ship of that name 
 that same tide that sweep into the viking bay of stornoway also lap tarbert in harris lochmaddy north uist lochsboisdale and castlebay in barra that hebridean archipelago of or be it island guard our western approach be they to be transpose on to a map of mainland britain they would run from london to sheffield in length with well scenery of course that be why i be reluctant to enter the traditional rivalry between maiden speaker of declare their constituency the most beautiful in the country when they come they will see that there be no competition 
 i do not intend to give a cook ’s tour of my constituency but barra the jewel of the hebrides be where angus macneil the former mp for na h eileanan an iar reside fior ghaidheal a true gael and a generously spirited man whose chairmanship of many committees in this house be testimony not just to his political acuman but to his ability to befriend people across the chamber that be characteristic of my predecessor that i hope to emulate 
 i will not take the house around the whole of the western isles because time be short but there be some other political monument that deserve mention i have no few than former labour mps in my constituency on whom to lean for advice dame anne mcguire the queen of stirling ian davidson the former chair of the scottish affairs committee who be still campaign for labour calum macdonald the former labour mp for the western isles and our community wind farm expert and foremost among they brian wilson a former energy minister whose counsel i commend to those on the front bench and who have be a guide light for i since he hire i at the west highland free press as a journalist many year ago 
 in pass i can not but pay tribute to those above we i do not mean the angel i mean the devil in the press gallery among whom i dance for many year as a journalist for the daily record and the glasgow herald and as a freelance broadcaster for the bbc of course it be friday and nearly lunchtime so they be not there when i be in the lobby it be always nearly friday and always nearly lunchtime 
 in a double transfer deal which perform that rare feat of unite the westminster lobby and downing street i be join on these green benches by my hon friend   the new member for rochdale paul waugh who be my lobby roommate upstairs and will now join i here on the old map my constituency might have be mark here be dragon my hon friend the member for rochdale slay to get here 
 i will not detain the house with description of whisky salmon scallop that reach singapore in hour harris tweed or beautiful bay but i remind the minister that the people of the western isles have the tenacity the wherewithal and the resourcefulness embody in the arnish yard near stornoway to act as a stepping stone in the journey to renewable and to clean energy 
 it have be a long road from there to here many people have help and since i have arrive i have have many message of support and prayer and passage too as i come from of the most religiously observant part of britain that come as no surprise passage from an old friend have stay with i to save the hansard reporter who be probably struggle with the accent never mind the translation i will do the task for they she say may your conversation always be gracious seasoned with salt so that you may know how you ought to deal with anyone”—biodh ur comhraidh an comhnaidh grasmhor air a dheaneamh blasta le salainn 
 season with salt madam deputy speaker i like that i hope that all our exchange in this house will be gracious and seasoned with the salt air of the atlantic and our common future because in this chamber and in this kingdom we be all islander 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for call i to speak i congratulate you on your election to the chair and commend   the hon member for glasgow south west dr ahmed   for his passionate and touching maiden speech 
 south northamptonshire of the few constituency to have geographical term in its name comprise the majority of the seat hold by dame andrea leadsom part of the former daventry constituency which be hold by chris heaton harris and part of wellingborough constituency recently hold by   the hon member for wellingborough and rushden gen kitchen 
 as be tradition i must start by pay tribute to my immediate predecessor dame andrea leadsom be a powerhouse a tour de force not only in industry but in parliament where she serve the people of south northamptonshire for year she serve as city minister leader of the house secretary of state for the departments for environment food and rural affairs and for business energy and industrial strategy and latterly minister for public health start for life and primary care 
 as leader of the house dame andrea spearhead the creation of the independent complaints and grievance scheme which have help many member and staff across the house she be wonderfully compassionate   and have be an incredible mentor to i since my selection to stand she be a strong advocate on issue to do with early year in her start for life role she open family hub in local authority area her determination to open the family hub in south northamptonshire will support so many local family in give their child the good start in life i know that she be determined to continue that work in the year to come and she have my full support in her endeavour 
 although   the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew   may have an opportunity to speak to the legacy of chris heaton harris i can not let this opportunity pass without pay tribute to chris as he be such a dedicated statesman he spend year in the european parliament and year as the member for daventry include as secretary of state for northern ireland a crucial role all the while still find the time to be an active qualified football referee officiate at game at different level for more than year chris support i during my campaign i see the warmth with which he be greet on the doorstep and how highly regarded he be by his constituent a role model to follow 
 in their maiden speech both former members pay tribute to their predecessor the now lord boswell of aynho who represent south northamptonshire for year and whom i also have the pleasure of meeting during my campaign they both note that he have be describe in the daily telegraph as a saint during my husting of my opponent note my apparent road to damascus conversion from commercial property lawyer to campaigner against inappropriate development dub i saint sarah on the road to silverstone while i be not expect a call from the pope any time soon as a jibe i quite like that 
 south northamptonshire be a constituency with a rich history from bozeat to brackley both of which be mention in the domesday book and from harpole to deanshanger the latter be the location of of the miracle that thomas becket perform which lead to his canonisation we seem to be truly bless we have lactodorum or towcester as it be now know in the centre of the constituency and the saracens head public house be mention in charles dickens the pickwick papers we even have sulgrave manor the ancestral home of the family of george washington the president of the united states of america have grow up in rutland i have to remember that the river nene be pronounce nen not neen”—i be frequently quiz about that on the campaign trail 
 in recent week i have suddenly become very popular with many member and while i would love to think that it be because of my friendly nature it turn out that many have realise that i have the world famous silverstone in my constituency and they would love to address their need for speed i be incredibly proud to represent the home of the grand prix and this year to witness the victory of our british talent lewis hamilton it be safe to say give that king george vi have be the only reign monarch to attend a british motor race that i would love to extend the invitation to his majesty the king 
 i choose this clean energy debate for my maiden speech because it be an important issue that will have a big impact on my constituent while there be no doubt that we need to look at renewable and diverse energy source for our future energy security destroy thousand of   acre of prime agricultural land can not be the solution to this ongoing question in our area we have already see the solar farm application make at greatworth and now the green hill solar farm propose for a location near grendon and the surround village in my constituency would take over acre of productive farmland and convert it to solar panel and associate battery storage 
 the fact that the government have so quickly in a matter of day sign off proposal for over acre of solar farm be of great concern to i because of the precedent that it will set scheme like this will jeopardise our food security and scar our beautiful countryside when there be other sensible solution we should be look to industrial rooftop and transport corridor at a minimum the minister talk of community benefit but there be no engagement with the community who have to live alongside and with these panel it be a case of marry in haste repent at leisure 
 disagree with the government ’s approach to this matter lead i to mention of my key priority for my time in this place i firmly believe that in all our debate we can disagree agreeably and that be a message i advocate during my election campaign discussion nowadays be too polarised too black and white and far too hostile we need robust debate and discussion and we need to take the heat out of difficult issue so that we can reach the good resolution i want to ensure that we adopt a fair and balanced approach see both side of the issue but settle on that which resonate most and that be always my promise 
 i also want to be a champion for those with hidden disability such as diabetes have myself be give the shock diagnosis of late onset type diabete just year ago i understand the difficulty of adapt to life with a hidden condition technology have enhance our quality of life but it be still difficult to access that technology and i want to help in whatever way i can and to champion this cause as lady may have over the year upside be that i will always be carry some form of sweet for low blood sugar so member know where to come if they be in need 
 before i end my speech i want to take a moment to note my inspiration for enter politic my father kenneth who be now an honorary alderman of rutland as a result of his year of service and his dedication to help his community that dedication extend to my family too in his marriage to my beautiful mother maria they celebrate year together in may their love and dedication to each other be a model to follow and i be privileged to have they as my parent i also would not be here in this chamber without the support of my sibling my sister lorraine her husband richard and their child joshua dominic jonty and olivia and my brother matthew and his wife barbara i say thank you beyond word when my parent bring i to visit parliament when i be about year old i could only have dream that day i would be stand here address the house and indeed they in the gallery dream really can come true

 our metro mayor steve rotheram and local leader include our new st helens borough council leader anthony burns be ambitious for what we can achieve just as we lead the world in the industrial revolution so we can lead it in the green industrial revolution the threat of climate change be real and it be urgent but the mission to tackle it and the journey to net if do in the right way can also be an opportunity for new job new investment new skill and new opportunity for worker and for business grow our local and regional economy and at the same time protect our energy security in a volatile world great british energy be just vital and exciting part of labour ’s broad agenda for government and it be why i be proud to vote for the measure in the king ’s speech 
 since those vote early this week there have rightly be a lot of attention on child poverty and as someone who have be concern about this for almost all my work life and who have try to raise the issue for year i be delighted that it be finally be talk about the previous labour government lift child out of poverty and i have no doubt that this government will too but if we be go to lift child and their family out of poverty it have to be a whole government approach everything be connect to everything else 
 we need the child poverty strategy and action to follow it urgently but we also need economic stability and a strong focus on inclusive growth we need great british energy and affordable energy we need new social and genuinely affordable home we need new job and the new deal for work people we need investment in our town centre and high street investment in public service and the staff who provide they and high aspiration for every single child start with a properly fund properly resource broad education those be the manifesto commitment i support this week 
 it will not surprise anyone to hear that as a former teacher i be a firm believer that there be no great tool for social mobility or personal fulfilment than education and i be evidence of it i be a shy and quiet working class kid at school and it be not until i go to form college and particularly university that i eventually gain the confidence to believe in myself and stand up in front of other and speak and i would never have dream that i would be do it here in this place 
 i would not be here today if it have not be for that experience of high education and i think we should resist at all cost any of the grow argument that some degree and time spend learning be worthless or that too many young people be do degree what i suspect some of those behind such claim mean be too many of the wrong people well if it be good enough for the child of the wealthy it be good enough for working class kid like i and those to come 
 all child deserve those opportunity include those with special educational need there be a crisis right now in the system which be leave too many child and their family wait far too long for assessment and then when they be assess they too often do not get the support they need despite the good effort of their school and school staff whether they be child in mainstream education with dyslexia or autism or child in special school with more complex need every child deserve to be able to access a full and vibrant curriculum with adequate support and adjustment to help they achieve their good the parent of these child be every bit as ambitious for they as any other parent just as parent of state school pupil be equally ambitious as those who can afford private school all they ask like any parent or any child be for a fair chance 
 i be encourage to hear our new government talk about these issue already and about the challenge that our school pupil and their family face i intend to do all i can to help deliver the change that they and we all need if young people be to access the job of today and tomorrow in ai and life science clean energy and more we must be focus on open every possible door not close they 
 in conclusion we have be send to this place with a mandate to change the country and to change life for the well there be a huge amount to do but labour ’s plan for the country be ambitious and most importantly deliverable for as long as i be in this place i will do all i can to help give all our child and young people the tool and opportunity to reach their potential and to ensure that the benefit of the change we will bring be feel by people in st helens north as well as the country as a whole

 due to the vagary of boundary change i have to go back some year to the maiden speech give by the late baron renton to find the original and only maiden speech make by a member of parliament for mid sussex on read that maiden speech i briefly consider a simple copy and paste job such be the relevance of his speech echo through the decade to the moment we find ourselves in today he raise concern about the expansion of gatwick airport about housing growth without vital infrastructure and about doctor and teacher not be able to afford a house all those thing be important to people in my constituency as well as to the liberal democrats 
 of special note be baron renton ’s call for more generous attendance and disability allowance so that people can be properly care for by love one in their own home the importance of have a care system that truly work and genuinely support carer be critical to ensure that we live in a civilised society where regardless of someone ’s life stage and their physical or mental health they can live the good life possible and achieve their potential we must care about care we must make that a priority of this new parliament 
 in the most recent boundary change a significant proportion of mid sussex and the area that be my home be formally part of the arundel and south downs constituency i thank   the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith   for his courteous and prompt handover of casework i probably owe a big debt of gratitude to his predecessor lord herbert of south downs the noble lord might not realise it but he play a hand in light the touchpaper on my political journey that have lead i to be here today during the eu referendum campaign the noble lord be chairman of conservatives for reform in europe he kindly agree to come to my village afternoon to join a cross party stall for remain that i be organise it might be say that he inspire i as a liberal democrat i will always advocate close tie with our european ally and neighbour we believe that in a world this unstable and dangerous we be strong when we turn to face our close friend and neighbour co operation not antagonism be the good way of tackle the challenge that our planet face

 there be also incredible group work to tackle the climate crisis which bring i to the subject of today ’s debate fairer world lindfield hurst rethink and greener hassocks and ditchling be tireless advocate and campaigner for the idea of start something to tackle the climate crisis rather than wait for the government to get on board greener hassocks and ditchling have put solar panel on the roof of downlands community school in hassock the bolney wine estate have in conjunction with the brighton energy cooperative put a solar array on the roof of its winery which now generate over of the energy require to produce half a bottle of wine 
 however local group can only do so much they need the government to create an environment in which it be easy to make the energy transition speed up grid connection for example can currently take up to year we need to make well use of space that have no other purpose industrial rooftop or the side of railway line include for solar array the will be there in mid sussex and i be sure right across the country we need to do more and we must make it easy our community our constituent our child and as yet unborn generation demand nothing less 
 thank you madam deputy speaker and may i congratulate you on your elevation to the chair 
 i be grateful for this opportunity to make my maiden speech especially during this debate give that scotland be at the heart of the government ’s plan to make the uk a green energy superpower it be a pleasure to follow   the hon member for mid sussex alison bennett who give such a fantastic tribute to her constituency and indeed all other hon member who have speak with such passion and eloquence during their maiden speech particularly my hon friend the members for glasgow south west dr ahmed and for central ayrshire alan gemmell as well as my hon friend   the member for na h eileanan an iar torcuil crichton i be glad that he be no long in the chamber to hear my mispronunciation

 it be an incredible honour and privilege to serve as the representative of the new constituency of bathgate and linlithgow i must thank my predecessor martyn day for his service to the former constituency of linlithgow and east falkirk he serve as a member of this place for year and prior to that as a councillor represent his hometown of linlithgow for year a remarkable quarter century of public service for which i thank he i must also pay tribute to the former mp michael connarty a friend and colleague who be always on hand with advice and support 
 campaign trail can be tough with long hour many mile walk thousand of door knock and mountain of haribo consume other brand be available of the great pleasure of my campaign be meet so many people who share personal and heartwarming account of the help they receive from the former father of the house tam dalyell or who simply know he as tam the affection and respect in which he be hold to this day be something to which i can only aspire and i will endeavour to live up to his example of dedicated service to constituent i can not confirm or deny whether this will involve be awkward 
 i be not a bathgate bairn i choose to make bathgate my home almost year ago leave behind scotland ’s great city glasgow to lay down root for my family and i could not have make a well decision with the beauty of the bathgate hill on my doorstep as well as the beecraigs and polkemmet country park the kinneil local nature reserve and the shoreline at bo’ness and blackness i be never far from stunning and tranquil countryside we must seek to protect and preserve this natural beauty for future generation 
 key to this be our effort to reach our net target and combat climate change which be cause significant damage to our environment but let we be clear that our natural environment also have a key role to play in achieve our goal so it be in our interest to do all we can to protect it 
 with the passion and commitment show by the secretary of state for energy security and net and his team ably represent today by the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks and the ambitious plan that they have set out include on support for community energy project which i welcome as a co operator i be confident that we will leave a legacy for future generation to enjoy 
 our landscape also tell the story of our industrial and manufacturing heritage from the shale bing across the constituency and the former brickwork and foundry to the former british leyland site plessey semiconductors now whiteside business park and the pyramids business park which once house motorola the people of the bathgate and linlithgow constituency have always embrace change and technological advance the constituency have a highly skilled and flexible workforce with opportunity attract worker from across the   central belt include the glasgow overspill which be still refer to as such today despite many live in the area for almost year 
 i recall my visit to aldo ’s chippy in bathgate when the lady behind the counter recognise my accent ask if i want salt and vinegar rather than salt and sauce which be a topic of heated debate between glasgow and edinburgh colleague of course the correct answer be salt and vinegar 
 however the story of the constituency have not always be of prosperity this year mark the anniversary of the miner strike and the subsequent closure of polkemmet colliery after the pit pump be switch off flood the gallery the smoulder slag heap have be remove and new house have be build as part of of the big regeneration project in europe but the town of whitburn and the surround community be devastate with many family endure severe hardship 
 the mistake of the past must not be repeat lesson must be learn about the impact of such loss on individual on family and on entire community that be why i support the fight to keep grangemouth work and to keep the job on which many of my constituent rely particularly in bo’ness and linlithgow i thank my hon friend on the front bench for their proactive approach to work towards a sustainable future for the site i also thank my hon friend   the member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman who have be steadfast and vocal in his support for the campaign 
 while we honour our history and the tradition of the past we look to the future with hope and ambition we be situate at the heart of scotland with easy access across the central belt via the m8 and m9 and rail route to our great city and beyond with the unfortunate exception of winchburgh which still await its train station more people be choose to live in the constituency and more company be choose to locate there to do business include in manufacturing technology communication logistic retail and hospitality 
 tourism also drive our local economy particularly in the royal burgh of linlithgow with the royal palace set aside the loch and the peel st michael ’s church and its newly refurbish crown of thorn the union canal the historic canal basin it pass through and other treasure there be plenty of reason to linger long in linlithgow in bo’ness we have the steam railway museum the motor museum the restore hippodrome theatre and numerous place of interest 
 we be also see a growth in tourism as a result of the increase in tv and film production in the area the blackness bay distillery set in the picturesque village of blackness be example it be benefit from the increase in visitor to the castle as a result of the success of outlander i can tell those who have not visit yet that they will receive the warm of welcome from sheena and colm at the distillery i also want to mention the major historic house attraction of kinneil house hopetoun house and house of the binns the ancestral home of the dalyell family as place to visit 
 as a labour and co operative member i see the opportunity to expand the co operative economy put power directly in the hand of local people for the benefit of local community i look forward to work with fellow co operator to do just that 
 although job and opportunity be on our doorstep too many people still face barrier to employment and many be not earn enough to get by that create huge demand on local food bank and other vital support service include those offer by our local sector organisation which do a tremendous and invaluable job child poverty be a scandal that blight community across the country and in my constituency but it do not exist in a vacuum low pay high rent high mortgage exorbitant energy bill and the rise cost of food all contribute to severe financial pressure on family that be why i welcome the announcement of the child poverty taskforce which will bring together voice inside government and those of outside expert to take a holistic and targeted approach to tackle this scourge and ensure that every child have a chance to achieve their goal irrespective of their background 
 with more people choose to live in the bathgate and linlithgow constituency we be see increase pressure on vital local service which be significantly underfunded as well as pressure on gp surgery and on our local infrastructure both the avon gorge junction and the burghmuir junction be in serious need of upgrading with under investment in bus transport at a scottish level our more rural community such as greenrigg newton philipstoun bridgend torphichen westfield blackridge seafield and even the town of blackburn be struggle to keep connect it be crucial that investment in vital service and local infrastructure keep pace with development and that be something that i will champion in my constituency 
 as a young girl grow up in the small village of lennoxtown at the foot of the campsie hill never do i think that i would be stand here in the house of commons as of female mp the high ever number of woman representative that do not just happen we be here only because of the woman who forge the way for we such as the incomparable harriet harman who i have the pleasure of meeting for the time at last year ’s edinburgh festival it be empower to see so many incredible labour woman take their rightful place on our front benches their example will let young girl today know that they can be here day too 
 while the increase in woman member to of this place be hugely welcome we still have much work to do to achieve 50:50 representation as a councillor i work to remove barrier to participation do my bit to ensure that council chamber start to reflect the community that we represent i pledge to continue that work with hon member in and across this chamber 
 finally i think most people here would agree that our politic have be mire by division and scandal in recent year and that have undermine public trust in politician we have a duty to restore that trust which be key to our democracy in scotland there have be far too much finger pointing with representative retreat to their respective trench and endless constitutional debate that ultimately deliver nothing for the people of scotland i welcome the new approach of work with the devolved government and the response from the scottish government on issue such as the tobacco and vape bill and hopefully a uk wide deposit return scheme this relationship reset will be far strengthen   by the new council of nation and region which will facilitate a return to constructive engagement and co operation in the interest of the people we be all here to serve 
 for my part i will work with hon member in this place and with elect representative in all chamber to deliver for the people of bathgate and linlithgow my constituent have bestow their faith on i and for that i thank they it be a responsibility that i will carry every single day and i pledge to be the champion and advocate they need and deserve 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to make my maiden speech to the house in this debate on make britain a clean energy superpower i congratulate you on your elevation 
 it be a privilege to follow   the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan who always speak with great eloquence and passion it be also a privilege to speak in a debate lead by the under secretary of state for energy security and net my hon friend   the member for rutherglen michael shanks i offer he my warm congratulation as he take up his position and i wish he well as i be sure we all do 
 i recognise the great honour that have be bestow on all of we to be in this house and i be so proud and fortunate to represent my constituency of west dunbartonshire it contain very distinct community the vale of leven and the town of dumbarton and clydebank the latter of which be my home town i have live in clydebank with my family all my life and i pledge to work tirelessly in this place for all my fellow resident 
 my constituency can well be describe as stretch from the bank of the river clyde to the shore of loch lomond from industrial clydeside to the gateway to the highland i therefore can boast of the unrivalled natural beauty of loch lomond and dumbarton castle of scotland ’s royal castle the town of dumbarton be the ancient capital of strathclyde grant royal borough status by alexander ii in and it be home to denny ’s shipyard which build the cutty sark the vale of leven be renowned for its turkey red dye and print cotton export across the globe singer ’s factory in my home town where my late father work make the famous sewing machine and there be a time last century when virtually every home in the land possess a singer sewing machine 
 clydebank be synonymous with john brown ’s shipyard where the queen elizabeth the queen mary the qeii and the royal yacht britannia be build a history we be rightly proud of however in do that we gain an unwanted legacy as the european hotspot for asbestos relate industrial illness and death it be on that cause among countless other that i wish to pay tribute to my predecessor martin docherty hughes martin be a powerful advocate in this place in the pursuit of truth and justice for the victim of asbestos relate industrial death and for their family in the fight for fair compensation i know how closely he work with the clydebank asbestos group and it be now incumbent on i to pick up the baton martin docherty hughes conduct himself with great dignity before and after the general election and i wish to thank he for his year of service and the generosity and courtesy he extend to i throughout i wish he the very good in his future endeavour 
 the great honour of represent west dunbartonshire be emphasise yet far when i reflect on my other predecessor who serve with great distinction in this house include gemma doyle and my great friend tony worthington who represent the former constituency of clydebank and milngavie it be truly humble to follow they and of course the lord speaker lord mcfall of alcluith who be also renowned for his chairmanship of the treasury committee in this place 
 many of the great industry of the clyde be sadly go consign to history and while as a bankie i be rightly proud of our history it be to our future that i look i be elect by my constituent to deliver change and i be determined to do that and to play my part in ensure that all community across west dunbartonshire can look forward to a dynamic and prosperous future the work of the regeneration of clydeside and the town centre of clydebank dumbarton and the vale of leven will be my priority the government have the ambition to grow the economy make work pay and create job and new employment opportunity for our young people and i have great confidence in the ability of the youth of west dunbartonshire to match those ambition provide they with the same life opportunity as child in any other constituency across this great nation of our will be my driving mission 
 i pledge during the election campaign to fight to ensure that everyone in my constituency have access to that very basic of right a safe warm and affordable home my local authority of west dunbartonshire declare a housing emergency in may amid unprecedented pressure on the ability to meet the need of those in social housing or seek a council property i welcome my government ’s ambition to unlock the barrier to build more home but it be essential that they be affordable so as to tackle that injustice and insecurity that be why we campaign for a publicly own gb energy company headquarter in scotland it be therefore particularly satisfying to make my maiden speech during this debate gb energy will cut bill in west dunbartonshire deliver energy security and put scotland at the forefront of the clean energy revolution it will be publicly own and will utilise our extraordinary natural resource 
 that bring i back to the natural resource of the river clyde the yard may have go but the future be with clean energy on the site of the former john brown ’s shipyard to which i refer early be now the west dunbartonshire energy centre a groundbreake project feature scotland ’s large water source heat pump installation which take water from the river clyde and use it to generate heat this publicly own district heating system be truly groundbreake help west dunbartonshire to transition towards a net future crucially it also allow we to address the fuel poverty of my fellow resident i will be delighted to welcome the minister to visit the centre in the very near future 
 in take my place in this house i step away from year of appear daily in court throughout scotland as a solicitor i represent some of the most vulnerable member of our society as i step away from the profession to take my seat in this house i do so with a heavy heart i leave behind a demoralise profession ignore by successive government who fail to recognise that a   properly fund legal aid scheme be the bedrock of a fair society my experience be with the scottish court but i understand that south of the border the system be in similar peril i be sure the house will recognise that upholding respect and promote the rule of law require we to ensure access to justice fair representation and a widening of the scope of legal aid eligibility and also to recognise that the court be as vital a public asset and as much of a foundation stone of society as school social service and hospital 
 i also leave year of unbroken service to local government as a councillor at west dunbartonshire local government be on its knee starve of vital funding the last of the low hang fruit long since pick frontline service be under serious threat and i wish for this house to recognise those across all political party and in all public office at local government level and all the highly dedicated staff who share the same desire as we all do across this house to advance the wellbeing of our local community they deserve great support from we 
 my constituency be support in this endeavour by a wealth of local charity and community organisation as provost of west dunbartonshire i gain unique insight into this vital support chain which include group such as mentor scotland that provide mental health support as well as the men ’s shed local not for profit trust such as flourishing faifley bag full of love duntocher village hall antonine sports and the skylark ix recovery trust these and the countless faith group across my constituency provide food bank and shelter truly be the good of our society

 the scale of the horror that be uncover by sir brian langstaff ’s report almost defy belief of the issue that the report bring to light be the importance of address the unacceptable culture of defensiveness in the public sector we must make sure that people ’s reputation and protect institution be never put above public service this government will bring forward legislation to place a duty of candour on public servant and authority to make sure that this kind of behaviour can not happen again that legislation must be the catalyst for a change culture in the public sector by improve transparency and accountability it will address the culture of defensiveness and help ensure that the lack of candour uncover in the infected blood scandal and indeed in too many other instance such as hillsborough and horizon be not repeat 
 we recognise that as well as deliver institutional change we must provide financial redress to people whose life have be irreversibly and tragically change as a result of the infected blood scandal of the most powerful conclusion in the inquiry ’s report be that an apology be meaningful only if it be accompany by action and it be now my responsibility to carry forward this action i hope to lead that work not only with the support of this house but with sensitivity and respect towards the people who have be so unfairly affect by this scandal after all that have happen listen to the voice of victim be crucial and i will endeavour to work closely with the infected blood community as we progress this work 
 i would also like to update the house on the progress be make in establish the infected blood compensation authority the victims and prisoners act legally create the authority on   may and since that point the interim chief executive david foley have be work closely with sir robert francis kc the interim chair to set up the compensation service it be frankly no small task the cabinet office be support the organisation as it recruit and set up a service that be easy to access and simple to use the authority will provide regular update to the infected blood community and all other interested in its work 
 let i turn to compensation on   may i welcome the former administration ’s announcement on compensation there be an urgent need to get money to people in the most timely way possible on   june further interim payment of £ be make to beneficiary of the infected blood support scheme live with infection bring the total pay in compensation to victim to more than £ however we recognise that this be not enough give that many other have also be wait for far too long

 finally i reassure the house that there will be an opportunity to fully debate the content of the inquiry ’s final report i be conscious that give the timing of the recent election there have not yet be time for right hon and hon member to do so it be essential in my view that member of this house have enough time to digest and debate the devastating finding of the report the government be consider sir brian langstaff ’s recommendation and we will provide an update to parliament by the end of the year on the progress that we be make on respond to the inquiry ’s recommendation as sir brian recommend in the report 
 the infected blood scandal be of the grave injustice this country have see i want to end by pay tribute to the courage and determination of the victim of this scandal those infected and those affect who fight so hard for justice at every debate on this issue we remember that they be at the centre of all this it be for they that we must come together to restore the sense that this be a country that can rectify injustice they deserve nothing less i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow minister 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i congratulate you on your elevation i thank the paymaster general for his statement and thank he very much for the customarily early sight of his statement this morning 
 the finding of the infected blood inquiry remain a shameful moment for the british state of all i reiterate our apology to all those whose life have be change as a result of this appalling tragedy which   never should have happen on   may the day of the inquiry ’s final report the then prime minister confirm that the government would pay comprehensive compensation to those who have be affect and infect as quickly as possible 
 before the election be call on   may i take a number of step to ensure that interim compensation of £ would be pay as quickly as possible to those register with exist infected blood support scheme as well as those who register with the support scheme before the final scheme become operational and to the estate of those who pass away between then and payment be make i be delighted that the paymaster general this morning confirm that over £ have now be pay during the run up to the general election 
 the legislation pass on   may   establish the infected blood compensation authority to administer the compensation scheme and appoint sir robert francis as the interim chair sir robert have previously lead the infected blood compensation framework study and i understand from engagement with senior official right up till the day of the general election that he undertake a meaningful series of engagement meeting as the right hon gentleman confirm with representative of the infected and affected community during the purdah period 
 we also accept the then opposition ’s call for regulation to set up the scheme to be make within month of the legislation receive royal assent we ask for an update to be provide to the house within sit day of the inquiry ’s final report be publish i believe that the statement this morning honour that i welcome the fact that the new government have continue to prioritise this issue and to keep the house and of course the victim and their family update on progress however there remain question and matter on which i think the infected and affected blood community would respectfully expect i to challenge the government 
 will the paymaster general confirm that the debate that i promise after the whitsun recess could be schedule for september that would give member a reasonable amount of time over the recess to study this considerable report will he reiterate my commitment to respond to sir brian ’s recommendation by as quickly as possible within a comprehensive response to the report
