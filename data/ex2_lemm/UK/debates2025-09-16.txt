 what step he be take to reduce backlog in the criminal justice system 
 what step his department be take to reduce the length of time for case to go to trial 
 mr speaker it be nice to be back on my old beat 
 this government inherit a record court backlog we have take immediate action by fund a record high allocation of crown court sit day this year fundamental reform be of course necessary which be why the previous lord chancellor my right hon friend   the member for birmingham ladywood shabana mahmood commission sir brian leveson to propose bold reform which we be now consider 
 i recently have the chance to visit my local magistrate court in cannock and i be tell that a major barrier to ramp up the number of sit day in both magistrate and crown court be the lack of legal adviser i be tell that many be leave the crown prosecution service because the pay be often well elsewhere but that mean have to cut back on sit time will my right hon friend outline what step the ministry be take to increase the number of legal adviser in our court 
 my hon friend will be pleased that we be recruit more legal adviser and we be increase capacity in the system he be right that magistrate court particularly be the bedrock of the system which be why i be so appalled that the previous government cut back our magistrate court so extensively it be important that we support our magistrate to do their very important work 
 crown courtroom be sit empty for up to of the time judge use to be book in trial to month into the future but now they be book well into or even into which be to save the cost of bring in a recorder at £ a day however these case still need to be try at some point so that be not actually save cost just defer they in the meantime there be a terrible impact on complainant and in fact on justice itself what will the secretary of state do to clear this backlog and ensure that case come to trial 
 order we have a lot of question to get in 
 the hon lady be completely right victim must see justice be do in real time that be why we ask brian leveson to do the part of his review on efficiency which go to the heart of her question 
 some case be now be list for which be completely unacceptable how be the secretary of state undo the harm inflict by the conservative party not only on the justice system but to trust that justice will be find 
 the inheritance from the previous government be shocking and at the heart of it be victim suffer what we be do be increase the number of sit day which be hugely important and i be very pleased to meet the lady chief justice last week to discuss what more we can do to ensure that we deal with that terrible inheritance we will of course get on and implement the leveson review 
 i wish the right hon gentleman the very good in his new appointment but he be preside over a complicated system in which today out of crown courtroom be empty will he comment on that and on when the part of the leveson report will come into effect so that we know when action will be take on the great complexity that be yet to be evaluate 
 the right hon gentleman be right that we have to build the system ’s capacity to use courtroom well i can tell he that sir brian leveson i be very grateful to sir brian for come to see i as foreign secretary while he be complete his review because of my experience in the criminal justice system be complete his review by the end of the year 
 of the most effective step take by this government to help reduce the crown court backlog be the record increase to criminal legal aid few criminal barrister and solicitor will not help to tackle case waiting time scotland be experience unacceptable delay in solemn case come to trial make bad by the inadequate funding of scottish legal aid by the scottish government do the justice secretary agree that unless we significantly increase legal aid fee across the uk the current criminal defence model be unsustainable and we risk the collapse of our court system 
 my hon friend highlight almost decade of the snp run scotland into the ground here we have have a record increase of £ on the day we introduce the hillsborough law it be hugely important to record that that be the big extension of legal aid for people who have suffer at the hand of the state in over a decade 
 rape be a heinous and despicable crime with lifelong consequence for victim some do not survive accord to the house of commons library the average number of day from charge to case completion be day what time do the government think be acceptable for deliver justice for rape victim do they have a target what be it and what step be they take to reach it 
 we must have swifter justice for victim of rape when i be shadow justice secretary i be appal that under the previous government we get to a position where we have almost decriminalise the situation because there be so few prosecution there must be justice and that mean swifter justice 
 in west kent an initiative to share the resource of maidstone crown court with woolwich crown court be spread case into area where there be not such a backlog can the government indicate whether   that be be openly consider in other part of the country so that we can spread the backlog across different area 
 it be absolutely the case that where court be come together and be proactive we be see progress i look forward to look more closely at the example of maidstone and woolwich my hon friend be absolutely right that that be the way forward 
 of people arrest for support palestine action be arrest under section of the terrorism act this prohibit people from carry article in public which 
 arouse reasonable suspicion that an individual be a member or supporter of a proscribe organisation 
 even the protester who display those sicken picture of hamas paraglider in the week after   october   be each give a conditional discharge will the government please look again at the terrorism act to avoid clog up the criminal justice system with people whose real motive be to support action on palestine 
 i be always happy to do anything i do it in my last role and i will do it in this role to ensure that anyone terrorise be convict that be quite properly a matter for law enforcement and prosecutor but i will examine the detail of what the hon gentleman say 
 i have meet constituent who have be victim of some of the most serious offence and be wait for year before the general election to have access to justice will the secretary of state meet i to discuss how i can ensure that my constituent have timely access to justice 
 my hon friend be right we have to ensure that the system work for victim under the previous government half of all magistrate court close and in december the crown court backlog have increase by we be deal with that we have to do so as swiftly as possible i will of course ensure that he meet with the appropriate minister 
 with your permission mr speaker i pay tribute to my predecessor who be mention on the face of the order paper who be kill in 
 the justice secretary keep refer to the previous government and i sort of get that but i remind he that the new government have be in post for some or month over a year and at some point that particular argument be go to wear very thin be he aware of the extraordinary length of time that victim of serious sexual assault and crime must wait in the shropshire court particularly shrewsbury crown court it be double the day that we have just hear from the lib dem benches what will the justice secretary do to help those victim as well as the defendant who may on occasion be innocent 
 the right hon gentleman and i be friend across this house however i have to say to he and he should say this to his constituent that under the previous government we see devastating cut to the police with a reduction of officer   we see no building of prison at all effectively only place we see the decimation of the probation service which we be rebuild and we see a reduction in sit day we have have to get on with all that yes we have make some stride in month but the devastation be big and it will take a bit long 
 what step his department be take to support probation officer 
 what step he be take to support the probation service 
 we be determined to back our hard work probation staff by invest up to £ by the final year of the spending review and an initial £ in technology to reduce administrative burden we will also recruit trainee probation officer in the next year 
 the probation officer i have speak to be supportive of the early release scheme inasmuch as it be necessary to deal with the chronic overcrowding in our prison a legacy of the previous government ’s dereliction of duty many offender on the fix recall scheme with a determinate sentence however be not be risk assess before rerelease which concern probation officer in that context can the secretary of state indicate what measure he be put in place to ensure that probation officer be able to do their job with offender be release early 
 i be with probation officer last week in my visit as secretary of state it be important that probation be the place i go to because the work and dedication of those officer and the staff be immense we be work with the home office to ensure that those risk assessment be do 
 my constituency of chelmsford be an important hub for the justice system in essex it be home to several court include a crown court the independent sentencing review lead by david gauke find that the reoffende rate for those who be homeless or rough sleeping be double that of those who have accommodation to go to upon release indeed i have hear example from charity of those on probation be recall to prison simply because they have no fix address at a time when prison place be so limited what step be the justice secretary take to ensure that such frustrating example of recall stop and how do he intend to work with the inter ministerial group for homelessness and rough sleeping to ensure that the probation service ’s work be not undermine by a lack of accommodation upon release from prison 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her question no doubt she will be contribute to the debate a little later on our sentencing bill that issue be raise with i by probation worker last week it remain a big issue in our system make bad by the previous government i commit to work closely   with colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that that housing be available 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 i welcome my right hon friend back to his rightful place i remember be a junior shadow minister under he i will try to be less deferential in my current role 
 my right hon friend rightly say that the government be recruit new probation officer to fulfil the new responsibility under the sentencing bill and to deal with early release the bbc recently report however a shortage of probation officer how be we go to fill that gap the probation service be absolutely essential to the strategy that he be rightly follow now 
 my hon friend and i do a lot of work together while the probation service be decimate by a badly botch privatisation that ruin such an incredible service he be right that we will need to recruit more officer the £ that we find be essential and i will be look closely at the allocation over the come month 
 i wish to pay tribute to the probation officer in northern ireland who do an excellent job i have meet they many time and they be magnificent on many occasion they have to deal with young people who due to peer pressure find themselves influence to do thing that they normally would not do restorative justice be way to try to make thing well be there a direct strategy within government to ensure that restorative justice be use to rehabilitate young people and give they the chance of a well life 
 the hon gentleman bring a lot of experience to these issue what he reflect on be an issue face in constituency like mine i hope he will contribute to the debate on the sentencing bill later today 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i welcome the new justice secretary and the minister responsible for sentencing to their place the probation service rely on an effective tagging system in order to keep our community safe but the £ contract that the last government award to serco have result in lot of failure i see some of they close up when i shadow serco over the summer include for example wrong address be provide which mean multiple fail visit and a failure to tag the offender who need to be tag will the secretary of state tell we how much serco have be fin in its contract and will he commit to strengthen penalty so that we ensure that private contractor be not reward for failure 
 the hon gentleman be right that serco ’s record be poor and unacceptable we step in and have fin it i can not say by how much because it be commercially sensitive but i can tell he that i intend to hold serco to account the job that it do be immensely important for public confidence 
 what step his department be take to maintain courtroom 
 what step he be take to improve the court estate through restoration and renewal 
 for year our court building under the last government be leave to crumble and decay this government have boost capital funding from £ last year to over £ for this year from read to blackpool we be build new court and restore old one 
 i look forward to chorley ’s then 
 prestatyn justice centre and its hard work staff provide a vital service to my constituent but on a recent visit it be clear that the building need investment can the minister update the house on what the government be do to repair and modernise our court estate and will she look at what can be do to support our facility in prestatyn 
 my hon friend be right that the prestatyn justice centre be a valuable facility for her community we have a number of project in the pipeline for wales obviously we must prioritise those court building that be most in need and where there be most disrepair so that we can bring they back into use but i be happy for she to write to i about that particular case 
 since my constituent in lancaster have have to look at a ring of steel fencing around the lancaster courthouse in our city centre as it await maintenance work to make it more sightly the fencing have be there since so how much long will my constituent have to wait for this maintenance work 
 i understand that people in lancaster have be use the crown court in nearby preston which be a more modern and accessible facility we be undertake a consultation about the future of lancaster crown court but i be happy to write to my hon friend in more detail about the timeline 
 do the minister agree that access to justice be very important particularly in rural area where sometimes witness or those offer family support have to travel to court appearance be it not vital to maximise accessibility for such people 
 the hon member be absolutely right when we talk about access to justice that must mean access to justice in every single respect and there be no more obvious demonstration of that than accessibility to the door of the court that be why we undertake continuous review of our court estate to ensure that it be physically accessible to all user 
 what step he be take to improve the safety of the prison estate 
 the safety of our prison staff be a no priority for i that be why we be invest £ to stop the contraband that put our hard work staff particularly at risk we be also roll out protective body armour for use in the high security unit and trialle the use of tasers for specialised staff 
 thousand of drone be be use to smuggle contraband such as weapon and drug into prison locally i have meet lead security company preventive concepts security the shadow lord chancellor be good enough to visit it in france to see its technology in action detect and disable drone what specific step be the department take to roll out drone detection capability across the prison estate be it currently engage directly with private stakeholder such as preventive concepts security 
 i do see that the shadow lord chancellor have visit france i look seriously and closely at what he be propose and i propose to make some announcement in that area over the come week 
 last week in brighton the tuc unanimously back the safe inside campaign promote by the joint unions in prisons alliance call for urgent action against record high level of prison violence and hand exposure to psychoactive substance do the secretary of state agree that current condition be quite intolerable for prison staff and that the prison service need to be hold directly accountable for the health and safety of everyone who work in prison all of whom deserve to be safe inside 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for that question we be talk to the union i hope that the £ we have put in will be able to alleviate some of the problem but he be right that the assault on our staff be entirely unacceptable that be why i be commit from the dispatch box to make further announcement in the come day 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be sure that the whole house will join i in pay tribute to the murder prison officer lenny scott whose killer be find guilty and sentence over the recess it be hard to overstate the seriousness of the case this be a prison officer murder simply for do his job like police officer we ask prison officer every day to stand up to some of the most violent people in our society do the new lord chancellor agree that prison officer deserve the same legal protection as police officer 
 the work that our prison officer do be incredible the work that our prison governor do be incredible over the course of both my career in law and my career in the house i have visit very many prison   and i pay tribute to their work i will certainly be look closely at this issue i hope to come forward with more announcement in the come day 
 i be sure that prison officer will welcome any future announcement that the lord chancellor make we have talk this morning about preventive measure we can take to ensure prison officer safety but police officer benefit from legal protection in term of the consequence for murder they with mandatory whole life order impose on people who do that the opposition will table an amendment to the sentencing bill that would give the same protection to prison officer i think they deserve it and i would welcome his support for that measure 
 it be a serious issue and i will certainly consider it i know that the law commission be look at similar provision 
 what step he be take to support rehabilitative programme in prison 
 welcome minister 
 thank you mr speaker 
 this government be commit to tackle the root cause of reoffende that mean invest in service that turn offender away from a life of crime and instead back on the straight and narrow that include service in employment accommodation and substance misuse treatment 
 i thank the minister for his response and welcome he to his place we have a prison population crisis but rather than build or release our way out of it we have to reduce reoffende i recently visit hmp bure in my constituency and see the excellent work it have be do internally to support prisoner in learn new skill and equip they for life after release will the minister assure i that the government will support and provide funding for such programme will he meet i to hear more about the fantastic work of the staff at hmp bure 
 the government be commit to tackle reoffende and that include investment in service exactly like those that the hon member visit we be build more prison place because we need to in year the conservatives add just additional prison place and in month we have add alongside that we have to tackle reoffende and i hope the hon member will support the sentencing bill later this afternoon which will do that 
 rehabilitation be a vital part of prison health programme but when prisoner develop infectious disease such as tuberculosis they can be isolate from organise programme such as rehab give the risk that interrupt tb treatment can fuel antimicrobial resistance what step be the   department take to ensure that prisoner receive both uninterrupted medical care and continue access to rehabilitation 
 i will be talk with colleague in the department of health and social care on exactly that issue and on tackle reoffende make sure that there be treatment in prison so that prisoner be rehabilitate the sole focus of this government be on stop reoffende and cut crime and that mean work with prisoner there be also the sentencing bill and i hope that my hon friend will contribute to the debate on that today 
 what step his department be take to support victim of rape and sexual violence through the court system 
 it be vital that victim feel support at court the ministry of justice fund the national witness service which provide support on the day of trial and independent sexual violence advocate can accompany victim while they be in the courtroom pre trial victim can receive support from victim liaison officer or from the moj fund victim support service and that be available throughout their criminal justice journey 
 may i welcome our new minister and justice secretary to their place i have hear far too many story from constituent who have endure sexual violence and rape they tell i how isolate and intimidate the court system can feel and how difficult it can be to get the support they need will the minister reassure i and those constituent that this government be do everything they can to ensure that victim and survivor of rape and sexual violence be support in a timely manner 
 i thank my hon friend for that important question she be a tireless advocate for all victim of violence against woman and girl she will know that this government be commit to support those victim in court through measure such as section the witness service and our victim liaison officer to further support victim the ministry of justice also fund support service such as independent sexual violence advocate and independent domestic violence advocate we be also committed to introduce free independent legal adviser for victim of adult rape across england and wales and i hope to announce more on that measure soon 
 my constituent louise report her sexual assault to the police back in she have have court date push back twice and the trial be now expect in december nearly year after report it to the police what assessment have the minister make of the impact of such delay on victim survivor who be also witness and of the impact on the quality of the eventual court case 
 i thank the hon member for that really important question all my thought be with louise and sadly so many like she who be wait for justice we know that justice delay be justice deny that be why we ask sir brian leveson to conduct the once in a generation reform of our criminal court system to ensure that we have a criminal justice system fit for the future which break down the backlog on our court case so that victim such as louise be no long wait for justice 
 last week the justice committee hear evidence about the use of special measure to support vulnerable or intimidate witness to give their good evidence that be obviously so important in rape and sexual assault case will the minister reaffirm her support for the continue use of those measure despite some debate about the evidence of their effectiveness 
 i be pleased to attend the justice committee to discuss how important section be to vulnerable witness and victim and the difference that it make by allow victim of rape and sexual offence crime specifically to be maintain within the justice system allow they to give their evidence in a safe manner that be more accessible to they in a justice system where currently of rape victim be withdraw from the process because of the backlog the wait and how traumatic it be anything that help they to be maintain in the criminal justice system be worth championing 
 my constituent wait month to face her abuser in court only to be tell the day before the trial be suppose to begin that it have be postpone until may how be victim of domestic abuse suppose to get redress and closure when they face such intolerable delay 
 it be unacceptable that this be be allow to carry on in our court which be why we be take that fundamental reform because without victim we would not have a criminal justice system and it be important that we put they at the heart of this we be fund independent domestic abuse advocate to support victim to get they through the system quick we be also committed to roll out more specialist domestic abuse court that be of the clear recommendation of the leveson review and it be something that the courts minister my hon and learn friend   the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman and i be work closely on to support victim but i will happily discuss this far with the hon member to ensure that we get this right for victim of domestic abuse 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 child sex offender destroy the life of their victim so why do the justice secretary as foreign secretary appoint the good pal and know business partner of of the world ’s most notorious paedophile as our ambassador to washington what message do the minister think this send to the victim of rape and child sex abuse here in the uk 
 child sexual abuse be of the most abhorrent crime in our society that be why it be this government who be enact the recommendation of the grooming gang inquiry that be why we have kick off the review into ensure that victim get the justice they so deserve it be why we be today introduce a hillsborough law a groundbreaking law to ensure that victim and survivor never again have to wait decade for truth and justice 
 the minister could not answer because it be simply indefensible and she know it everyone in this house know it everyone know it on sunday the family of of epstein ’s victim virginia giuffre say that mandelson should never have be appoint i agree almost every person in this country agree do the justice secretary not read the paper that detail mandelson ’s extensive connection to epstein after he have be convict or do he read they and flippantly disregard the crime and pain he cause so many will the minister take this opportunity in her role to apologise on behalf of the justice secretary to epstein ’s victim 
 i understand the point be raise and it be a very important but we be a long distance from the original question 
 it be about justice for victim 
 i be well aware of that and certainly do not need to be tell we have a hour debate come up on that subject so hopefully the minister can respond 
 thank you mr speaker the shadow justice secretary say from a seat position that this be about justice for victim if this be really about justice for victim in the year of his government he would have carry out reform to ensure that victim get swift justice instead he preside over a criminal justice system that be at break point where victim be wait year for their day in court and where prison be overflow and we be unable to ensure that there be always a space available it be this government that be ensure there will always be a prison place available it be this government that be get on with carry out the recommendation of the national grooming inquiry it be this government that take victim and justice seriously 
 what step he be take to introduce statutory regulation of the funeral sector 
 on   july the fuller inquiry recommend introduce statutory regulation for funeral director the government recognise the urgency of the concern raise and we be carefully consider all the recommendation the government have commit to respond to the inquiry with an interim update on progress this year and a final response will be give by summer 
 the minister will be aware of the plight of zoe ward and cody townend mum from leeds who tragically lose baby in different circumstance but who both go to the same funeral director who do not treat their baby body with the dignity care or respect that they deserve despite the shocking detail of these case the police find nothing actionable because the funeral sector be not regulate in any way will the minister commit to meet zoe cody and i to discuss these horrific case but also to talk about how quickly we can regulate the law in this area to ensure that what happen to they never happen to anyone ever again 
 the whole house will be utterly horrify at the case of zoe and cody and what they have have to go through dignity for our deceased should be uphold by all as something of fundamental importance my colleague and i be commit to ensure that we get funeral regulation right and i be work on that with colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government the department of health and social care and the department for business and trade i would be honour to meet my hon friend zoe and cody to discuss this far 
 what step he be take to support witness through the criminal justice system 
 support victim and witness be key to ensure that offender be bring to justice measure be in place to support victim we have already discuss those measure such as section and the ministry of justice fund victim and witness service the witness service provide emotional and practical on the day support to help prosecution and defence witness in criminal court across england and wales because we need they to be able to give the good evidence possible 
 i recently meet a constituent who have serve as a juror in a very distressing child sexual abuse case she highlight the profound impact that such trial can have not just on the witness themselves but on the juror who may experience trauma and even post traumatic stress disorder although the appointment of the new victim commissioner be welcome could the minister outline what support be available for juror who have to cope with the impact of the evidence they see and hear in such distressing case 
 the hon member make an important point i would like to take this opportunity to put on the record my thank to everyone who do their civic duty by take part in jury service jury be a cornerstone of our justice system and carry out an important function there be support available for juror and i be so sorry to hear of her constituent ’s situation if the hon member want to write to i i will happily look into this more and work with she on what more we can do to support juror who do such a brilliant job 
 my constituent billy boyack see his wife angela and son stephen kill in a head on collision the driver responsible initially show no remorse and be already ban from the area under bail condition he receive only a year sentence how do the minister intend to redress the unfairness in our sentencing law with victim like billy suffer such injustice 
 all my thought be with billy and the family for the horrific tragedy they have suffer my hon friend will know that we be debate the sentencing bill later today look at how we redress the balance here the law commission be also do a special piece of work look at homicide law and i would happily discuss that with she and billy and discuss how good we can support they 
 what assessment he have make of trend in the level of reoffende rate 
 although there be a long term downward trend in the rate of prove reoffende this country remain an outlier in that regard that be why the government be take action to reduce reoffende especially among prolific offender that include measure in the sentencing bill on short term sentencing community punishment investment in regional employment council to bring local partner together to help offender into work and the rolling out of intensive supervision court which have have incredibly encouraging result so far 
 i too welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state for justice and his new ministerial team to their role the clink charity have deliver life change rehabilitation at hmp brixton for over a decade significantly reduce reoffende rate indeed its graduate be less likely to reoffend however the charity have recently be tell that it must compete in a commercial procurement process alongside large corporation to continue operate at brixton that risk disadvantage an award win charity with a prove track record that be have a positive impact do the minister agree that this be unfair and can he reassure i that he will review the situation to ensure that procurement process consider the excellent work already be achieve by organisation such as the clink 
 yes i be aware of the great work that the clink do as be the justice secretary and the prisons minister in the other place we will be review what have happen and be happen there in due course 
 of the key way to reduce reoffending be to ensure that ex offender leave prison have secure place to live and be not tempt to go back to a life of crime however it can be a consequence of early release that that be not prepare in advance what action will the minister take so that prison governor and those involve in the prison service ensure that ex offender go into secure accommodation once they leave prison 
 the hon member raise an important point and challenge for the probation service as the sentencing bill come to fruition i be with the justice secretary just last week meet probation staff housing be a big challenge i will work with colleague from across government to ensure that we be up to that challenge the hon member make a good point and i will update the house in due course 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 it be my honour to take my oral question as lord chancellor and justice secretary 
 today the government will introduce the public office accountability bill well know as the hillsborough law it will create a new professional and legal duty of candour place public servant under a duty to act with honesty and integrity at all time it will be back by a new offence for mislead the public and new offence for misconduct in public office 
 this be an historic moment but the credit belong not to the government but to the family of the whose courage never falter and to all who fight for justice after grenfell after windrush after the infected blood and horizon scandal this law will be their legacy we can not rewrite history but with the hillsborough law we can ensure that it never repeat itself again 
 i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s passionate remark some of people in the youth justice system have a speech and language need that may impact on their ability to access justice but only a tiny fraction of those young people have receive any speech and language support how be he work across government particularly with the department of health and social care and the department for education to prevent those vulnerable young people from be disproportionately draw into the youth justice system 
 i remain very concerned particularly about neurodiversity in young people and how they fare in the criminal justice system i will look closely at the youth justice system work closely with colleague in the department of health and social care and of course the department for education 
 i call the shadow justice secretary 
 i welcome the justice secretary to his place the only in out deal that be work in the government be the for deputy prime ministers 
 just last month the country be cry out that the justice secretary must face justice after his scandalous failure to register a licence for fish well he think he be off the hook but finally it be justice for lammy i know that he have a previous and rather traumatic experience with john humphrys on mastermind so i hope that he be sit comfortably how many foreign national be clog up our prison and do   he stand by the letter he sign that oppose the removal of foreign criminal of whom go on to murder 
 i will look forward to this i know that the right hon gentleman be so good that my predecessor be promote and that he be audition for another job let i be clear return under this government have go up i take a keen interest as foreign secretary they will be go up far 
 i will give it to the justice secretary that be a well reply than the he give when he be ask which monarch succeed henry viii and he say henry vii but it be not the answer that i be ask for in fact there be foreign national in our prison and that figure have go up under labour the obstacle to so many of their removal be the european convention on human right which have morph into a charter for criminal the previous justice secretary pretend that we could reform the echr but the attorney general lord hermer have state that that position be a political trick be it a trick that this justice secretary intend to play on the british public 
 i know the right hon gentleman be a corporate lawyer but he really need to get into the detail we be reform through the sentencing bill so that we can get people out of the country by deport they on sentencing he need to get into the weed and look at the bill he can do well 
 i have to raise a harrowing case from my constituency an year old mother and grandmother report be sexually assault in her care home by of the worker when this be report it be find that that care worker be already be investigate for a number of similar assault the family have wait over a year already to get into court and they have now be tell they will have to wait until will the minister meet i to review this case importantly the family also ask can we look at how we learn from this to improve the system for other family 
 i be deeply trouble by this case and of course i be happy to meet my hon friend it be hard to think of a more graphic illustration of what we mean when we say that justice delay be justice deny and it be exactly why this government be grip the backlog in our court with record sitting day increase sentencing power for magistrate and by propose once in a generation bold reform of our criminal court 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i would like to associate myself with the deputy prime minister ’s comment on the bravery of the hillsborough family and pay tribute to they for the success that have be land today 
 many of we across the house be deeply concerned that domestic abuser be weaponise the family court to perpetrate their abuse effort to reform it have not yet be forthcoming from this government and we need change will the deputy prime minister commit   to legislate in the next king ’s speech for reform of the family court so that it support survivor and do not sabotage they any long 
 we be determined to look at this lacuna for victim of domestic violence and if necessary we will come forward with further amendment or indeed legislation 
 may i associate myself with the secretary of state ’s remark about the remarkable achievement of the hillsborough campaigner 
 last week i meet soroptimist international member in stafford who raise concern about mother in drake hall prison in my constituency every year child have their mother go to prison yet only be take care of by their father where do those child go and what step be the minister take to ensure that child of woman in prison be properly identify and take care of 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her really important question i work with the amazing charity child heard and see prior to get this role i be determined to ensure that we do more to protect the child of prisoner the prisons minister in the other place be already work with the women ’s justice board to look at well way we can treat woman prisoner to ensure that they be rehabilitate 
 my team and i support many family navigate the special educational need and disability system and of the challenge be delay in get access to tribunal justice as the secretary of state get to grip with his new role will he make shorten those delay of his priority and can he update the house accordingly

 my hon friend raise a really important point the sentencing bill which we will debate later today have really important measure that will protect victim of domestic abuse and ensure that victim be at the heart of our criminal justice policy as well as probation service 
 of my constituent have be tell that their crown court case will not be hear until year after the alleged offence occur the delay be due to court closure and a lack of capacity locally the government should not need a report to tell they that they need to make more court available at more time and they need to fund our court properly we have have question about this from around the chamber already so i will take a slightly different angle what do the minister have to say to my constituent who have another year to wait for their case to be resolve year of be unable to work and year of uncertainty hang over her head 
 the sort of delay that the hon gentleman ’s constituent be experience be unacceptable the consensus be that the delay be unacceptable and that we have to do something big and bold about they this be a complex system which be why we have ask sir brian leveson with his expertise to tell we how good we go about that but we will have to get behind once in a generation reform we be grip the issue now we be make record investment in criminal legal aid and sit day but we will need reform as well 
 i thank the deputy prime minister for his announcement on the hillsborough law for decade the family have carry the weight of injustice and government have fail to act today the hillsborough law will be lay before this house but it must not be another false start will the deputy prime minister promise i that this bill will be the hillsborough law and that it will emerge strong and not weak from parliament and finally deliver justice for the

 i be pleased to meet andrew turner and   the hon member for horsham john milne   on this important issue we have to get the balance right between protect vulnerable adult from financial abuse while at the same time ensure that they can access asset that be theirs it be complicated and require cross government work but i assure the hon lady that the impetus be there

 i know the hon lady ’s constituency well so i will take a close look at the issue 
 victim of sexual crime be understandably often traumatise what step be the government take to ensure the long term sustainability of specialist support for those victim such as the calderdale womencentre which provide support for victim in calder valley in particular give the long wait for justice and the high demand for trauma inform support 
 may i put on the record my sincere gratitude to the womencentre for do all it can to support the victim of these crime support service be a vital element of ensure that victim and witness engage with the criminal justice system and be keep inform about the uptake of their trial we have ringfence funding to protect these special support service we be currently go through the allocation process to ensure that we have support service at the front of our mind and i will be happy to keep my hon friend update as that come forward

 yes i can 
 barlinnie prison be operate at above capacity and his majesty ’s inspectorate of prisons be strongly urge scottish government action before the £ replacement be   finally build in what step be minister take to avoid the costly mistake of the snp scottish government in tackle the prison capacity crisis 
 the snp be run down scotland and waste taxpayer money on the new barlinnie prison more than double the original estimate cost we be do much well on this side of the border and we be work with colleague to see what we can do about that situation 
 do the new secretary of state for justice recognise sharia law and sharia court in the united kingdom yes or no 
 sharia law form no part of the law of england and wales but where people choose to put themselves before those council in common with christian jewish and other court of faith that be part of religious tolerance which be an important british value 
 will the secretary of state join i in pay tribute to officer at harlow police station during recess i go on a ride along and see their professionalism and dedication at hand 
 i agree with my hon friend 100%—and not just because a lot of those officer be spurs supporter 
 prison officer at whitemoor prison in my constituency have raise concern that the recruitment process for staff be not work effectively and be unduly bureaucratic will the secretary of state write to i with his assessment and look at what change could be make 
 yes of course and i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for raise that point 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 i be sure the lord chancellor have read baroness harman ’s independent review of bullying harassment and sexual harassment at the bar and on the bench which be publish last week its troubling finding be primarily for the bar itself and for the judiciary to address but do the government support the report ’s recommendation and what can they do to ensure that they be implement 
 in typical fashion baroness harman have conduct a thorough review into our profession and the judiciary the judiciary and the bar be of the pride of this country but where there be unacceptable practice and behaviour it be right that we shine a light on they and demand that we do much well 
 as ministers will know some rogue builder take thousand of pound from people wreck their home and leave they while they go on to do the same to other victim yet victim be tell that no crime have be commit will the ministerial team look at the notion of fraud when a pattern of such behaviour can be evidence 
 we will be consult on a new victim code in due course to make sure that all these crime be capture so that we can support all victim i would be happy to discuss this matter far with the right hon gentleman 
 for year lancaster courthouse have be surround by temporary fencing as it await maintenance how much long will my constituent have to wait 
 i be happy to meet my hon friend to address her point and to give she the detail that she require 
 the new minister state early that the government have create new prison place but of those be at hmp millsike which be part of the new prison programme that be announce by the previous conservative government the additional prison place estate expansion programme include the houseblock and refurbishment programme and the category d programme have be downgrade from amber to red in the delivery confidence assessment due to the programme ’s key supplier enter administration what step be the justice secretary take to put prison construction back on track 
 the hon member seem to be the last person defend the last conservative government on prison and law and order the truth be that over year    they build prison place in month this labour government have build place we be fix the mess that they leave behind 
 voice a domestic abuse charity in bath have create a guide to family court proceeding to support survivor to navigate the family court without legal representation the pilot be roll out in the south west and in yorkshire will the government work with voices to roll it out nationally 
 i be happy to meet voices to discuss that guidance we have be work with organisation like the children and family court advisory and support service and cafcass cymru to ensure that victim and survivor have the good support available when they be navigate the family court process 
 under current law most instance of the sexual abuse of animal be not offence not only be those act despicable in themselves but give the proven link between animal abuse and child abuse do the minister agree that this dangerous gap be a miss opportunity to identify abuser before they go on to harm child 
 i commit to look at that far 
 on a point of order mr speaker on   june i ask a write question to the department of health and social care seek an update on plan for a new dental school at the university of east anglia this be a hugely important issue for people in norfolk and have be raise by mp across the house i have be leave with a hold answer by the department for month with no update in sight and today we break for another month of recess this be not an acceptable way for the government to handle scrutiny i seek your guidance on what avenue be available to i to secure answer from the government on this issue of deep concern to my constituent 
 it be totally unacceptable to treat any member of any party in this house that way to be leave with a hold answer for month be not acceptable i be sure those on the treasury bench be now busily answer that question if not please let i know and i be sure we can do something more about it 
 on a point of order mr speaker last week the house debate the incursion into polish airspace by russian drone and there be clear cross party unity on the need for the uk robustly to support our nato ally it be therefore deeply disappointing that the secretary of state for defence choose to announce the deployment of typhoons to poland outside this house there be nothing more important than the defence of the realm and the decision to deploy service personnel be of the high significance minister have offer a write statement today but this action after the fact do not live up to the severity and importance of the decision that the government have make to deploy our plane and personnel can you advise on how we can ensure that future statement of this magnitude be bring properly before this house 
 i will be quite honest this house should be treat with respect the fact be that i be not quite sure whether the secretary of state could have come to the house before the typhoons be need and i never want to put the house in that position i can assure the hon gentleman however that i have have no indication that a minister intend to come to the house to make a statement on this matter quite rightly he have put his point on the record i take defence matter seriously and i be sure that he will have be hear 
 on a point of order mr speaker thank you for allow i to raise a point of order of which i have send give you notice have you have an indication from the foreign secretary that the government will either come to this house today or that they will make a statement concern the un independent international commission of inquiry report on the occupied palestinian territories that report have confirm in horrify detail the act of genocide now be commit by israeli force against the palestinian people against child destroy hospital destroy school and destroy life itself this be a serious matter if we be to continue normal relation with israel i think the foreign office need to   explain why we be have those relation with a country that be commit act of genocide against the palestinian people 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order i have have no indication that ministers intend to come to the house to make a statement on this matter but he have certainly put the point on the record i know that many other member be concern i will look to the government to bring forward a statement on our immediate return to the house if not i be quite sure that other will on our return look to place before i a request for an urgent question 
 far to that point of order mr speaker the un independent international commission of inquiry on the occupied palestinian territories have conclude that israel have commit genocide in gaza despite welcome the israeli president last week the government have fail to make a statement as we have hear as the house be about to go into recess can you advise i and the house how we be to seek accountability on this important matter 
 i can not add any more to what i have already say once again i be sure that those on the treasury bench have listen to the right hon member i know that we have hour for the next debate but quite rightly this message have go across i could not be clear i expect the government to come forward with a statement if not i be sure i can work with member who may wish to place an urgent question before the house 
 on a point of order mr speaker on   september   the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks now minister of state in the department for energy security and net issue a write statement on the contingent liability from the fund decommissioning programme and government support package for sizewell c which be due to be undertake on   october it be a liability to government and taxpayer that could reach up to the tune of £ that be a significant contingent liability for the public purse and due parliamentary scrutiny be necessary although the minister state reason for not provide the require day for scrutiny and withholding of approval which be normally require for any contingent liability above £ surely parliament should have be present with the result of the ongoing review of the liability during whatever time be available and parliamentary time should have be schedule to allow parliamentarian to scrutinise 
 order i think i get the message in the minute 
 i be very grateful to the hon member for give notice of her point of order as she say a contingent liability of this size would normally involve the laying of a memorandum for a period of sitting day before the guarantee be approve the write statement make by the minister for energy on   september when the house return from the summer recess set out the reason why the usual process could not be follow in this case i suggest that the hon member might want to raise this matter privately with the public accounts   committee and the energy security and net committee i know that she be a doughty member who will ensure that those concern be raise in many other area

 bill read the time to be read a time on   monday october and to be print bill with explanatory note bill en 
 emergency debate standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that this house have consider the appointment process and the circumstance lead to the dismissal of the former united kingdom ambassador to the united states lord mandelson 
 sometimes exquisite coincidence happen in this place we have just see a bill present on the topic of public office accountability by the immediate past foreign secretary the now justice secretary i will just read to the house the line of its description 
 a bill to impose a duty on public authority and public official to act with candour transparency and frankness 
 i think i might return to those issue in the course of what i have to say 
 as i have say this be a matter of utmost concern across the house it be an issue that do not just concern the conservative party the scottish national party or the dup member from all part of the house be worried about it as we have see in the newspaper the government have key question to answer and as i say yesterday the central question be who know what and when let we be clear though there be many question on many level in this matter and the government must answer they all so far they have singularly fail to do so 
 the question fall naturally into category be peter mandelson ever an appropriate character to appoint as our ambassador hon member no well we will get to that later secondly what be the procedure for vetting be it properly follow and why have it go so horribly wrong thirdly what have happen in the last couple of week to lead to the demise of the former ambassador who make the critical decision and why fourthly what do we do now how do we make this government tell the house and the nation the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth which in itself would be a novelty for lord mandelson 
 let we begin with whether lord mandelson be ever an appropriate selection as i say yesterday our ambassador in washington stand at the nexus of our most important bilateral relationship for those who have not serve in government it be the bilateral relationship run by no not the foreign office that be because it be so important and it be a role of exceptional sensitivity more classified information cross the ambassador ’s desk than get to most cabinet ministers indeed in british embassy the agency report to the ambassador it be not the same in american embassy where the cia do what it want our agency report to the ambassador so it be a sensitive post 
 today peter kyle i have forget his new post say that global circumstance dictate that the position of this particular ambassador be more important than it have ever be and it could easily go terribly wrong the failure to appoint the right person have already have a serious and deleterious impact on the national interest 
 the prime minister stake his special relationship with the us president on the diplomatic skill of an ambassador who have a special relationship with the world ’s most notorious child sex offender i be sure that the right   hon gentleman agree that the prime minister ’s judgment and the uk ’s presence on the world stage have be diminish by this affair 
 there be no doubt that the right hon lady be correct frankly i be go to try not to make this ad hominem about the ministers who make decision we need to make that decision later as it be she be right that it have diminish the standing of our prime minister and i regret that although we be the opposition i want this government to succeed in the national interest and this be do the opposite of that the ambassador ’s conduct both prior to appointment and during must reflect the high standard of integrity that be fundamental and it be true for any ambassador 
 i commend the right hon gentleman on secure this debate it unite the house with its purpose it be clear within the rule that mp be accountable for their staff and their conduct and that there will be repercussion do he agree that the prime minister be accountable for his appointment of the uk ambassador to the united states of america and the same rule should apply 
 the hon gentleman be absolutely right when we look at the mechanism engage as i hope we will in the course of this debate we will see why the prime minister make the wrong decision there be no doubt in my mind that he do 
 the right hon gentleman talk about decision by the prime minister he talk about the duty on member of this place and of the other place to conduct themselves appropriately do it surprise he as it surprise i that we have a situation where my hon friend   the member for york central rachael maskell   have be unfairly suspend from the labour whip along with other for oppose disability benefit cut and the mother of the house my right hon friend   the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott remain suspend from the labour party yet lord mandelson retain the labour whip in the house of lords be all of those thing not decision by the prime minister people outside here include labour member think it be completely unfair 
 i understand all too well the point that the hon gentleman be make many have make it in the newspaper although generally anonymously a double standard apply to the top of the labour party labour royalty if you like as oppose to other people who have be punish for do their job represent their people and so on he have get a point 
 rise 
 i will give way but then i must make some progress 
 do the right hon gentleman not think it slightly odd that sufficient due diligence be not do prior to the appointment of lord mandelson on the day before lord mandelson be dismiss apparently there be a lot of email available to the prime minister that he either be not give or do not read we find ourselves in this odd situation where the british ambassador   to the usa have to be dismiss in the full glare of international publicity because of his past behaviour which be apparently well known to a very large number of people who should not have support his appointment in the place 
 the right hon gentleman be exactly right we will come to a number of circumstance in which information be available and should have be but be not act upon this be not as hard as some may try to portray it as be after all the appointment do not come as a surprise lord mandelson himself be clearly campaign to become the ambassador after fail to win the chancellorship of oxford university indeed someone tell i that he be actually campaign for the ambassadorship while also campaign for the chancellorship so he be after job not it be clear at an early stage that he be go to attempt to do this and there be widespread discussion at the time about his suitability for the role so there be plenty of time for a preliminary investigative or vetting process there be and be a vast amount of datum in the public domain most of what i will speak of today be public domain material i will explain when it be not 
 what would those conduct that vetting process be look for a number of we on these benches and i would imagine on most benches have be through such process ourselves traditionally they would review the history and personality of the candidate assess risk such as the risk of the candidate be susceptible to undue influence or in extreme example blackmail the russians and the chinese collect kompromat all the time the risk of the candidate abuse or misuse the role the risk of the candidate do something that would cause reputational damage or the risk with which some on the labour front bench may have difficulty and which they may find rather old fashioned that the candidate be too morally flawed to be give a major role in any case and fail a simple ethical test which be where we may arrive in a moment i be afraid that i be old fashioned i view ethical test as an absolute which can not be trade off against some benefit or other 
 in the history that i be about to detail we see a peter mandelson who be easily dazzle by wealth and glamour and be willing to use his public position to pursue those thing for himself this be visible very early in his career even to his friend in he be sack as trade and industry secretary for fail to declare a pretty enormous interest free loan that he have receive from geoffrey robinson at that time mr robinson ’s business be be investigate by mandelson ’s department so there be a clear clash of interest and mandelson do not even declare the loan that be the occasion on which we see so publicly the abide flaw in his character which would generally disqualify any normal person for a job as important as this even his friend see that of his flaw be describe plainly by of his friend back then who say 
 peter be live beyond his mean pretend to be something he ’s not and therefore he be beholden to people 
 the important bit be that last phrase he be beholden to people it be a characteristic that be display time and again as he seek to use his position to curry favour with very wealthy and very powerful people who be either current or future benefactor 
 this be repeat in when lord mandelson be again sack after attempt to broker a british passport for mr hinduja a wealthy donor to the millennium dome project with which he be involve mandelson attempt to influence the home office to give mr hinduja a passport when mr hinduja and his brother be under investigation in the bofors weapon contract scandal again a dubious reason incidentally it be at about that time that his association with epstein start and the infamous birthday book entry date from then 
 do the right hon gentleman share my concern about the possibility that the prime minister will discuss this issue with president trump later in the week the prime minister have to have influence over president trump for very good reason but if the issue of lord mandelson ’s relationship with jeffrey epstein come up we understand that president trump also contribute to that birthday book with an infamous poem what be the prime minister go to say 
 i be very glad to say that i be not the prime minister ’s speechwriter but all i can say to the hon gentleman be that i hope the issue do not come up because it would undoubtedly be embarrassing and diplomatically problematic for the prime minister 
 astonishingly after be sack twice for misdemeanours in lord mandelson be appoint by tony blair to be the european trade commissioner he be as it be give a chance as the trade commissioner he be criticise on numerous occasion for accept lavish hospitality from company on whose commercial interest he be in the process of ruling whether the company concern be microsoft an italian shoe producer or whatever which for some reason often involve free luxury cruise he see nothing wrong with such apparently compromise behaviour and in that category indeed rather at the top of it be his association with the russian oligarch and gangster capitalist oleg deripaska 
 let we be clear who we be talk about here because most member probably do not know much about he mr deripaska be the winner of the battle for control of the russian aluminium industry a battle in which roughly people be murder in court report interpol document and american government publication deripaska have face serious allegation of murder bribery extortion and involvement in organised crime this be a truly bad man 
 i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give way and for the case that he be make i wonder whether while he be deal with the influence of russian oligarch in british politic he will opine on the suitability of british political party accept donation from russians and the impact that that might have on their policy and their position 
 have the hon gentleman be here before the last election he would have sit in this chamber i hope and hear i opine on all those subject and raise prospective law to deal with those oligarch law that sadly this government have fail to carry through 
 that then be the backdrop mr deripaska ’s visa be revoke by the americans in so mandelson have no excuse for not know about his activity yet as european trade commissioner he see fit to accept hospitality from deripaska on multiple occasion over several year which include visit he in moscow and be fly by his private jet to stay at his dacha in siberia and on his private yacht in the mediterranean all while consider whether to give russian aluminium access to the european market deripaska ’s activity be know to the british security service and briefing be available to mandelson so again there be no excuse he do this in the full knowledge of who he be deal with it be in this position that mandelson promote and sign off concession to russian aluminium company which ultimately benefit mr deripaska or his company to the tune of $ a year although it do not actually happen company be due to be the subject of an initial public offering due to be float shortly thereafter a $ change in profit tend to mean a multibillion dollar change in value and that will have go into the pocket of mr deripaska as we all know deripaska be a nominee of putin so we can assume that a large chunk of it go to putin as well 
 in mandelson be very controversially raise to the peerage by gordon brown and appoint business secretary his contact with epstein do not end as epstein be plead guilty to child sex offence mandelson email he 
 i think the world of you and i feel hopeless and furious about what have happen your friend stay with you and love you 
 little remorse there shall we say and little pity for the victim 
 after lord mandelson leave office when labour lose the election in he found a lobbying firm global counsel controversially he do not name his client the house of lords have rather slack rule about this so somebody can create a company and just declare that they get however much money from the company but they do not declare who the customer really be i do not have documentary record on this so i be not go to name the company i be talk about but there be russian company extremely dubious russian company and chinese company i be look at my right hon friend   the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith who would recognise a number of the chinese company because he have campaign about they but i will leave it there 
 in the context of lord mandelson ’s appointment to washington and bear in mind that this be all to do with a judgment make about his be the ambassador in washington it be his close association with the organ of the chinese state that should have raise most red flag if the house will forgive the pun the inter parliamentary alliance on china present a dossier to us senators which provoke enough concern that they pass it to the fbi this may have be a reason and here i be surmise for the purported concern about whether the trump administration would allow mandelson ’s accreditation back in january 
 i appreciate some of the point the right hon member be make but i would just note that of the conservative candidate run in a milton keynes constituency at   the last general election work for global counsel it be interesting that the conservatives have such complaint about this organisation when they be willing to support a candidate who work for it 
 i be go to be very gentle let i just say that we be talk about a very serious issue in which the national interest be engage and about somebody who in my view have use his public position to his own advantage and to the disadvantage of the state that be not true of some candidate work in a junior role for the company but it be true of the man who create that company and use it to promote his own interest 
 to come back to the inter parliamentary alliance on china from my point of view and this be personal rather than political even more worrying be the attitude strike by mandelson in february when during a lobbying meeting on behalf of his rich client he tell chinese premier li keqiang that the critic of beijing ’s human right record would be prove wrong that astonishing statement be follow later in by mandelson be the only labour peer to vote against a line whip against a genocide amendment that would have mean this country have to reconsider any trade deal with a country find by the high court to be commit genocide and most specifically china be in the crosshair frankly it would appear that lord mandelson have subcontract his conscience for money 
 my right hon friend have mention the inter parliamentary alliance on china in case the house think it be a conservative organisation can i explain that it have members of parliament from all party in this house that country be involve and that it have co chair from both the left and the right it be wholly above party politic but be all about the threat from china 
 my right hon friend be exactly right and the senators to whom these document be send be very responsible one they would not frivolously pass on such document to the fbi and the fbi would not frivolously accept they and investigate 
 do my right hon friend recall that on   november   last the prime minister be challenge to rule out appoint lord mandelson as ambassador to the united states on the ground that he have say ukraine would have to give up all the land russia have occupy and that it must give up any hope of ever join nato in return for some unspecified security guarantee the prime minister say he would not be tempt to comment on the possibility of his be appoint ambassador and as he say it he have a very noticeable little smirk on his face do my right hon friend agree that the prime minister be not smirk about this matter any more 
 i say to my right hon friend that the prime minister give what be clearly what can i say?—a lawyer ’s answer to that question which as we all know be not a proper answer at all 
 no be well aware that mandelson have continue his relationship with epstein after he be convict as a paedophile how the prime minister could possibly have think it be wise to appoint a man who be on   record consorting with allege murderer and convict paedophile to a position of privilege and power be to i utterly unfathomable 
 the right hon member have rightly point out lord mandelson ’s murky attitude towards money but do this not also shine a terrible light on his attitude towards woman which by contrast do not look good for the government 
 i agree the hon member be right lord mandelson ’s continue support of epstein show an attitude that i find completely reprehensible in exactly that respect because epstein ’s victim be woman young woman girl child so yes i do agree 
 it have long be clear that mandelson be not suitable to be our ambassador so the question be what change last week the bloomberg email reveal further detail of epstein ’s relationship with he and the birthday book in which he refer to epstein as his good pal be with mandelson by monday evening and with the foreign office overnight or by tuesday morning at the late the prime minister be say to have know of the investigation by tuesday afternoon but not of the content of the email why when our most important diplomat in our most important international relationship be under question or under investigation would the prime minister not want to know the detail of the investigation immediately 
 we understand that the prime minister ’s chief of staff morgan mcsweeney be talk to mandelson all day on tuesday so what be mandelson say to mcsweeney and be this pass to the prime minister of the thing i would ask the minister be if later on he can give the house an undertaking that we can have a record of that conversation because we need to know mandelson give an immediate interview on wednesday morning hour before prime minister ’s question admit that more embarrassing revelation would come out mandelson ’s past scandal and his link to epstein be crystal clear by the time the prime minister rise to speak in pmq last wednesday 
 be my right hon friend aware that james matthews the sky news reporter cornered lord mandelson on   may   to ask he specifically about stay in epstein ’s flat mandelson do not deny it but simply say that he regret have any connection with he these be the kind of question that should have be ask and be be ask by my hon friend   the member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns   and many other member back in may about the suitability of the ambassador do my right hon friend agree that the prime minister should have look into this far at that point 
 exactly and in fact early than that point i will come back to that when i talk briefly about the vetting process 
 what precisely do the prime minister learn from read the bloomberg email that be not already know about lord mandelson from public information and vetting do before the appointment each day that go by we see more shocking revelation not only about his misconduct and his link to jeffrey epstein   but about the failure of both the vetting process and the political judgment of those at the top of government i say to   the hon member for leeds east richard burgon   that that relate not just to their political judgment but to their moral standard and the equity in how they apply those moral standard across the board 
 that bring we to the question what happen to the vetting process most of what i have describe be in the public domain it do not take james bond google could do this what be not in the public domain be in the official record or know to the intelligence agency in other word it be all available to the government we know there be a page propriety and ethic briefing which should have flag concern but it merely trigger an unpenetrating email inquiry that go straight to the point raise by my hon friend   the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans which be where be the question someone do not just send a line email and forget about it they pursue the question and cross question the person under suspicion 
 i be grateful to my right hon friend for give way he will know that member of the intelligence and security committee of parliament be subject to extremely deep vetting there be also a double check which be that parliament have to give its agreement to the appointment to the committee once nominate by the prime minister do the mandelson case not strengthen the argument for pre confirmation hearing by the relevant parliamentary committees of this house in order that candidate can be cross question at the moment the cabinet office advise on only about regulate public appointment for this house ahead of appointment none of they be a foreign commonwealth and development office appointment be it not now time to make that change whether they be political appointment or senior civil servant 
 my right hon friend make a very good point i certainly think that that would be the right way to go for political appointment it would probably be the right way to go for the top dozen embassy i would not worry about all of they without be rude to well i will not pick a country that would just be meaningless but the top dozen be well worth do 
 the right hon gentleman mention that the cabinet office propriety and ethic team produce a report that be presumably hand to the prime minister and that be certainly do prior to the announcement do he agree that the minister must tell we whether the prime minister read that report and whether it contain anything that parliament should have be aware of before he make the appointment 
 the hon gentleman make a good point he be right and i will reiterate the point in addition to what my right hon friend   the member for the wrekin mark pritchard   say there should have be a fully develop vetting process and that appear not to have happen there be a vetting unit in the foreign office and a vetting unit in the cabinet office and normally of they would have be engage on this there have be claim that develop vetting happen after an appointment no it do not for exist ambassador who be on a year vetting   cycle sure for ambassador or officer who be be read into a new class of material sure but for this an outsider come into the most sensitive job in government certainly not 
 will my right hon friend give way 
 i be be frown at by mr speaker for take so much time i will give way for the last time 
 my right hon friend be be very generous at the weekend the secretary of state for business and trade appear to say that the government believe it be worth the risk of appoint lord mandelson from the outset as i hear it what the business secretary be say be that for the positive quality lord mandelson have as they see it it be worth the risk that he might be more involved with a convict paedophile than they think from the outset if that be the risk the government be judge he by be that not shameful 
 i have already say that my view be that ethical standard be absolute so there should not be a trade off 
 let we take this for a as a practical decision and take mandelson at his own measure he love be call the dark lord and all the rest of it he preen himself on be a master of the dark art spin message management political tactic and manipulation of the truth a repertoire of thing that most people would not be proud of if the government think that those skill actually make up for his sin well no he be not as good as he be crack up to be frankly he be be measure remember this against karen pierce the officer in place who be probably the good ambassador in washington and certainly the most revere and after she tim barrow who be our ambassador to the european union during brexit and the national security adviser he know all these thing to the tip of finger be lord mandelson well than they pull the other 
 i be come to the end mr speaker before you frown any more no claim that mandelson be economical with the truth mandelson claim he tell the whole truth both statement can not be true the question i pose to the minister be these will the government rule out mandelson be bring back into government no refuse to rule out give he another job last week if mandelson withhold information during the vetting process will he lose the labour whip i be look at mr burgon when i say that be he go to have to resign from the house of lords will lord mandelson be receive compensation some report in the medium suggest we will pay £ of taxpayer money will the prime minister his chief of staff his cabinet secretary and the permanent secretary to the fcdo appear before the select committees of the house to give evidence will the minister provide the house with the document the propriety and ethic team report and the developed vetting report if it exist require to answer our question as to who know what and when there be many quote in the newspaper from those in the minister ’s own party about their horror regard the prime minister ’s decision and process 
 will the right hon gentleman give way on that point 
 no i really be come to an end 
 i will quote just of they this be a long stand senior labour member 
 i care that this culture of turn a blind eye to horrendous behaviour be endemic at the top of society 
 i agree with he when individual with such association be usher back into the heart of government be we not right to ask what standard now govern appointment to public life impunity be not a right impropriety be not a technicality and survivor of crime should not have to do the heavy lifting of hold the powerful to account 
 i mention at the beginning of my speech that a bill have today be present to the house impose a duty of candour on public authority and public official my last and single question to the minister be this will his government now live up to the word in that bill 
 rise 
 i gently say to the right hon gentleman as he be a senior member that though he have take the time he feel be require it have be long than minute 
 may i just say that when we refer to other member it should be by constituency not by name i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 my committee ask for the opportunity to question lord mandelson at the end of last year when rumour surface about his appointment as ambassador to the united states we continue to ask after his appointment be confirm indeed the minister may remember our exchange on   january   in this chamber when i ask he to 
 allow lord mandelson the time to come before my committee before he leave for the united states 
 to 
 allow my colleague to hear directly why the prime minister have appoint him”.—[official report   january vol c. 
 request be make more often and privately after that and in the month since they have be turn down i understand that there have be some chinese whisper go on it have be claim that the fcdo have be tell journalist that the committee have the opportunity to meet and question lord mandelson when we be in washington obviously there have be a break in the chain because the reality be that we have a minute interaction over breakfast while receive a formal briefing from diplomatic staff about other meeting that day which be quite materially different from the type of formal evidence session require to conduct meaningful scrutiny
