i be grateful to the minister for give way on that point because she be at risk of not necessarily be accurate in her remark she be absolutely right that the conservative government go into negotiation with mauritius but she seem to think that start negotiation mean that the end result must be capitulation and abide by mauritius ’s idea before other member stand up and read out the labour party briefing can i remind the minister that under a conservative foreign secretary lord cameron it be deem that those negotiation be go in a direction that be not in the british national interest and they be end 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step his department be take with the northern ireland executive to help improve public service in northern ireland 
 what recent discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on improve public service 
 what recent discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on improve public service 
 what recent discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on improve public service 
 what recent discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on improve public service 
 i regularly meet northern ireland ministers to discuss the share challenge we face in improve public service and the government will do everything we can to help last week i meet the new finance minister and we both expect to be in a position soon to announce progress on funding to help with the transformation of public service 
 the northern ireland executive be mean to agree their programme for government today but apparently the meeting be cancel at the last minute the secretary of state refer to the transformation fund £ be allocate to it over a year ago but it remain unspent the transformation board that be mean to be manage that fund be still interim with every party in northern ireland clamour for transformation and the secretary of state and his ministerial team call for transformation of public service will the secretary of state for northern ireland intervene with the executive and tell they to get on with it 
 i hope very much that the programme for government will be agree as soon as possible it be the responsibility of the northern ireland executive and i look forward to read it a number of bid be   submit for transformation funding they have be carefully look at by the interim board and as i indicate a moment ago i look forward together with the finance minister to announce the result of that work soon 
 last december the royal college of nursing northern ireland reveal that there be a severe shortage of nursing staff in the north there be almost vacancy in the sector as well as concern about retention what step be the northern ireland office take to support the executive in provide safe level of staffing in northern ireland include by tackle staffing pressure low pay and unacceptable working condition 
 i share the concern that my hon friend express about the number of vacancy the single most important thing that the government have do be allocate for next year a record sum to the northern ireland executive of £ which be an increase of £ the resource be there and it be for the northern ireland executive to decide how they will use they 
 i welcome what the secretary of state have say about public service reform be a share challenge do he agree with i that it be in the interest of patient both in northern ireland and in england to share knowledge of what work and good practice 
 i agree absolutely with my hon friend indeed i discuss that with mike nesbitt the health minister when i meet he recently i ask he what support and help we can give he but we can all learn from each other across the united kingdom 
 when the secretary of state have his discussion with the executive will he look to the example of wales and its social partnership model government public sector worker and union be work collaboratively and be in positive discussion to bring about real change and harmony in the delivery of public service 
 i have not look specifically at the social partnership model in wales to which he refer but i look forward to learn more about it it sound very interesting as i have indicate we have a lot to learn from each other 
 the proactive approach that the secretary of state have set out be an important step change from the approach take by the previous government do he agree that stabilise and transform the health service in northern ireland be now the priority 
 it certainly be have only to look at the waiting list figure in northern ireland some of those wait for a consultant ’s appointment wait for more than a year the figure in england be the minister recently describe the state of the health service in northern ireland as diabolical i be absolutely clear that ministers and the executive understand   that and i very much support the programme that   the new health minister be seek to put in place to deal with that 
 would the secretary of state agree that the appointment of mike farrar as chief executive and head of the northern ireland health service an external appointment be a positive move and a good example of the executive get on with it despite comment that have be make 
 i do agree he have great expertise and knowledge and i be sure that it will be use for the benefit of people in northern ireland particularly patient wait for appointment 
 my daughter live in donegal when her little boy be bear she have the choice of they be bear in derry or sligo on either side of the border the republic of ireland have introduce an initiative call share island that be not a united ireland but it work in improve service will the government look at its success and consider how scotland might work in a similar way to northern ireland for the benefit of service 
 as i understand it there be a long establish arrangement under which people can move from side of the border to the other to seek care particularly in donegal and derry londonderry thing would be slightly different in scotland for physical reason but once again i be sure that all opportunity that can be take to help people get the care they need would be welcome 
 the secretary of state will be aware that it have be a year since the executive be finally re establish in that time they have still be unable to agree a programme for government this morning we learn that today ’s meeting to agree it have be move again do he agree that for the sake of the people of northern ireland it be time they get on with it 
 as i indicate a moment ago i look forward to the executive adopt a programme for government i be aware of what happen early today i be confident that another meeting will be arrange and i look forward to see the programme adopt 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 the government ’s decision to repeal the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act will mean reopen many inquest and civil case many of those case will impact on the police do the secretary of state accept that that will mean a significant cost to the police service of northern ireland 
 as the hon gentleman be aware the legacy legislation that the previous government pass have be find to be flawed and unlawful in a number of respect and it fall to this government to clean up the mess that the last government leave i be in the process of consultation with many party i have already indicate to the house the proposal that i put forward in the remedial order and have say that i propose bring legislation before the house when parliamentary time allow it be important that people be able to   pursue civil case and the ban on they by the last government have be find to be unlawful why should people in northern ireland not be entitle to an inquest 
 my question be about the liability that the police service of northern ireland might be under follow the secretary of state ’s decision police number in northern ireland be at their low ever week ago policy exchange estimate that the cost to the psni of the repeal of the legacy act might well stretch to hundred of million of pound if that be the case will the government step in to support the psni or be they content to see a reduction in frontline policing and national security 
 the government have provide additional funding to the psni in the autumn statement through the additional security fund i have read the policy exchange report and it contain a lot of speculation about number the fact remain that the legislation support by the government of which the hon gentleman be part have not work it be flawed and find to be unlawful i be afraid that the opposition will have to recognise that at some point and it need to be fix 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 pharmacy in northern ireland be in a declare state of crisis pharmacist be have to dip into their saving just to stay afloat and they be cut staff number and opening hour the national pharmacy association which represent community pharmacy have warn that its member may have to far cut opening hour halt home delivery and reduce local support service and that warning be amplify in northern ireland what conversation have the secretary of state have with the northern ireland executive to safeguard access to crucial pharmacy service across rural and urban region do he agree that an urgent impact assessment on pharmacy underfunding be require to highlight the scale of the crisis for community pharmacy which provide vital to life service 
 that issue do not figure in the discussion i have recently with the ni health minister but i have no doubt that it will do so in the future and i will take the matter up 
 many ministerial decision be important in get public service deliver but so too be back up by the civil service there be some concern about the level of expertise in the civil service in northern ireland in the inquiry into the renewable heat incentive the permanent secretary admit that the civil service be not able to give timely advice to ministers and have not give accurate advice what can the secretary of state do to ensure that the gap that there appear to be in expertise in the civil service because the northern ireland civil service be not integrate into the uk civil service can be fill 
 i have meet many civil servant who be do a very good job and be very committed to their work but the northern ireland civil service be the responsibility of the northern ireland executive and the ministers in the departments it be not my responsibility to deal with 
 many project that be design to improve public service be be hold up in the court in northern ireland because of procurement planning and the decision process the late ruse be use to hold up project be the claim that they do not comply with the government ’s net policy and will lead to an increase in carbon dioxide emission of the project that be be hold up be the important a5 road in the west of northern ireland do the secretary of state agree that while we have statutory limit on co2 emission we will always be vulnerable to major infrastructure project be hold up in the court 
 i do not accept that because get to a net world be really important for the future of humankind and the government have commitment that it be very important to fulfil as for delay in the planning system and the way in which the court operate in northern ireland once again those be matter for the executive 
 what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the recommendation in the independent reporting commission 's annual report 
 the irc ’s report highlight progress but remind we that there be still much to do to tackle paramilitarism and the harm it cause follow discussion with the irish government it have be agree to support a short independent scope exercise to assess whether there be merit in a formal process to bring about paramilitary group disbandment as the irc have suggest and whether there would be public support for such a process 
 have spend lot of time with family in northern ireland since i be a small child i have see the progress make over the year and know what a difference it have make on the ground i welcome this government ’s commitment to help secure that progress and tackle the scourge of paramilitarism do the secretary of state share my view that make further progress will require a range of measure and that the executive ’s programme on paramilitarism criminality and organised crime be a crucial part of that 
 i do indeed agree with my hon friend that programme be do very good work and of course the uk government be fund it together with the executive i also agree that a wide range of approach need to be take include continue to use the full force of the law to deal with paramilitary criminality 
 after decade of illegal paramilitary organisation take successive government for a ride over transition and pocket million of pound along the way the secretary of state now want to appoint a special envoy a nursemaid to paramilitary when will this pander come to an end and be the secretary of state go to accept the irc ’s grotesque proposal of move to de proscription   under which organisation that murder thousand of people would ultimately be make legal can he at least rule that out 
 on a happy note will the secretary of state join i in welcome today ’s announcement by the irish football association and the galgorm resort that there will be a new training facility par excellence for northern ireland football team 
 i be very happy to join in what appear to be the general consensus of welcome for the ifa ’s announcement a proposal that i discuss when i meet the ifa during my time as shadow secretary of state 
 on the substantive issue that the hon and learn gentleman have raise the fact be that year later people say that the paramilitary organisation should have leave the stage they be still here despite the progress that have be make and be still cause harm to community the irc ’s proposal which i recognise be not support by everybody be to inquire whether there be some paramilitary organisation that do actually want to leave the stage and whether there be merit in have a process that ensure that however what i announce yesterday be not a process it be a scope study to find out whether it be worth have or not which i think be the right thing to do 
 after all these year people be bewildered that we be still talk about transition paramilitary group which have continue to recruit to grip and to poison community and current day politic in northern ireland will the minister commit to ensure that we learn from all the thing that have not go right and all the previous attempt at transition will he commit to ensure that there be no payday for former paramilitary that we take a serious criminal justice approach and that there be precondition on such thing as emblem and financial asset do he agree that that make it even more important that we get the infrastructure right on the legacy of the trouble and move towards get back on track as a serious rule of law society 
 for the avoidance of doubt there be no question of pay anybody any money to disband there be no question of do that at all as i indicate a moment ago for all the effort that have be make there be much to learn from what have work the fact remain as the independent reporting commission report make clear that many community in northern ireland continue to suffer real harm because of paramilitary activity what be the proof that those who say they be prepared to disband be do so the proof will be do they end recruitment paramilitary style assault intimidation child criminal and sexual exploitation and violence against woman and girl that be what people be experience today in northern ireland 
 i want all paramilitary off our street for good and i also want to see justice do for their victim that be why i can not quite understand why the dublin government be close their eye to the horner judgment which recommend inquiry in the united kingdom and in the republic of ireland the family hearing in omagh have bring the horror of that day to a new generation   will the secretary of state use his influence to call on dublin to give the omagh family the public inquiry they deserve and want so so much 
 i recognise not least because of the commemorative hearing that have be take place in the inquiry that all the pain suffering horror and tragedy of that day have be bring to life again for the family who live with that every single day of the week i welcome the fact that the irish government be commit to co operate with the omagh inquiry i look forward to the signing of the memorandum of understanding it be for the irish government to decide what inquiry they wish to establish in relation to event in the republic 
 whether he have have recent discussion with horticultural supplier in great britain on the supply of good to consumer in northern ireland 
 the secretary of state have meet supplier and my official meet regularly with horticultural industry representative the next meeting of the horticultural working group be in day time and the government be commit to address the outstanding issue on horticultural product to ensure that these can move safely within the uk 
 the situation remain difficult in fact the horticultural trades association say that it remain impossible for some retailer who be try to order product from gb base company for consumer in northern ireland everyone can complain about that but some of we be try to do something about it the government be the people who can bring pressure to bear to resolve this problem for consumer in northern ireland so what action be be take to try to resolve it 
 official from the department for environment food and rural affairs be follow up specifically with the company that be most affect such as seed shipping company shipping seed be allow use phytosanitary certificate but business to business posting be currently smooth than business to consumer posting solution to this issue be be work out within the requirement of the windsor framework and guidance should be update shortly 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 i thank the minister for her answer but we want to know more detail of the progress that the horticultural work group be make on resolve the issue to do with the movement of plant and cut flower from gb to ni under the windsor framework can she please update we on that as a matter of urgency 
 i can provide more update the ban plant be be work through species by species there be in and in and we be work through each of those the working group be take each of those on a case by case basis and work through each issue as it arise 
 give that the grace period will run out within the next year what be the plan to ensure that northern ireland do not run out of veterinary medicine 
 we be work to narrow the range of product that involve a problem but we be work in respect of each of they as well the matter be be give consideration in the knowledge that as the hon member have point out the deadline be approach 
 the windsor framework be a distinct improvement on the old northern ireland protocol but do the minister agree that if we be to ensure the smooth possible movement of agrifood product across the irish sea it be vital that we secure a sanitary and phytosanitary agreement with the european union 
 i agree that the windsor framework be a big improvement on the protocol we be committed to implement it at the same time as seek to negotiate an sps agreement that would provide further improvement in the movement of agrifood product and we must pave the way to that by reset our relationship with the eu and implement the windsor framework in good faith 
 what step he plan to take to replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 what step he plan to take to replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act 
 the approach to legacy take by the last government be wrong it cause immense pain to victim and survivor and in many respect have be find to be unlawful in december i lay a proposal for a draft remedial order to address the human right deficiency in the act that have be identify by the court and when parliamentary time allow i will introduce primary legislation to reinstate legacy inquest halt by the act and to reform and strengthen the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery 
 why do the secretary of state abandon the appeal in dillon and ors 
 because section and of the act be find to be unlawful and as the right hon gentleman will be aware the case that give rise to the attempt to deal with the problem through those section that have now be find to be unlawful arise from a supreme court judgment in for and a bit year the last government be unable to find a solution 
 notwithstanding the secretary of state ’s response may i ask why this labour government be continue to undermine the tough action take by the   conservative government on individual who have act against our democracy and society such as gerry adams by consider repeal the act give adams and other the possibility of a figure payout 
 as i say during the last northern ireland question no want to see that happen we be currently work to find a lawful way of deal with the problem that be create by the way in which the original interim custody order be sign in and i think in the supreme court find that order that have not be sign and consider by the then secretary of state be not lawful 
 in boris johnson commission the shawcross report on libyan sponsor ira terrorism united states citizen have receive compensation from the libyan government for attack on british soil but uk citizen never have will the secretary of state work with the foreign commonwealth and development office to ensure that the report be publish 
 the whole house will have profound sympathy for all the victim of gaddafi sponsor ira terrorism and all the victim of the trouble the shawcross report be commission by the last government as an internal report and decision on the report and its future be currently under review by the fcdo 
 i call the shadow minister 
 people throughout the united kingdom will be disgusted if former terrorist such as gerry adams receive compensation from the taxpayer because of labour ’s decision to repeal the legacy act without put something in its place will the secretary of state finally commit himself to legislate immediately to prevent that from happen 
 i refer the hon gentleman to the answer that i give a moment ago 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday february 
 this week mark year since putin ’s barbaric invasion of ukraine the courage of the ukrainians be inspire and across this house we stand with they for as long as it take that be why we be increase defence spending to of gdp by april with an ambition to reach in the next parliament as economic and fiscal condition allow this afternoon of course i will travel to the us to have discussion with president trump about the endure security partnership between our country 
 i be also delighted that we have announce the school to start offer free breakfast club this be our plan for change in action ensure every child have the chance to thrive 
 i be sure the whole house will want to join i in thank amanda pritchard for her service as chief executive of nhs england and i wish she well for the future 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 could the prime minister tell this house whether the outcome of his budget be by design or by mistake do he mean to push pensioner into poverty with his own analysis when he remove the winter fuel allowance or be that a mistake do he mean to decimate family farming when he change inheritance tax or be that a mistake do he mean to tax gps care home and hospice when he raise national insurance contribution or be that a mistake can the prime minister tell the house whether they be acceptable collateral damage in his path for change or simply mistake that need rectify 
 i will tell the hon member what be a mistake leave a £ black hole that we have to sort out we take the difficult decision invest in our nhs and i would have think he would have welcome the extra appointment that we have achieve in the month of a labour government that be the difference our budget be make to people 
 i be delighted that calton and grange primary school in my city of gloucester will be among the school to get free breakfast club and i be pleased that this government be already deliver on their manifesto promise in less than a year so will the prime minister agree with i that by help work parent with childcare and deliver the good start to the day for every single child we be deliver opportunity for the next generation 
 i agree with my hon friend we be pleased that of the early adopter school will be in his constituency we be ensure that all child of primary school age can get access to free breakfast and at least minute of free childcare that mean every child ready to learn and parent of course support with up to £ a year back in their pocket that be the change a labour government make 
 we now come to the leader of the opposition 
 i wish the prime minister every success on his trip to washington the visit to see president trump must serve our national interest the prime minister and i be completely united in our support for ukraine as a proud and sovereign nation what specific step will he take to ensure ukraine be at the negotiating table for any peace settlement 
 i thank the leader of the opposition for her word about the forthcoming trip it be right and i think the whole house will think it be right that ukraine must be at the table at negotiation there can be no negotiation about ukraine without ukraine that have be my consistent position in all of the   discussion that i have have that will continue to be my position because this be about the sovereignty of ukraine and the ukrainians ability to decide for themselves the future of their country so they must be at the table 
 i thank the prime minister for that answer and as i say i wish he every success we want to support he on this issue 
 turn to the detail of the plan the prime minister set out yesterday over the weekend i suggest to he that he cut the aid budget and i be pleased that he accept my advice—[laughter it be the fast response i have ever have from the prime minister however he announce £ in additional defence spending yesterday this morning his defence secretary say the uplift be only £ which be the correct figure 
 i be go to have to let the leader of the opposition down gently she do not feature in my thinking at all i be so busy over the weekend that i do not even see her proposal she have appoint herself the saviour of western civilisation it be a desperate search for relevance 
 if you take the number for this financial year and the number for the financial year there be a £ increase that be the large sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war and will put we in a position to ensure the security and defence of our country and of europe 
 that be not very clear how be it that the defence secretary say £ but the prime minister say £ the institute for fiscal studies have say the government be play silly game with number how have he find this difference in number 
 we go through this week ago go over the same question again and again let i say it again if you take the financial year this year and then you take the financial year for the difference between the be £ that be the same answer if she ask again i will give the same answer again 
 more 
 i will decide when there be more 
 someone need to tell the prime minister that be patronising be not a substitute for answer question he have not answer the question what he have say be different from what he say yesterday we be still not clear where the money be come from we want to support he he have also say that we should put british troop on the ground in ukraine but we have not see the detail of any proposal would his new spending plan allow he to fund that commitment effectively 
 i think it be the same question again it be £ that be the difference between this year and 
 the leader of the opposition ask a serious question about the security guarantee in ukraine that be extremely important because the bad of all outcome if there be to be a cessation of hostility would be for it to be a short break rather than a sustained and last peace   that mean there have to be security guarantee and i have indicate that we will play our full part there have to be us backing otherwise i do not think it will deter putin we be work on that i be have extensive discussion on it i be not in a position to put detail before the house today as she well know but i will continue down that route i want a last peace in ukraine and europe for the safety and security of ukrainians europeans and of course everybody in this country 
 this be an endeavour that we want to support the prime minister in but we need to know exactly what we be support we need clarity and transparency over the money and we also need to know where the money be go this morning the defence secretary could not say whether the chagos deal would come out of the defence budget can the prime minister confirm to the house that none of the defence uplift include payment for his chagos deal 
 the additional spend i announce yesterday be for our capability on defence and security in europe as i make absolutely clear yesterday the chagos deal be extremely important for our security and for us security and the us be rightly look at it when the deal be finalise i will put it before the house with the costing the figure be bandy around be absolutely wide of the mark the deal be for well over a century the funding i announce yesterday be for our capability and will put we in a position to rise to a generational challenge that be what that money be all about i think the right hon lady support it 
 we need to make sure we be support a plan that be clear and transparent yesterday the prime minister set an ambition for defence spending to reach in the next parliament and we agree with he on that however that could be almost a decade away that be too slow we do not know how he will pay for it we can not raise taxis far and we already pay more on debt interest than defence 
 everyone in this house will have hear the prime minister not answer the previous question so i will ask again be he pay for the chagos deal with this defence uplift or not 
 i have just deal with that question mr speaker the money announce yesterday be go to our capability in order to put ourselves in a position to defend the security of both our country and europe the leader of the opposition ask about defence spending she give what people have describe as a ramble speech yesterday where she could not say what defence spending should be we have be absolutely clear we have set out a full credible costed plan and i think she support it 
 the prime minister will be aware that in coastal community such as mine in east thanet people develop cancer early get treat and diagnose later and die young can he give the house an update on the government ’s plan to implement the recommendation by the chief medical officer chris witty for tackle poor health in our seaside town 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this matter she be right that cancer patient be wait too long for diagnosis and treatment address healthcare inequity be part of our year health plan which aim to halve the gap in healthy life expectancy between the rich and the poor region and we be already make progress on that 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 may i start by wish the prime minister well on his trip to the white house it will not be an easy meeting but we be all behind he for the sake of our national interest it be already clear that sadly under president trump we will not be able to rely on the united states to help ensure our security against russian aggression which be why we strongly welcome the prime minister ’s decision to increase britain ’s defence spending but europe must do far more to rearm in the face of putin ’s threat and the uk must lead on that that be why we back the idea of a new european rearmament bank so that we can finance a big increase in manufacturing capacity without the need to cut britain ’s vital soft power will the prime minister look at this idea work across this house and across europe so that we can make a european rearmament bank happen 
 i shall resist the right hon gentleman ’s suggestion that we somehow have to choose between the us and our european partner i do not believe that to be the case i want to strengthen our already strong relationship with the us because it be vital that we do so i of course want to work with our european ally on defence capability and on what more we need to do in relation to capability co ordination and funding in the long term there be an ongoing discussion among ally as to future funding and i be happy to share that with the house as it evolve 
 i hope the prime minister be successful in keep the us on board with our european ally i be glad that he be talk about finance and defence if he be to push this european rearmament bank at the summit of european leader on sunday i think that he would be push at an open door certainly prime minister tusk be support the idea from the polish point of view 
 let i turn now to domestic matter with the cost of living crisis hit so many of our constituent family in my constituency be really angry that thames water be send they bill this april that will cost they £ a year more thames water have already let down so many people whether it be through leak pipe or pump its filthy sewage into our river a of customer bill be already use just to pay the interest on thames water ’s debt and now the company will borrow £ more be it not time to stop make people pay for bail out the vulture fund that be drown thames water in debt will his government just put this firm out of its misery and put it into special administration so that we can sort out that mess and the mess leave by that lot on the conservative benches 
 the right hon gentleman be certainly right about the mess make by that lot we obviously have our water bill which contain very strong measure and i think that he support they 
 we have hear extraordinary rhetoric come out of washington in recent day and we have see fascist salute on our screen we have witness wild statement about palestinians be expel from gaza and we have see our ally label dictator britain ’s interest be well serve by stand with ukraine work closely with our european ally uphold international law and remain a strong part of nato will the prime minister assure we that this will form a central part of his message when he meet world leader this week 
 we certainly stand with ukraine i think i speak for the whole house when i say that as i set out yesterday nato be the bedrock of our security it have be our most important alliance for many many year and it be as important today as it have ever be we build that alliance by work with the us we have a special and deep relationship with the us that be not just word but to do with security defence and intelligence capability which be vitally important for both side but we also work with our european ally it be that ability to work with the us and our european partner that have hold the peace for so many year and need to hold the peace for many year to come 
 i call the leader of the snp 
 prior to the election the labour party promise to reduce energy bill by £ yet on its watch energy bill be about to increase by almost £ be the failure to keep that promise a consequence of government incompetence or have the labour party be catch lie to the public 
 we be very proud of the fact that we be push forward for energy independence which will keep our bill low the right hon gentleman know very well what my position be however i note again that he be very quiet on the snp record and i will tell hon member why just this week we have see the attainment gap widen in scotland number of pupil leave school with no qualification rise those from deprived area go to work fall instead of play the politic of grievance snp members need to take responsibility for their own record 
 my constituent mike addison be of a kind a physical disability rugby league world champion with england and warrington wolves and an avid volunteer for the club and foundation he be a friend to everyone who know he tragically he die at age have take his own life death by suicide be too many and every suicide be preventable however office for national statistics datum put the rate in the north west at more than double the rate in london with a increase last year will the prime minister outline what more can be do work across government to help warrington meet our target of eliminate suicide 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that tragic case my thought and i be sure those of the house be with the family friend and teammate of mike at warrington wolves she be right   that death by suicide be too many and reduce the number be a vital part of our health mission we be recruit an additional mental health worker who be especially train to support people at risk of suicide we be committed to take forward the suicide prevention strategy for england and i be sure the whole house support that 
 i welcome the prime minister ’s statement commit we to increase defence spending and reaffirm the uk ’s support for ukraine and its democratically elect leader president zelensky he be a wartime leader like winston churchill who also have to delay election because his country face an existential threat as the prime minister travel to washington with this house and the country will he to succeed will he invoke the legacy of churchill in make the case for the uk to be the key in bridge transatlantic relation to bring we all together for the sake of freedom and democracy across the world 
 i thank the hon member for his question and may i pick up on both element president zelensky be a democratically elect leader and suspend election be precisely what we do in this country when we be fight in the world war secondly yes the uk have successfully be a bridge between the us and europe for many year it be vital that we continue in that role that be why my message to president trump be that the relationship between our country need to go from strength to strength it be already strong while we work at the same time with our european ally 
 on monday night there be a brutal double stabbing in my constituency which add to a long line of horrific knife attack that have include fatality over the past year i know that the prime minister be aware of the particular challenge we face in bournemouth although crime have be go down i know there be much more that he will want to do will he join i in praise the crucial work do by organisation such as changes be make which provide positive activity such as box to young people and will he share what more the government can do to tackle knife crime in community such as mine 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that really important issue yesterday we introduce our crime and policing bill which be central to our plan for change and to halve knife crime it involve new power to seize and destroy knife find on private property and a new criminal offence of possess a bladed article with the intent to cause harm plus tough penalty for sell dangerous weapon to under-18s and strict rule for online sale under ronan ’s law we will continue that work 
 the flood of devastate datchet horton and wraysbury and the flooding last january be not much well but shockingly the river thames scheme as currently propose continue to leave my constituent at risk the council be ask to cough up ten of million but like many it be cash strapped do the prime minister agree that   the only option to protect my constituent be to fund channel of the river thames scheme as national strategic infrastructure which really it be

 yesterday   i return from ukraine have spend day with a cross party delegation of parliamentarian the ukrainians we meet from across society have simple message   they be deeply thankful for our partnership and they want we to know that they can overcome the russian invasion because they must do the prime minister agree that alongside our welcome year partnership now be the time for the uk to redouble our effort alongside our european partner to help secure ukraine ’s future as a free democratic and sovereign european nation

 as i have say when the deal be complete i will put it before the house with the costing the money yesterday be allocate to aid our capability and be the single big sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war 
 the whole country stand behind the people of ukraine but there be a view that take money from aid and development to spend on armament and tank make people less safe not more safe because the desperation and poverty that so often lead to warfare be what aid and development money be suppose to counter 
 as i say yesterday overseas development be important and i be proud of what we have do it be not a decision that i take lightly or want to take but it be important at this moment that we put defence spending and the defence and security of our country and europe uppermost we will of course make sure that we be able to fulfil our humanitarian obligation in relation to gaza ukraine and sudan and other vital work i want to be clear we do of course want to go back and increase that funding as soon as we be able to do so 
 i hope the prime minister know that when he travel to washington to meet the former leader of the free world he do so with the hope and prayer of this house and the country probably no more serious a meeting could be take place while the subject of ukraine will clearly dominate will he undertake to raise with president trump the fact that canada be a value respected and much love member of both nato and our commonwealth this childish nonsense of a state should be call out by the prime minister for what it be 
 i thank the hon member for raise this issue the uk and canada be close ally and have be for a long time with a partnership base on a share history and a share set of value and a determination to be an active force for good in the world we work closely with canada on issue of the commonwealth on nato and of course eyes intelligence sharing we will work to strengthen that relationship

 i be not across the detail of the right hon member ’s case as she will understand but i be in favour of make sure that we can have the infrastructure and the house we need to grow our economy of the problem we have over the past year be an assertion or rhetoric that we want home and infrastructure but when the decision for all that come up the answer be always no the answer can not always be no

 i agree with the right hon gentleman entirely on the priority in term of nato putin think he could weaken nato he have only make it strong and large nato ’s strength come from the us european partner and other work together and that be absolutely the focus of my work at the moment it be right as he say that european country include the united kingdom need to do more on capability co ordination and defence spend that must be see not as a project separate to nato but as part of an essential project that ensure nato be there for decade and decade to come preserve the peace just as it have be for year

 this government accept that the final report of the grenfell tower inquiry must be the catalyst for long last systemic change all member of the house past and present will have share my anger over its shocking finding the inquiry chair sir martin moore bick and his dedicated team uncover damn evidence of political corporate and individual failing go back decade these lead to the loss of innocent life of they child on that terrible night in june it be a deadly betrayal and a national tragedy that must never happen again i repeat today what the prime minister say in september to the bereaved family the survivor and those in the immediate grenfell community some of whom be with we today in the gallery on behalf of the government the british state and those responsible i be very sorry 
 the inquiry report make recommendation of which be direct at the government the government accept the finding of the report and will take forward all the recommendation our response publish today address each in turn and go far to set out our wide reform of social housing and the construction sector as we make these vital change we will publish quarterly report on progress and update parliament annually the government be open to scrutiny and will remain accountable for their action 
 we will prioritise resident and protect their interest make sure that industry build safe home and provide clear accountability and enforcement to have anyone anywhere live in an unsafe home be person too many that will be our guide principle and it must be that of anyone who want to build or care for our home that will be an important part of the legacy of grenfell 
 for nearly year despite their pain the bereaved survivor and member of the community have campaign with determination not want anyone to suffer as they have it be fair to say that the building system we have today be not the same as the that be justly criticise in the report the we have lead up to the tragic event of but it be also clear that there be still much more to do so i can announce that we will create a single construction regulator and a chief construction adviser we will set out our detailed plan later this year 
 i be accept the recommendation to professionalise fire engineer and assessor to licence principal contractor and to review the role of building control where standard be clear and industry have clarity and certainty on how individual and firm must behave it encourage investor confidence this will improve the safety of resident and support the construction industry and our mission to deliver economic growth 
 we have pledge to build home over the parliament to tackle our country ’s acute housing crisis as part of our plan for change to improve the life of people across the country it be vital that these future home as well as exist home be safe and of high quality and i welcome how some part of the industry have step up to lead the necessary change in culture and approach 
 but lest we forget sir martin find that just about every institution and organisation charge with keep the tower safe and protect those who call it home fail his most devastating conclusion be that every single death be avoidable the inquiry uncover serial incompetence and negligence complacency and inaction and blatant dishonesty and greed the organisation that fail include the government and regulator the department i now lead which fail to act on know risk and ignore delayed or disregarded matter affect the safety of life and the manufacture company include arconic kingspan and celotex whose product be use to refurbish the tower the report find that they act with systemic dishonesty as they mi sell and market they their disgraceful mercenary behaviour put profit before people and exploit the regulatory regime to evade accountability with fatal consequence to my disgust and their shame some have show little remorse and have refuse even to help fix the building safety crisis that they do so much to create 
 company must be hold to account for their role in grenfell the parliamentary secretary cabinet office be announce today that she will use new power under the procurement act to investigate arconic kingspan saint gobain as the owner of celotex at the time and other organisation i expect swift decisive action and will ensure that progress be report 
 but we must do more to make sure that the right rule be in place to this day critical gap persist in how construction product be regulate only with rigorous reform will we transform the culture that allow the tragedy to happen to achieve that we be also publish today a construction product reform green paper it will help we to cut out the rot in the sector and allow competence to take root safety will come and a culture of responsibility will prevail we will celebrate those who lead the way and those who fall short will suffer the consequence in the future rogue company will be hold to account our green paper set out our idea for prison time for executive who break the rule and unlimited fine where safety be put at risk we will do whatever it take 
 across the sector there be appetite for change that change be overdue and we will lead it i pay tribute to the endure resilience and resolve of the bereaved family the survivor and the member of the immediate community their campaigning have see new legislation pass which member of this government support that have make our public realm more secure everyone be safe thank to the building safety act which set new standard for the construction of residential building in england the act introduce the building safety regulator and provision for high risk building all people live in flat now know that the entrance door external wall and structure of their home be in scope of fire risk assessment thank to the fire safety act there be new duty for owner and manager of building and block of flat the social housing regulation act ensure that landlord be hold to account 
 i have challenge the royal borough of kensington and chelsea to demonstrate how it have change by become an exemplar landlord and local authority i will be keep a close eye on its progress and we will listen to its tenant to assess whether it have succeed 
 we be push ahead with the remediation acceleration plan to fix all building around the country that still have dangerous cladding and where building owner fall short we will act we be introduce regulation to improve the fire safety and evacuation of disabled and vulnerable resident in high rise and high risk residential building as of   april ministerial responsibility for fire function will move from the home office to my department in line with the inquiry ’s recommendation that we bring responsibility for fire safety into a single department 
 people and their safety be front and centre of our inquiry response but there remain a stark and terrible reality the bereaved the survivor and member of the grenfell community be still wait for the justice they need and deserve justice must be do the ongoing metropolitan police investigation be among the big it have ever undertake and the met have the government ’s full support in september the prime minister rightly say that this tragedy pose question about what social justice mean in britain today and whether the voice of working class people those with disability and those of colour be ignore and dismiss i be here to say that we will not be that country we will be a country where decent housing security safety and peace of mind be share by all and be not just the privilege of a few 
 the lesson of the inquiry should not have take a tragedy to unearth we will honour the memory of those who lose their life by bring about meaningful change in their name change that will make life well for everyone we be under no illusion about the scale of the task at hand the responsibility to deliver last change be the privilege of leadership that will not be do by government alone but we will put our voice and power in the service of the cause that the grenfell community have continue to fight for nearly long year together we will bring about the transformational change that the people of this country deserve it be with that admiration for the spirit of the grenfell community and the determination to honour it that i commend the statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 may i thank the deputy prime minister for advance sight of her statement and the government ’s response to the phase report 
 i echo the deputy prime minister ’s sentiment which be share across the house the tragedy of grenfell which claim innocent lives—54 adult and child will always remain a scar on our national conscience i thank sir martin moore bick and his team for their work i join the deputy prime minister in offer my deep apology to the bereaved the survivor and the grenfell community for the failure that lead to that horrific night in june we all remember where we be that night i also thank they for their constant and constructive campaigning 
 the inquiry ’s finding decade of systemic failure dishonesty and negligence be a damn indictment of successive government regulator and industry   the government ’s response with its acceptance of all recommendation be a step forward and i welcome the commitment to action the creation of a single construction regulator the appointment of a chief construction adviser and the consolidation of fire safety function under department be long overdue reform so too be the focus on professionalise fire engineer and reform the construction product sector which the inquiry expose as riddled with systemic dishonesty from firm such as arconic kingspan and celotex 
 the green paper on construction product reform be a promising start but it must deliver real accountability unlimited fine and prison sentence for rogue executive and where appropriate government official can not remain mere rhetoric ambition must be match by urgency and scrutiny nearly year have pass since grenfell yet thousand still live in building with unsafe cladding and other fire safety defect although i welcome the fact that the deputy prime minister have accept the majority of the recommendation why have she not accept the inquiry ’s recommendation for a single regulator to oversee the testing and certification of construction product leave that instead with conformity assessment body i remind she that the building research establishment which be itself a conformity assessment body be strongly criticise for its conflict of interest 
 the remediation acceleration plan be welcome but its target of assess all building by july and complete work by rely heavily on developer step up voluntarily what action will the deputy prime minister take if they do not comply will she work to deliver solution for non qualifying leaseholder and those at risk as a consequence of other fire safety defect this house need concrete assurance that no resident will be leave behind i question the phase approach to implementation stretch beyond justice delay be justice deny the grenfell community have wait long enough for change why must they potentially wait another parliamentary term for full delivery 
 what discussion have the leader of the house have with parliamentary colleague on the establishment of a public inquiry joint committee to monitor the implementation of public inquiry recommendation what be the timetable for the new publicly available record on all public inquiry recommendation since on social housing the extension of awaab ’s law and new standard be positive but the government must go far to address the inquiry ’s wide lesson resident voice be ignore tenant empowerment must be more than a panel or a campaign it need legal tooth to ensure landlord act on concern swiftly 
 justice demand accountability the metropolitan police investigation have our full support but the pace must quicken those who profit from cut comer or be criminally negligent must face consequence not just fine but criminal charge where evidence allow grenfell must be a watershed a legacy of safety transparency and respect for every resident i make our clear commitment to work with the deputy prime minister and the government on a cross party basis to meet that promise 
 i thank the shadow secretary of state for his comment and the way in which he make they i hope genuinely that we can work together to continue this piece of work i recognise in my statement the   work of the previous government through the building safety act and other measure and we will continue to work in that vein 
 i hope that the shadow secretary of state recognise some of the work that we be already do we have bring forward a significant amount of legislation on social tenancy on empower tenant through the renters rights bill on protect leaseholder and on our remediation acceleration plan the government will deliver those legislative change as soon as parliamentary time allow the legislation commitment be detail in the plan that include create certainty on building that need remediation and on who be responsible for remediate they make obligation for assess and complete regulation remediation clear with severe consequence for non compliance and give resident great control in situation of acute harm where landlord have neglect their responsibility 
 the shadow secretary of state ask about a single construction regulator we accept that recommendation in principle but the single regulator will deliver the function recommend by the inquiry with exception to avoid conflict of interest set the rule for construction product and police its own compliance we will consult on the design of the regulator in the autumn 
 i call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee 
 today be yet another long exhausting day for the love one of the victim of grenfell who be still have to fight for justice nearly year on i welcome the secretary of state ’s response and look forward to the select committee ’s scrutiny of the green paper and the proposal for the single construction regulator 
 if we be honest however what the secretary of state have outline will not tackle the root cause of the systematic ignorance of tenant concern that toxic stigma at the heart of our social housing sector what step be she take to ensure that tenant have a voice in the social housing sector and be show respect when they raise concern for their family 
 we must never forget that of the victim of grenfell be disable that figure underline the collective failure of the system to protect those in need the government ’s commitment to residential evacuation plan for disabled people in high rise building be a welcome step forward but i would be grateful if the secretary of state clarify how the government intend to make residential personal emergency evacuation plan peep enforceable if the responsible person fail to identify the vulnerable resident i be also pleased that funding have be allocate for that in the social sector but in reality disabled people live in all type of housing will she commit to ensure that disabled people in the private rent sector have the same access to evacuation plan as those in the social sector 
 none of the family present in the public gallery should have to be here the tragedy in happen in the holy month of ramadan and as we approach ramadan this week a time that should be dedicate to reflection healing and togetherness too many family be still fight for justice no family member present   should have to spend their time demand accountability when they should be focus on recover from their trauma i pay tribute to they for their tireless effort and pledge to continue to be a voice for they in their fight for justice without any more delay 
 i know that my hon friend as chair of the housing communities and local government committee be commit to the right of social housing tenant as she outline the social housing system have not be fit for purpose and those failing contribute to the grenfell tragedy we be drive up standard in social housing through strong regulation and enforcement measure strengthen tenant voice and improve access to redress those reform will ensure that landlord be hold accountable for the quality of the home and service that they provide 
 at the heart of the new regulatory regime be the requirement for all landlord to treat tenant with fairness and respect social landlord be require to understand and provide information and support that recognise the diverse need of their tenant include those arise from protect characteristic and language barrier the government will lay regulation as soon as possible this year on the social housing provider funding make available for residential peep we will direct the regulator to set standard on the competency and conduct of staff to ensure that tenant be treat with respect 
 at a national level we have extend the social housing resident panel to help ensure that tenant voice and experience inform policy development we will keep a new regulatory system under review we will evaluate its effectiveness by to ensure that it be deliver the improvement we need we will set out further measure to strengthen resident voice in the long term housing strategy later this year 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 liberal democrats stand firmly with the many bereaved family member as well as the immediate community friend and neighbour as they mourn the people include child who tragically lose their life in any step regard change to the building will be a deeply personal matter for that community and i know that the secretary of state will approach any decision about the future of the building with due respect for the local community survivor and victim we therefore welcome the government ’s decision to work with the grenfell tower memorial commission to design a memorial and we urge the government to approach the discussion with respect and sympathy for those who suffer as i be sure the secretary of state will do 
 as we approach year since the grenfell fire liberal democrats be concerned that there be still thousand of people in the uk live in building with dangerous cladding the grenfell inquiry provide a detailed look at the fact lead up to the night of   june include look at the underlying cause of the fire where mistake be make the condition of the tower and the response of the public and the emergency service on the recommendation to the architectural profession i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests i be a member of the royal institute of british architects 
 there be lesson to be learn by ever authority in the land we recognise that the previous government provide funding to start the process of deal with cladding which be slowly be allocate but it be now time to accelerate that vital work to make all building safe we be concerned that too many developer and building owner be pass the cost of remediation work on to tenant and leaseholder which put many at serious financial risk 
 liberal democrats endorse all recommendation of the grenfell inquiry phase report by sir martin moore bick include the creation of legally enforceable order to remediate premise so they be safe on pain of criminal sanction however we need to take further step to guard against commercial interest override safety as they do in both the testing of material and the enforcement of building regulation we would like to see more do to ensure that commerciality will not shockingly and disgracefully override interest of safety ever again 
 it be time to invest in our housing stock so that the cladding be deal with it be time for justice for the victim and for all those live in unsafe housing lib dems stand ready to work across party to do achieve that 
 i thank the hon member for his commitment and support in take forward the recommendation that come from the inquiry i thank he for his comment about ensure that we take decision about the future of grenfell in the most sensitive of way i absolutely agree with he and i be committed to take the next step respectfully and carefully with the community i continue to support the independent grenfell tower memorial commission as the community choose a design team to work with they on design a memorial 
 i agree that it be a priority for we to work at pace because the work be urgent we be work as quickly as we possibly can some of the inquiry recommendation be wide reach and some will require further work include public consultation before they can be deliver however where we can work quickly such as with the machinery of government change move responsibility for fire to my department we be committed to do that 
 i hope the hon gentleman hear my word on the acceleration of remediation and our action plan as i hope be reflect in my response i agree entirely with his comment about commerciality not take precedent or have any control over safety safety must come and this government be commit to that 
 i thank the deputy prime minister for her statement today and the prime minister for his statement on   september which make it clear that the lesson from grenfell be central to this government ’s mission today be another painful step towards truth justice and change for the bereaved family of the people who lose their life at grenfell the survivor and the community in my constituency of kensington and bayswater many of whom have join we today i pay tribute again to their strength and resilience 
 the fight for justice now nearly year long will continue after today and every day until we have criminal prosecution and true accountability for those responsible include those company reference in the inquiry report i know the government have look seriously at the inquiry recommendation and i welcome the commitment to meaningful change across all of they but too often recommendation from public inquiry fail to be implement indeed if the lesson from previous fire have be learn include at lakanal house in then life would have be save this be avoidable will the deputy prime minister assure i that the government will consider a strong oversight mechanism to ensure accountability for implement what have be set out today so that it last beyond any government and lead to real change 
 will she also provide further detail on how she plan to ensure accountability for the royal borough of kensington and chelsea give their culpability before during and after the fire the council ’s culture desperately need to change and there need to be an improvement in the quality of service in our community today 
 i thank and pay tribute to my hon friend for the way he have constructively challenge and work with we on behalf of his constituent i know this report have great personal significance for his constituent and i pay tribute to his dedicated work as an advocate in call for truth justice and change for the grenfell community 
 i agree that robust oversight of the government ’s implementation of the response be essential for this and for all public inquiry the system need to be improve and we be take forward the inquiry ’s recommendation on oversight we will create a publicly accessible record on gov.uk of recommendation make by public inquiry since and we will consider make that a legal requirement as part of a wide review of the inquiry ’s framework 
 on the grenfell inquiry recommendation my department will publish quarterly progress update on gov.uk until they have all be deliver we will report annually to parliament to enable member to scrutinise our progress and hold we to account 
 on my hon friend ’s comment about the council the council fail in some of its most fundamental duty to keep resident safe to listen to their concern and to respond effectively when disaster strike the council be right to apologise but it be clear that more must be do i have welcome the council ’s commitment to improvement and culture change and i have set my challenge to the leader of the council to ensure that those improvement be a reality feel by the council ’s resident i will continue to engage and keep an eye on that progress 
 i welcome the secretary of state ’s statement all our thought be with the victim and their family i know the secretary of state will keep we up to date about the permanent memorial however the big failure that she have not speak about be the testing regime for the product that be put on grenfell and on building up and down the country firm deliberately cheat the testing regime system so product be sign off as safe will she undertake to overhaul safety mechanism and the   testing regime for product so that building both the one we have already and those build in the future will be safe for the resident who live in they 
 i agree with what the hon gentleman say the government be commit to a system wide reform of the construction product regime ensure that we address the significant gap that the grenfell inquiry and the independent review of the construction product testing regime have expose the construction product green paper that we have publish today be a significant step forward towards a construction product regime that have public safety at its heart i hope we can continue to work across government and across the house to ensure that we have a system that be fit for purpose for the future 
 will the secretary of state go a little far than she do in her reply to my hon friend   the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell it be good that she will have a publicly accessible record of recommendation will she commit to what the charity inquest and many other have ask for which be a national oversight mechanism a body that collate analyse and follow up on the recommendation of inquiry and inquest otherwise there be a real danger that these recommendation and other will gather dust on the shelf 
 i hear directly from member of the grenfell community their call for the government to introduce a national oversight mechanism we recognise that this go wide than grenfell and that it be an important issue for other community and family such as those affect by covid-19 and the blood scandal we be consider that in the year ahead as part of measure to strengthen public inquiry and the government will listen to the view of the affect family as part of that consideration 
 the grenfell fire be an appalling tragedy but it also throw a blanket of uncertainty over countless resident in many of our constituency who be trap in cladde property when i hear the deputy prime minister talk about a new regulatory regime and change i confess i feel very nervous that any change to the regulatory regime will throw further uncertainty over those who be still trap in their home can she assure the house that any move she make will not create further uncertainty about the standard to which building need to be remediate i also highlight the case of my constituent in harold wood who have their building assess by a fire risk assessor who be subsequently strike off those people who think they be go to be release from that terrible stasis be now back to not know where they stand so will she please look into those concern 
 i hope that what we be announce today will bring clarity to the system of the thing that come out of the phase report be about the system be disjoint bring clarity will hopefully ensure that people understand what they be mean to do what their legal obligation be and that we expect they to do it if they do not do it there will be serious consequence 
 i also point to the remediation acceleration plan i completely understand that many people be still in building that be unsafe which be unacceptable that be why this government be take action on the harold wood case i be happy for the hon lady to meet the building safety minister about that 
 i thank the secretary of state for her important statement the people of grenfell be treat badly because of who they be what they look like and how much they earn we say that people be kill in grenfell but the police be hold ash for which they have no name nobody should have to go through this the family should never have to go through this this should never happen again do she agree that as well as the chief executive officer of the company all the people in the council who treat the resident badly and do not listen to they because of what they look like must be hold accountable everybody need to be hold accountable 
 i absolutely agree with my hon friend at the heart of the new regulatory regime be the requirement that all landlord treat their tenant with fairness and respect and take action so that the service they provide have fair and equitable outcome social landlord be require to understand and provide information and support that recognise the diverse need of their tenant include those arise from protect characteristic that have not be so in the past and if i be honest it do not feel like it be the case today when i speak to resident of the community that be why i have push the council in that particular area and why this government be bring forward legislation that say we respect people whether they be social tenant or private tenant they deserve a safe and secure home and to be treat with dignity and respect 
 i welcome the deputy prime minister ’s statement and the move towards centralised regulation and improve safety generally do the report not serve as a single act of shame for this country as she just say it reveal that the safety and quality of social housing have be consider to matter less because the people who live in social housing have be consider to matter less should that point of view which have be in place since the decline in building standard in the 1960 not be a matter of deep national repentance 
 as the deputy prime minister seek to tackle that have she speak to or be she continue to speak to her right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer there be a cost to make sure that we build to a high standard as we do immediately after the war while also expand the number of social rent home particularly in part of the country where build cost be more expensive such as london and the lake district 
 i thank the hon gentleman for the way in which he articulate that point i be still dismay to this day by archaic attitude towards people in social tenancy i be a social tenant for a very long time and grow up in a council house the issue be the way that these people be treat especially after this report i ask anyone who work in social housing to read the report or at least the executive finding if they do not   want to go through the chapter that i go through sir martin outline the horrifying way that people be treat that be a shame for our country and we must do well hopefully the legislation we be bring forward will bring about a cultural change 
 i absolutely agree with the hon gentleman that social housing should be of high quality safe affordable and warm and this government will continue to ensure that safety will not be compromise in our build home nor will build home compromise our ability to bring up to standard home that be not up to standard we have all see the report and we have all see on television programme that show people still live in damp mouldy property that have to end 
 i also welcome the statement by the deputy prime minister the people in my constituency of chelsea and fulham stand shoulder to shoulder with the people who live in grenfell tower who have suffer hugely the pain be still feel throughout the whole community i be delighted to hear my hon friend   the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell   highlight again the culpability of the local council and the contractor i know from my own experience that there be much for the council to do to improve its respect for and the way it deal with people live in social housing 
 i pick up on the point make powerfully by my hon friend   the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi   about disabled people of whom die in grenfell tower because they have no personal emergency evacuation plan i like she welcome the deputy prime minister ’s commitment to introduce regulation to improve the fire safety and evacuation of disabled and vulnerable people but when will we see the detail will those regulation apply to all disabled resident wherever they live what legal weight will they have can we be absolutely sure that everything be be do to ensure that disabled people have the evacuation plan that they need in order to escape in the event of a terrible fire such as that at grenfell 
 my hon friend be absolutely right since take office we have ensure that all the outstanding phase recommendation be fully consider and respond to the government announce on   september   that a residential peep policy would be take forward and we also commit funding for it the government will lay regulation as soon as possible and social housing provider funding will be make available this year 
 this policy aim to improve the fire safety and evacuation of disabled and vulnerable resident in high rise and high rise residential building in england by provide resident who have disability and impairment with a person centre risk assessment that identify appropriate equipment and adjustment it aim to aid their fire safety and evacuation by ensure that there be a residential peep statement that record what vulnerable resident should do in the event of a fire and record information for fire and rescue service in case they need to undertake evacuation we will continue to keep that under review 
 i refer the house to my declaration of voluntary interest i commend the deputy prime minister for the sensitivity with which she be approach the issue both with family and in the house today as she know mediation effort with resident of grenfell be be lead by lord neuberger and other i genuinely believe that mediation be of massive value in this situation i realise that much of this be in the legal sphere but can she and the government commit in any way to support those mediation effort 
 it be absolutely right that we look at all option and i be happy for the right hon gentleman to take that matter up with the safety minister as well we want to continue to support the community who have be through so much i visit the site and meet the headteacher of the school child who be not even bear when the tragedy happen be still suffer the effect of the trauma today we be commit to support the community the bereaved and the survivor for as long as it take 
 i thank the deputy prime minister for her response to the report on the grenfell tragedy flat in a large leasehold block in my constituency be give a b2 ews1 certificate by adam kiziak of tri fire ltd. he and tri fire be now be investigate for potential malpractice by the institution of fire engineers of my constituent a leaseholder in that block tell i that they do not know whether their certificate be valid or whether their problem can be remediate through the building safety fund they do not even know whether their block still have a safety issue and that be quite apart from the fact that those need to move can not sell because mortgage lender will not lend how and when can leaseholder such as my constituent get the assurance they need include the assurance that no more fire inspector will be allow to get away with what adam kiziak do
