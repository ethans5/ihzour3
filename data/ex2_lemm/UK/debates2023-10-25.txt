let i say to the hon lady that as someone who be hospitalise after be attack because of my sexuality i know how difficult that be it be not just the attack that be painful but what be leave afterwards 
 i will continue to raise each of these issue but i want to make this point i keep hear that we do not care about lgbt issue it be this government who introduce   same sex marriage and it be this government who introduce it in northern ireland it be this government who introduce turing ’s law in we have modernise gender recognition certificate and make they affordable we have remove self funding for fertility treatment for same sex couple lift the ban on blood donation and tackle lgbt relate bullying in school we have apologise for the way in which lgbt people be treat in the armed force and we have provide funding to ensure that lgbt right across the commonwealth be protect 
 the minister for women and equalities be ask 
 what step the government be take to protect single sex space 
 we be committed to maintain the safeguard that allow organisation to provide single sex service the equality act set out that provider have the right to restrict use of service on the basis of sex where there be justified and proportionate reason 
 a number of member of the house have relative or family member who be tran and we will all have constituent who be member of the trans community do the minister agree that trans people need safe space too 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the tone in which the debate should take place just a few week ago we have a debate in westminster hall where i absolutely make that point this be not about pit woman against the trans community gender reassignment be a protect characteristic under the equality act but it be important that biological woman have the ability to access single sex space too 
 what step the government be take to help increase the participation of minority ethnic group in the democratic process 
 whether she have have discussion with stakeholder on improve the diversity of parliamentary candidate 
 the government have work hard to remove any material obstacle to democratic participation for all eligible group register to vote be quick and easy take as little as minute any elector without an   accept form of photographic identification can apply for a voter authority certificate from their local authority free of charge or alternatively they could vote by post or proxy 
 i have a thriving british albanian community in my chipping barnet constituency make a really positive contribution to our culture and economy what more can the government do to encourage they to be involve in campaign at election vote in election and standing as candidate in election 
 i welcome my right hon friend ’s effort in ensure that everyone participate in the democratic process i agree with she but it be ultimately for local registration team to ensure as good they can that all eligible elector in their area be correctly register to vote we want to ensure that all part of the uk be equally represent in politic and the democratic system where they be eligible 
 with almost a quarter of the uk ’s population register as disabled do the minister agree that all political party need to try hard in the run up to the next general election in select a diverse group of candidate with perhaps slightly less emphasis on nepotism and more on the representation of ordinary voter include those from all ethnic minority background 
 the hon lady ask an excellent question and i thank she for all the work she do campaign for woman ’s right she have be at the vanguard of some contentious issue she be quite right to raise candidate selection all political party have to make the very good of effort in ensure that a meritocracy exist and help those include disabled people who might need additional assistance in participate through some of the difficult selection process i highlight again how diverse the conservative party be and the cabinet in particular that be testament to the fact that meritocracy work we hope that other will learn from our example 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the labour party have more woman and ethnic minority mps than the rest of the political party put together we know that that lead to well outcome for british people but there be always further to go that be why we have commit to enact section of the equality act so that all political party would be require to be transparent about the diversity of their candidate why will the government not do the same 
 at the end of the day it be the electorate who decide who get to represent they the hon member might be cherry pick statistic on which party be the most diverse we can do the same and talk about how the conservatives have have female prime ministers when labour have not have even a single leader if she want to dive deep down and be granular we have more black man in our party than in all the other party combine this splitting hair be not helpful what we need to do be ensure that the process be as meritocratic as possible 
 what step the government be take to help support woman in stem role 
 what step the government be take to help support woman in stem role 
 we have make great progress in increase the number of girl study stem science technology engineering and math subject our challenge now be to do more to get they into stem job to support that we launch a scheme call stem returner as of our programme to grow the skill of people who have take a career break we have so far have woman in our cohort and have sign up for our cohort get woman with experience and skill back into stem job 
 while the uk wide responsibility in area such as energy and defence among other be reserve to this parliament education skill university college and apprenticeship among other be devolve what discussion have my hon friend the minister have with other uk government ministers and devolve administration to ensure that the opportunity for woman to get their stem education and skill and to maintain their career be maximise across the united kingdom 
 i thank my hon friend for his work particularly around promote the energy sector across the united kingdom we be make progress on try to get woman and girl into that vital sector of our build back well campaign be seek to inspire woman from all walk of life to work in the green energy economy and raise awareness of green education training and career my colleague the minister with responsibility for employment and i regularly meet devolved colleague to discuss how we can have a united kingdom approach to this issue 
 last week i meet a group of life science apprentice young woman and young man who have take up some great opportunity with stem employer issue they raise with i be the lack of information about non trade apprenticeship when they be consider their career option what more can my hon friend do to promote stem apprenticeship for the to year old who may not want to pursue the university route 
 my hon friend be a shin example of how woman can lead in the stem sector with her own experience in clinical care before she come to this place we be try to drive forward apprenticeship particularly in stem subject since may over apprenticeship start have happen and our apprenticeship diversity champion be help those aged and over to get into apprenticeship particularly in stem subject organisation such as ucas and young women ’s trust be also do that specific work 
 the scottish government have a number of ambition to address the lack of woman in stem occupation   and setting such as school those ambition start early the gender pay gap action plan examine how school have a key role in help young woman make transition into broad occupation as well as set out measure that address occupation segregation lead to more woman access stem career what be the government do to provide that kind of support 
 key route be through apprenticeship for many young woman be able to earn while you learn and get that work experience be vital for they to progress through the stem sector we have degree apprenticeship and master degree apprenticeship that be an increase of in stem subject in particular we have employer design apprenticeship include level cyber security level software development and level civil engineering we believe apprenticeship be the way forward to drive more woman into stem area 
 i thank the minister for that answer in northern ireland woman be under represent in stem industry only of woman in northern ireland study core stem subject compare to of man that be a clear anomaly that need to be address may i encourage the minister to use her office to engage with the department for the economy to encourage more uptake in university stem subject woman can do the job every bit as well as a man give that opportunity 
 i thank the hon member for that question that go to the point raise by my hon friend   the member for banff and buchan david duguid we need a uk approach across the government whether in the department for work and pensions or the department for education we focus on try to improve all avenue for those particularly woman who want to go into stem area 
 what step she be take to help improve the life of lgbt people 
 the uk have a proud history of lgbt right and of the world ’s most comprehensive and robust legislative protection framework for lgbt people we have take great stride as a country over the last couple of decade and it be my job to continue that journey 
 the minister be absolutely right great thing have be do for lgbt+ people in the last year include blood donation change the prep pre exposure prophylaxis roll out and of course same sex marriage however hate crime against lgbt+ people be on the up conversion therapy still have not be ban and the uk have slip down the ranking for lgbt+ equality i know that this minister take these issue incredibly seriously but how can he assure i that the government take they seriously and that they will tackle they as a matter of urgency 
 my hon friend be right to highlight the issue of all form of anti lgbt hate crime they be utterly unacceptable and we have a robust legislative framework to respond to that i meet representative of   the metropolitan police and other stakeholder just last week to ensure that everything possible be be do to crack down on such crime there will be further question later about conversion practice and we be consider all those issue this be a complex area of work but i give my hon friend a personal commitment that anything to do with lgbt right and improve the life of lgbt people will be high on my agenda 
 a bill ban the psychological abuse that some people call conversion therapy have be promise repeatedly in this session from that dispatch box where be it 
 i accept that and i apologise for the fact that it have take so long but as i have say it be a complex issue i have be personally campaign for this for many year but even i recognise there be deep complexity it be right that we take the time to consider each of the issue carefully so that what we have in place be consistent robust and up to date and tackle these appalling practice 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 almost day have pass since the government promise to ban conversion therapy and day have pass since a conversion therapy bill be promise in the last queen ’s speech the delay be not this minister ’s responsibility accord to the press they be a result of differ view on the government front bench but because of that there be still no bill can the minister tell the house whether the next king ’s speech will include a commitment to a full loophole free ban on lgbt conversion therapy yes or no 
 i should have think the hon lady would know that no ever make announcement about what be in the king ’s speech ahead of his majesty ’s delivery of that speech let i also say to she respectfully that she should not believe everything she read in the press as for the rest of her question i refer she to the answer i give a few moment ago 
 i would therefore counsel the minister to advise his colleague to stop brief the press on these issue and get on with delivering because there be failure when it come to delivery for lgbt+ people yesterday i meet michael smith who be viciously attack at a bus stop simply for be with his partner police record sexual orientation hate crime have increase by more than in the last year and more than a of all hate crime be now violence against the person offence i know that the minister care deeply about this subject so can he please explain why his government do not agree with labour or with the law commission that every violent act of hatred should be punish in the same way as an aggravate offence 
 let i say to the hon lady that as someone who be hospitalise after be attack because of my sexuality i know how difficult that be it be not just the attack that be painful but what be leave afterwards 
 i will continue to raise each of these issue but i want to make this point i keep hear that we do not care about lgbt issue it be this government who introduce   same sex marriage and it be this government who introduce it in northern ireland it be this government who introduce turing ’s law in we have modernise gender recognition certificate and make they affordable we have remove self funding for fertility treatment for same sex couple lift the ban on blood donation and tackle lgbt relate bullying in school we have apologise for the way in which lgbt people be treat in the armed force and we have provide funding to ensure that lgbt right across the commonwealth be protected.[official report   november vol c. 4mc 
 order we need to make progress now 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on tackle pay inequality in the labour market 
 owe to my joint role i be also secretary of state for business and trade i have a unique understanding of unjust pay disparity and i be proud of the step that this government have take to tackle they we will publish new guidance in april to help employer to measure report on and address unfair ethnicity pay difference and it be a conservative government who introduce gender pay gap reporting in 
 us state have ban employer from ask prospective employee about their salary history mean that people be pay what the job be worth and not just what the boss can get away with this have have a massive impact on tackle unequal pay for woman and black worker in particular have talk about pilot a similar salary history measure why have the government appear to stall on what would be a really positive policy 
 we be not stall our pilot will support employer to take step towards transparency in their own organisation to see the impact for themselves we know that this be not straightforward which be why we will ensure that employer look to implement great transparency in their recruitment process be able to access good practice and learn from each other 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson 
 the uk government ’s inclusive britain update report acknowledge the value of measure the ethnicity pay gap and the government have publish guidance for employer note that employer can use ethnicity pay gap calculation to consider evidence base action to address any unfair disparity despite that the uk government will not legislate to mandate reporting since employment law be a reserved matter will the minister urge her government to do the right thing and mandate ethnicity pay gap reporting or urge the devolution of employment law to scotland so that the scottish government can 
 absolutely not this be something that we will not be devolve and it absolutely should not be mandatory ethnicity pay gap can not be measure in the same way as gender pay gap i have say this to the hon lady at this dispatch box multiple time we can measure a pay gap where a population be binary male and female but we can not do it across a broad spectrum of ethnicity we have publish guidance for those employer who want to do this but it would be absolutely wrong to mandate 
 what recent estimate she have make of the level of additional cost affect household with disabled people 
 we will spend around £ this year on benefit to support disabled people and people with health condition no such estimate have be make but as a government we be provide total support of more than £ from to and we be determined to help all household and individual with the rise cost of bill this include an additional £ for more than disabled people 
 that be great but back in the real world the minister really do know that the rise cost of living be have a disproportionately negative impact on disabled people they face high living cost as a consequence and they still face barrier to employment do she accept that target action include disability pay gap reporting be now need to support disabled people 
 if the hon gentleman be concerned about his disabled constituent i can point he to the household support fund which be also help those constituent and their carer in his constituency in his real world an additional £ have land to support he this be not a matter for the department for work and pensions but i be sure that it will have be hear 
 my hon friend will be aware that fund be make available to get disabled people into employment via access to work however there be significant delay in those fund be make available once grant additional cost to disabled people for example their pay £ for powered wheel come at more of a cost when they be oblige to pay for they on their credit card because they can not access the fund in time will she please work with colleague across the dwp to ensure that there be no delay in get access to the fund that will help disabled people into work 
 i thank my right hon friend for her point which give i the opportunity to say that from next tuesday an additional £ will be pay in cost of live payment to those who be eligible regard access to work there be a continue focus on improve waiting time for customer and we be streamline and digitise the process indeed i speak to the minister   for disabled people this week on exactly this matter in relation to of my own constituent and i will see that he hear it again from my right hon friend 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 as the minister for women and equality it would be remiss of i not to reflect on the way religious community in the uk have be impact by the terrible event in the middle east all our citizen have a right to feel secure and at peace in britain of the reason we have be able to integrate people from all over the world be an unwritten rule that people with root elsewhere do not play out foreign conflict on the street of this country we owe a duty of care and civility to our neighbour whatever their ethnicity religion or background all of we be free to practise our faith and celebrate our culture but we must do so in a positive way consistent with fundamental value that be the bedrock of britain 
 i be afraid to say that in recent day we have see that social contract be breach in particular i believe that the hostility direct towards our jewish community the call for jihad the ostentatious indifference to the victim of terrorism the aggressive chanting by mob brandish placard of hate and the odious people rip down poster of miss child do not reflect our value as a nation 
 we must all stand firm on the boundary of acceptable behaviour particularly in the public space that we all share that be why today i be remind public sector organisation that they have a legal obligation as part of the equality duty to consider how they contribute to the advancement of good relation in community as they deliver public service where organisation be have difficulty do that i urge they to write to i as soon as possible for advice on how they can fulfil their legal obligation 
 i thank my right hon friend for that answer there should be no place for hatred in our community 
 as a woman in her 50s—[hon member no!”]—i know how challenging the menopause can be especially when you have a busy job what support be there for work woman with the menopause 
 i hope that my right hon friend feel that she be support by all of her colleague i be delighted to let she know that there will be a full debate on menopause tomorrow lead by the minister for social mobility i be proud of the great stride that helen tomlinson have make since her appointment as the department for work and pensions menopause employment champion the report no time to step back detail this progress and look forward to the next month include the sector specific workshop 
 in less than a decade the proportion of female pensioner in the uk live in poverty have rise by which mean that in every female pensioner be below the breadline despite the fact that   the number of female pensioner have fall due to the rise in state pension age which disadvantage ten of thousand of old woman do the minister for equalities share my concern that in the uk today of female pensioner be live in poverty and what action will she take to address that 
 i thank the hon lady for her point in there be few female pensioner in absolute poverty than in after housing cost i point the hon lady to the barnett consequential of the household support fund in scotland which be there to be distribute by her government to those in need 
 as you will know mr speaker watford be a thriving multi faith community and it be a privilege to take part in so many celebration and learn about the history of each culture that make watford unique and amazing will the minister join i in encourage colleague to attend the event that i will be host with the inter faith network on november to promote a national organisation to understand how we can all engage well with the different faith in our community and will he please also consider attend the event if diary permit 
 faith be a vital part of people ’s identity and of their community we fully support the invaluable work be do by people around the country who be inspire by their faith my hon friend be a great advocate for the work that go on in his own constituency i certainly encourage people to attend that event and i will do everything i can to pop in myself 
 a year ago the public order bill be pass in this house and with it my new clause which be overwhelmingly support in a free vote by mp on both side of the house to stop woman be deter from use and enter the door of abortion clinic by protest outside a year on intimidation be bad than ever because the legislation be not be enact will the minister look into why that be and fix this now 
 if the hon lady have a specific example of where that be happen i will be happy to look at it if she raise it with i 
 in its census the office for national statistics estimate that there be transgender people in the uk do the minister agree with the separate office for statistics regulation that due to skewed methodology this number be likely to have be a huge overestimate 
 i share the concern that the office for statistics regulation have raise and in february i ask my official to explore with the ons whether because of a lack of understanding of the question the census have the number right we need to be very careful about language people do not often understand what we mean when we use term such as transgender and gender identity we have to make sure that they understand they the ons will be conduct and report on   research to explore that issue and it should publish the result by the end of the year and will monitor they go forward 
 some year ago the united nations find that disabled people ’s right be be systematically violate by conservative ministers recently the equality and human rights commission find that nothing at all have change be the minister not ashamed 
 i thank the hon lady for raise that matter the point regard the ehrc be that it be an independent and public body but i do not think that any member come to this house to erode anybody ’s right whether they be disabled or have a health issue i absolutely refute what the hon lady say she should look at our action and our record of the work that we have do around british sign language and more widely we stand by all constituent whatever their need 
 just before we come to prime minister ’s question i would like to welcome to this chamber the grandson of mahatma gandhi 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday october 
 i know that the sympathy of the whole house be with all those affect by storm babet and in particular the friend and family of those who lose their life 
 this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 i join the prime minister in express my sympathy to all those affect by the recent storm 
 people just can not be sustain from odd aid lorry utter catastrophe be be unleash in gaza do the prime minister not now see that only a humanitarian ceasefire can bring about the scale of emergency aid that be need of course israel have a right to defend itself in line with international and humanitarian law but we must also speak out when those law be breach surely he agree that deprive civilian a of they child of food water medicine and fuel be not in accordance with international law will he press israel to restore the supply of these essential for the sake of innocent civilian and the future of the entire region 
 it be important that we do everything we can to get humanitarian aid to those who need it in gaza which be why on monday we announce a doubling of our international aid to the region and why the development minister be actively engage with our partner on the ground to ensure that that aid get to those people as quickly as possible 
 double child rapist and murderer colin pitchfork have yet another parole review hear only a few week ago i thank the justice secretary for have listen to i and engage the reconsideration mechanism rule i know that the prime minister do not have any decision make role on the independent parole board it be independent of government but it be a wing of the executive it be not the judiciary do the prime minister agree that generally as a point of principle man sexual offender who rape and brutally murder young woman as mr pitchfork do to dawn ashworth and lynda mann in my constituency should remain in prison for most of their natural life 
 i agree with my hon friend that the public should be confident that murderer and rapist will be keep behind bar for as long as be necessary to keep the public safe that be why we be reform the parole system our victims and prisoners bill will mean that minimise risk and protect the public be the sole consideration in parole board decision it will also give the justice secretary the power to step in on behalf of the public and take a look at decision to release the most serious offender include murderer and rapist last week we announce that we will be introduce long sentence for dangerous criminal for the most heinous crime life will mean life 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 i join the prime minister in his comment about all those affect by the storm 
 i start by welcome my hon friend   the new member for mid bedfordshire alistair strathern the labour mp ever to represent those beautiful town and village he defy the odd history and of course the fantasy lib dem bar chart i also welcome my hon friend   the new member for tamworth sarah edwards she will be a powerful representative for her constituent be the prime minister as relieve as i be that those constituent be not burden with his defeat candidate who tell they do not worry mr speaker i be go to sanitise this to eff off if they be struggle with the cost of living 
 i be proud of what this government have be do to support the most vulnerable over the past year in fact i join the right hon and learn gentleman in welcome the new member to their place after all i suspect that the new member for mid beds may actually support i a little more than the last one—[laughter i do notice that the new member say that they will be oppose new housing in their local area while the new member for tamworth claim that they will protect green space i urge they to have a word with their leader because that be not exactly his position although with his track record of u turn who know what his housing policy will be next week 
 so much for be the change candidate the prime minister can not even distance himself from those appalling comment i have to ask he where on earth do he think his candidate get the idea in the place that throw expletive at struggle family be his government ’s official position 
 let we just look at the record of what this government be do to help those people pay for around half of a typical family ’s energy bill over the last year support worth over £ the most vulnerable in our society receive £ in direct cost of living support record increase in the national living wage record increase in welfare and this winter pensioner to receive an extra £ or £ alongside their winter fuel payment to help they through what we know be a tough time all of that significant support fund by this government would be put at risk by labour ’s reckless plan to borrow £ a year 
 the prime minister keep boast about how great thing be the voter keep tell he that he have get it wrong i can see why the tamworth candidate think that he be just follow government line annalisa and her child live in their home for year in may they be kick out with a no fault eviction notice despite his government ’s pledge to scrap no fault eviction this week the prime minister crumble to the landlord on his own back benches and kill the policy what message other than the message deliver by his candidate in tamworth could annalisa possibly take from that 
 we have take significant action to help renter like annalisa and other we have cap hold deposit at week we have protect tenant from rip off tenancy fee deliver almost half a affordable home for rent halve the percentage of substandard home in the private rented sector and strengthen local authority enforcement power because the government be deliver for renter we be also try to ensure that the new generation can buy their own home so perhaps the leader of the opposition can explain to annalisa and million of other why when we bring forward plan to unlock new home he stand in the way of that interruption 
 order just to say it be prime minister ’s question not opposition ’s question interruption i be sorry prime minister it be prime minister ’s question i do not need you nod against my decision 
 i be sure that annalisa and her child who have now be evict will take great comfort from that non answer 
 emma and her teenage son see their mortgage go up by more than a quarter—[interruption government members may think this be funny but this be real life after year of dutifully pay the mortgage for the time she be have to choose between new shoe for her son and put the heating on all because the prime minister ’s party crash the economy push mortgage rate to their high level in decade he say ignore all that”—ignore the fact that the guilty man and woman responsible be stand again as his candidate and still set his policy can he not see why emma might think that his party be tell they exactly where to go 
 the right hon and learn gentleman keep talk about the mini budget i will not ask he a question mr speaker but i will just point out that he actually support of the thing in that mini budget which i do not he have have a whole   summer to get on top of the detail but he be still ignore the fact that rise interest rate be a global challenge they be at their high level in america and europe for more than or year mortgage rate have double in america and treble in europe 
 to help mortgage holder we want to ensure that they can use the mortgage charter we have agree with the bank thank to the step we have take someone with a £ property with about £ leave on their mortgage could save more than £ a month and lock in a new deal month before theirs end and repossession will be prohibit for month from the miss payment the right hon and learn gentleman might have miss that that policy be twice as generous as labour ’s 
 absolutely tone deaf in every caff pub and supermarket in britain people be have the same conversation we can not afford that put it back on the shelf it ’ too expensive the prime minister be completely oblivious just pat himself on the back 
 emily and jamie have work hard and be save to buy their own home they be nearly there last year but he scrap house building target because his back benchers push he around house building have fall off a cliff shatter the simple dream of home ownership for people like emily and jamie can the prime minister now see that actually his candidate in tamworth be just loyally follow the party line 
 these prepare line really be not work for he any more the right hon and learn gentleman literally ask i a question about the support we be provide for mortgage holder i give he the answer to that question and then he read from his script that i have not answer the question we be provide significant help for all these people 
 the right hon and learn gentleman have move on to housing target here be the record additional home housing start double what we inherit from the labour party housing supply up on track to deliver a new home and a record number of time buyer he bring up his candidate in tamworth and mid beds as we open this session and he be now say he want to build home well both of those candidate say that they want to block new home in their constituency 
 simon hoare 
 rise 
 sorry keir starmer 
 across our country the british people be roll up their sleeve and get on with it do their good in the face of a punish cost of live crisis and a government who have abandon they abandon renter at risk of be kick out abandon mortgage payer struggle to make end meet and abandon people who dream of own their own house the truth be that the prime minister ’s candidate in tamworth sum up perfectly just how he and his tories be treat the british public so will he just call a general election and give the british public the chance to respond as they do in selby mid beds and tamworth they have hear the government tell they to eff off and they want the chance to return the compliment 
 as we see with the right hon and learn gentleman ’s recent decision on build new house politician like he always take the easy way out whereas we be get on with make the right long term decision to change this country for the well on net on high speed on a smoke free generation on education and on energy security contrast that with his leadership too cautious to say anything and hop that nobody notice let i tell he come that general election the british people will 
 i call simon hoare 
 more 
 i say hoare not more 
 that be the time i have be confuse with the leader of the opposition mr speaker 
 there have be many rumour about you 
 and of all they be true mr speaker 
 like i my right hon friend the prime minister have the honour and privilege of represent a rural constituency i be sure that he like i occasionally feel a certain degree of frustration that although progress have be make in this area the rubric of funding formulae for thing such as the environment agency local government the police and education still fail to adequately reflect the difficulty and challenge of deliver public service in rural area will my right hon friend the chancellor and the wide government use the opportunity of the autumn statement and the forthcoming budget to explore those issue far and make the delivery of service well for the prime minister ’s constituent and mine 
 i thank my hon friend for raise that important issue on behalf of his and my constituent it be vital that we have the same high quality service in rural area as in our town and city i be pleased to tell he that we be provide £ through the rural service delivery grant to help rural council achieve exactly that we be currently review the police funding formula i remember work with he to ensure that the national funding formula for school take account of the different characteristic of school and their pupil we will continue to keep all those thing under review i agree with he entirely our rural community must be give the same funding and public service as everyone else in our country 
 i call the snp deputy leader 
 yesterday the un warn that hospital in gaza have just hour of fuel leave to keep their electricity go that be hour ago the electricity run out tonight we have a human responsibility to all the people in gaza but we have a particular responsibility for uk citizen some of whom be in those hospital with no food no water no medicine and no way out how much bad do the situation have to get before the prime minister will join we in call for a humanitarian ceasefire 
 from the start we have say that the and most important principle be that israel have the right to defend itself under international law our   support for that position be absolute and unchanged but we have also say from the start that we want british national to be able to leave gaza hostage to be release and humanitarian aid to get in we recognise that for all that to happen there have to be a safe environment which of course necessitate specific pause as distinct from a ceasefire we discuss that with partner yesterday evening at the united nations and we have be consistently clear that everything must be do to protect civilian in line with international law and to continue get more aid flow into gaza 
 the grow call for a ceasefire be also about calm the situation in the broad region especially the west bank unicef have report over fatality and over injure child since the conflict begin due to unrelenting attack if we ignore that we risk pour petrol on a fire in a place that only require a spark to ignite can the prime minister understand that join call for a ceasefire be now the good and maybe the only way to stop this conflict escalate beyond all control 
 we have to remember that israel have suffer a shockingly brutal terrorist attack hamas be responsible for this conflict and israel have the right to protect itself in line with international law as the un charter make clear we will continue to urge the israelis to follow international law but we also have to remember that hamas cruelly embe themselves in civilian population 
 we be do everything we can to get aid into the region i be pleased to say that an raf flight leave the uk for egypt this morning carry tonne of aid for gaza the relief supply include more than medical kit solar light and water filter for family and warehousing equipment our team be on the ground ready to receive we will continue to do everything we can to increase the flow of aid include fuel into gaza 
 in the matter of walleys quarry my constituent have be utterly let down and fail by the environment agency not only have it fail to prosecute a rogue operator for the repeat breach of its permit we now learn that for the past year all of its monitoring equipment include in your constituency mr speaker have be grossly under record level of hydrogen sulphide by a factor of approximately or that be the monitoring equipment that people have be rely on to tell they that their air be clean and safe to breathe give everything that have happen we really need to see some proper action now i have have enough of the ea and my constituent have too so will the prime minister do everything in his power to get a grip on this fail organisation 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise the concern of his constituent the environment agency ’s criminal investigation be ongoing so as i hope he understand i can not comment far on it however with regard to his concern about the measurement inaccuracy i have be assure and have check that the environment agency be work swiftly to understand the scale of the problem the   environment secretary be monitor the situation and i have ask she to keep my hon friend update regularly 
 a few short month ago the world come to belfast to celebrate the good friday agreement at the heart of that agreement be the realisation that we could not use violence as a tool for revenge or to achieve our political aim as israelis and almost palestinians lie die or dead when will the prime minister say enough be enough when will he call for a ceasefire when will he tell israel to stop mete out collective punishment to the people of gaza and when will he and other world leader insist on a political solution that involve a palestinian state for the palestinian people 
 as i say an important principle be that israel do have the right to defend itself under international law to ensure that attack like this which be brutal and horrific for its citizen cannot happen again we continue to support that position but as i say from the start we have also want to ensure that humanitarian aid can go in and hostage and foreign national can come out we recognise that that mean there have to be a safe environment which of course necessitate specific pause as distinct from a ceasefire we discuss exactly this with our international partner yesterday at the united nations and will continue to do so as i make clear on monday we have double down on our effort to find a well future for the palestinian people that have be a feature of all our diplomacy in the region and we will continue to give all our effort to make that happen 
 for too long bradford council have fail to represent the good interest of my constituent whether in its catastrophic failure on child ’s service its inability to invest our own council tax back into keighley and ilkley or its refusal to instigate a review into child sexual exploitation across the bradford district local resident and i be feed up of be ignore by bradford council and we want out will the prime minister meet i to discuss my case for leave bradford council and create our own unitary authority that well represent keighley and ilkley put our priority 
 i know my hon friend be a passionate campaigner on this issue have even introduce a private member ’s bill on it early this year i agree that his council should be work to ensure that it deliver good service for all its resident include his constituent and i will certainly arrange for the relevant minister to discuss his concern far with he as my hon friend do not do so maybe i can plug his event this afternoon in the jubilee room a keighley and ilkley showcase perhaps the minister can come to that event and discuss it in person then 
 just a year ago the new prime minister promise to unite our country not with word but with action quite rightly voter make a judgment on action but in my constituency as in many other the prime minister have not deliver on his promise arbroath house in easington colliery be a gp practice without the funding   to deliver basic community health service community such as shotton south hetton haswell and horden lack the police officer to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour we see sewage be dump on our coastline at seaham and blackhall without prosecution of the privatised water company and we see investment for level up block for horden when will the prime minister call a general election and let labour rise to the task of rebuild britain 
 the hon gentleman raise crime i be pleased to say that crime be now down by over since labour be last in office and that include significant reduction in antisocial behaviour which he mention indeed early this year not only do we meet our pledge to deliver more police officer a record number on our street but our antisocial behaviour plan be already make a difference deliver immediate justice and clamp down on that type of activity 
 i support the government ’s plan to build more home and ease housing shortage however i have significant concern about the impact of development on our age drainage system and the potential flooding risk this pose as we be see in place such as the hazelwalls development in uttoxeter what step will the government take to ensure that as more house be build exist infrastructure be upgrade and maintain by local authority to ensure that it be not overwhelm with additional use and less permeable surface 
 as my hon friend know our traditional drainage system be under increase pressure and that compare with the benefit of sustainable drainage system which work in a different way it be already a requirement that sustainable drainage system should be give priority in any major new development and development in flood risk area but early this year we commit to require sustainable drainage system in all new development on top of defra ’s plan for water which put a statutory duty on water company to produce plan to set out how they will improve maintain and extend our robust and resilient waste water system 
 this morning i host the ms society and people live with multiple sclerosis to hear about their experience access personal independence payment year on from its introduction people with ms and other fluctuating condition be still too often be deny the support they deserve to manage the extra cost of their condition and to retain their independence for long some people with ms have sign a petition call for a full review of pip for fluctuate condition which be on its way to downing street right now will the prime minister listen to their call 
 i be very sorry to hear about the experience of those suffer with ms that the hon lady mention and i will ensure that the work and pensions secretary look at their concern and write to she

 i thank my hon friend for his kind word 
 while the final report of the infected blood inquiry have be postpone until march sir brian langstaff the independent chair have already publish his recommendation on compensation for victim of that scandal will the prime minister explain why his government insist on postpone their response until after publication of the final report kick it into the long grass and delay justice once again for my constituent justine rachel and paul whose father die as a result of that scandal as well as thousand of other across these isle 
 as i have say previously from the dispatch box what happen be an appalling tragedy and my heart go out to all of those affect and their family i have give extensive evidence to the inquiry so my position on this matter be on the record what i would say be that extensive work have be go on in government for a long time co ordinated by the minister for the cabinet office as well as interim payment of £ be make to those who be affect

 we be make significant improvement to our cross border rail service across the union thank to our decision on hs2 we can now provide an unprecedented £ of investment to fund the electrification of the north wales main line which will ensure reliable punctual journey between north wales and multiple city across the north west of england we be also continue to develop the pant llanymynech bypass scheme in our next round of the road investment plan and a section of the a5 in england will be consider by national highways as part of the midland and gloucestershire to wales route strategy 
 it be important that the covid inquiry have all the relevant document that be what the public include thousand of bereaved family expect and deserve but despite be a self describe tech bro the prime minister have be unable to locate and provide his whatsapp message to the inquiry do he agree that device should be hand over to expert to retrieve this information 
 both the government and i have fully co operate to provide ten of thousand of document to the covid inquiry and i look forward to give evidence later this year 
 with the ongoing national crisis in nhs dentistry be raise here most week can my right hon friend advise as to when the dentistry plan produce by the department of health and social care will be publish can he ensure that any claw back unspent fund be ringfence for nhs dentistry so as to deal with emergency and to help clear the backlog 
 we be invest £ in nhs dentistry and the reform dental contract be help to improve nhs access for patient i be pleased to say that nhs dental activity in the past year increase by almost a quarter compare with the year before but the forthcoming dental recovery plan which will be out shortly will include action to incentivise dentist to deliver even more nhs care 
 it be an honour to be elect to this place and the standard by which we be expect to abide matter do the prime minister therefore accept that it be ill judge for he to fail to declare to parliament that company link to his wife have benefit to the tune of £ from a fund he have set up as chancellor will he correct the record now 
 it be worth bear in mind that labour front benchers back the future fund when it be introduce indeed they be call for more funding for it not less 
 the house will be aware of my wife ’s shareholding in various british start up that be her career those be on the record and i be happy to put that on the record again it be worth bear in mind that the future fund help more than different company neither the government nor the british business bank choose any of those specific investment it be open to any british firm that meet the criterion 
 the uk be at risk of be leave behind on hydrogen internal combustion engine the eu and the usa now recognise hydrogen combustion engine as emission and be support those industry as all viable carbon technology will be need particularly for our hgv accord to the renewable hydrogen alliance i be work with borgwarner phinia and many mp on hice because this issue be crucial for uk job skill and manufacturing will my right hon friend commit to urgently extend the scope of the automotive transformation fund industrialisation grant to include hydrogen engine so that we win the hice race 
 the government be determined to ensure that the uk remain of the good location in the world for automotive manufacturing hydrogen fuel cell and their upstream supply chain be already   in the scope of the atf and support for the fund have enable johnson matthey ’s £ investment in hertfordshire to develop hydrogen technology i be tell by the secretary of state for business and trade that the department for business and trade be continue to look at the future possibility for renewable hydrogen and will consider the fund ’s eligibility in light of the new development in this space 
 there be an email in my inbox from a constituent who have family in gaza it read 
 my heart can not handle this anymore we be be massacre relentlessly bomb home destroy no water no food no electricity 
 save the children report that child be kill every minute as i speak the life of baby in incubator be in danger if fuel do not reach their hospital in time this be collective punishment of the palestinian people in gaza for crime they do not commit how many more innocent palestinians must die before the prime minister call for a humanitarian ceasefire 
 i welcome the unity across the house on israel ’s right to defend itself in the face of an unspeakable act of terror but it be also clear that we must support the palestinian people they be victim of hamas too hamas use innocent people as human shield and we mourn the loss of every innocent life of every people every faith and every nationality we be work as hard as we can to get as much humanitarian aid into gaza as quickly as practically possible 
 last week suffolk experience its bad local flood for over year with community in and around needham market framlingham debenham and wickham market particularly badly affected home and business have be destroy in suffolk the community have rally together in a very stoic and pragmatic way to support those in need at this very difficult time what long term support can the prime minister offer to the people of suffolk whose business and home have be affect by these flood to help they to recover and rebuild 
 flooding be a devastating experience and i extend my sympathy to all those affect include those in my hon friend ’s constituency i be pleased to say that through the flood recovery framework we be confirm additional financial support for the most affected household and business this will include a £ grant for household and council tax discount and business rate relief of up to for month small and medium sized business will also be eligible for a £ business recovery grant and there be a grant of up to £ to make flooded home more resilient to future flooding we recognise the heroic effort of local council like my hon friend ’s and of emergency responder everywhere who have be work tirelessly in affected area they have our thank and we stand ready to consider any request from council to support their recovery effort 
 on a point of order mr speaker the house rise tomorrow for day i believe regrettably and sadly it may be likely that a ground invasion of gaza will commence during that period this not only have consequence for the palestinians and the israelis but could create turmoil and destabilise the whole middle east i appreciate that it be the government who determine whether or not parliament be recall but in your conversation with the government will you advise they that the house should be recall to debate such a serious issue 
 you be absolutely right that it would not be for i under the normal rule although i recognise the importance of a major escalation and what could happen in the middle east you be correct that it would be for the government not for i unfortunately to recall the house i will work through the usual channel to try to ensure that quite rightly we look to see what can be do in what would be special circumstance because obviously the house will have prorogue i do not lose sight of what you have say and i take it on board i will work with other behind the scene to see how we would manage such a situation 
 far to that point of order mr speaker i can assure the house that the foreign commonwealth and development office my office and other departments across whitehall be very aware that this house will want to be keep update about the ongoing situation many right hon and hon member will have constituent directly affect and we be work with the house of commons library to ensure that people be update about the situation during the recess 
 okay thank you 
 on a point of order mr speaker i seek your guidance to understand how we can table write question about the government ’s policy of evict afghans from hotel accommodation a project run by the minister for veterans affair out of the cabinet office i have give the minister notice that i would raise this issue 
 despite the minister ’s have give multiple statement to the house this year on the housing of our afghan friend my front bench colleague and i be unable to table write question to the cabinet office which instead be be reallocate to either the home office or the department for levelling up housing and communities the table office staff be great but i think a bit of parliamentary plumbing need to be put in place to make sure that effective scrutiny via write question of the minister lead this area be possible please could you advise how i can ensure that the minister for veterans affairs can be successfully scrutinise by write parliamentary question for the area he lead on in government 
 i be concern by what the hon member have raise and grateful to he for give i notice of his point of order he will know that the table office be guide by government departments about the matter of which minister respond to question and on policy area i will look into the matter i take it very seriously and i be very concerned we all know that the minister for veterans affairs be very concerned about veteran so i be sure he will be disappoint to know that those question be not reach he i will investigate 
 the leader of the house be here and i be sure that she will assist i i be sure that we can work together because no member should be unable to lay question to the minister minister be answerable to this house all member from whatever party should have that ability i be very disappointed by what i have be tell we will get to the bottom of it 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no pm 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require local authority to publish a register of derelict building in their area to make provision in respect of the preparation and maintenance of such register and for connected purpose 
 my home town now my home city be a place i be very proud of doncaster have many wonderful asset and the people be the good in the land however although plus per cent of it be great some part be not so the bill will make a real difference to that 
 derelict building be a problem they blight our city town and village this place have provide local authority with power to tackle derelict building sadly though those power be not be use as we intend the bill will provide an incentive to local authority to do their duty and exercise their power for the community as parliament intend it will start to address their dereliction of duty we do not even know exactly how many derelict site there be or precisely where they be how can we as a society tackle the problem of derelict building until we truly know the scale of the problem it be a problem of real significance 
 as i come home on the train to doncaster from parliament on a thursday evening the list building i see be denison house by the railway station the window be smash weed be grow out of the guttering and there be general neglect derelict i walk through the station and see the grand theatre another list building derelict again i walk through town past waterdale derelict i pass by the new expensive and shiny but half empty council building and on south parade i see another denison house also list and also derelict this be the former home of sir edmund beckett denison the man who in bring the railway to doncaster that building of his be now an eyesore derelict again 
 as i drive to the town and village across my constituency i pass tyram hall derelict i keep on drive into thorne to view the work to reopen the leisure centre and i drive by haynes house derelict i pass thorne brewery derelict i have a secretary of state visit doncaster and i take he to edlington ’s leisure centre derelict prince ’s crescent many property there be also derelict the list go on and on 
 why be this so it be because there be no register no personal responsibility and no example set by labour control city of doncaster council the power they hold be not be exercise labour ’s care for our city be seemingly as derelict as the property i have describe we can not let this state of affair continue if we do all we shall see be further deterioration and more derelict building it drag we all down to their level level down not level up 
 my bill would ensure that all derelict building be identify it would answer question what be the definition of a derelict building secondly who will create and maintain the list and thirdly how will it be accessible to the public 
 albert einstein be repute to have say this about solve problem 
 if i have an hour to solve a problem i ’d spend minute think about the problem and minute think about solution 
 i have give this considerable thought and it seem to i that the step must be to have a register of derelict building the obvious body well place for this exercise would be the local authority local authority already have the necessary infrastructure and resource they have a list of all the empty building already they maintain record for council tax and business rate for property include those that be exempt they will accordingly have a list of all building and structure within their area of jurisdiction within their boundary it be important to note that their department for planning and building control as well as for council tax and business rate will have record that can be cross referenced not only be local authority an obvious candidate but they be the one well place 
 there be no need to set up a quango no need to spend enormous sum of taxpayer money and as we have see local authority already have the infrastructure and the record it would merely be a question of identify which of the empty building be derelict they all have website with information accessible by the public the small step require of they by the bill would not incur substantial additional expenditure ongoing maintenance of the record would not require much time effort or expense either 
 my bill will be the step on this journey to address the blight of derelict building in our community this be the step to the solution by pass a law require all local authority to identify derelict building in their area we can start to make progress 
 let i start with the definition a derelict site be define in my bill as a site that have a structure or structure upon the land that be ruinous derelict or in dangerous condition the next step be to identify the derelict building and property council officer would check their exist record for empty property most such property if not all will be easily identify by their status regard payment of council tax or business rate a provisional list can be easily create which then should be publish 
 additionally all local authority have district councillor who should know their ward intimately conservative councillor do that i do know it seem to i that each councillor could easily provide the council with the detail and address of building they believe be an eyesore in their locality and they should be put on a provisional list i would not expect there to be many that be not in that list those property would then be visit by council officer to establish the condition 
 the property on the provisional list would then be classify as derelict and the owner give day notice of the intention to give that classification to the property any owner would have the right to object provide reason in writing these objection could then be review the local authority could then either withdraw the classification or confirm it 
 so why be such a list of any value to we the advantage be numerous it would enable we to know the scale of the problem it would provide an incentive to all   area to see that list reduce rather than increase should the building be leave as they be be improve or be demolish these be question that will arise and the right answer may be different across the board should improvement work be exempt from vat should compulsory purchase order be make should owner be require to carry out improvement or demolition should they be persuade to address that by carrot or stick or indeed by both 
 many such question arise the bill do not attempt to answer they it would however enable we for the time to understand the scale of the problem face by every part of this wonderful country i want to ensure that our city town and village be not blight derelict building be a blight there be no doubt about that let we identify the scale of the problem let we learn from the wisdom of albert einstein let we think about the problem the bill would enable we to do exactly that then and only then shall we find the solution and return all our town and city to their former glory 
 question put and agree to 
 order 
 that nick fletcher dr liam fox antony higginbotham mark eastwood damien moore paul bristow brendan clarke smith mark jenkinson danny kruger lia nici alexander stafford and miriam cates present the bill 
 nick fletcher accordingly present the bill 
 bill read the time to be read a time on   friday november and to be print bill 
 consideration of lords message 
 i beg to move 
 that this house insist on its amendment 151a and disagree with the lords in their amendment 151e and 151f. 
 with this it will be convenient to discuss amendment a and the follow motion 
 that this house insist on its amendment 161a in lieu and disagree with the lords in their amendment 161d in lieu 
 i be pleased to bring this important bill back to the house this afternoon for what i sincerely hope be the last time give that this will be the time we have debate and vote on similar issue i urge opposition front bench members and those in the other place not to risk the safe passage of this hugely significant near-400 page bill by continue to press these amendment 
 the government have appreciate the input of right hon and hon member from both side of the house include the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge and for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland   and my hon friend   the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill to help change the bill for the well we be discuss failure to prevent together with the identification of doctoring the government be take world lead measure i think this be the time that a major economy such as ours have implement they which we should be proud we be implement through the bill of course if the elect chamber express its strong will on these remain issue for the time i very much hope that the other place will agree that now be the time for it to accept that position i think we would all rather have what we have do than see all this good work be in vain by let the legislation fall 
 let i discuss the issue in turn i will keep my remark brief as the argument remain the same as on the precede time we have discuss they i will address lords amendment 151e and 151f on the failure to prevent threshold i will also address amendment a table last night by the right hon member for barking on a government review of the threshold while my noble friend lord garnier ’s amendment have move close yet again to the government ’s position by exempt micro entity and small organisation from the offence i be afraid that the government will not support the lowering of the threshold at this time let i repeat the reason why it be already an offence to perpetrate fraud the objective of the new offence be to ensure that there be accountability where fraud occur in large organisation there be simply no need to apply any such offence to small organisation 
 every time such an offence be introduce business owner end up distracted from run their business by take time to reassess their compliance risk which   often involve take professional advice we assess that the revise threshold propose by lord garnier would cost medium sized enterprise £ in off cost and nearly £ in annual recur cost we should be make it easy for business to operate in the uk and only impose additional regulatory burden when absolutely necessary the government completely reject the notion of use such an offence simply to raise awareness among business owner of the seriousness of the problem of fraud there would be other more proportionate way to do that if necessary 
 in response to the amendment table by the right hon member for barking the government have already future proof the bill by include a delegate power to allow the government to raise low or remove the threshold altogether of course as with all legislation the government will keep the threshold under review i make a personal commitment to do that and to make change if evidence suggest that they be require i do not think that a government review be necessary for that to take place so i ask the right hon member not to move her amendment we must bear in mind that a review do not guarantee change anyway what guarantee change be have the right people at the dispatch box make change whether those be people from her party or my party and both party be equally exercise by these concern i urge all right hon and hon member to support the government motion to disagree with the lords amendment to ensure that we take a proportionate approach and do not impose unnecessary measure on legitimate business that would curb our economic growth 
 i turn to lords amendment 161d table by lord faulks on cost protection in civil recovery case the government remain of the view that such an amendment would be a significant departure from a fundamental principle of justice that the loser pay and therefore not something that should be rush into without careful consideration furthermore as i set out when we last debate this issue we have see no clear evidence that the amendment would increase the number of case take on by law enforcement however that be not to say that such an amendment be necessarily a bad idea that be why we previously add to the bill a statutory commitment to review the payment of cost in civil recovery case in england and wales by enforcement authority to publish a report on the finding and to lay that before parliament within month 
 with regard to civil cost reform in england and wales the government would normally look to consult appropriate consultee include the senior judiciary the law society and the bar council enact the reform now without a full review would not allow judge and relevant organisation or indeed their counterpart in northern ireland and scotland to comment on how it would be read and apply in practice we therefore feel it would be irresponsible for we to rush into make such a significant change at the end of a bill ’s passage without full consideration by government and further scrutiny by parliament i very much hope that all right hon and hon member will agree that that be the responsible approach to take and therefore support the government ’s position 
 the minister say clearly that there have be consultation with scotland and northern ireland will he indicate who those discussion have take place with be it bank or the departments look after matter in the absence of a function northern ireland assembly i be keen to know who do the work to ensure that there be accountability for everyone 
 that be a good point there be clearly different legal jurisdiction in northern ireland and scotland with of course the court of session in scotland from a legal perspective the counsel in those jurisdiction be the people who discuss this in wide issue such as failure to prevent bank and many other stakeholder have people who will consult during the process i be happy to keep up the conversation with the hon gentleman 
 the reason i ask the question be quite specific although it might not necessarily relate to the issue directly the minister refer to bank a number of local organisation and community group back home which be register and constitute as community institution have have their bank account close bank have close their account down because they say they be non profitable be it right that bank should be able to do that i know the minister understand the matter 
 order can i just help a little bit the hon gentleman be very good but his intervention be very long why do he not put down to speak it might be easy i have to get other people in as well 
 the hon gentleman raise a very important issue relate to the concern about de banking that we have across the economy the economic secretary to the treasury my hon friend   the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith   be look at it as be the treasury in future it be our intention to ensure that when bank close account they give a valid reason why rather than close they summarily he be absolutely right to raise the point and i be very happy to engage with he on it because it affect business as well as community group 
 to conclude i encourage everyone to agree with the government ’s position on these area it be vital that we achieve royal assent without delay so we can proceed to implement the important reform in the bill as quickly as possible 
 it be an honour to speak on the bill again i be hop that we could conclude the proceeding on the bill as soon as possible and it be disappointing that the government be yet to make further compromise the bill be welcome in principle but it should not have take the war on ukraine to prompt the government into action i be grateful to my right hon friend the members for barking dame margaret hodge and for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne and to members across the house for work together to improve the bill 
 economic crime pose a threat to our country ’s national security our institution our economy and cause serious harm to our citizen and wide society conservative   estimate place the cost of economic crime at £ a year accord to the national crime agency and the failure to stop criminal benefit from the proceed of their crime can fund further criminality that can include offence such as funding organise crime group terrorist activity drug dealing and people traffic this be a very serious issue 
 economic crime as the minister know have many victim for too long the government have turn a blind eye to corrupt and dirty money allow russian illicit finance to flood into britain that let putin ’s crony stash ill get gain and even recycle the proceed of crime into luxury property that be well document and have be highlight by many member across the house as well as in select committees accord to analysis by transparency international property to the tune of £ have be buy through suspicious wealth of those almost a quarter in value be 
 buy by russians accuse of corruption or link to the kremlin 
 most be hold via secretive offshore company that drive up property price for ordinary people in our country more than third of english and welsh property hold by foreign shell company do not report their true owner research by the london school of economics and warwick university show that the register of overseas entities be not fully effective for of such property essential information about their beneficial owner remain miss or publicly inaccessible despite the register that mean we still can not know whether sanctioned individual money launderer or other corrupt individual be benefit from those property 
 we must not sustain economic growth off the back of dirty money the government have already delay the bill and these action for too long in that time money have be lose economic crime have become ingrained and the uk economy have once again lose out give that the nature and necessity of the bill have already be discuss at length i will focus on address the amendment 
 during the passage of the bill helpful alteration have be make to ensure that it be robust the lords amendment before we today seek to address omission we be very disappointed that the government be not willing to compromise and not willing to heed the wise and expert input of the lords that be deeply disappointing because a great deal could be achieve if the minister and his government take note include from hon and learn member on their own side 
 rise 
 if the minister be brief rather than talk the bill out like he do last time i will give way 
 i will be very brief on the question of compromise the hon lady will have notice that there be no failure to prevent offence when the legislation be table nor be there an identification doctrine there have be significant compromise on the government side our preference clearly be to move forward in that spirit of compromise we have achieve a great deal with the bill which have move from under page to page i do not think it be right to say that the government have not compromise 
 when the minister be a back bencher he be a powerful advocate on the very issue we be discuss today it be a shame he have be muzzle but i appreciate that he be in a difficult position i hope we can have some comprise but clearly he have not manage to persuade senior member of his government i ask the government to once again carefully consider these amendment so that we can well tackle the problem of fraud and economic crime 
 the minister highlight all the problem with the amendment but i want to talk about their strength the noble lord garnier ’s amendment on failure to prevent fraud which exempt small and micro enterprise highlight that the criminal law should be uniform and apply to all in a similar way this be not just a small insignificant amendment but a change that would significantly alter law enforcement for context fraud be the most common crime in the uk account for of all crime introduce a failure to prevent offence would help to deter company from engage in or facilitate fraud to fully change corporate behaviour we must ensure that the offence apply to all company regardless of size 
 as have be state on many occasion since the failure to prevent bribery cover all company there be no reason why this measure should not also cover business of all size it simply create more discrepancy and confusion for business the size of a business should not determine who be exempt the government have tout this exemption as a protection for small business against unnecessary red tape but in reality this carve out deprive small and medium size enterprise of the defence of have put in place reasonable anti fraud procedure small company will instead be cover only by the fraud offence itself when large company would be catch by the light failure to prevent fraud offence the introduction of a new failure to prevent offence should apply to all and the corresponding defence of put in place reasonable defence procedure should be available to all in effect through this carve out the government be create an uneven playing field that be bias against small company the bill currently leave large gap for economic crime to not only persist but flourish which i know be not the intention of the minister the amendment would have go a long way to address those issue i ask he once again to carefully consider the amendment rather than reject it 
 i want to turn to the amendment from the noble lord faulks on cost protection in civil recovery case the amendment give more discretion to court judge to alter the allocation of legal cost to ensure that extortionate legal fee be not a hindrance to justice the spirit of the amendment be that it will help to prevent criminal benefit from the proceed of crime here or around the world when it come to case where enforcement agency be try to prosecute high level large scale economic crime cost order remain a serious barrier i know that hand from evidence we receive when i serve on the treasury committee where we conduct inquiry on these issue our enforcement agency need strong backing if they be to take on fraud money laundering and other type of economic crime on the large scale right now the government should be on the side of our agency rather than tie their hand behind their back the amendment would   ensure that criminal crony and kleptocrat be not give cover by leave the back door open for they to spend their way out of justice that can not be right it would ensure that the size of their bank account and asset do not give they a guarantee get out of jail free card just because they can afford to meet any expense require to support their case the minister know that this be a problem he have hear evidence of it he know that it be a serious issue that need to be address 
 it have be disappointing to observe the government ’s lack of willingness to protect our law enforcement it seem reasonable that a court could have discretion on how to allocate cost especially when we know of previous case of which result in a family ’ seek cost amount to a staggering £ that represent of the national crime agency ’s annual budget between and 
 the bill be almost over the line and i acknowledge that there have be some improvement but we could do a great deal more we have welcome the bill and we welcome the lords amendment so we be disappointed that the government continue to fail to support they we would be in a much well place if there be a compromise the failure to prevent offence be a case in point for year we have be call for a replication of the success of the bribery act sadly our capital city have be nickname londongrad and be now consider to be a capital where money laundering and fraud be rife that mean that we must do more to tackle these issue but the bill provide only part of the solution the present circumstance require much more radical action than the timidity that we have witness both today and in the last session 
 it be sadden that the government have miss such an important opportunity we will continue to hold their foot to the fire but give the lack of compromise it will be for the next government the next labour government i hope to pick up the piece and toughen up our response in order to end the corrosive impact of dirty money in our country 
 rise 
 order before i call the next speaker let i point out it may not be obvious that we only have until pm to complete this business i therefore appeal for brevity i be not go to impose a time limit because give that everyone present be a distinguished and experienced member we should not need 
 on a point of order madam deputy speaker i just want to be clear about this i assume that we can speak until pm and vote after that be that correct 
 it be let i say for the purpose of clarity that the right hon lady be absolutely correct 
 there have be a great deal of improvement in the bill and much of its content be welcome i recognise that   and i also recognise what the minister have say but i be sorry to say that the dead hand of the treasury have yet again get in the way of our get the bill into the good possible state let we be blunt about it the government regrettably have not move which be why i support the amendment table by   the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge   and my right hon and learn friend   the member for south swindon sir robert buckland which i have sign and which i think offer a sensible compromise if it take long for the treasury and other part of the government to be persuade well and good let we have a proper review after month however a serious issue have arise and i want to make brief point about it 
 let i deal with the point make in the other place by lord garnier about the inherent contradiction in a test of criminality base on the size of an organisation i can see that there be a proportionality point to be make about very small enterprise but there be good evidence and anyone who practise in the field will know that fraud and other illicit activity be often channel through small company and the people in those company be precisely the people over whom we do need to have a degree of control law enforcement be not with respect needless bureaucracy it be fundamental to good business and i think that that point be regrettably be miss 
 it be a point underline when we hear public evidence on the bill people explain to we how a number of different small company might well be set up to become conduit for fraud 
 that be a compelling point and it accord with the evidence that the justice committee be give in relation to our inquiry into fraud in the justice system the irony be that the government ’s current stance may well create a perverse incentive that be certainly not what the minister want and it be not what anyone in the house ought to want 
 the point about cost cap be important as well but i be particularly exercise about the failure to prevent offence everyone have argue for that and we be nearly there i hop that the government be reasonable would say let we have a look at it let we have a commitment in the bill i accept that the minister be an entirely honourable man and i accept what he say but i know from personal experience that minister do not stay forever at the end of the day we want an assurance that this provision will be write into the statute and there will be a review because it be so important i beg the minister to reflect on that otherwise those of we who want to be able to support the government today will find ourselves in a position where we can not do so although there be so little between we the ability to move just that little bit far would send a much well signal as it be the lords pass these amendment last time with large majority than before and they will be entitle to take note of that in the event that the bill go back to they again i therefore hope that even at the last minute the government will reflect 
 i call dame margaret hodge i beg your pardon i call alison thewliss 
 i know that when you refer to we all as distinguished and experience member you do not mean i madam deputy speaker 
 this be the time we have be back here and i think it incumbent on the government to listen to the lords they have make it clear that they feel strongly about their very reasonable amendment which show how important they be and how we should be get this right there be no question that as the minister suggest we be go to let the bill fall today i think that if he be worried about that he would accept the lords amendment this afternoon rather than allow the process to go on and on we do not need to be here at the last minute he could have accept many of the amendment at a much early stage because fundamentally he agree with they we know that because he say it on many occasion before he take ministerial office i think that a great deal can be do if the minister will make that compromise this afternoon 
 the notion that of business can be exempt from the failure to prevent offence be absolutely mad small business be both part of and victim of economic crime some figure from uk finance arrive in our inboxe early today accord to its finding criminal steal £ through unauthorised and authorise fraud in just the half of uk finance say that that be a decrease but it be still a significant amount of money business as well as individual be lose out and the government should be pay more attention to that 
 the minister describe failure to prevent as a distraction for business i wonder if he also think for consistency ’s sake that the failure to prevent bribery offence in the bribery act and the failure to prevent tax evasion offence in the criminal finances act be distraction for business if he think that failure to prevent economic crime be a distraction for business he must surely think that those other offence be also an unnecessary bit of bureaucracy that business have to carry out it do not make any sense 
 i fully support the level playing field for cost protection we must give our enforcement agency both the tool and money to do their job no enforcement agency should be think we can not afford to take on this case we can not afford to prosecute these economic criminal the government should be support law enforcement allow this lords amendment to go through and ensure that we make the good possible legislation there be no excuse for the government not to do these thing the government agree with they and we in the house agree with they on a cross party basis the government should get on with it and not return the bill to the lords 
 i will certainly remember your exhortation to brevity madam deputy speaker as you know that be something of a challenge for i at the good of time 
 no no 
 i think my right hon friend may suffer from the same affliction dare i say but i will draw a veil of charity over that 
 my hon friend and my friend the minister have campaign assiduously with we in the trench on this issue for many year i yield to none in my admiration for he and i want to put on record how grateful i be that he be in this place in that spot do the job that he be do we have come a long way i well remember be on the parliamentary business and legislation committee give authorisation for this bill in the place and know then that it would require heavy amendment during its course
