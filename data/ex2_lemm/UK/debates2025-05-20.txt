 successive government have fail to deliver a fair energy transition for worker and community we have see the devastating closure of the grangemouth oil refinery and now we be see uncertainty around the gas storage facility off the east coast just out of offshore oil and gas company be plan to invest anything in renewable energy by so the government must be the one in the drive seat to ensure that our north sea oil and gas worker do not meet the same fate what discussion have the minister have with the secretary of state for energy security and net on new financial support to create recruitment and retention pathway for worker move into the clean energy pathway 
 our skilled workforce in the oil and gas industry will be important for the continue role of oil and gas in the energy mix but also for the transition to renewable and net energy as the hon lady have point out that be why we have invest significant sum of money in carbon capture and storage work with exactly those company and we will set out detail of further support for the industry at the spending review in the come month 
 i welcome the £ commitment to grangemouth and clean energy through the national wealth fund and i also welcome the department ’s confirmation to i recently that that money will not be fetter exclusively to the project willow proposal the need for investment be urgent with job lose and the broad economic impact impend we need to move far and fast so what conversation be treasury ministers have with their cabinet colleague to encourage they to act on the project willow policy recommendation and deliver investment in grangemouth 
 i thank my hon friend who be a champion for his constituency and for industry as he have allude to the government have already make hundred of million of pound available through the national wealth fund for the company in question we be work to ensure a just transition harbour the skill of people in scotland and across the country we be now in active discussion as the spending review come to an end and we will be able to present more detail to the house on   june 
 i call the shadow minister 
 the climate change committee say that we will need oil and gas until at least but rather than maximise north sea production the government be tax it out of existence harbour energy have just announce hundred of job loss as a result of the chancellor ’s windfall tax instead of costly transition import will ministers use the spending review to think again and focus on an energy policy that will deliver cheap and clean energy that be affordable for consumer and business 
 i welcome the hon gentleman ’s encouragement that be why we be invest in home grow secure energy include renewable nuclear and other form of energy in yesterday ’s uk eu trade deal which i be sure the shadow minister would like to welcome we have enhance our arrangement with the european union on electricity trading enable we to export energy we produce in the uk to the european union and vice versa that will ensure energy security as well as good job and good business in the energy sector for decade to come 
 what recent discussion she have have with the financial conduct authority on the adequacy of support from mortgage lender for old people with interest roll up lifetime mortgage 
 lifetime mortgage have be regulate by the fca since those rule provide robust consumer protection include require lender to engage and provide tailor support to all their customer 
 of my constituent a year old man take out in what he think be a £ loan but what be actually an interest roll up lifetime mortgage despite pay £ over the year he now owe over £ due to compound interest he have be   deny redress by the financial ombudsman due to time limit and my team have also contact the fca and the lender without success my constituent be now leave to deal with the consequence will the minister meet i to discuss this case and how we can well support other people who have be mi sell those product 
 i be really sorry to hear about the circumstance that my hon friend ’s constituent be face and i would be happy to meet she to discuss the issue far lifetime mortgage be complex financial product and i suggest that anyone consider equity release seek independent financial advice to help ensure those product be suitable for their need 
 an increase number of pensioner be reach the end of their mortgage with outstanding borrowing and find themselves unable to meet later life lending criterion and this be likely to become even more prevalent in year to come as house price rise continue to outstrip earning what discussion be the minister have with lender and the mortgage industry about expand those criterion and give hard work pensioner who might otherwise be force to seek council support the opportunity to remain in their own home 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise this important issue i discuss mortgage with lender and indeed with the financial conduct authority on a weekly basis and i will ensure that i pass on his comment 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the autumn budget on cost for business 
 the government consider all the policy in the autumn budget carefully in the context of the difficult fiscal inheritance that we have receive from the conservative party the decision to increase employer national insurance contribution and reduce the secondary threshold be take to stabilise the public finance and ensure that money be available for our crucial public service especially the national health service 
 johnson ’s of hedon a diy store have trade successfully for year but its owner mike brooke who have run it throughout that time say that the national insurance hike introduce by the chancellor have finally make the business unviable be the cruel destruction of johnson ’s of hedon and the job that it provide deliberate or an accident 
 the money from national insurance which of course only come in last month be be use to fund investment in the national health service since the general election we have deliver additional nhs appointment which benefit constituent in east yorkshire and throughout the country as for support business the trade deal that we secure with the european union be welcome yesterday by the confederation of british industry the food drink   federation the institute of directors and other because it will add about £ to the size of the uk economy 
 i call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer 
 only last week the right hon lady be trumpet that the economy have turn a corner but as she have just say it be barely a month since her disastrous job tax start to bite may i ask she precisely which business confidence survey just she can point to which support her assertion that everything be come up rose 
 accord to pwc ’s global ceo survey that be just of the survey britain be the good place in the world in which to invest and that be what this government be do the shadow chancellor simply be not serious and his party be become completely irrelevant he talk about job job have be create since the general election he talk about economic growth the uk be now the fast grow economy in the g7 he talk about business we have secure trade agreement which be back by british business and british trade union and the conservative party oppose every single of they no wonder even george osborne have say that the shadow chancellor have no credible economic plan while the conservative party plummet into irrelevance this labour government will deliver in the national interest 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in the budget the government reduce business rate relief which be hit small business hard under current plan in the next financial year small independent business could see their rate go up by and chain could see theirs go down by i have share that analysis with ministers will the chancellor please promise that she will look at it personally to ensure that this i think unintended consequence do not come to pass and independent business do not close leave even more of our high street look the same 
 the hon lady will know that in the budget at a cost of about £ we be able to extend business rate relief which be due to end entirely under the plan we have inherit from the conservative party as she will also know we be reform the way in which business rate work so that there be permanently low rate for hospitality and retail sector particularly on our high street 
 what progress she have make on update the green book 
 what comparative assessment she have make of the potential impact of rule for assess value for money in public spending on level of funding allocate in the south east and the north of england 
 in january i announce a review of the green book to ensure that it be support fair objective and transparent advice on public investment across the country and i be work closely with our mayor particularly steve rotheram who have champion this issue since january the treasury have be in conversation with over different organisation and individual regionally and nationally to identify area where we can make change to the green book and champion investment in the north of england 
 bear with i on this mr speaker the previous conservative government do not get absolutely everything wrong they rightly identify that treasury spending be a powerful tool to rebalance our economy in favour of area like our in the north of england they then fail to deliver and voter deliver their verdict at the ballot box this government have the opportunity to use this powerful tool and ensure that regional disparity be not far entrench when they look at the green book what reassurance can the chancellor give my constituent that project such as repair stepping hill hospital or bring the tram train to marple will get a fair crack of the treasury spending whip 
 i totally agree with the hon lady the plan that we inherit from the conservative party see capital spending decline as a share of gdp which be totally the wrong decision if we want to grow the economy and improve prospect in town and city across the north of england over the course of this parliament we be put £ more into capital spending so that we can build the road and rail infrastructure the energy infrastructure the digital infrastructure and the housing that our country desperately need under our reform to the green book we will make sure that we get more investment to the place that need it include town and city in the north of england 
 i be grateful to have secure thursday ’s adjournment debate on the a66 road improvement project a key transport link between cumbria the north east and north yorkshire cumbria be a long way from westminster and many of we fear that the economic case for major project be stack in favour of the economically active south east can the chancellor reassure i that cumbria will not be disadvantage when key public spending decision be take 
 my hon friend be a staunch defender of his constituency and region we will make decision at the spending review which we will publish on   june but as a proud northern mp i be absolutely determined that the north get its fair share of investment 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to support growth in the night time economy 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to support growth in the night time economy in essex 
 the night time economy and the hospitality sector more widely be the beat heart of our cultural life bring to life the place we all call home that be why this government have cut draught duty and introduce a fairer permanent business rate system we all want our pub club and restaurant to thrive 
 last month i meet representative of bournemouth town centre ’s night time economy at of the new addition to our high street barbara ’s bier haus the sector be incredibly resilient but be grapple with a number of challenge such as change consumer behaviour and rise cost issue that be common across our hospitality and retail sector be prohibitively high business rate can the minister update we on the progress that we be make towards business rate reform and tell we how this will give the night time economy the security it need to be prosperous 
 i completely recognise my hon friend ’s point last autumn alongside announce immediate support for retail hospitality and leisure property the government publish a discussion paper set out our priority for wide reform and i know the exchequer secretary have meet a wide range of business on this subject we be deliver permanently low business rate for these sector and we will announce further policy detail at the budget in the autumn 
 the kursaal in southend the site of the theme park in europe and the freight house in rochford be once iconic venue in my community and central to the night time economy over the last year venue have be force to close and heritage building have be leave empty what step be the minister and his cabinet colleague take to protect the iconic heritage and cultural venue that be the backbone of our evening and local economy 
 i have miss out on the particular historical gem that my hon friend mention but my daughter be a big fan of southend so obviously i agree with he wholeheartedly and the government agree with my hon friend which be why last december we announce the large round of the community ownership fund award £ to project across the uk in fact i agree with my hon friend so much that my own office be in the rejuvenate albert hall in swansea which have have previous incarnation as a cinema a bingo venue and a music venue but behaviour in that building be much well these day 
 just a few week ago i hold a roundtable in my constituency with ukhospitality and hospitality business such as hotel night time economy business and pub it be just after the national insurance rise payment which mean that those business be devastate and be have few job few apprentice and less investment what they be worried about as they look to the future be whether the chancellor will be raise taxis again in the coming month can the minister assure my business that the chancellor will not be come back for more 
 what the sector be do be welcome the trade deal do by the government yesterday what it be worried about be a conservative party that   can not bring itself to welcome a single trade deal with any country around the world the party of robert peel have turn its back on the entire world 
 the hop tub in hurstpierpoint the hop sun in haywards heath and the brickworks in burgess hill be fantastic microbrewery serve the constituent of mid sussex give the pressure of national insurance and the challenge of business rate what be the treasury do to support these innovative business 
 i think everybody in this house enjoy the proliferation of microbrewery around the country which be why the government be support draught beer and cider by knock 1p off the price of a pint at the budget last year it be important not only that we support our pub but the brewer who produce the content that be sell in they 
 i call the shadow minister 
 sacha lord labour ’s former night time economy adviser say that it be tough for the hospitality industry today than it be even during the pandemic but the chancellor be ignore his advice and push ahead with a cocktail of cost that the night time industries association have call a death sentence for our pub bar and club can the minister and the chancellor not see that the future of the industry be fatally undermine by their anti growth taxation 
 what be anti growth be the conservative party which sit over long year of decline and completely unprecedented economic stagnation our job be to support the hospitality and leisure sector more generally that be why we be reduce red tape through the cross government licensing taskforce why we be permanently cut business rate move away from the year by year chaotic system put in place by the conservative party and why we be engage all the time with the hospitality sector council 
 what assessment her department have make of the potential impact of the double contribution convention in the uk india free trade agreement on level of tax revenue 
 the trade deal that we have secure with india add around £ to the uk economy on social security contribution if somebody who work for an indian business be post to the uk or someone from a uk business be post to india they will not pay lot of contribution if you be pay into the indian provident fund in india you will not be pay national insurance contribution here and if you be pay national insurance contribution here you will not be pay into the indian provident fund on top of that to come to the uk to work from india you will need to pay just over £ for the nhs surcharge to be able to access those service and £ in visa fee contribute to the uk exchequer 
 i note that the chancellor do not actually address the point of the cost to the exchequer of the double contribution convention which the government have agree with india indian worker send here by their employer on intra company transfer cost more in taxis than british worker but that flip under this deal indian worker will be tax less and cost less to employ than british rival for do the same job that will not only cost the treasury lose revenue which the chancellor do not admit but displace british worker suppress wage and increase immigration will the chancellor commit now to monitor the effect of the agreement and if the datum show any of that happening promise to scrap this charter for immigration with india 
 this deal be worth £ to the uk economy and it also benefit british worker be post by their company to work in india the conservatives be now in the absurd situation of oppose the us deal the india deal and the deal with the eu they be simply not serious the india deal reduce tariff on scotch whisky by more than half and bring into the uk more good job pay decent wage the conservatives seem to be against that 
 special steel business paralloy in billingham in my constituency have tell i that uncertainty on international trade have recently leave its customer run for the hill do the chancellor of the exchequer agree that now we have trade deal come along like bus with india the us and the eu we can offer reliability and confidence to important local business such as paralloy that want to export to the world 
 steel be of the sector that will benefit particularly from the trade deal this government have secure free ourselves of tariff on steel go into the us indeed the deal we secure with the eu yesterday mean that we avoid tariff on steel be sell into european market as well as now be exempt from the european carbon border adjustment mechanism which be good for steel and good for job right across britain 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to ensure cross departmental planning in the development of the spending review 
 the treasury have reform the spending review process to ensure that it facilitate genuine collaboration across department as part of this spending review the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and i have meet secretaries of state multilaterally in mission cluster which have bring together department to agree cross departmental priority increase transparency reduce duplication and align spending with mission delivery across whitehall while learn every possible lesson from the failure of the conservatives to ensure that it be never repeat ever again 
 some uk medical graduate compete with overseas graduate for postgraduate training mean that many of our own graduate simply can not progress into high professional training and either go abroad themselves or leave medicine do the minister agree that the treasury have a crucial role to co ordinate spending on medical university education by the department for education and on postgraduate training by the department of health and social care so as to ensure that public money spend on medical student education be not waste 
 the government be commit to train the staff the nhs need as part of our year plan international staff clearly play an important role in the mix of staff that we have but we also want to create opportunity for people across the country to work in our national health service that be why thank to change this government have make we have already be able to recruit more than additional gps since october who would otherwise not have be able to seek that type of employment 
 while discuss the spending review will the treasury get the agriculture secretary and the energy secretary together in the same room and make sure that agriculture receive the funding it need and that energy be not allow to charge agriculture effectively for its loss of income in other word will the chancellor ensure we be not rob peter to pay paul 
 a meeting of that nature have already take place as part of our mission lead approach to government we continue to engage with the departments for energy security and net and for environment food and rural affairs on these issue as the right hon gentleman suggest it be exactly what we mean when we talk about cross departmental collaboration as the right hon gentleman know further detail will be set out in the spending review in due course 
 what step she be take to increase level of funding for northern town 
 i be pleased to go with my hon friend to darwen to visit the banking hub which be roll out just a few month ago we also visit the thriving darwen market in of his local town we will set out at the spending review how we will spend the £ extra that we be put in to capital spending compare with the plan we inherit from the conservatives of course we will ensure that town and city include across the north of england benefit from that investment 
 i thank the chancellor for that answer the government ’s commitment to the north be absolutely clear we very much enjoy our visit to darwen market at the same time however history tell we that small town like those that make up rossendale and darwen can far too easily get leave behind and not feel the benefit of major infrastructure investment despite be the very community that need to see and feel change   the most do the chancellor agree that as we implement our investment and growth strategy and deliver the review of the green book we must put our leave behind community as part of every major investment decision we should ask the question what do this do for our most deprived and left behind neighbourhood it be only by target investment where it be need most that we can ensure that every community feel the benefit of the growth that this government will bring 
 my hon friend be a proud champion of the town and village of rossendale and darwen we will make sure that we use our green book review to properly assess the benefit of all this government ’s investment on top of that capital investment the people of rossendale and darwen be benefit from the additional appointment that we have deliver which have lead to reduction in nhs waiting list and also the increase in the national living wage which will make work people in his constituency and across the country well off 
 the town and village of the lake and the dale in cumbria be proud to host visitor every single year we be the uk ’s big visitor destination outside of london yet we get almost no support whatsoever for the cost incur by those visitor on our highway and other infrastructure health service and police will the chancellor look at funding allocation to make sure that those service that support the resident and the visitor be properly fund 
 the green book reform will ensure that we properly assess the benefit of investment in different part of the uk but the people of cumbria and the lake will benefit from the record investment in the nhs the roll out of nursery and free breakfast club at primary school as well as the increase in the national living wage from which many worker in sector such as hospitality and retail in the hon member ’s constituency will directly benefit 
 way to get treasury official to start focus more on northern town would be to move the treasury up north after experience our rail network and our infrastructure they may very quickly invest more money in the area be there any plan to move any treasury office to the north 
 no market street chorley laughter 
 this government have commit to increase the proportion of civil servant who work in the north of england but we already have a hub that we be expand in darlington where department work include official from the treasury the treasury be very mindful of the importance of invest right across the north of england in darlington leeds cumbria rossendale and darwen and many other constituency beside 
 the prosperity of northern town be very much dependent on good transport connection will the chancellor ensure that national highways be adequately fund so that it can improve access to the port and town of immingham through improvement to the a180 and   also that the department for transport have adequate fund to meet the modest amount that be need to fund an extension of the king ’s cross to lincoln train service through to grimsby and cleethorpes 
 i shall make sure that the transport secretary hear those request but the hon gentleman know that our investment in british steel which will save that company be set to increase the number of job there that will make a massive difference to his constituent as will the investment in renewable energy in the north sea particularly around immingham create good job and pay decent wage in his constituency and in many other too 
 what step she be take through the spending review to help increase level of economic growth 
 what step she be take through the spending review to help increase level of economic growth 
 what step she be take through the spending review to help increase level of economic growth 
 i know that my hon friend be work closely with the local labour council in southport to regenerate the local town centre and we will make sure that this government back he every step of the way 
 whether it be the marine lake events centre the enterprise arcade or the new market quarter in my southport constituency my town have benefit from state lead investment in neighbourhood and the public realm do the chancellor agree that investment policy of this sort be essential to drive economic growth in our region and nation and will help we to finally turn the page on the fail austerity policy of the conservative party 
 i absolutely agree and that be why we have reverse the conservative decision to cut capital spending instead we be preserve that capital investment which mean spend £ more on road rail energy home and digital infrastructure than would have be spend in the plan we inherit we be also spend on day to day thing such as make sure that we have police on our street and work with our mayor include mayor steve rotheram to ensure we get investment into the place that most need it 
 small business be the backbone of our economy in ilford south we have many small business range from restaurant like delhi o delhi mr bunns bakery tea shop like mi chaii to local shop like the chopra convenience store they make ilford an amazing place to eat shop and do business will the chancellor join i in commend the local business that make the high street the beat heart of ilford south and will she lay out what step she be take to support these entrepreneur 
 at the budget we more than double the employment allowance to £ to take many small business out of pay national insurance altogether on corporation tax we have maintain the small profit rate to help small business and to help entrepreneur raise finance and grow the government have extend the enterprise investment scheme and the venture capital trust scheme i very much add my word of support to business across ilford and i commend the work my hon friend do to champion they 
 clwyd north be a proud coastal constituency home to a dedicated hospitality sector with many small business include the recently open bobcats coffee where young entrepreneur bobby be an example to we all economic circumstance have be tough after a decade of neglect by the tories will the chancellor outline the treasury ’s plan to support the small business that be such a vital part of our local economy 
 from the next financial year this government will introduce permanently low rate for high street retail hospitality and leisure property with rateable value below £ and we be do that exactly to support the sort of business that my hon friend champion 
 i draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests early this month harbour energy announce that it would be cut of its onshore workforce blame the government ’s punitive fiscal position and challenge regulatory environment when the news be announce the chancellor say that this be just a commercial decision by company so how do she explain the other energy sector job that have be lose in north east scotland in just the last few week belmar engineering be enter liquidation with job loss well safe solutions face job loss beam a subsea technology company have make all staff redundant with harbour energy ’s cut of of its workforce—250 job we be talk about job in total how can the chancellor explain that and how will she support the industry in the spending review 
 my hon friend the exchequer secretary to the treasury be work closely with business right across the energy sector the previous government increase the rate of tax on energy company to and we increase it by percentage point to reflect the fact that energy company have enjoy huge profit since russia ’s illegal invasion of ukraine when people ’s bill have go up it be right that we ask the energy company make those profit to contribute a little more 
 what change will the chancellor introduce in the spring statement to compensate for the growth threaten sword of damocles she have just place over the scottish fishing industry she should know but probably do not that of revenue from fishing and aquaculture come from scotland and she should know but probably do not that the fishing industry in scotland be time large for scotland ’s economy than for the uk ’s can   she explain what discussion she have with the scottish fishermen ’s federation or the scottish government before make this damaging decision 
 i be very pleased that the scottish salmon association welcome the trade deal that we secure with the eu yesterday some of the fish that be catch in uk water be sell into european market that will now benefit from the sanitary and phytosanitary deal that we have secure within that deal we have roll over the deal that the previous government secure give certainty to fisherman in scotland and across the uk we have make it easy for they to export into european market we have ensure that we can sell shellfish again into european market and we announce yesterday the £ package of measure to support coastal and fishing industry the scottish national party be now in an absurd situation where it support reform and the tories in oppose the deal with the eu 
 i welcome the chancellor ’s answer on growth she have be a strong champion of the oxford cambridge growth corridor but my constituent be concerned to know that she will lend her support to lord vallance ’s effort to join up across departments and ensure that there be the social infrastructure to support the growth my constituent worry that hospital school and road will not keep up with the ambitious pace that lord vallance be propose 
 that be an opportune question because i will be meet lord vallance this afternoon to discuss the work he be take forward on the ox cam corridor to bring more good job pay good wage not only to oxford and cambridge but crucially to the town and city in between some of the extra money we be put into capital investment will absolutely be go to support the huge growth opportunity in that part of the world 
 i call the shadow minister 
 of course the good way to improve economic growth be for this chancellor to stop punish business with high taxis within the spending review the key be to improve public sector productivity as the chancellor know of the key aspect in do that be the use of technology this government have substantial advantage over the next few year with major advance in artificial intelligence technology but those can only be capture if the treasury set clear direction for department include incentive and penalty what directive have his majesty ’s treasury give to departments to improve productivity through the adoption of artificial intelligence specifically do that advice include a requirement for the use of agentic ai during the multi year spending period 
 i think the hon gentleman be go to welcome the investment of universal studios in bedfordshire which will be a massive boon to the county ’s economy 
 on support the adoption of ai we be do key thing we be support that sector investing in the uk and the deal we secure with the us will help bring more investment into our digital sector   secondly and crucially we be improve the productivity of our public service the hon gentleman will see more about that when we publish the spending review on   june we be absolutely determined to boost productivity in the public sector after the mess in which it be leave by the conservatives 
 what step she be take through the tax system to support vulnerable family 
 the government be commit to keep taxis for work people as low as possible the personal allowance mean those earn below £ pay no tax at our budget we decide not to extend the freeze on personal tax threshold which be implement by the previous government 
 i thank the minister for his response but what short and long term assessment have ministers make of the cost to the taxpayer of the deep cut in grant for therapy for some of the most vulnerable and traumatise child in our country through the adoption and special guardianship support fund give the treasury ’s intransigence in put more money into the fund to meet rise demand it be likely that adoption and kinship care placement will fail result in more child in the care system in the short term in the long term sadly we know that care experience child be time more likely to end up with a criminal conviction there be a moral and economic case to support this fund properly 
 i very much recognise both as a constituency mp and as a minister the importance of make sure that adoptive parent can build a strong family unit with their adoptive child if i may make a broad point the only reason we can invest in public service be because of difficult decision we have take around taxation the problem with the liberal democrats and other party on the opposition benches be that they be happy to support the extra funding for public spending but not the tax rise necessary to pay for it 
 this be not an issue on which to make a party political point the reality be that a cut to the adoption and special guardianship support fund will be deeply impactful for young people who have experience significant trauma abuse neglect and so much more give that our mental health service be not fit for purpose at the moment it be imperative that we make the right investment so that those young people be not deny a life course opportunity if that fund be cut will the minister review the decision and ensure that we have the proper funding that young people need 
 as my hon friend will know spend decision be for the chief secretary of the treasury to discuss with department i make the general point that investment in mental health for instance which she mention be possible only because of the decision we   have take on taxation to ensure that we can support public spending on mental health service and on support for young people 
 what step she be take to help increase return on investment from pension saving 
 that be absolutely the right question we all understandably hear call for high rate of pension saving but the prior question be this how do we ensure that saver get the good bang for their buck for every penny they save the forthcoming pension scheme bill will help make that happen with big pension scheme and few small pension pot drive down cost and drive up save rate for pensioner 
 can the minister share with i as chair of the reconstitute all party parliamentary group on pension and growth any plan for how county that be outside mayoral authority such as staffordshire could benefit from pension reform to encourage more investment in the uk to support infrastructure job and local regeneration 
 i certainly can our reform to the local government pension scheme will support local investment in every part of england and wales our defence spending plan will be feel on the ground total defence spending in the west midland total £ a year we be build reservoir again include in the west midland we be also get the country trading once again include business in tamworth where pi kem a specialist chemical supplier recently win a major export order with £ in uk export finance support britain and tamworth be open for business 
 i want to ask about year old who be just start off be encourage to take out a pension whenever i be my mother take i down to see john thompson the pension man in ballywalter and he say you ’re go to take a pension i ask what for mum she say you ’re take a pension so i take the pension do the minister agree that what everybody really need be somebody like my mother to encourage they to take a pension 
 i do not know where that be go but i know that i speak for everybody in the house when i say that the whole country need someone like the hon gentleman ’s mother 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help increase economic growth in south yorkshire 
 what step she have take to help increase economic growth in derby 
 kick start economic growth be this government ’s no mission from the next financial year south yorkshire combine authority will receive a single flexible funding pot through its integrated settlement and the east midlands combine authority will benefit from a new advanced manufacturing and logistic park unlock up to £ of investment both area will benefit from £ of investment towards trailblazer to tackle economic inactivity 
 the speciality steel site at stocksbridge in my constituency have a strategically significant highly specialist capability to produce world lead steel that be crucial to our national defence aerospace and energy industry the site employ people and have an excellent skill training centre i welcome the government ’s £ commitment to our uk steel industry what discussion have the chancellor have with the department for business and trade to ensure that the government do everything they can to secure the british steel industry by use our domestic steel asset productively and in particular the stocksbridge speciality steel site 
 although i will not get into detailed discussion about individual company last year the government set out the £ steel fund in the budget to preserve and grow steel manufacturing in the uk in the trade deal we have secure with the us and with the eu in the last couple of week we have reduce tariff on steel export which will be good for the british steel industry 
 shockingly in derby south of adult in the community be financially vulnerable which be far above the national average of to lift people out of this vicious cycle we need a grow economy but for those who be worried about how they will make it to the next payday dread an unexpected bill or struggle to feed their family the benefit of growth can feel mile out of reach will the chancellor outline how her plan for growth will put money in people ’s pocket and deliver change for those in our struggle community 
 we will shortly publish a financial inclusion strategy as well as extend the household support fund to support some of the most vulnerable there be huge opportunity in derby as my hon friend know i be at rolls royce in derby just last week what we be do on trade deal particularly with the us hugely support our aerospace sector along with the increase spending on defence to of gdp which help to invest in great british firm and indeed in great british steel 
 i be aware that derby ’s economy be blight last november by a foul smell say to be emanate from its local water treatment work similar be true of my constituency due to the failure of southern water ’s air scrubbing system will the chancellor ensure that the spending review grant the environment agency the resource it need to crack down on smell nuisance so that the water company get a grip on the matter for the benefit of local growth and our economy 
 supplementary question must be relevant to the question on the order paper forget it 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility

 westminster be once again buzz with the late u turn speculation and briefing over the chancellor ’s policy on the winter fuel allowance and the child benefit cap there be less of a buzz for the visitor to canterbury food bank however which last month distribute enough food to make meal in a rise on the same period last year will the chancellor end the serious anxiety of those experience fuel and food poverty now and reverse those policy 
 the only reason that we have be able to grow the economy and get those cut in interest rate which help work family in canterbury and right across our country be because we have return stability to our economy that mean never make a policy commitment without be able to say where the money come from which be what get our country into a mess under the previous government we have set out the policy that we need to put investment into the nhs and secure our public finance

 in our manifesto we set out that we would not increase taxis on work people that is the income tax national insurance or vat that they pay that be why we also reverse the previous government ’s decision to increase fuel duty which would have have a disastrous effect on work people in our country we will set out all other tax policy at the budget 
 what many up and down the country be ask be why that manifesto pledge not to impose taxis on work people be break last week the pensions minister confirm to the house that the government would never interfere with the fiduciary duty of pension trustee to get the good return for their member but when the chancellor be question on that topic by bloomberg the very same day she say 
 i be never go to say never 
 this be chaos the government can not even speak with voice it be clear that the right hon lady and the pensions minister can not both be right so will she now put the record straight 
 we have secure an agreement with the big pension company to invest on a voluntary basis in uk unlisted equity and infrastructure which be something the conservatives never achieve we be get investment into british infrastructure and british business because that be the way to grow the economy and support work people 
 will my right hon friend outline the step be take in the forthcoming spending review to ensure that increase defence spending will stimulate economic growth so that supply chain company such as collins aerospace in my constituency can continue to strengthen national defence capability while boost our local economy job and quality apprenticeship

 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 yesterday the chancellor say that she understand the concern that some people have about the limit at which the winter fuel payment be remove do she therefore now agree that restrict the eligibility so tightly be a mistake 
 as the hon lady know when i become chancellor last year we inherit a £ black hole in the public finance not in some year in the future but in the financial year that we be already or month into this mean that we have to    make difficult and urgent decision to put our public finance back on a firm footing because unlike the conservatives i will never play fast and loose with the public finance 
 labour lead ipswich borough council recently announce investment to reopen the iconic grimwades building in our town centre which have be leave vacant for more than a decade this local ambition match the government ’s national initiative but challenge remain so what step be the government take to go even far and reform the unfair business rate system for good 
 we be determined to go far and fast to reform business rate which be why we will publish an update paper in the summer i be also glad that we can work with council such as ipswich to ensure that we can turn around town centre after year of conservative decline 
 with interest rate still high what assessment have the chancellor make of the number of homeowner go into mortgage arrear and the impact that be have on family right across the uk 
 we be in weekly touch with the financial conduct authority which regulate mortgage and under this government we have see interest rate cut since the election which be bring mortgage rate down for hard work people across the country 
 do the chancellor agree that interest rate cut trade deal successive quarter of growth and almost of growth announce last week show that our plan for change be work do she also agree that it be now essential that this house support the government ’s planning and infrastructure bill and other effort to boost growth and put money in the pocket of my constituent in ealing southall 
 i very much agree but what be truly extraordinary be that the conservatives reform and the scottish national party have vote against or abstain on the planning and infrastructure bill and they do not support any of the trade deal that we have secure to support work people in our country 
 my hazel grove constituent be content to pay their fair share of tax but they be understandably disappointed when his majesty ’s revenue and customs overcharge and then ghost they gail from romiley be a foster carer who be owe a tax repayment she repeatedly contact hmrc over a month period but it be only when my superstar casework team get involve that she get a £ rebate what assurance can minister give my constituent that hmrc be adequately resource to give they the support they need to pay their fair share of tax 
 i be sorry to hear about the experience of the hon lady ’s constituent to reassure she and her constituent of my priority as chair of the hmrc board be to improve hmrc ’s day to day performance we have see the percentage of telephony adviser attempt handle go from last march to this march it will remain a priority for i to modernise and digitise the service 
 the european emission trading scheme have a carbon price that be high than the uk ’s what assessment have the chancellor make of the impact of join the scheme on inflation in this country 
 as my hon friend know sometimes the uk carbon price have be high but sometimes it have be low than in the eu this deal will ensure a big market that on average bring price down we be confident that the deal secure yesterday will bring more good job and bring down bill for consumer 
 scottish council now have the power to introduce a tourism levy that have go down extremely badly with the hospitality sector in particular they fear a tax on a tax that would be vat will the government look at rating that in the event that a tourism levy be introduce 
 i want to welcome tourist to great britain and northern ireland that be why we be secure trade deal with country around the world show that we as a country be open for business in the end it be up to the scottish government which additional taxis they introduce but as with income tax the snp never take the side of ordinary work people 
 last week i raise with the minister for social security and disability the case of a local disability charity be hit by increase bank charge and the minister commit to work with i on the issue will treasury ministers do the same so that we can take these bank to task and support fantastic local organisation 
 i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that issue 
 access to banking service be a particular issue in north east fife where the limitation of the access to cash legislation be become clear will the financial inclusion committee agree to look at the financial services and markets act to ensure that we get the access to banking service that local community need 
 our government secure the commitment of the banking industry to roll out banking hub across the country have already be agree and over be open the financial inclusion committee which i chair be look at financial inclusion include digital banking and ensure that people have the bank account they need 
 i congratulate the chancellor of the exchequer on secure the mansion house accord which will channel billion into the economy and make a real difference to my constituent of the reason that pension fund agree to join the accord be because of the strong pipeline of investable project that the government be create do the minister agree that the government ’s infrastructure plan and planning reform oppose by the conservatives will unlock growth 
 my hon friend be absolutely correct raise investment in the uk be about boost not just the supply of capital but the demand for it the investment pipeline we be approve infrastructure project from wind farm to reservoir that the conservatives block for year by reform the planning system we be do something really radical building home 
 the roll out of banking hub be help to a small degree but what plan do the government have to increase the number of banking hub beyond those in the pipeline 
 as i say in my previous answer we have secure the commitment of the industry to open banking hub by the end of this parliament the fca keep the access to cash rule under review as legislate for under the last government it have the power to make rule to ensure that there be access to cash across the country 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 yesterday there be a lot of coverage of the chancellor ’s comment about the isa limit she pledge to keep it at £ but do not specify how much within that would be cash and how much would be investment can the minister reassure i that she be seriously consider the impact on the mortgage lending market of change the cash isa limit 
 as we announce in the spring statement we be look for option for isa reform to ensure that we get the balance right between cash and equity i can reassure my hon friend that we understand that cash saving be a vital tool for people and act as a financial buffer for a rainy day 
 i be sure that the chancellor subscribe to the basic principle that if the cost of something be put up we will see less of it that be   why government have over many year put taxis on thing like smoking do she accept that the principle also apply to employ people that the more expensive the government make employ people with their job tax increase nic for employer the less we will see of that 
 the conservative party be a good example of that the cost of the conservative party go up and its number of mps shrank 
 the recent report by the independent commission on neighbourhood show that of blackpool ’s population be live in high need neighbourhood with mission critical neighbourhood in my constituency blackpool be desperate for investment and economic growth will the chancellor outline what the government be do to improve growth in our forget coastal town 
 yesterday we announce £ of investment in coastal and fishing community that will be vital to ensure that those community continue to thrive 
 dorset and wiltshire fire and rescue service have suffer a real term funding cut partly because the majority of firefighter be on call so the employer national insurance contribution be not sufficiently compensate will ministers commit to review the funding formula to fit the need of community and to undertake a local impact assessment on the effect of the funding cut on public and firefighter safety 
 the government have already increase nhs spending by £ police funding by £ and fire and rescue authority funding by £ further spending will be set out in the june spending review but this be another example of a labour government deliver on the promise of change 
 to alleviate grind penury for million of people the chancellor could introduce an annual wealth tax on multimillionaire which would raise approximately £ per annum yet she refuse to entertain the idea and consider cut to welfare acceptable why do tough political choice always seem to impact the most vulnerable 
 at the budget last year we increase the rate of tax on non dom we increase capital gain tax we increase the carry interest on bonus and we introduce vat on private school this government be ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share because that be a basic labour principle 
 with permission i will update the house on the recent trade deal that we have strike in the national interest 
 however i would like to say something about the horrific situation in gaza where the level of suffering with innocent child be bomb again be utterly intolerable over the weekend we co ordinate a response with our ally as set out in my statement with president macron and prime minister carney last night i want to put on record today that we be horrify by the escalation from israel we repeat our demand for a ceasefire as the only way to free the hostage we repeat our opposition to settlement in the west bank and we repeat our demand to massively scale up humanitarian assistance to gaza the recent announcement that israel will allow a basic quantity of food into gaza be totally and utterly inadequate so we must co ordinate our response because this war have go on for far too long we can not allow the people of gaza to starve and the foreign secretary will come to the house shortly to set out our response in detail 
 let i turn now to the deal that this government have strike the principle we take into the negotiation be clear and simple do it drive down bill do it drive up job do it strengthen our border in each case the answer be a resoundingly yes these deal release we from the tired argument of the past and as an independent sovereign nation allow we to seize the opportunity of the future a clear message send across the globe that britain be back on the world stage 
 we have a trade deal with the world ’s fast grow economy india cut tariff for british industry which be a huge boost for our whisky and gin distillery their only concern now be whether they can produce enough to sell and for our car manufacturer with tariff slash from over to just and no concession on visa we have a trade deal with the world ’s rich economy the united states slash tariff save thousand upon thousand of job in car manufacturing in place like jaguar land rover protect our steel and aluminium export and safeguard the interest of our hugely important pharmaceutical sector 
 but i can already see that when it come to this hat trick of deal it be our new partnership with the eu that the opposition most want to talk about and give their abject failure to strike a deal with india or the us i can not say i blame they so let i spell out the benefit of this deal which give our country an unprecedented level of access to the eu market the good access of any nation outside the eu or european free trade association 
 i will start with our security when russian tank roll into ukraine over year ago a gauntlet be throw down and it be our responsibility to step up that be what this world demand and it be what this partnership deliver strengthen our national security through a new security and defence partnership that pave the way for british defence firm to access the eu ’s € defence fund that will support british job british wage and british livelihood 
 the partnership also increase co operation on emission trading save uk business from have to pay up to £ in eu carbon taxis once again back   british business the deal will drive down bill with increase co operation on energy because the agreement negotiate by the conservative party leave we with a more expensive way of work with our neighbour a needless rupture despite our grid be connect by undersea cable this partnership bring those system together again benefit british bill payer and boost clean british power in the north sea 
 this partnership also strengthen our border because again the previous deal leave a huge gap and weaken our ability to work together to tackle illegal migration the ultimate cross border challenge it close that gap include joint work on return prevent channel crossing and work upstream in key source and transit country co operate along the whole migration route to strengthen our hand in the fight against the vile smuggling gang it boost our co operation on law enforcement combat terrorism and serious organise crime with close operational work with agency like europol and well sharing of intelligence and datum include for the time facial imaging 
 this partnership help british holidaymaker who will be able to use e gate when they travel to europe end those huge queue at passport control it deliver for our young people because we be now on a path towards a control youth experience scheme with firm cap on number and visa control a relationship we have with so many country around the world some of which be even set up by the conservative party we should be proud to give our young people that opportunity and not for the time this government have deliver for britain ’s steel industry protect our steel export from new eu tariff and back our steel sector to the hilt 
 last but certainly not least we have a new sanitary and phytosanitary deal as promise in our manifesto which will cut the price of a weekly shop mean that there will be more money in the pocket of work people less red tape for our exporter no more lorry driver sit for hour at the border with rot food in the back and no more needless check the inevitable consequence of the conservatives policy which make it so much hard to trade even within our own market between great britain and northern ireland 
 the deal mean that british good that have long be off the menu in europe can regain their true place include shellfish which be hugely important for cornwall devon and scotland not only do our deal on fish provide stability with no increase in the amount that eu vessel can catch in british water but the new sps agreement slash cost and red tape for our export to the european market we sell of our seafood to that market so there be a huge opportunity that britain ’s fishery in which we have make a £ investment will now look to exploit 
 the reaction to this deal from business have be absolutely clear mr speaker i know you be a stickler for keep to time so i do not have time to run through the list of supportive quote from business hon member go on 
 order the prime minister be correct 
 this be not the full list but the new partnership have be back by the federation of small businesses the cbi the british retail consortium   asda morrisons salmon scotland the food drink federation the british chamber of commerce ryanair vodafone and producer of meat milk and poultry the list go on and on i wonder whether that long list of business come out in support of the deal will temper the reaction of the leader of the opposition but then again for week now she have be dismissive of the benefit of any trade deal in defiance frankly of her party ’s history it be not just the conservatives that i be talk about   the hon member for clacton nigel farage who be not here and   the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey   have both show in their own way that their party simply do not get it if your whole approach to our ally be about strike a pose you do not get to strike a deal what that mean in a world like our where deal be ever more the currency of security and justice be that you do not get to make a difference and you do not get to deliver for britain that be what this partnership mean 
 for year we be tell that this could not be do what the conservatives mean be that they could not do it we be tell that a deal with the us or india be impossible what they mean be that it be impossible for they we be tell that a choice must be make between the us and eu what they mean be that they could not do a deal with both this government can and will because we stay in the room we fight for the national interest and we put the british people these deal represent a signal that we be back on the world stage a global champion of free trade play our historic role on european security but above all they be deal that put money in the pocket of work people because that be what independent sovereign nation do i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 when labour negotiate britain lose the prime minister talk about a hat trick of deal they be own goal in the conservatives conclude the trade and co operation agreement the large and most comprehensive free trade agreement in the world we agree to come back in year with improved term this renegotiation should have be an opportunity to improve term for our country but the term be improve for the eu the prime minister can dress it up as much as he want but he have fail it be bad for bill it be bad for job and it be bad for border 
 this be not a deal make for britain this deal be make for labour ’s public relation to show labour on the world stage but it be a stitch up for our country in return for short term headline let we take the prime minister ’s abject failure by on fishing he have give away the prize most desire by eu member state and he have do so for almost nothing it be very easy to sign deal if you be prepared to give everything away for penny this deal lock out our fisherman until we be now in a bad position than the faroe islands a set of island with the population of scarborough but which get to have annual negotiation the prime minister quote some organisation that welcome his deal he do not listen to they normally but he leave out deliberately the national federation of fishermen ’s organisations have describe the deal as a surrender and a giveaway this be a prime minister who   would pay to give away his family silver why be the prime minister sell our fisherman down the river be it because they do not vote labour 
 secondly on food and agriculture the prime minister be go to pay the eu to abide by law that we have no say on while british farmer struggle with the family farm tax that his chancellor have impose on they their regulation will now be make in paris and enforce in brussels it be a total capitulation we be not in the eu and we be not at the table so can the prime minister tell we how he will ensure accountability for the hundred of regulation that he have sign this country up to 
 thirdly on energy the prime minister have shackle we to the eu ’s emission trading scheme that mean that the government can no long cut energy cost without the eu ’s permission it will also unravel part of the india free trade agreement that he have just negotiate this be not a technicality it be a betrayal the house should be in no doubt that this mean high bill more pain and less flexibility 
 fourthly on the prime minister ’s manifesto promise he say that we would not rejoin the single market he promise no new payment and that he would protect british interest that promise have last about as long as his commitment to protect pensioner winter fuel allowance he say whatever be need to win power and now he will say whatever be need to keep it even if it mean sell out our sovereignty our business and the public 
 the truth be that most of what be announce yesterday be not a deal there be no bind agreement on anything most of the item outline be simply agreement to enter into further discussion which we be already have the prime minister be boast that we will now avoid airport queue because we will get access to eu e gate it sound great except it be not true some airport already allow that and this deal do not guarantee it anywhere as each country still have to agree that sum up this deal perfectly it be a lot of spin to disguise the terrible substance 
 have previously rule out a youth mobility scheme the prime minister be now desperately try to hide his late u turn by rebrande the scheme as an experience that be risible we have no detail on any cap or time limit which beg the question why be the government talk about increase migration before they have get a grip on the small boat or the legal migration system i know that the prime minister do not like answer question but people out there want to know can we have some honesty about what have be discuss how many young european worker do the prime minister think would be acceptable and will they be able to bring dependant 
 even the defence commitment in this deal be hopelessly side we be make payment but the eu be offer dialogue and consultation this be a pitiful return for the country that lead nato in europe and have troop on the ground in estonia defend our ally can the prime minister tell we why there be not a single word in his statement about the money that we will now be send to brussels can he set out how much those payment will cost taxpayer in government detail matter and so do honesty laughter labour member be laugh but this be a bad deal for the country look at they this be how they laugh at the budget they have no idea what it be that they have   sign up to the prime minister say that he would stay out of the single market he be go into the single market for agrifood electricity and energy he say that he would stay out of the custom union but he be accept eu tariff rule how do he plan to stop the eu change they to our disadvantage he have no idea and neither do any of they 
 the british people know when they be be mislead they know that headline fail the prime minister do not listen to the cbi on the job tax and he do not listen to the federation of small businesses on the family farm tax this deal have already unravel the damage be become clear and the political consequence will be huge and here he be trumpet his success when he stand up in a moment he will deflect dismiss and distract but we all know the truth this be a fiction of a speech a fraud of a deal and a failure of a prime minister 
 oh dear that be just such an unserious response the right hon lady say that detail matter in government they matter in opposition as well the sps agreement cut red tape and bureaucracy for all food and agricultural product go to the eu it be a massive boost for our supermarket our farmer and other why be it that all the supermarket have come out behind this deal because they know how important the sps agreement be it be completely in our favour there be a huge amount of detail there it be the good agreement 
 on defence and security we have great operational co ordination and the right hon lady be against it at a time like this it open the gate to the eu defence procurement fund of € that be a condition of the deal she complain about emission hon member how much i will tell you how much business be go to pay £ a year in tariff that they will not now pay that be why they be come out in support of the deal that be how much the detail matter 
 on energy we be already connect but we be not use that energy connection we have electrical access to the market on steel we be get rid of the tariff that will support british steel but the right hon lady be against that yet again she say that e gates access be already in existence this deal clear the way for e gates access that be the huge difference it make interruption if any conservative members doubt that they should travel across a border today and see the long queue 
 on law enforcement we have well operational work with europol and the right hon lady be against it we have information sharing on facial mapping and deal with criminal record and she be against it she be absolutely unserious she be also against the india deal which of course do huge thing for trade in sector such as whisky where their only concern be whether they can produce enough they have be absolutely clear about support the india deal a deal that the conservatives try to do and she now say that she be against it 
 we have the us deal which save thousand upon thousand of job in car manufacturing and at jaguar land rover i do not know whether the right hon lady have the chance to make that trip to jlr but she really   ought to before she respond like that again the us deal reduce tariff on steel so that our steel can be sell to america and support our whisky and gin and she be against it she be against every single deal she be the only ex trade secretary who be against every single deal these deal have be welcome broadly because they be good deal you do not get a great long list of endorsement from all the business association and company for no—[interruption the conservatives be so unserious they be lose in a descent into the abyss they use to be a proud party of trading agreement and they have slide off into the abyss that be where they be 
 on fishing none of the right negotiate by the conservatives have be remove there be no change in access for coastal community which be the same as before there be no reduction in the british quota or increase in the eu quota they be the same as before we have reciprocal arrangement which be the same as before what be new be have the sps agreement for the time and it be permanent they be unable to do that it reopen the eu market for shellfish and make it much easy to sell british fish to our large trading partner that be hugely significant because of british fish be trade into eu market and it be now easy to do that we be back that with £ through our fishing and coastal grant the leader of the opposition talk about the youth experience scheme that scheme be cap it be time limit and it be balance 
 in relation to standard the truth be this we be currently align in our standard but we do not get the benefit of that we want to continue to have high standard that be what the british public want and it be what this deal deliver we will have a role in shape any future rule and application of they be specifically subject to our constitutional arrangement we will have a process in this parliament to apply the rule but to be clear we be already apply those rule at the moment we be just not get the advantage this deal strip that away it be good for our country and good for our economy and it be a shame that the leader of the opposition can not stand up and support it 
 i call the chair of the business and trade committee 
 this deal be good for business and good for britain i congratulate the prime minister on embrace a good half of the select committee ’s recommendation which if i might say so be agree on a cross party basis while some in this house be propose trade barrier the prime minister be build trade bridge and that be in the national interest 
 we have a deal but we do not have a date the office for budget responsibility can not score the gain business can not plan for the benefit and we can not suspend custom check in northern ireland until we know when the new sps check will come into force what timetable have the prime minister give his negotiator for when that sps deal will come into effect business need certainty and for that we need clarity 
 let i pick up on my right hon friend ’s point about the cross party support of the select committee there be conservative members   who i think be ashamed by the response of the leader of the opposition and know very well that these be good deal that should be support a number of her back bench mp be already come out and say that these deal be good and in the national interest hon member who you know who they be 
 i assure my right hon friend that we have move at pace to get the deal and our instruction to our team now be to move at pace to implement they that be what we will do we negotiate these deal in a short number of month and we will keep move at the same pace 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark about the appalling situation in gaza when he be work with our french and canadian colleague to put pressure on netanyahu will he consider with the french formally recognise the state of palestine 
 turn to the eu reset deal the prime minister know that we do not think this deal go far enough to fix our broken relationship with europe but there be many part of it that we welcome we have long be argue for an agrifood deal to help british farmer export to europe for a youth mobility scheme to give our young people incredible new opportunity and british business especially in hospitality a boost and for close alliance on defence in the face of putin ’s imperialism and trump ’s unpredictability i welcome the progress on those issue even if there be only very limited progress on thing such as youth mobility 
 we have all see the terrible damage cause by the conservatives brexit deal and hear the conservative leader complain today be like listen to a backseat driver who previously crash the car our country have move on from the divisive brexit war of a decade ago and some member of this house need to do the same however do the prime minister accept that this deal must be only the step and that we must be far more ambitious in strengthen our economic and security tie with our near neighbour we believe that a bespoke customs union be a key part of that not turn back to the past but form a new partnership that serve our national interest i know that the prime minister once make that a red line but he will accept that the world have change since then so will he open negotiation on a custom union to get a well deal for britain a trade deal to dwarf all other trade deal 
 on the right hon gentleman ’s question about this deal be a step it be intend that this be the beginning of a process to complete what we have already agree we also intend to have annual summit so that we can take our co operation and co ordination far step by step and we will do that while keep to the red line in our manifesto 
 on the question of a custom union the problem with the right hon gentleman ’s proposal as i know he know be that we have just strike deal with india and the us if we now undo that good work we undo all the benefit of those deal for jlr and other car manufacturer this be the here and now of their job at the moment that be why we have our red line and keep to those red line and i be not prepared to rip up the benefit that we have negotiate in those deal 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs select committee 
 i begin by thank the prime minister for what he have say about gaza the message he be send to netanyahu ’s far right government could not be clear and it should have the unanimous support of this house it be essentially this must stop 
 turn to the grow up eu deal which come hard on the heel of the other recent trade agreement the government be rightly confident that those deal will be popular and will provide great benefit to our country as such i ask the prime minister this why not take this opportunity to fix a glaring hole in our democracy and simply put those agreement to a vote allow they to be scrutinise by this place i can assure he that they will be pass 
 as my right hon friend know there be a process for implement any agreement all of these agreement will require legislation and therefore they will go through the house on that basis 
 can i just point out to the prime minister that nothing can undo the fact that people vote leave they vote to take back control of our law and stop pay money to the eu that be a considerably large number than the people who vote labour at the last election but now the prime minister be submit to eu regulation without any control and start to pay money back to the european union he be give up control over our law and restore payment to the european union he will pay a bitter political price for this betrayal 
 the hon gentleman know full well that we have red line about not rejoin the eu no single market no custom union and no freedom of movement we be tell that it be impossible to negotiate a well deal with the eu with those red line but we have just do it we have also show that we be outside the eu because as the hon gentleman will appreciate have deal with india and the us be inconsistent with membership of the eu there could be no well evidence that we be not go back into the eu nor be these negotiation on that basis i know that the hon gentleman understand that well so i be surprised at the way in which he have put his question 
 as for control of border net migration quadruple after brexit to nearly a that be not control our border it be a complete lack of control by the conservative party on the question of payment it be important to appreciate that we have achieve unprecedented access to eu market without the budgetary payment of member state that be an incredible achievement the only payment under the sps agreement be administrative to support the relevant cost of implement and administer the scheme for scheme and payment where it be in our national interest we will negotiate proportionate contribution as already happen under the deal negotiate by the conservatives for example in relation to research and development and horizon the hon gentleman know all that very well 
 i call the chair of the treasury committee 
 i congratulate the prime minister on this achievement on top of great trade deal this be important if we be try to deliver growth in the economy could the prime minister outline what he think the or main gain be to boost the economy in short order so that we can build the public spending that we so badly need 
 our approach have be on the question of bring our bill down which be why the sps agreement be so important and of protect and drive up job which be why the eu india and us agreement be all so important that be particularly the case for car manufacturing but equally so for pharmaceutical which be protect under our agreement however there be a big picture these be individual trade deal but take together they show that other country want to do deal with the uk now in a way that they do not before 
 with youth unemployment higher in europe in country such as france spain portugal and sweden i can see why the eu push for a youth mobility scheme to help get its youth unemployment figure down can the prime minister tell the house what impact assessment he have do of his youth scheme what effect will it have on youth unemployment among young brit particularly white working class boy who suffer the most can he also tell the house today what cap he have put on the number of people come to the uk if he can not this be a bitter betrayal of british youth 
 the agreement give young people in the united kingdom the opportunity to work to study and to travel in europe it will be a cap scheme of limited duration and with visa this again be something that everyone say we could not negotiate and we have negotiate it as for the right hon lady ’s question about what we be do for young people in this country she should look to the trailblazer scheme that we set up to help young people back into work 
 will the prime minister join i in invite conservative member to celebrate the restoration of access to our british shellfisher and the reduction in friction on the of our british seafood that be export to the eu will he encourage those conservative members to get out there and help we to deploy the £ of fishing and coastal community funding that we have unlock 
 under the conservatives deal shellfish be lock out but it can now be sell back into the market which be hugely important to place such as cornwall that be why their response to this be so uncertain and if i may say so un tory 
 on separate occasion since the beginning of the year i have ask the paymaster general about plan for a youth mobility scheme and every single time he have tell i that labour have no plan i realise that i be in error and should have ask about a youth experience scheme but let i ask the prime minister now whether he have a timescale for when such a scheme can be put into   operation and we can start to see the benefit that liberal democrats know it can bring to young people here in the uk and across the eu 
 we have move apace to get this far but we now need to move apace to implement what we agree yesterday so we will be do that and we will update the house as we do so 
 i congratulate the prime minister and his colleague on their success at the summit the government ’s hard work have pay off this be a good deal and a good step business will benefit from a reduction in red tape and consumer will see low bill in the long run the announcement on youth experience and erasmus+ will be welcome by the many young people in my constituency i also welcome the recognition of the value of tour artist in both the eu and the uk i realise that the barrier to tour be complex but will the pm commit himself to keep up the hard work so we can begin to reduce and break down those barrier 
 my hon friend have raise an important point about tour artist we be absolutely committed to secure a well deal for they and that will be part of the ongoing work as we move forward from this summit to the next 
 i think the front benches need to calm the jet a wee bit this be obviously not a surrender just as it be obviously no substitute for membership of the european union nor indeed be it as the prime minister have say repeatedly today provide unprecedented access to the eu market that be simply absurd 
 the deal do provide for co operation on carbon storage so will the prime minister build on that good work by commit his government to provide the financial support that be necessary to take forward the acorn project in the north east of scotland 
 the deal do allow we to move forward on renewable and carbon capture as part of the package around renewable which be why it be so important across the united kingdom but particularly in scotland because of the potential for job opportunity there so of course we will press on in that regard i would gently ask the right hon gentleman to consider again why he should not support this deal for the benefit of the whisky sector in scotland and give that yesterday salmon scotland come out hugely in favour of it he should stand up and support the work that we be do 
 my constituency be home to the world ’s old biscuit factory carr ’s have be make table water cracker ginger nut and custard cream for many decade and in about year time it will celebrate year in business can the prime minister say more about the importance of this deal to food and drink business such as pladi which own and operate the carr ’s biscuit factory 
 for food for biscuit and all the content cover by the sps agreement this deal be a massive step forward it get rid of the red tape and   bureaucracy that cost each business thousand upon thousand of pound this be good for biscuit good for business 
 may i have a serious answer to a very narrow and specific question we know how many fishing right the prime minister be prepared to give away for how many year in order to accede to the eu ’s demand but how much uk taxpayer money be he willing to hand over to the eu in order to sign up to its protectionist demand 
 i remind the right hon lady that nothing that be negotiate on fishing by the previous government have be give away quite the contrary on cost i give a full answer early we be not pay into the eu budget in the way that eu member do and that be why this unprecedented access be so important in relation to scheme and programme yes we will make a proportionate contribution on the same basis with the same principle that the conservative party the then government negotiate the current arrangement on horizon and research and development it be hard to see why have negotiate those arrangement it be now suddenly against they 
 the energy industry be central to our mission for growth but it be also important to our tackling of the generational challenge that be climate change this be a sentiment feel in my constituency which be proud to be a regional hub of carbon capture and hydrogen storage will the prime minister explain how the deal support the energy industry so that we can pursue the growth bring down energy bill and tackle climate change 
 it do so in way it make permanent the energy chapter in the current deal and it go beyond that to allow we to co operate and co ordinate more closely on energy we have the ability for connection already but we can now take well advantage of it 
 successive governments and successive parliaments have cause unnecessary and at time intolerable damage to our union we recognise the reduction in some check on some issue but can the prime minister explain why if animal and animal product be now suitable to come to northern ireland free of check the european union be still intent on ban the very veterinary medicine that be take by those animal if standard be the same in the united kingdom and the european union and this parliament have already decide that ce marking will be retain why be product and manufacture good not part of the arrangement will the prime minister confirm to this parliament that it be his intention to rid northern ireland of the windsor framework and to get rid of the barrier within our union 
 as the right hon gentleman will know the sps agreement that we have negotiate for the uk as a whole be good for northern ireland because it complement the current sps agreement for northern ireland that it come up against that will be a huge step forward for northern ireland which i know he   care about and other care about and i care about it be among the advantage of the sps deal that we have strike 
 i do understand the issue of veterinary medicine and we be work to resolve the problem that the right hon gentleman have rightly describe i think we be in a well position to resolve it by co operate and co ordinating with the eu which be what we be do on the windsor framework it be important that we implement the agreement that we have in place because the blunt truth be that no will make further agreement with a country that walk away from agreement that it have already put in place
