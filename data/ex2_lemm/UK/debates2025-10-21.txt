the simple answer be yes my hon friend be absolutely right on his point what we should all seek to be do throughout this be to try to grease the wheel so that we can have the good possible inquiry we should all be seek to do that while hold people to account with as much scrutiny as be need i will absolutely do that and obviously i have meet lord hanson a number of time get mandatory reporting right be vital and much like in the survivor group there be different view on either side 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the vaccine damage payment scheme 
 i reiterate my deep sympathy to all those who have experience harm follow vaccination and to their family i recognise many of the concern that campaigner have raise regard the vaccine damage payment scheme their input will shape our ongoing consideration of reform to the scheme and i will keep parliament update as appropriate 
 my constituent kelly hatfield sadly lose her father ken purnell as a result of the covid-19 vaccination the family receive a vaccine damage payment yet the sum which have not increase since fall short of the loss trauma and long term financial impact on these family will the minister explain why that off payment have not be inflation adjust and will she commit to review its adequacy and fairness 
 the vaccine damage payment scheme be not a compensation scheme but a off payment it be important to state that as i have say we recognise that there be concern which campaigner have raise and their input be shape our ongoing consideration of reform to the scheme all vaccine in the uk be authorise by the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency which be an independent body recognise globally for its high safety standard this labour government base our decision on scientific fact unlike reform which have still not apologise for platforme dangerous anti vax conspiracy theory i can only assume that it be less interested in protect people than it be in alarm folk for political advantage 
 what step he be take to help improve the performance of the most underperforming nhs trust 
 this government have invest an extra £ in the nhs deliver more appointment in our year and cut waiting list by more than we be also tackle the nhs postcode lottery patient should not have to wait long for bad care because of where they live our new nhs league table shine a light on the poor performer so they receive the extra support and accountability need to turn they around the good leader be be send into the most challenge trust to turn they around fail manager will have their pay dock and persistent failure will lead to restriction on board as we see in leeds this week we will not tolerate failure 
 in telford and wide shropshire we know that the nhs have an absolute mountain to climb after year of underperformance we have begin that journey with fall waiting time increase government investment and plan for telford ’s ever cancer treatment unit will the secretary of state ensure that trust that show sign of improvement be back to catch up with the rest and continue their improvement particularly with investment in technology research and infrastructure 
 absolutely my hon friend deserve real credit for championing telford and shropshire and help to get the trust the investment it need he be right that local service have not be good enough for a number of year we will not turn a blind eye to that failure we will do something about it there be a long way to go but we have already deliver an extra appointment and cut waiting list by over at his local trust since the general election so a lot do but lot more to do 
 i see the health secretary be have a bust up with the chancellor over who pay his £ redundancy bill for break up nhs england will he guarantee that once he have resolve his difference with the chancellor not a single penny will be take from deliver frontline health and social care service or from underperform nhs trust to pay for make staff redundant 
 the hon gentleman should not believe everything he read in the newspaper i make no apology for try to cut unnecessary bureaucracy in large national organisation to redeploy saving to frontline service his government really should have take a leaf out of our book 
 the secretary of state need look no far than homerton university hospital in hackney for good performance it have manage to increase productivity by over what be he do to support great leader who deliver great progress and to make sure that they have the funding they need to continue with that 
 i be delighted to meet my hon friend only recently to hear about the really impressive productivity gain be make at her local trust i be keen to learn more we need to incentivise and reward leader for that kind of outstanding performance and we also need to get some of that good practice to some of our poor performing trust 
 oxford university hospital trust be of just trust that do not provide givinostat for duchenne through the early access programme last week i attend a roundtable at which of my constituent alex advocate on behalf of his son ben who be not get the treatment we discuss lesson learn from the early access programme will the secretary of state meet i duchenne uk and the all party parliamentary group on access to medicine and medical device so that we can share those lesson with he 
 i have have the privilege of meet some of the campaigner and particularly the young people affect by that cruel condition and i understand the hon gentleman ’s frustration i know that the medication be be put through the national institute for health and care excellence process and i hope that that will deliver a positive outcome i would be delighted to keep he apprise of progress 
 can i just suggest to members that their supplementary question should relate to the table question that would be helpful i call the shadow minister 
 with report of over £ in cost for integrate care board redundancy and the chief executive officer of nhs england warning that service could have to move to plan b could the secretary of state set out what plan b be 
 we be absolutely committed to deliver the transformation that we have outline and we be work with icb leader and nhs leader to do that in a timely way those saving will deliver well value for money and enable we to redeploy resource to the frontline where they belong 
 i thank the secretary of state for his answer but waiting list have rise for successive month now doctor be on strike gps be in formal dispute with the government and the icb be cut of their staff and do not have £ to pay for it all while the nhs year plan have be publish but with no delivery chapter when will the secretary of state come to the house with the delivery plan for the nhs year plan 
 not only have the conservatives fail to get in the news but they have clearly not be read it either there have be no doctor strike in the nhs since before the summer and we have sit down with resident doctor and their new leadership to try to avert future strike action the hon gentleman be right to point out that the action take by the previous committee unnecessary and irresponsible as it be have impact on waiting list in the last few month as have high level of demand than anticipate i say that by way of explanation by the way not by way of excuse i be determined to make sure that we hit our target as outline in the government ’s plan for change and i think he will find that in the come month we will be back on track and well on course to achieve something that the conservatives fail to do when they have the chance 
 what step his department be take to improve maternity and neonatal care 
 i be deeply concerned by the state of maternity care that we inherit in the nhs that be why i have ask baroness amos to chair an independent investigation into nhs maternity and neonatal service family deserve truth and justice there must be accountability for failing and service must improve i be commit to do whatever it take to provide patient and baby with safe comfortable and dignified care 
 i should also inform the house that this week i have announce an inquiry into failing at the leeds teach hospital trust i be work with the family affect to agree on a chair and term of reference and i will keep the house update on next step 
 pregnancy can be a worrying time for any expectant parent and know they can access their gp to see a person face to face be hugely important that be deny to my constituent hayley johnson who sadly go on to lose her baby evelyn when she be deliver in an emergency at week and day due to a huge misdiagnosis give over the phone with regard to maternity support specifically what be the minister do to ensure that excellent maternity care be deliver in local community so that that never happen to another family and that when the very bad do happen and parent be suffer the loss of a baby the support also extend to bereavement counselling 
 i thank my hon friend for the work she be do to campaign for well support in this space and for raise these tragic case not just today but in her powerful contribution to last week ’s debate she be right to say that gps be critical for support woman during pregnancy provide compassionate physical and mental health care and signpost relevant service which be why continuity be important i be happy to report to she that in term of mental health and bereavement support a record number of woman access a specialist community perinatal mental health service or maternal mental health service in the month to july but clearly there be much more to do we have announce a £ package for bespoke perinatal mental health and parent infant relationship support as part of the continuation of the family hub and start for life programme but as we hear in last week ’s debate although a lot have be do there be so much more to do 
 safe maternity care depend on adequate staffing and we on these benches have be call for well recruitment and retention of staff in woman ’s health service for a long time now can the secretary of state outline what specific measure the government be take to address the shortage of midwife and specialist neonatal nurse across england 
 we need to make sure that there be well staffing and that we have the right people in the right place i should just caution the house though   because in recent year there have be an increase in staffing but not a corresponding increase in the quality of care so we have to make sure we be look at this issue in a nuanced way it be about have the right staff in the right place at the right time to deliver safe maternity and perinatal service and that be exactly what we will do 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 our maternity ward be in a state of crisis with death and injury rise at an alarming rate sadly this issue be not confine to shropshire and there have be a steady drumbeat of maternity scandal with review after review find consistent failing across the nhs can the secretary of state explain to i and the many mother i have meet who have face tragedy and unacceptable trauma why the government be cut national service development funding ringfence funding to improve maternity care by more than and why the immediate and essential action from the ockenden review into the failing at shrewsbury and telford hospital trust which be to be implement nationwide be still not in place more than year later 
 we really be not what we have do be devolve funding and responsibility to local level which we think be the right thing to do if i may say so it be quite irresponsible to suggest that maternity funding and funding for service have be cut in the way that the hon lady describe i think it cause unnecessary concern we be take into account the recommendation make by donna ockenden as well as a wide range of other review and inquiry as part of baroness amos ’s rapid investigation because i like the hon member want to see rapid improvement in maternity service across the country 
 whether he have make an assessment of the potential merit of increase ringfenced nhs funding for child ’s hospice to £ by 
 child ’s hospice provide crucial support but for too long they have face the cliff edge of annual funding cycle i be really proud that we have provide certainty with a year funding settlement of £ give child ’s hospice the stability and predictability they need to plan properly and focus on care for seriously ill child and their family and love one i be sure that the hon member will join i in welcome the certainty that we have deliver for the sector 
 i absolutely welcome the government ’s announcement last week that funding for child ’s hospice will be extend for the next year and will rise in line with inflation julia ’s house be such hospice that serve family in my constituency however child ’s hospice still face challenge in access funding from local nhs body and council address workforce shortage and hold integrate care board to account for the way in which they commission child ’s palliative care so what reassurance   can the minister give that child ’s hospice will benefit from sustainable financial support both now and in the future 
 i be delighted that julia ’s house hospice receive £ from the allocation i be sure that be very welcome to the staff and the family it be also worth note that of the £ allocation that we make to capital funding £ go to child ’s hospice that be an increase on top of what we have just be talk about of course there be challenging time for funding but we have also provide the sector with a huge amount of certainty and stability 
 this funding be welcome but hospice such as mountbatten in my area be still make cut because of the budgetary choice that the chancellor make and icb practice this be a multi year funding settlement but multi year funding settlement need to be long will the minister commit to include all hospice in a long multi year funding settlement for stability in the sector 
 i find it quite extraordinary that opposition members come to this house and lecture we on the sustainability of funding give the way in which they crash the economy and leave we in a dire fiscal position i would have hop that the hon gentleman would welcome the fact that rather than the annual funding cliff edge that they leave for vital child ’s hospice service we have move to a year funding settlement his criticism beggar belief 
 what progress his department have make on the implementation of the new hospital programme 
 the conservative government ’s promise of new hospital by be a fantasy there be no funding beyond last march in january we publish a realistic plan that put the programme on a credible and sustainable footing we be commit to deliver all the scheme in the programme and be move at pace with funding in place for design work construction activity and business case development 
 the conservatives still have not apologise for the appalling state that they leave our nhs in torbay hospital be the old hospital in the united kingdom it have a tower block wreathe in scaffold to stop bit of it fall off rather than it be under repair and it have sewage leak throughout sadly it need significant investment which have be kick into the long grass a senior manager describe the situation only this week as dire will the minister meet i and hospital representative to explore how we can achieve the investment to turn this round 
 the hon member make an excellent point it be echo by lord darzi in his report about the state of our hospital and i know many hon member have similar problem i have visit many such hospital and would be happy to discuss the matter with he far i remind he that of course the   torbay and south devon nhs foundation trust have be provide with £ from the estate safety fund for work at the hospital and we be absolutely committed to ensure that it will be develop in line with the programme 
 what recent progress he have make on reorganise the nhs 
 we be put the final nail in the coffin of the   hon member ’s party ’s disastrous lansley reorganisation so bad that it make i become an mp we be abolish the world ’s big quango nhs england along with other body the question be why do the conservatives not do that when they have the chance 
 yesterday i meet lila a form student at coombe dean school who raise the issue of long waiting list for mental health service for child and young people across devon what action have be take as a result of the government ’s policy of reorganise the nhs to reduce the unacceptable delay in mental health diagnosis and treatment for child and young people particularly in constituency such as south west devon 
 all of we as constituency mp be fully aware of the state of mental health service particularly for young people which be why my hon friend the minister for care be work at pace on our manifesto commitment to support young people particularly through school we also understand the difficulty that her icb in particular have with its financial situation something we be also target as part of our reform to ensure that icb develop service for local people in line with the expectation that we have set they 
 likewise in york child and adolescent mental health service be just not work for child who be leave on waiting list often with no management or treatment in order really to achieve reorganisation in our nhs would our government look at local authority commission mental health service to deliver such service and to meet the holistic need of young child ’s development and mental health wellbeing 
 again i echo comment on the state of mental health service as the hon member have do as it say in our manifesto we be commit to those extra mental health support worker in local area such as her it be important that commissioner work closely with their local authority on mental health service and i know my hon friend the minister for care be ensure that that happen as part of the reform we be undertake 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be concerned that the disruption cause by an uncoste unplanned simultaneous reorganisation of   nhs england and the icbs be affect patient care before the summer the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation recommend that the rsv vaccine should be give to those over and those in adult care home in july i ask the secretary of state to confirm that this vaccine will be available in time for the winter season and he say 
 i can certainly reassure the shadow minister on this ”—[official report   july vol c. 
 the winter vaccine programme start week ago why have he not deliver on his promise 
 we have 
 as my right hon friend have just say we have deliver on that commitment the hon member talk about the reorganisation be a distraction if her party have focus taxpayer money on patient service rather than ballooning bureaucracy with cost increase both among provider and through icb we would not have inherit the mess that we do and would be able to roll out programme more effectively we have commit to do that 
 i thank the hon lady for her answer but i would like she to check and perhaps update the guidance for gps and the website that continue to say that it be only available to year old who turn after   september which be not all people over the age of 
 reorganisation be affect delivery elsewhere too the secretary of state also promise that the continue roll out of fracture liaison service would be of his priority how many new fracture liaison service have open since the general election 
 on the hon lady ’s point this government unlike the previous government do believe in expert and we follow the clinical advice that we be give on her point as she be so keen on read our manifesto commitment the commitment be to do that by it be currently our reform to icb and provider bring nhs england inside the department of health and social care to make it more democratically accountable for taxpayer will reverse the shocking increase in funding that the previous government put into a leaky bucket we be fix the foundation of the nhs we be target resource at people in line with our year plan 
 what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of nhs online on wait time 
 the nhs online hospital will connect patient with clinician anywhere in england through the nhs app it will deliver up to appointment in its year time more than the average nhs trust finally bring the nhs into the digital age we be cut waiting time and provide patient with more choice and convenience 
 the wellbeing of our nation ’s young people remain in crisis with in have a probable mental health condition and the number be refer to emergency mental health care continue to rise in community like mine in croydon east where young people be wait month and sometimes even year for help family be desperate for support how will nhs online help young people access the mental health support they need and what impact will it have on reduce the waiting time for child and adolescent mental health service 
 i thank my hon friend for bring this crucial issue to light early access to high quality support be critical for young people struggle with their mental health that be back by we with an extra £ this year we be hire more staff expand support team in school and boost support in new young futures hub so that child can get the good possible start in life although initially not focus on camhs the scope of the nhs online hospital be a personal priority for the prime minister and have the capacity to grow and we will consider incorporate it when safely able to alongside other service 
 whatever the impact of these new online service the opposition front bench team have draw attention to the fact that waiting list in england have rise for the last month i can inform the house this morning that waiting list in scotland be come down would the minister like to explain why that be the case 
 i be so glad the hon gentleman take the time to ask that question because while we invest in digital service scotland and scottish patient be still wait for the most basic digital infrastructure while we invest record amount in scotland ’s budget the snp ’s excuse keep rise what he need to answer be why scottish patient be live in a digital desert while patient here in england be get more and more sophisticated nhs digital service 
 what step his department be take to reduce the time take for cancer diagnosis 
 this government be invest an extra £ in the nhs open up community diagnostic centre at evening and weekend and deliver more appointment to catch cancer early we be make progress more patient have already have cancer diagnose or rule out within the day target compare with the previous year a lot do and a lot more to do 
 a local teacher go to her gp with clear symptom of a facial tumour but be tell it be simply the effect of age it take almost year to receive a confirm diagnosis include month lose in the system after an urgent referral do the minister agree that reduce time for cancer diagnosis must start with strengthen system to support early recognition and   follow up so that no be leave wait i wish the minister well with her own cancer battle and thank she for bravely share her experience of live with cancer 
 i thank my hon friend for her question and her well wish we be take cancer detection seriously in general practice and there be work to do it be why we have recently launch jess ’s rule which be a patient safety initiative that mean when patient return time with worsen or undiagnosed symptom gps must reflect review and rethink that could include a opinion episodic continuity of care or order additional test i wish her constituent the very good and offer she my sympathy in her diagnosis 
 the government claim that they wish to reduce nhs waiting time but i have write confirmation from the government that they have slash funding for community diagnostic centre the consequence of labour ’s funding cut mean that brand new facility such as those at queen mary ’s hospital in sidcup for which i secure £ of funding from the last conservative government can now open only day per week will the minister urgently review that funding cut so that more patient in bexley and across the uk can get their diagnostic quicker 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question but i think he might be mistake we be open more cdc than ever before i have lose count of the amount of cdc we have be invite to open and we be make sure that people have access to diagnostic in their community from hospital to community with the most access that there have be for some year 
 what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the increase in employer ’s national insurance contribution on general practice 
 thank to the decision take by the chancellor at the budget we be invest an extra £ in general practice the big increase in a decade that funding have allow we to recruit an extra gps agree a contract for the time in year and introduce online access do the hon member welcome that investment or would she cut it 
 gps surgery across the weald of kent include in woodchurch and charing tell i how much they struggle with rise staff cost and the national insurance increase in last year ’s budget put huge pressure on they alongside the investment that the hon gentleman just mention what discussion have he or his colleague from the department of health and social care have with treasury colleague about protect gp partnership from further ni burden in the upcoming budget 
 again i find it extraordinary that conservative members have the brass neck to ask those kind of question they create the mess and now they be criticise we it be a bit like the arsonist heckle the firefighter patient satisfaction in general   practice have rise from last year to this year and the proportion of patient report difficulty contact their practice have fall from in july to in may we be just get start and i do not hear the hon lady welcome the investment 
 what step his department be take to support people with acute myeloid leukaemia 
 this government be commit to improve survival for blood cancer include acute myeloid leukaemia we be raise awareness deliver more research and improve early diagnosis blood cancer be the big cancer killer and the most common cancer in the uk that be why we be committed to develop a national cancer plan with patient at its heart cover the cancer plan from referral and diagnosis to treatment and ongoing care have consult with key stakeholder and patient group i confirm that that plan will be publish early in the new year 
 i thank the minister for her response my constituent ruth wake who live in brewood be tragically diagnose with acute myeloid leukaemia in january last year she have go through chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant and while she have make good process and be in remission sadly the stem cell transplant have fail after and a half month under the current rule if it fail in under a year she can not have a stem cell transplant i know the pressure that the minister be under in term of her time but my constituent have so little time could she look at this particular case and also look at guideline from the national institute for health and care excellence which be write over year ago science and treatment have move so rapidly and i wonder if the minister could look at both those point 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question and offer my good wish to his constituent ruth in her treatment i thank he for bring her story to my attention i really do appreciate perhaps more than most the urgency of the matter although i be unable to comment on individual case i understand that of my ministerial colleague will be write to the right hon gentleman directly on this matter in the very near future 
 this week we learn about the incredible result of the galleri trial which allow the early identification of many tumour by look at dna circulate in the blood indeed i be a volunteer in this trial will the secretary of state join i in recognise the central importance of medical research 
 absolutely the new progress particularly around circulate tumour dna be really interesting and we be move forward with more investment in research so that we can bring forward more such treatment 
 what recent step he have take to increase access to gp appointment 
 what step his department be take to improve patient access to gps 
 we strengthen the nhs front door with £ for general practice the big cash increase in over a decade we promise to recruit an extra gps in our year we recruit patient be now able to request appointment online which be a huge step towards deliver our manifesto commitment to end the am scramble 
 great western park have add home to didcot in my oxfordshire constituency and valley park which be under construction will add more however the new gp surgery promise in remain a barren patch of land and exist facility can not cope the integrated care board be supportive but progress have stall due to nhs england ’s involvement do the secretary of state agree with i that integrate care board should have the authority to direct primary care funding and will he meet i to help to unblock the new gp surgery my constituent desperately need 
 let i come back to the hon gentleman after i have find out what have go wrong in this case as he point out icb be responsible for commission planning secure and monitor gp service within their health system through delegate responsibility from nhs england and capital be allocate to icb on a basis that take account of annual population growth i can understand his frustration and that of his constituent so let i find out what have go wrong and come back to he 
 after year of a conservative government poor access to gps be something that we have come to know well in certain area of my constituency of sherwood forest in hucknall demand for gp appointment be overwhelming to the point that practice have have to close its online system promise of a super healthcare system be make by the previous government but never deliver meanwhile local ashfield independent politician have disgracefully use this as a political football do the secretary of state agree with i that there have be far too much talk and not enough action and that it be now time that both the integrate care board and ashfield district council deliver on this 
 it be of no surprise to i that my hon friend raise yet another example of conservative broken promise and the hot air that come from independent who have all the luxury of be commentator but none of the responsibility of ever have to deliver anything i would be happy to meet she to look into what have go wrong here this have go on for far too many year and i can well understand her frustration 
 what step he be take to ensure that frontline nhs service be support follow the potential introduction of new public private partnership contract 
 let i be clear this government will always protect the nhs and have the service free at the point of use for everyone this government be determined to shift health out of hospital and into the community as set out in the year plan and neighbourhood health service will be fundamental to deliver this shift so it be right that we look at a range of option to provide the good care for people across the country let i reassure hon member that all proposal be subject to robust value for money assessment to ensure taxpayer get the good possible return on investment in our health service 
 may i begin by congratulate the secretary of state on his action in try to repair our cherished nhs follow year of tory destruction we must learn from past mistake the private finance initiative be a huge expensive mistake an absolute disaster with £ repay for an investment of £ will the minister reassure the house that the lesson of pfi have be well learn and that they be well and truly in the past and in the dustbin 
 i thank my hon friend for his word of encouragement and congratulation i assure he that lesson have be learn we will ensure value for taxpayer money in all future proposal 
 i meet regularly with gps in my constituency and they have highlight that they do not yet have clarity or certainty about the role and resource that they will have in the roll out of service from hospital to community and neighbourhood health service will the minister meet i to provide that clarity to our gps and assure they that they will be at the table during that roll out 
 it be absolutely the role of the hon lady ’s local integrate care board to ensure that it involve all partner particularly primary care in the exciting roll out of neighbourhood health service which i think they welcome i be happy to discuss that far with she 
 what step his department be take to tackle wasteful spending in the health service 
 as well as the record investment that we put into the nhs we be ensure that we get a well bang for the taxpayer ’s buck under the conservatives for example the nhs be pay £ to recruitment firm for agency shift we have cut agency spending by a and be abolish it altogether with the saving reinveste in staff pay and treatment for patient that be just example of how our reform agenda be good for patient and for taxpayer 
 private finance initiative deal do huge damage to nhs budget despite receive just £ in asset nhs trust be saddle with more than £ in pfi debt most of that be still be pay back we have even see some hospital spend more on pfi debt than on medicine if they really want to cut out waste and avoid a pfi style disaster will the government rule out use private finance for the new network of new nhs clinic as have be float 
 as i answer in response to my hon friend   the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery we will absolutely ensure that we learn the lesson of the last government ’s failure 
 do the minister agree that it be completely wasteful to make cancer patient who need to go for chemotherapy in carlisle on a wednesday but who live in say kirkby stephen to have to travel to carlisle on the day or on the day before to get their blood take why be that because the local hospital will no long fund the local gp surgery in kirkby stephen or appleby to take their blood there be it not wrong that those gp surgery can no long provide secondary healthcare blood service in their own setting in people ’s own community 
 as he often do the hon gentleman highlight in his own very rural constituency some of the fundamental problem at the heart of our nhs that be why we be reform it ensure that we move hospital service from hospital into the community and develop neighbourhood health service we be also look at the financial flow in the system that lead to these sort of perverse incentive and funding arrangement which do damage to his constituent as they do to many other and to rural and coastal community that be why we highlight that in the year plan we need to see the end of such example 
 what step he be take to ensure that woman have access to menopause treatment on the nhs 
 we have already make excellent progress turn commitment in the woman ’s health strategy into tangible action we be deliver extra appointment which include tackle gynaecology waiting list we know though that more need to be do for woman experience the menopause and on improve awareness and access to treatment menopause mandate have long campaign alongside many member in this house for the menopause to be include in the nhs health check i hope to be able to say more soon but rest assure that we have hear those call 
 early this year a constituent come to speak to i about shortage of the hormone replacement therapy drug that be work for she after year of misdiagnose and ineffective treatment she tell i that gps have very low awareness of menopause and often recommend alternative that cause   adverse reaction leave she and many other woman pay for private advice and treatment and take time off work will the minister update the house on what the department be do to address hrt shortage and to improve training for gps so that million of woman get the support that they need 
 i thank my hon friend for highlight this crucial issue the majority of the more than hrt product be in good supply but we be aware of shortage affect certain estradiol patch and we be engage with supplier to expedite delivery wherever we can we have issue guidance to healthcare professional under the serious shortage protocol methodology to enable community pharmacist to supply alternative where appropriate furthermore we be commit to fund research into woman ’s health and we have invest approximately £ through the national institute for health and care research scheme into menopause research include study for new treatment to improve outcome for woman experience the menopause 
 it be be report in the press this week that woman be be exploit by a menopause gold rush enable by tech giant such as instagram what step can be take to ensure that woman have access to the very good of information and that misinformation on the internet be bring under control 
 i thank the hon lady for highlight this issue the good way to do that be to beef up nhs digital service as we be do to the nhs digital app so that woman and all patient can have confidence in the advice that they receive 
 what step he have take to support the virtual ward programme 
 i welcome the chair of the select committee back from parental leave and greatly look forward to work with she again virtual ward allow patient to get hospital level care in the comfort of their own home speed up their recovery while free up hospital bed for the patient who need they most we be roll out virtual ward far so that they become the norm for manage many condition at home 
 early this year i visit the hospital at home team at the john radcliffe hospital who run an incredible virtual ward i see they deliver care to mavis who be she be so emotional and grateful for the work they do we all end up in tear imagine my disappointment that while i be off we get an email from the team say that the funding for that incredible service be no long there and that they face closure this be an example of the good of the nhs we want it roll out to the rest but if the funding be not there for these nascent service to find their footing how can we ensure that good practice can be spread across the whole of oxfordshire and beyond 
 the hon lady make a very valid point this be about the shift from hospital to community which we have to drive forward in september virtual ward bed be available an increase from in september slowly but surely we be increase the number of virtual ward bed and the capability of virtual ward but there be still a long way to go i absolutely accept the point that the hon lady make 
 what step he be take to transfer care from hospital into the community 
 the darzi investigation find that nhs resource be too focused on hospital at the expense of community care our reform will turn the nhs into more of a neighbourhood health service we have already recruit an extra more gps we be roll out extra dental appointment and we have agree a new contract of investment and reform for community pharmacy as part of our year plan we will be roll out neighbourhood health centre across the country start with the place that be in the great need 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer and for the brilliant work that the whole team be do to put the nhs year plan into action transfer care into the community will give many more patient quick and easy access to specialist care when they need it however access to parkinson ’s nurse who be worth their weight in gold remain deeply unequal too often patient be leave without nurse and have to travel a long way to see a specialist nurse worse still the few parkinson ’s nurse who be available be predominantly fund by parkinson ’s uk can the minister set out what step be be take to increase equitable access to parkinson ’s nurse across the country 
 i thank my hon friend for that question and congratulate he on his work campaign on this issue regular support and advice from a parkinson ’s disease nurse specialist be highlight as a key intervention in the national institute for health and care excellence guideline on parkinson ’s disease in adult the forthcoming year workforce plan will support the year health plan by address workforce shortage and skill gap this will be crucial to deliver quality and accessible care for those with parkinson ’s 
 ironically get care out of hospital and into the community very much depend on a function hospital last month i meet the group chief executive officer of hull university teaching hospital nhs trust follow news that it have be place in segment of the nhs acute trust league table she acknowledge the urgent need for improvement and express clear ambition for change but she will not be able to deliver the transformation of that important hospital alone could i meet the secretary of state or ministers to discuss what more can be do to support that hospital on its road to transformation and improvement 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his question i be not familiar with the detail of that case but if he would not mind write to i i would be very happy to take that issue forward he be right that there be a mountain to climb not least because of the mess that be leave to we by the previous government but we be climb that mountain step by step the year plan be a big step in the right direction it be now all about delivery and that be what we be do every day 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 since i last answer question in this house the government have announce half a pound for a fair pay agreement for care worker nhs online the ever online only hospital trust and £ for child ’s hospice we have announce an independent inquiry into maternity service in leeds introduce jess ’s rule implement online request for gp appointment open the community diagnostic centre make the chickenpox vaccine available on the nhs and publish nhs league table a lot do a lot more to do 
 we promise more appointment and we have deliver along with extra gps more mental health worker more doctor and more nurse and midwife the cancer diagnosis standard have be meet gp satisfaction be up and waiting list be down the brand new midland metropolitan university hospital have open in my constituency do the secretary of state agree that this be the difference that a labour government make and that we be only just get start 
 why stop there we have more home adaptation for disabled people through the disabled facility grant and more suspect cancer patient receive a diagnosis on time we have more than case off the waiting list £ for the ever fair pay agreement for care worker and the big uplift in carer ’s allowance for a generation the tories do not do it and reform would undo it that be the difference that a labour government make 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 it be great to be in this new role i genuinely want to be part of a constructive opposition but equally i want to do my role in hold this government to account i note the lack of detail in the secretary of state ’s answer on reorganisation so can i ask the basic again how many people will be make redundant what will it cost and who be pay 
 i welcome the shadow secretary of state to his place it be good to hear from the conservative front benchers i have almost forget they exist the conservatives create a complex web of bureaucracy it be a bit rich to complain we be not abolish their   creation quickly enough we have have a number of expression of interest in voluntary redundancy across my department nhs england and the integrated care board and we be work through that as we speak 
 again the secretary of state can not answer his answer be too vague he be very good at make promise but the fact be that he be preside over a reorganisation that have stall create uncertainty for staff waiting list be up in the past month hospice be in crisis because of national insurance contribution rise and we have have strike again despite big pay rise with the threat of more if the secretary of state want the leadership in the future perhaps he should show leadership in the nhs now and tell we not just the plan but when he will give the detail and how he will deliver on his promise to patient 
 waiting list be low now than when labour take office and that be in stark contrast with the record of the government in which the shadow secretary of state serve waiting list increase every single year they be in charge this be the year in that waiting list have fall that be the difference that a labour government make we be only just get start as for leadership change we all know why they be call the leader of the opposition kemi kaze 
 a channel dispatch documentary recently go undercover at an ambulance centre   in my constituency of gillingham and rainham it show exhausted staff work under difficult circumstance the result of year of tory neglect and mismanagement of our nhs do my right hon friend agree that after the chaos under the last government this administration will put staff and patient will the relevant minister come to my constituency to meet healthcare provider and discuss our local challenge

 moya cole in heald green be a shin example of a hospice that do fantastic work in a very tough economic situation but it should not have to rely on coffee morning and jumble sale to fund its most essential service liberal democrat research finding show that almost a half of hospice in the united kingdom be plan cut this year will the government commit themselves to fund our hospice properly in the upcoming budget so that they do not need to cut the vital service that they provide 
 i do not hear the hon gentleman welcome the fact that we provide £ an unprecedented amount in capital funding for hospice and £ a year and £ over year for child ’s hospice we recognise that hospice benefit from be root in their community with amazing charity and philanthropy support but of course we know that the government need to do their bit as well and that be precisely what we be do i be very pleased to visit noah ’s ark child ’s hospice in barnet last week and to speak to the chief executive who warmly welcome the stability and certainty that the year allocation have provide 
 after a decade of under investment in our nhs under the conservatives i welcome the progress that have be make on reduce a&e waiting time under this government but there be no immediate fix just last month a coffee shop at the william harvey hospital in ashford be convert into an emergency ward to treat a&e patient will the secretary of state visit the hospital to see the continue problem with corridor care and will he update the house on what the government be do to ensure that the hospital can manage winter pressure and maintain safe high quality care 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for bring this matter to the house ’s attention it be appal for coffee shop to be commandeer as   space for the care of patient and we will not accept it i be happy to look at the case that my hon friend have mention we will also be publish figure on corridor care so that we can hold the system to account and the public can hold we to account to improve the situation that we inherit

 as i have point out we be provide unprecedented level of funding for hospice but there be clearly a challenging fiscal position i note that in their manifesto the liberal democrats propose to spend only an extra £ on health and care whereas we have invest £ before call for more spending they should tell we what they would cut 
 i welcome the change in the gp booking system but in many case it be still very difficult to obtain a gp appointment on the isle of wight a large factor in that be the difficulty of recruit gps to the island will the minister assure i that he will investigate all option for improve gp recruitment to coastal rural and island community like mine 
 through a £ investment in the additional role reimbursement scheme we have recruit more than new gps nationwide but we recognise the inequity in funding that can exacerbate regional inequality in access to service i have launch a review of the gp funding formula to ensure that funding follow the need of the population the national institute for health and care research have begin a review of the carr hill funding formula which will conclude in month time

 on a point of order mr speaker i be concerned that the health team may have inadvertently mislead the house in july the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation note that respiratory syncytial virus vaccine be so effective that they should be extend to all those over and those in adult care home the secretary of state reassure this house in july that the recommendation have be accept and provision would be in place for this winter when i ask about that today the secretary of state say from a sedentary position that he have deliver on that promise and the minister for secondary care then confirm that however government and nhs guideline still show that availability of the vaccine have not be extend how can i ensure that the record be correct 
 of all you can not continue the debate but you have certainly put that on the record 
 on a point of order mr speaker before begin my question i mean to pay tribute to our former colleague oliver colvile who sadly pass away last night he serve as the member for plymouth sutton and devonport between and and be name by conservative home as of a minority of conservative mps not to have vote against the government which as a previous whip i think be exceptional he be a true gentleman whose eccentricity endear he to many i be sure the thought of the whole house be with his family

 his brother be the famous sky cricket commentator 
 urgent question to ask the home secretary to make a statement on the recent criticism of the statutory inquiry into the rape gang scandal 
 as state in my previous statement to the house on   september   and in my letter to the home affairs committee yesterday the government remain resolute in deliver baroness casey ’s recommendation follow her national audit of group base child sexual exploitation and abuse these crime commit by groom gang be among the most horrific imaginable baroness casey ’s report expose more than a decade of institutional inaction and we be determined to ensure that such failure be never repeat 
 central to our response be a statutory national inquiry under the inquiries act it will oversee local investigation and will have full power to compel evidence it will also be time limit to year to ensure that victim and survivor receive answer swiftly the inquiry will examine safeguard system accountability and intersection with ethnicity race and culture identify failure and good practice the inquiry will work alongside operation beaconport a national police operation 
 the appointment of the chair be at a critical stage and we hope to confirm its conclusion soon victim and survivor have be at the heart of the process with trauma inform opportunity to share their view we have engage with they on the chair appointment and the term of reference which will be shape by the chair in public consultation with stakeholder as have be widely report in the medium victim and survivor be meet prospective chair this week today in fact this process contrary to the reporting be manage not by the home office but by the independent child exploitation charity nwg network we be gather view to ensure that the perspective of victim and survivor remain central 
 we must avoid delay as be see in the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and we be progress as swiftly as thoroughness allow misinformation undermine this process allegation of intentional delay lack of interest and a widening or dilution of the inquiry ’s scope be false the inquiry will remain laser focused on groom gang as baroness casey recommend 
 this scandal arise because young mainly white girl be systematically gang rap and it be cover up by those in authority because the perpetrator be mainly of pakistani origin it be all the more shocking that when call for a national inquiry become public in january the prime minister smear campaigner as 
 jump on a far right bandwagon 
 comment like that be a disgrace and be what lead to this scandal be cover up in the place month later just day before face a vote in parliament the government finally agree to the inquiry but it be   clear that they never want this inquiry and be force into it perhaps that be why month later the government have say nothing substantive publicly and their inquiry be descend into chaos 
 what we have hear publicly be that victim and survivor on the liaison panel have no confidence in the government or the inquiry in the last hour alone have resign fiona goddard resign from the panel say that 
 the secretive conduct and condition impose on survivor 
 by the government 
 have lead to a toxic fearful environment and there be a high risk of people feel silence all over again 
 hour later ellie ann reynolds also resign say that the remit of the inquiry have be widen to 
 downplay the racial and religious motivation behind our abuse 
 the minister shake her head but that be what ellie ann reynolds say 
 fiona also raise the issue of sabah kaiser who have be act as a liaison officer on behalf of nwg just year ago ms kaiser describe call out the fact that the majority of perpetrator be of pakistani heritage as destructive distract irresponsible give those frankly appalling view and the complaint about they by survivor will the minister ensure that ms kaiser play no further role 
 victim and survivor have also question the suitability of former police officer or social worker to chair the inquiry they do not believe that people from the profession that fail they so badly be suitable will the minister accept this feedback and appoint a judge to lead the inquiry will the minister confirm that the scope of the inquiry will not be dilute as both fiona and ellie ann say be now happen and that it will focus on the cover up of the rape gang scandal because of the fact that the majority of perpetrator be of pakistani origin 
 finally fiona say this yesterday 
 i just will not be gag and control by the government while they turn this inquiry into a cover up 
 will the minister apologise to fiona and ellie ann 
 the right hon gentleman can not have listen to my remark at all if he be suggest that the government have silence anybody the government have not handle the process it have be handle by a grooming gang charity he cite and name a victim of crime 
 if the right hon gentleman have do anywhere near the level of work that i have do he would know that not all victim and survivor be of the same opinion they be not homogeneous group of people who all think the same thing who all want the same exposure and who all want their identity know i have speak to fiona goddard many time and i will continue that relationship with she should that be what she wish every single survivor who have be engage with there have be many will have different feeling on the subject 
 with regard to the right hon gentleman require a judge baroness casey say to the house in the home affairs committee that she do not want a traditional judicial lead inquiry she be explicit about that can anyone in the house find i an institution that do not   fail these girl over the year that include our court which take child away from the grooming gang victim and which criminalise some of they there be no institution in our country that have not fail 
 today i will meet many of the victim and get their feedback and i will continue to progress with that in mind i will engage with all the victim regardless of their opinion and i will listen to those who have be put in the medium and be put in panel i will always listen and i will speak to all of they 
 oldham have step forward to take on a local inquiry and it have be wait to understand what the move to the national inquiry mean for its work the same be true of victim and survivor whose bravery and strength in the most difficult circumstance have be truly remarkable what arrangement have be put in place to ensure that there be a clear front door offer support that be fully independent of council and police force while local deep dive be clearly essential can we have an assurance that if the evidence take an investigation beyond council and police force boundary it will be follow to the full extent 
 i will not be chair the inquiry so i can only say to my hon friend that the term of reference i be not sure this be usual will be consult on in public that be because of the issue of bad faith and the concern about transparency the remit of the inquiry will be decide by the chair live within those term of reference have be part of various different inquiry or watch they from a distance i know that no stone will be leave unturned whoever chair the inquiry will feel empower to do what they think be good 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 it have be month and long since the home office announce the national statutory inquiry into group base child sexual exploitation i know that ministers will have want quick progress we on the liberal democrat benches do too we still have no chair no term of reference and most importantly no justice for the victim who have already wait year now member of the victim and survivor liaison panel have step down after raise concern about shortlist chair they seem to have lose confidence in the process before it have begin 
 the home office must listen to and act on the concern of victim i know that the minister will agree and get the inquiry off the ground that be the only way to ensure that it proceed with integrity and the trust of those it be mean to serve 
 now be the time to prioritise justice and prevention over political point scoring i know that the minister will agree with i on that too because this be an extremely sensitive matter particularly for the victim will the minister commit to publish the term of reference along with full detail of the inquiry ’s budget and staffing and a timeline by the end of the month if not to that deadline when will that be publish 
 i thank the hon gentleman for both his tone and his approach as per the inquiries act the term of reference have to be set and consult on with the chair the chair be be decide on 
 i have to say it be not take any long than the covid inquiry or the infected blood inquiry which i think each take month from their announcement to the appointment of the chair i do not remember huge amount of criticism or bellyache about that because we want to get those thing right actually get this right mean deal with lot of different stakeholder and victim with different view the process have to be follow that the term of reference go through the chair we have already do some of the work on the term of reference with victim group but we can not publish those we will do that publicly as i say until a chair be appoint i will not rush that because i will take note of all the feedback i receive 
 today the government have announce that they will take parental responsibility away where a child be bear of rape that will protect grooming victim child in this country will no long be the only proceed of crime that criminal can have lifelong access to do the minister agree that survivor be fail for too long by a conservative government who do not prioritise give they justice that party be lead by the leader of the opposition who do not mention groom when she have the power to do something about it instead survivor have have to wait for victim and activist to be on the government benches and for the fierce of advocate to be at the dispatch box 
 i thank my hon friend i think she mischaracterise i as the fierce of advocate because she as a grooming victim with a child bear of rape be the fierce and bravest i could cry i feel so proud that the government seek to get she elect i have be campaign for the thing she have fight for with groom gang victim for nearly a decade i meet with ministers of the then government and nothing be do interruption the exact thing that she have campaign for be ask for repeatedly and nothing be do i be incredibly proud of she as it be because of she and this government that today i can say that that will change 
 i have a copy of the government ’s response to the development last night address to the home affairs committee and i find the response completely unacceptable be the government seriously imply that fiona and ellie who have be disbelieve and call liar by the british state their entire life be spread misinformation about a process they have be directly involve in that would be a deeply damaging thing for any government to imply 
 bad there be a line in the letter about the government ’s propose inquiry in oldham that say that the government 
 have be in discussion with oldham council about the right approach for oldham 
 how can that possibly be right how can the home office discuss the right approach with the very local authority be investigate it would be like the post office inquiry sit down with the post office to   negotiate how it should be investigate will the minister explain how the government will restore trust right now in the process give the content of the letter that she send to the home affairs committee last night 
 can i be completely clear i be suggest that i will listen completely and utterly to the feedback from the victim who be on the panel and those who still be they be not spread misinformation at all but the hon member ’s interpretation be a brilliant case in point 
 i will be completely honest the conversation with oldham be do we not think it might be well for oldham just to take part in a statutory inquiry it have absolutely nothing to do with the idea that oldham be tell i what to do the more people on the conservative benches—[interruption oh the hon member can hold up his letter and have a smug face all he like but the fact of the matter be that there be no council in this country that will tell the inquiry where it can and can not go i have say that time from the dispatch box yet the same thing get peddle again and again 
 i know that the minister will not want to comment on individual candidate to chair the national groom inquiry however may i put on record that jim gamble be a highly regard police officer with a long experience of deal with this matter his leadership of the child exploitation and online protection centre prove what a fearless and fiercely independent figure he be with a real track record of track down sick paedophile online and off do the minister agree that the chair of the inquiry must be someone who can earn the trust of those who have be let down by those in position of authority for far too long will she confirm i hope that she will that the inquiry will not shy away from issue of race or class and will follow the evidence wherever it lead 
 and foremost i absolutely confirm that that will not happen not only that but i confirm that the home office have ask police force across the country to collect datum on ethnicity that be not do before i will not be draw into his point about the chair it be not up to i however i will say that the gentleman my hon friend mention resign from a previous role in this field because he think that the then government be not invest enough in tackle child sexual exploitation 
 the victim of these crime be vulnerable child who be ignore gaslit and dismiss victim have now resign because of the process its failure and their lack of faith in it yet i hear what appear to i to be an aggressive and defensive tone from the minister 
 yes that be because of you lot 
 she should remember that those people be watch will she listen to the victim and do she regret that those individual have resign from the process 
 i absolutely regret that they have resign from the process funnily enough in the particular instance of of the people i have have no involvement in that process i do not know who be on the panel of victim it be entirely independently manage by a grooming gang charity of my only intervention be to ensure that the name of some of the voice that i think deserve to be hear be include i have do that on a number of occasion 
 i will of course listen to they actually i be mean to be with those panel of victim hear their response right now as i have say i will take the feedback of anyone both publicly and should they want to speak to i as i have approach they i be always sad when victim feel that they can not take part in a process of course i be there be many different victim and they have many different view there be one that we hear publicly but i want to make it clear that there be many different victim and we have to ensure that all their voice be hear equally whether they be part of the process or not 
 the minister have reiterate time and again that victim must be at the centre of an inquiry will she tell we what she intend to do to ensure that that aim be fully implement 
 while the inquiry be ongoing that will be a matter for the chair however i know from the inquiry that i have be involve in that be successful and victim centric that there always have to be a system for support the victim both with take part in the inquiry and with the trauma that might be bring up usually those thing be separate but i will say this once again i will not be the chair of this committee undoubtedly it be about ensure that victim be protect throughout the process should they want to go out and speak publicly both negatively and positively about that process i would absolutely welcome that people should never be prevent from speak we have to ensure that support be available regardless of how they wish to gain it 
 there should be nothing more precious in the eye of this parliament than the protection of child particularly those who suffer at the hand of these barbaric individual many of we be parent aunt uncle and grandparent and this cut very deep i know that the minister care and be a caring person but today we need decisive action give that of the victim have walk away from the inquiry 
 
 give that of the victim have walk away from the inquiry will the minister clearly state how she will ensure that a fully independent inquiry can take place and that it prominently include victim 
 all i can say be that there be a reason that i can not stand in front of the victim who i be mean to be get feedback from right now and definitely say when the chair will come i could have just put my finger in the air and pick out some random judge we could have do that but i be listen to victim feedback again i have to stress that that process be not easy there be difficult dynamic within group of   people and the people who we have ask to engage be deal with difficult thing so undoubtedly that be not uncomplex as anyone who have work with group of people who have be wrong sham and treat badly will know it would be a lie to stand here and tell they that there be a straight line and a simple answer and i be not willing to do that 
 i thank the minister for her continued work all victim and survivor have not have their voice hear for too long we need to ensure that that happen and i be sure that the minister be do that will she confirm what resource be available to ensure that survivor be properly support through the process on system delay we know that there be still issue with court delay and ensure we go after all the perpetrator will she give an update on that and on the jay inquiry recommendation 
 i will chair an interministerial   cross government group next week to push through   the other recommendation baroness casey make recommendation but people rarely speak about any of the other this be not her most press instead she give primacy to the policing relate recommendation around operation beaconport as i say in my previous statement on   september the work on the case that move forward be ongoing and run alongside this that be where justice will be serve in our court if only they have not be horrendously degrade so that rape victim wait for year and year 
 i think we all agree that the voice of survivor have to be at the heart of this it be worry and concern when of those survivor do not feel as if the process be properly look after they and ensure their voice be hear will the minister commit to speak to both fiona goddard and ellie ann reynolds to try and encourage and reassure they that this be a process that really will listen to their voice 
 that opportunity have already be present to they and i would be more than happy i know of they but not the other that opportunity be always available and of they have my phone number on the idea that i do not listen and have not be make myself available i have try to keep the process fiercely independent of government intervention so that it can happen and victim can feel safe in that but of course i feel sad that this be how it have end actually i hope that this be not how it have end and i will commit to make sure that this be not the end my door be always open to they 
 in a bangladeshi national be sentence in my carlisle constituency for attempt to recruit girl age to into prostitution in his sum up the judge describe how the man ’s conduct have corrode 
 the foundation of decency and respect by which all right think people live their life whatever their ethnic or religious background 
 will the minister take the opportunity to again reassure all right think people that this inquiry will look at everything to find answer include the role of ethnicity 
 i say again and again that it will not shy away from finding where they be present anybody who have do the work in this space will know that that be go to be find as the case in my hon friend ’s constituency highlight there be absolutely no sense that ethnicity will be bury away every single time that there be an apparently needless delay even though it take month to put in place chair for both the covid inquiry and the blood inquiry and nobody moan about that it get use to say that we want to cover something up that be the misinformation i be talk about it will not cover thing up we be take time to ensure that that can never happen 
 the hon lady have be an outspoken champion for the victim and will continue to be so but she must be concern that member of the panel have withdraw and we understand that of the candidate to be chair of the inquiry have withdraw clearly there be concern across the house that institution such as the police social service council and the court be all in a position where they have fail whoever chair the inquiry must therefore have full rigour over service that they may have be involve in so there be an issue of confidence can she update the house on how the inquiry will report back to the house and what scrutiny the house will have over the action of the inquiry and the term of reference 
 i thank the hon gentleman who be in a unique category of always ask a question that lead i to further question that be pertinent an inquiry do not usually report to the house while it be ongoing but i will take that away to see if there be an appetite for that all i can say be that there be no institution in the country include this here that do not have skeleton do i think all politician would not be robust in this no i do not i think some would i can guarantee that i can point at people the hon gentleman include who would show absolute rigour even against his own the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse iicsa have a judge lead it and it lose the confidence of the victim people lose the confidence of the victim it take year there be not an institution that do not fail those girl that be the whole point there be no clean skin but there be brilliant people who whistleblew and who try in every of those institution that be essentially where we be leave with this but i promise rigour in the same way that when i see thing happen in here i be rigorous 
 i commend the minister for her formidable personal leadership on this and i be proud to sit on these benches alongside other formidable campaigner too the minister have reiterate that the inquiry must be trauma inform and i know from speak to victim in my constituency just how vital it be that we be cognisant both of the initial trauma that they have experience and also of the retraumatise effect of go through the process of seek justice for themselves and other can the minister set out more about how she will ensure that this trauma inform approach be weave through the ongoing inquiry 
 as the inquiry be set up as with previous inquiry with very vulnerable group of people such as iicsa thing will have to be put in place to ensure that people can freely give their evidence and that will have to be do in a trauma inform way the of baroness casey ’s recommendation be that all the recommendation should be fully fund by the government and this government have absolutely commit to that i very much expect that when the chair be in place those conversation about exactly how that will look will begin the only thing i do control i suppose in any of this be that this government will pay for it 
 the cover up continue we have a prime minister who never want a national inquiry we have a minister who never want a national inquiry and we have the labour back benchers who never want a national inquiry do the minister agree that the victim of these horrific crime will never get the justice they deserve as long as we have a labour government in charge
