bill read the time and pass with amendment 
 the minister of state be ask 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 what step he be take to help improve the humanitarian situation in gaza 
 if he will resume funding of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east 
 we be do all we can to increase aid into gaza with our ally we will take decision on the future of unrwa funding after scrutinise catherine colonna ’s interim report on unrwa neutrality 
 we have hear this morning some shocking report about palestinian medical staff in gaza be blindfold detain force to strip and repeatedly beat by israeli troop after a raid on nasser hospital last month there be footage from khan yunis show man strip and kneeling and patient with their hand bind be wheel in bed do the uk government believe that the israeli government be responsible for the conduct of their force and that this clearly appear to be torture and be in breach of international law include the universal declaration of human right and article of the geneva convention what be the uk government go to do about this 
 the hon lady be right to say that israel must comply with the geneva convention we have see these report a full explanation and investigation be require and that be what the british government be press for i point out to she that when it come to    target operation lawyer be embed in the israeli and israel defence forces command just as happen in britain which should ensure the acceptance and honouring of international humanitarian law but i agree that a full explanation be require 
 for month we have see the horrifying image of child in gaza mutilate or kill by bombing and now we see they starve aid by air and sea be welcome but it be insufficient and it be a diversion from israel ’s responsibility yesterday israeli human right organisation call out their own government for fail to comply with the international court of justice rule to facilitate access for humanitarian aid do the minister agree that the israeli government should be tell by the uk and our ally to unlock aid and end the killing or face real consequence 
 as the hon gentleman know the prime minister and the foreign secretary have both press prime minister netanyahu and indeed president herzog to ensure that more aid can get into gaza as the hon gentleman will also know it be the policy of the british government to do everything we can to achieve a pause so that we can get the hostage out and get more aid in and move towards a sustainable ceasefire we be do everything we can to try to achieve that 
 what we be see in gaza be a starvation level event the united states have take the desperate measure of air drop and flotilla which do not direct aid like land base aid the only organisation big enough to fully distribute aid in order to avoid starvation be unrwa canada review the interim report of the un office of internal oversight services and have resume fund sweden have receive bilateral assurance on the same action that the foreign commonwealth and development office be supposedly look for from unrwa and have resume fund it be scandalous that the uk government ’s position be still for a suspension of fund despite the interim report and without evidence of wrongdoing be provide by israeli in the place the british public do not want to be responsible for starvation in gaza when will the minister resume the funding 
 as i have tell the house before no british funding be due until april and enough fund have now come forward to ensure that adequate supply be available we be await the report of the un office of internal oversight services and the interim report from catherine colonna the former french foreign minister the view we take be that when we have see those we very much hope we will have the reassurance to recommence funding that be also the position of the us germany australia italy finland the netherlands and switzerland i hope that the hon gentleman will be comfort by the fact that we be very much try to resolve this matter as speedily as we can 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 the foreign affairs committee recently return from al arish which be the staging point for aid into gaza it be very difficult to see thousand of truck on that border   the government have be clear that israel have a legal   obligation to ensure that aid reach civilian the last legal assessment take place at the end of last year can my right hon friend tell the house in legal term whether israel be demonstrate a commitment to international humanitarian law if he will not tell we in the house will he please write to i 
 i thank my hon friend for her visit with the select committee and for her comment we be quite clear that israel have the capacity and ability to abide by international humanitarian law we review it on a regular basis but as of today that remain the position 
 the un mission team that recently visit israel conclude that 
 there be reasonable ground to believe that conflict relate sexual violence occur in multiple location during the   october   attack 
 in the light of that appalling and shocking conclusion will the government redouble their effort to get the hostage home because they might be suffer a similar fate to those victim on   october 
 i agree with my right hon friend she will know that the prime minister the foreign secretary and lord ahmad have all meet the family of the hostage i have the privilege of meet some of the family last week the occasion i have do so within the precinct of this house she be right we be do everything we can to increase the flow of aid and get the hostage home we will continue to do so 
 of the most troubling aspect of the   october   massacre be the fact that many ordinary gazans report indicate hundred or even thousand follow the hamas terrorist into israel and participate in the atrocity report suggest that civilian kidnap israelis and sell they to gaza base terrorist group and commit far unspeakable act of violence include sexual violence be my right hon friend aware of those report and do he share my concern about hamas ’s ongoing indoctrination of ordinary gazan citizen 
 my hon friend make a good point i be aware of those report the fact remain that the appalling event of   october   be as i have say in the house before the bad atrocity and the bad killing of jewish people since the holocaust and the world war we continue to want total accountability for the terrible event that take place on that day 
 accept what the minister say about there be no money due to go to unrwa until april can i say to he however that for we to continue not to fund unrwa send a truly dreadful signal to other country on the world stage canada and sweden have resume their funding surely we should be attend to this now as a matter of some urgency 
 i list the country that take the same view as we the right hon gentleman be right that there be a division but britain be not due to provide any funding until we reach the next financial year in april we will of course seek to do everything we can to resolve the matter by the time that funding be due 
 can the deputy foreign secretary confirm that israel be co operate with an increase number of lorry enter gaza carry essential humanitarian aid i have be look up the figure aid lorry tonne of food and tonne of water be it not correct that the israelis have say there be no limit on the amount of aid that can come in but that there be a delay once it have pass israeli check and before it get into gaza proper 
 my right hon and learn friend be right to say that there have be an increase in the number of truck get in in february there be on average only in march that figure be so there have be an improvement but the house will recognise that there be nothing like enough get through the easy way to do so be by truck and road it be because that be so difficult that we have have to find other mechanism such as the maritime and air route 
 i call the shadow minister 
 may i return the minister to the serious allegation make today follow a bbc investigation that medic in gaza be detain strip and beat while try to perform their life save humanitarian duty all of we in the house have repeatedly call on all party to abide by international law but the government have so far decline to say that the provisional measure of the international court of justice should be implement in full will he now tell we that they should be and that the uk will support the international criminal court investigation lead by andrew cayley to ensure not only that all allegation against all party be investigate but that there be accountability for those who break the law 
 the hon lady be quite right there need to be a full and thorough investigation and accountability in respect of what be report today by the bbc and i can assure she that the foreign office be press for full transparency and accountability on that matter 
 but surely the minister can see the problem unless the icj ’s provisional ruling be implement and the icc be allow to go about its work those word be simply meaningless and unless the international community make it crystal clear that rule will be uphold by all party and those who do not uphold they will be hold accountable more people will die peace be build on the bedrock of international law may i ask the minister again to make it clear to the house that the government will support the icc ’s investigation of hamas as well as its investigation of israel and will press for the full implementation of the icj ’s provisional ruling and that international law will be uphold not when it be convenient but always as the precondition for peace 
 let i be very clear about this we do not believe and do not believe that the icj referral be helpful to attempt to secure dialogue we respect the role and independence of the icj and will consider any advisory opinion but we do not think it helpful without the consent of both party for the court to deliver an advisory opinion on what be essentially a bilateral dispute   however we keep all these matter under review and as i have say our current position be that we believe israel have both the capacity and the intent to abide by international humanitarian law 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 the minister will have see the shocking image of parachute drop aid into gaza at the same moment as a barrage of israeli missile strike there be of course every chance that the aid and the missile originate from the same source and i wonder at the level of cognitive dissonance require to supply aid to innocent civilian while at the same time provide the mean by which israel can continue to kill they indiscriminately when will this government recognise the moral absurdity of sell weapon to israel while attempt to salve their conscience by airdrop aid to those civilian who be fortunate enough to have survive the bombardment 
 as i think i have mention to the hon gentleman before in this country we have the tough arm control mechanism anywhere but we accept that israel have a right of self defence and this have to be see through that prism as well as the prism through which he see it but i can tell he that we continually keep these matter under review that be not only international humanitarian law but the arm export regime and we will continue to do so 
 what step his department be take to support a state solution between israel and palestine 
 we must generate momentum towards a permanent peace with an immediate humanitarian pause lead to a sustainable ceasefire 
 i thank the minister for his comment everyone in the house want to see a negotiate diplomatic agreement to resolve the israeli palestinian conflict base on state but do he agree that the step towards achieve that be an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the release of all hostage 
 the problem with call for an immediate ceasefire be that neither side want to have and therefore in my view it would be an unhelpful intervention that be why the british government and other government too have call for a pause to get the hostage out and get aid in which can then be build on and lead to a sustainable ceasefire and that be what we be seek to do 
 the ideal of a state solution be that unite this house however there be practical barrier not least the fact that hamas be surge in the poll what poll there be across the palestinian authority and the palestinian authority continue to have hateful preaching in the school curriculum that be breed the sort of hate that lead to evil organisation such as hamas have a grip on gaza   and it continue to pay salary to convict terrorist family if we be to get a state solution that need to stop do it not 
 in respect of the textbook allegation that my hon friend make i have receive those allegation last week i have a meeting with the head of unrwa mr lazzarini in which i present he with the evidence and ask for a full account in respect of the state solution let i be clear that within both the israeli government and civil society throughout israel there be pragmatic voice that believe in self determination for palestine as the only way forward it be very important that we try to build on that vision which be why the foreign secretary be so committed to try to bring people together so that when the political track can open it have real substance to it 
 do the minister agree that a state solution have become more difficult because of the construction of over illegal home in the west bank which continue with the backing of the idf and the israeli government even now we see image of people be turf out of their home and other take over and illegal settlement home be be sell to people in the usa 
 there be thing that we want the israeli government to do in that respect we want they to release frozen fund halt settlement expansion and hold to account those responsible for settler violence which be why britain have sanction extremist israeli settler let i be clear as i understand it the israeli government be not against palestinian statehood but be against unilateral recognition without bilateral negotiation that be the burden of a vote in the knesset on   february   this year 
 the wide discussion of a state solution outside this place be be misrepresent restaurant be be boycott for sell coca cola because people think the company support israel the coca cola factory in the west bank be actually own by a palestinian franchisee so we need to educate people to get back to the discussion of a state solution we clearly need a ceasefire and the hostage to be release by hamas will my right hon friend detail what discussion he be have in that regard 
 those discussion be go on all the time with our friend and ally with the regional power at the united nations and indeed directly with israel as i say the prime minister and the foreign secretary talk regularly to prime minister netanyahu and we will continue to do so my hon friend eloquently set out the reason for the government ’s policy of try to create a pause to get the hostage out and aid in and we will continue to pursue that objective 
 i call shadow minister 
 the situation in gaza be truly appalling but the situation in the west bank be also a cause for huge concern since the horrific   october   attack over palestinians have be kill and thousand have be detain far to the   question from my hon friend   the member for bolton south east yasmin qureshi last week israel advance plan for new home in the occupied palestinian territories as a state solution be the only path to a last peace do the minister agree that a firm position on these issue must be take now by the united kingdom and the international community 
 i hope that i have set out my broad agreement with what the hon gentleman say britain want to see step take against illegal settlement and settler who have commit crime we want to see they arrest try and punish for those crime we want to see the palestinian authority reinvigorate with new leadership and a strong approach to take up the role that it will need to fulfil when the sky clear and there be a moment for the political track to begin 
 what assessment he have make of the step need to secure a sustainable ceasefire in gaza 
 what assessment he have make of the step need to secure a sustainable ceasefire in gaza 
 what discussion he have have with his us counterpart on a potential un security council resolution on a ceasefire in gaza 
 we need a humanitarian pause to get aid in and hostage out lead to a sustainable permanent ceasefire we be press for this with israel regional leader and our wide international partner include the united states 
 give the importance of their role the palestinian authority will require thoroughgoe reform will not they 
 my right hon friend be right and that be why both the foreign secretary and the noble lord ahmad have be in discussion with the palestinian authority and the wide regional community to try to ensure that when the moment come as i set out in my response to   the hon member for caerphilly wayne david the palestinian authority be able to seize it 
 do my right hon friend agree that an unsustainable ceasefire that rapidly collapse would only make it more difficult to build the confidence require for peace and that if there be a humanitarian pause now we could get more aid in and hostage out and it could help to bring about the condition require for a sustainable ceasefire 
 my hon friend have put his finger on   a critical point we do not believe that call for a general and immediate ceasefire and hop that it would somehow become permanent will work a ceasefire will not last if the hostage be still be hold we   can not just will it if neither side want it and the condition need to be in place for it not to collapse within day 
 some of these answers—“we have the tough arm licence regime we have urge israel to follow international law”—are the same meaningless supine nonsense week after week month after month from this government i have say many time that it sicken i that although this government and indeed the labour front benchers call out putin ’s war crime in ukraine at light speed they prevaricate on do the same when it come to the israeli bombardment and siege of gaza it sicken i that this government have abstain on un security council ceasefire resolution will the minister guarantee that the uk will work with partner to draft a resolution that reflect the will of this house and finally vote for a ceasefire to end the suffering of so many in gaza 
 on the hon gentleman ’s final point which i think be the question the answer be yes but in respect of everything else he say the answer be no 
 woman in gaza be give birth without even have a chair to sit down on they be have caesarean without medication the minister will know that many aid agency have repeatedly call out the horrific suffering of the palestinian people and israel ’s unacceptable restriction on aid flow we have be talk about the urgency of an immediate humanitarian ceasefire how urgently be the government actually push for this with both side and with partner in the middle east not just for the urgency of the ceasefire but for a plan for what come next 
 i can reassure the hon lady that on both of those point press for a pause and press all the regional power on what come next the government be actively and continually engage on her point about the terrible plight of woman in gaza that be why the british government give nearly £ just a week or so ago specifically to try to alleviate the desperate circumstance in gaza that so many woman find themselves in 
 i call the scottish national party spokesperson alyn smith 
 the good way to deal with a sustainable ceasefire be obviously to deal with the ongoing humanitarian crisis and that be well do by unrwa not through individual bilateral action the minister mention state that have suspend their funding and the situation be evolve really fast the eu have just announce € for unrwa and further tranche of € subject to the satisfactory completion of an audit i take the point that no funding be due from the uk to unrwa until april but what further reassurance do the uk need to ensure the funding will be in place because unrwa be the good organisation to disburse it and the uk risk be very much on the wrong side of these development 
 i do not agree with the hon gentleman ’s last point it be true that canada sweden spain and the eu with condition expect to be able to resume funding but as i mention early america germany australia   italy finland the netherlands and switzerland take the same view as we to the substantive point he   make we be in discussion with the leader of unrwa mr lazzarini and we be await the report from the former french foreign minister and the report from the un we hope that as a result of those report sufficient change will be secure so that we can continue to fund unrwa but the hon gentleman should be in no doubt that we have fully fund unrwa into the next financial year 
 what diplomatic step his department be take to help tackle illegal migration 
 we be engage with international partner on a whole of route approach to address irregular migration this include a multi year operational plan with france to stop small boat develop partnership to tackle organise immigration crime improve return process and work with partner country through a number of international fora to address the root cause 
 small boat crossing continue to be a massive concern for my constituent many of whom point out to i that there be some logic to the argument that if those who illegally enter our country from france a safe european country be return on the same day the problem would probably be deal with overnight have my right hon friend discuss this with her french counterpart and be her counterpart open to this undeniable logic if so why do france not accept they back on the same day 
 my hon friend raise a point that be raise in many of our postbag the reality be that individual in need of international protection should claim asylum in the safe country they reach that will always be the fast route to safety we of course continue to work collaboratively with our european partner include france to address our share migration challenge i can update the house that our partnership with france have help to bring down small boat arrival and together we stop more than crossing last year 
 i thank the minister for her response we in northern ireland have a border with the republic of ireland what discussion have she have with her counterpart in the devolved nation and particularly in the northern ireland assembly and the police service of northern ireland about tackle illegal migration i be ever mindful that we have a land border that need to be patrol and police 
 as i say we continue to engage across a number of international fora to strengthen our collaboration and to make sure that we have secure and ambitious partnership to tackle irregular migration i will ensure that my colleague update the hon gentleman on the meeting they have be have with the psni 
 what recent discussion he have have with his german counterpart on the war in ukraine 
 my right hon friend the foreign secretary and i regularly speak to our ministerial counterpart on a range of issue include the war in ukraine he meet foreign minister baerbock at the uk german strategic dialogue on   march   in berlin to reaffirm our commitment to support ukraine 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer he will be aware that the head of the luftwaffe lieutenant general ingo gerhartz make an appalling lapse of security the former director general of german intelligence august hanning say on the subject that nato security and british troop have have their existence in ukraine compromise do the minister agree 
 i appreciate my hon friend ’s motivation in ask that question we should keep in mind that our relationship with germany on support ukraine be strong united and deeply co operative together we be deliver the fighting edge that our friend in ukraine need 
 of the thing that rang in my ear after my recent visit to ukraine be the frustration with what be happen not just in the us but even in those european country germany the uk france and other that be a yes on weapon support it be the slow yes that be frustrating people what be the minister do to turn that slow yes to taurus into a quick yes more broadly do that not make the case for a comprehensive defence agreement between britain and the eu 
 no it do not but we continue to work very energetically and closely with our friend across europe include at the recently convene french summit to ensure that the heft and military capability of all ukraine ’s ally be bring to bear in increase ukraine ’s fighting edge 
 i call the shadow minister 
 our defence security and foreign policy relationship with germany be critical not least in relation to our united and mutual support for ukraine i will meet german counterpart about those issue in berlin this week will the minister give we more detail on the discussion he and the foreign secretary have have with german counterpart on issue urgently speed up and expand the delivery of weaponry bolster our diplomatic coalition and crucially use frozen russian state asset across europe to pay for urgent need to support ukraine 
 the hon gentleman ask a characteristically intelligent and pertinent question we be work together to increase defence industrial capability some new idea have come out of the french summit about increase domestic capability for our ukrainian friend a lot of diplomatic support go into that on   frozen asset he will have see recent thinking from the european side about use the interest payment from those fund which we will consider we need to find a reliable legal route if that be to be sustainable 
 what diplomatic step he be take to help secure the safety and release of vladimir kara murza 
 the uk have consistently condemn vladimir kara murza ’s politically motivated conviction and call for his release we sanction individual in response to his sentencing as well as individual involve in his early poisoning we regularly raise his case both with the russian authority and at multilateral fora 
 since the death of alexei navalny do the government recognise the increase urgency of vladimir kara murza ’s case he be now the most high profile live political prisoner in russia what more be the government consider do be the government work with our ally such as the united states on a number of issue in this field 
 our ambassador raise mr kara murza ’s case in person with russia ’s deputy foreign minister on   january repeat our request for consular access the foreign secretary meet mrs kara murza and mr kara murza ’s mother elena gordon on   march we remain in close and regular contact with his family and legal representative and we will continue to keep his case at the top of our agenda 
 my constituent evan gershkovich be detain by the fsb the federal security service almost exactly a year ago on   march he be an american citizen who live in the uk and work for the wall street journal his continued detention be another stain on russia although mr gershkovich be not a british citizen be the minister confer with his american colleague to ensure that mr gershkovich be release 
 yes i be happy to confirm that i will seek an update from our head of mission in moscow for the hon lady ’s increase awareness 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the israeli occupation of the west bank 
 what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of the israeli occupation of the west bank 
 israel must not undermine prospect for peace and security in the west bank as the occupy power israel must protect the civilian population 
 the minister forget to mention that this be of the rare occasion on which the united kingdom government have a long stand position that israel be act unlawfully in the west bank some separate criminal act of unlawful occupation have be endorse and instruct by benjamin netanyahu because that illegal occupation have go unpunished we now see extremist with the tacit acquiescence and sometimes direct support of the israeli defence force commit act of cold blooded murder against innocent civilian if they do not stand up to criminal those crime will get bad the minister mention that individual have be sanction for their crime in the west bank why have the president or the prime minister of israel who order that unlawful occupation not also be sanction 
 the government pursue the objective i have set out clearly to the house in a way most likely to bring success the core ask that be so relevant to many of these question be the release of all hostage formation of a new palestinian government for the west bank and gaza remove hamas ’s capacity to launch attack against israel hamas no long be in charge of gaza and with our ally the provision of serious practical and technical support for the palestinian authority that be the approach that be most likely to command support and not i fear the line that the hon gentleman take 
 the minister say that israel have a duty to protect civilian but in the west bank there have be death there be now testimony from palestinian civilian include woman and child who have be subject to kidnap torture and abuse at the hand of israeli settler yet the uk government have sanction only illegal settler what further action be the uk government go to take against settler surely it be time to ban the trade of good from those illegal settlement once and for all 
 i really do not think that that would be a very sensible thing to do we do not comment across the floor of the house on who be about to be sanction or where the sanction regime be go but the hon member may rest assure that we keep these matter under very careful review 
 i call the shadow minister 
 as ramadan begin and passover and easter approach it be vital that all place of worship in jerusalem be respect i be extremely concerned by suggestion from israeli minister ben gvir that restriction could be impose on worshipper at al aqsa mosque i welcome subsequent statement by israeli authority that the sanctity of the holiday will be preserve authority must show respect and restraint at this crucial moment have the government make it clear to israeli counterpart that minister ben gvir ’s comment be unacceptable and inflame tension and that the status quo arrangement must be maintain 
 the hon member be entirely right about the importance of religious freedom particularly in the circumstance that she so clearly set out she may rest   assure that those be point that the british government make very strongly to israel it be helpful that the opposition and the government speak with voice on that very important matter 
 what step he be take to uphold the falkland islanders right of self determination 
 what step he be take to uphold the falkland islanders right of self determination 
 the uk government will always protect and promote the falkland islanders right of self determination only they can decide their future we want a good relationship with argentina but have be very clear that we will never negotiate away the islander democratic right my right hon friend the foreign secretary reassure the islander about our endure commitment during his welcome visit to the falkland islands last month 
 i be the chair of the british overseas territory all party parliamentary group i remember watch the ship leave the tamar in my constituency and head to the falklands more than year ago in our prime minister maggie thatcher say 
 defeat i do not recognise the meaning of the word 
 do the government retain that steely resolve 
 i be young enough to remember those day as well and yes the uk government remain steadfast in their resolve to ensure that the falkland islanders right of self determination be uphold and we will continue to use all diplomatic mean to that end 
 will my hon friend join i in recognise the effort of the falkland islanders to build a modern thriving community and economy and do he agree that as long as they wish to remain part of the british family the sovereignty of the falklands islands will not be up for discussion 
 well say the modern diverse economically prosperous falkland islands of today be testimony to the islander achievement since the conflict the islander be a value part of the british family and as long as they want to remain part of the family sovereignty will not be up for discussion 
 have the very commendable word that the minister have say at the dispatch box today be relay to the argentinian authority 
 as i have say we be work on our good relation with argentina but the country be very clear about our position on the falkland islands 
 what step he be take to support effective governance in the british overseas territory 
 it be good to see my hon friend in his place and continue with his strong interest in our overseas territory the uk be commit to ensure the security and good governance of the overseas territory and their people we support improvement in institution to ensure great accountability and transparency and fair society 
 the minister will know that the british overseas territory be cherish part of the british family and we rightly expect good governance from they in return for their be part of our british family however be it not time that they be give some form of representation not necessarily here in the british parliament but in institution such as a committee of the house where they could actually have a voice at the moment they have no representation in any sense they be not even allow to be member of the commonwealth not even associate member will he look at that and see whether the government can come up with a new approach to ensure that our british overseas territory be fully represent 
 i understand my hon friend ’s point which he make with characteristic conviction the foreign affairs committee be set up a sub committee that will engage the overseas territory more of course i be a strong voice along with many other people here for the overseas territory and will continue to be so 
 what information his department hold on the number of uk national who have die follow surgical procedure in turkey in the last year 
 we be aware of british national who have die in turkey follow elective medical procedure since the uk government continue to engage actively with the turkish government on how to support the safety of patient who travel to turkey for medical treatment 
 i thank the minister for that answer that be far too many people who have die many gruesome death have occur follow cosmetic surgery in turkey the family of my constituent year old shannon witness the most agonising horrific death as she lie on a table convulse for some hour 
 as far as i be aware not once have foreign office ministers raise those needless death with turkish government official furthermore a pitiful byline of travel advice on the gov.uk website be simply not good enough will the minister investigate an advertising suspension in collaboration with cabinet colleague and regulator for country know for dangerous health tourism as a possible way to avoid further death like shannon ’s 
 we raise that issue with our turkish counterpart at many level we will always look at what more we can do but the head of mission in ankara be seize of the urgency and importance of the issue and be work in close collaboration with the turkish authority 
 what step his department be take to help secure the release of israeli hostage in gaza 
 what step he be take to support effort to secure the release of hostage hold by hamas in gaza 
 we have be work tirelessly to secure the release of all hostage include british national since   october 
 last week the un publish its report into the violence against woman in israel on   october   and against hostage it conclude that rape gang rape and genital mutilation be systematically use against israeli woman and girl the fact that the victim who survive do not trust the un enough to speak to it about their experience add another layer of heartbreak to the situation what will my right hon friend the minister do to urge the un to make it a priority to rebuild trust and tell the world that metoo count for jews too 
 the world very much need the united nations and i completely recognise the position that my hon friend so eloquently describe we will do everything we can as a lead member of the united nations of the p5 to try to improve that relationship on the appalling event of october which she describe we be do everything we can to try to help as i set out early 
 the hostage have be in captivity for more than day the new york times have report that of the hostage still in captivity may have be kill give that israeli citizen have be in captivity in gaza for more than year do my right hon friend the minister agree that there must absolutely be a commitment to return the hostage before we can move to a humanitarian ceasefire 
 yes my hon friend be absolutely correct he set out the position extremely well it be a top focus of all part of the british government to try to get the hostage back as i set out early the prime minister and the international court of justice have call for their immediate release although i can not give a running commentary we be work closely with the us qatar and egypt to secure their release 
 in the past month israeli and palestinian civilian have bear the brunt of this conflict we be get only the slight glimpse of the rape torture hostage taking and murder that be go on will the minister tell we what our   atrocity prevention team and prevent sexual violence team be do on the ground to document and stop that 
 we be very clear that we seek to document atrocity so that people can be hold to account no matter how long it take i set out early the additional funding specifically to help woman who have be the subject of appal sexual violence i be grateful to the hon lady and the international development committee for their visit to the region on the issue that she raise the british government ’s position be that there can be no impunity 
 the utter tragedy in the middle east be that innocent civilian on both side be pay the price for fail politic and extremism to take the minister back to his answer to the chair of the foreign affairs committee if he accept that israel have the capacity to meet international law he be say be he not that israel be in breach of it 
 no i be not say that i be say that the current judgment of the british government be that israel have both the capacity and the intent to abide within international humanitarian law it be an issue that we keep under review as the hon gentleman will understand 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 on the question of britain ’s priority in ukraine gaza and across the world the government be deliver at the munich security conference the g20 in brazil and the united nations the foreign secretary have argue for stand by ukraine as the invasion enter its year on gaza we be press with partner for a humanitarian pause and increase aid flow to palestinian civilian we have expand the blue belt defend shipping in the red sea and launch an innovative development partnership with qatar the international development white paper be be implement across government and have be widely welcome around the world 
 follow recent event in ukraine what step have be take to speed up the process of release fund from the sale of chelsea football club to support all victim of the war in ukraine wherever they be in the world 
 the hon lady be quite right that release those fund be take far too long there be significant complication address the release which involve the european union and portugal as well as britian i can tell she however that there be renew energy in the foreign office to try to bring this matter to a head as swiftly as possible 
 the international atomic energy agency have recently make an assessment that enough uranium have be enrich in iran to produce atomic warhead if that be true what be the government ’s consideration regard snap back sanction on iran 
 these enrichment level have no credible civilian justification we be work with partner to ensure that iran never develop a nuclear weapon be prepared to use all diplomatic option include trigger un snapback if necessary and will continue to monitor the situation very closely 
 i call the shadow minister 
 next month be the anniversary of a full year of unmitigated horror in sudan on friday the security council call for an immediate ramadan ceasefire and i know that our excellent diplomat and the minister be pivotal in that resolution the african union the arab league and members across this house echo that call but the violence have not stop if the war party continue to refuse to listen how can the government work with partner to step up the pressure 
 the hon lady be quite right to raise the appalling position in sudan which to some extent have be mask by other terrible event in the world she will be pleased to hear that thank to british leadership at the united nations a new security council resolution be pass i believe last friday we be seek to bring together all the different party to try to make progress so that the next round of talk possibly in jeddah will be more successful than the last britain condemn any arming of either party inside sudan we be seek also through the work of our diplomatic mission in khartoum currently base in addis to help build civil society so that a political track can emerge 
 as the prime minister ’s trade envoy to key latin american market i have see at hand the work that his majesty ’s government and the uk private sector be do to help with the responsible extraction of key mineral such as lithium with the drive to net accelerating those mineral will only become more important and competition be increase what diplomatic step be the department take to strengthen the uk ’s security and its economic relation with country in latin america 
 we be grateful for the outstanding work of our well respect trade envoy my hon friend do amazing work trade and security be central tenet of the uk ’s relationship with latin america join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership create huge opportunity for business in latin america and in the uk and as my hon friend be aware sustainable and reliable supply chain for critical mineral include lithium be key i look forward to meet the bolivian vice president this afternoon 
 state hood be the inalienable right of palestinian people and not in the gift of any neighbour so do the minister agree that no country have the right to veto the uk ’s recognition of a palestinian state 
 the british government have always make it clear that they will recognise the palestinian state when they think the time be right and such recognition would be helpful 
 the belarusian company alutech have somehow manage to circumvent sanction and set up in the uk in direct competition with its business partner dewsbury base alunet whose turnover have be halve from £ to £ and have shed job as a result of that unfair competition will the minister agree to meet with i and director of alunet to discuss how we can resolve this terrible situation 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this important issue as he know some of our official have meet representative of the company concern and we be continue to take action to close gap between our russian and belarusian sanction we keep they under constant review i would be very happy to meet with my hon friend to discuss the belarusian sanction far 
 the prime minister and foreign secretary have be clear that we must be bold seize hundred of billion of pound of frozen russian asset to support the ukraine war effort and that we must get hold of the interest on those asset in february the prime minister say 
 and then with the g7 we must find lawful way to seize the asset themselves and get those fund to ukraine too 
 can the minister update the house on progress within the g7 
 the hon gentleman be right to ask that question we be make progress but he be also right to point out that what we do need to be lawful that be the key thing and that be what we be work on 
 would the minister for development and africa please update the house on his recent visit to ethiopia 
 i thank my hon friend for her question i be recently in ethiopia and be able to visit tigray and the edge of the most food insecure area where as the house will know starvation and food shortage be rise alarmingly the situation be as if a football be be kick at a plate glass window we have the power to alter its trajectory but if we do not it will smash that window that be why britain be set up a pledge conference work closely with the united nations and a contact group on ethiopia in the next financial year we be increase our bilateral funding very significantly 
 while the world look the other way sudan be suffer from a catastrophe with people displace with no healthcare whatsoever and go hungry what little aid there be be not get in and all aid across the conflict line have be suspend since last december what effort be the minister make to advocate for additional crossing point for aid to get in to chad and south sudan and across the conflict line and will he attend the aid conference in paris next month 
 yes i do expect to attend that conference i speak regularly to counterpart in the african union the united arab emirates and saudi arabia and speak last night to tom perriello the new us special envoy for sudan we work very closely with the intergovernmental authority on development and the troika we understand that the violence in darfur bear all the hallmark of ethnic cleansing and be fund an open source organisation the centre for information resilience to keep account of those event so that there can be no impunity in that respect either 
 do my right hon friend agree that in order to see palestinian self determination we need an end to human right abuse antisemitism and the glorification of violence and we need palestinians free from hamas 
 we certainly agree with my hon friend ’s last point about a palestine free from hamas there be no place for hamas in the future government of palestine on the point he make about how we proceed far the government be absolutely clear that there be no place in our society or anywhere else for that matter for islamophobia or antisemitism 
 israeli minister benny gantz be the only person to have be grant a special mission status certificate by the foreign office since the beginning of last year in effect protect he from arrest for his part in suspect breach of international law accord to report israel do not grant gantz ’s delegation official status so can the minister explain why the uk government still choose to provide diplomatic cover for this individual 
 whatever the position of the israeli government let i assure the hon member that benny gantz be receive in this country he be see by the foreign secretary and his visit be most welcome 
 the minister will know that european security continue to be underpin by the usa which fund the vast majority of the nato budget could i please ask he what be be do to coerce more of our nato ally to meet their commitment and do he agree that european nation must shoulder more of the burden for our own security for good strategic reason 
 i do agree that we must put our money where our mouth be but as we survey the landscape of european and atlantic security on the anniversary of nato we see with the accession of finland and sweden that nato be in very good order indeed 
 i acknowledge what the minister of state say about sanction certain west bank settler although seem a very low number to i have he raise the activity of those settler with his opposite number in the israeli government 
 the british government have certainly raise those activity with the israeli government that be why we have ask that they should be arrest prosecute and punish for those activity on those who may or may not be subject to a sanction regime   we keep that fully under review but the hon member will understand why i think it be good not to discuss that across the floor of the house 
 have any foreign office minister official or embassy member have any discussion with our american ally over the dysfunctional extradition treaty since the disgraceful end of the sacoolas case 
 my right hon friend ask an extremely good question he and i have co operate on this matter many time in the past if he would be so good as to table a question on this matter i will make sure that he immediately get a full answer to that question 
 when jeffrey sachs a un adviser from a jewish american family incidentally say on camera 
 israel have deliberately starve the people of gaza i be not use an exaggeration i ’m talk literally starve a population israel be a criminal be in non stop war crime status now i believe in genocidal status and it be without shame without remorse without truth without insight into what it ’ do 
 and add 
 this be a murderous gang in government right now these be zealot 
 do that not give the uk government pause to reflect on the funding of unrwa and to call for a ceasefire and the recognition of palestine which of un member state have do rather than see it wipe off the map 
 i think almost nothing that the hon gentleman have just say could possibly be deem helpful in try to bring the side together achieve a pause get the hostage out get aid in and achieve a sustainable ceasefire therefore i be afraid i be unable to offer any reassurance on any of the point he make 
 last week child age between and be kidnap from their school in nigeria that come on top of christians who be kill for their faith last year what be we do about it 
 my right hon friend be right about these appalling event and the high commission in abuja have raise these matter our hon friend   the member for congleton fiona bruce who be responsible for freedom of religion or belief regularly focus on what be happen in nigeria and make representation which also ensure that the foreign office be keep up to the mark in pursue it 
 canada be to resume funding for unrwa have receive un report have the uk government receive such report be they be review and when will that review be conclude and decision be make 
 we be ask that we have an interim report on both the key report as soon as possible and we will look at those report as soon as they arrive and make our decision accordingly during the course of these question i have adumbrate both those who be support the same position as the uk and those who   be restore funding immediately the hon gentleman will want to bear in mind that britain have fully fund unrwa for its share up until the next financial year 
 i call the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
 haiti be on the edge of collapse and only nautical mile away be the turks and caicos island for whose national security the uk have responsibility will the foreign office fulfil its role by request of the ministry of defence and the home office that we deploy hms trent with its defensive capability deploy royal marine fast boat provide asset monitor in the sea lane and increase the police footprint in tci too often we have act too slowly which in the past that have result in threat to remove tci from our overseas family please can we act now 
 i assure my hon friend that i be recently in tci and i understand the situation there we have see a rise in the number of people make the dangerous journey by sea from haiti to tci we have put in place serious crime investigator and firearm officer and we be work with the home office and the mod in building capability and capacity in this important situation 
 i listen carefully as i always do to what the minister say regard call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire but it be now time to step up it require all war party to stop the rocket the bomb and the bullet exactly right and    for the hostage to be release surely it would send a very strong signal if the uk government now call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for what he have say he will have hear the key priority that the british government have put on the table and i be grateful to he for his agreement cross party support be extremely helpful in drive forward an imperative about which britain feel very strongly 
 will his majesty ’s government make the strong possible diplomatic protest against the draconian new national security law be impose on the good people of hong kong and do the minister accept that britain still have a moral responsibility to the people of hong kong who have be loyal to this country for so many year 
 my hon friend raise an important point and we continue to raise our concern about breach of the sino british joint declaration that we see and about this new layer of legislation come through we consider that that continue to be in breach and we continue to ask for those law to be remove 
 do the minister agree that the alleged detention beating and humiliation of palestinian medic at the nasser hospital last month need to be investigate by the international criminal court yes or no 
 this session end with the same question with which it start and as i set out we believe there must be accountability and we have make that clear to the israeli authority 
 with permission mr speaker i shall make a statement about criminal justice in england and wales 
 keep our people safe require a relentless focus on cut crime cut reoffending and make sure that those who pose the great risk be imprison for as long as necessary to protect the public that be why it be welcome that crime have fall significantly over the last decade in particular with fall of over since for offence of violence and burglary in addition the reoffende rate have fall over the last decade from to that have happen not by accident but as a result of prioritise measure range from the tagging of acquisitive offender post release to give the police the power they need such as stop and search 
 at the same time to take the bad offender out of society for long we have take action on sentencing and those commit the most serious crime be   be sentence to long behind bar that be because we act to end the injustice of automatic release at the halfway point for the bad offender instead of get out at the mark come what may serious sexual and violent criminal must now serve at least third of their sentence in custody rapist be now serve nearly year long on average than they do in and we be go even far by legislate to ensure that rapist service their whole term behind bar 
 secondly we have increase sentence maximum for the bad offender such as those who cause death by dangerous driving or who cause the death of a child and as a result of our reform currently before the house those who kill in the context of sexual or sadistic behaviour will in future expect to spend the rest of their natural life behind bar life should mean life for those who commit the most heinous crime 
 thirdly we have introduce a power to enable the secretary of state to block the release of offender such as robert brown where release would pose an unacceptable risk to society 
 meanwhile we be push ahead with the big prison building programme since the victorian era we be on track to deliver new prison place by the end of and be commit to build place overall today i can announce that we be go even far to make sure that we have the prison place we need to continue lock up serious and violent offender for long i want to focus in particular on foreign national offender whom i will call fno 
 the number of fno have increase over recent year to around of prisoner in england and wales at an average cost to the taxpayer of around £ per prisoner per year these foreign criminal be not only put a strain on the public purse but reduce the capacity of the prison system we believe that they should wherever possible be remove back to their country of origin and we have make progress last year the government return from prison and the    community nearly foreign criminal which be a increase on the year before and we be go far 
 in october i set out in the house our plan to reduce the fno population we have extend the early removal scheme from a maximum period of month to month so that eligible fno can be deport up to month early almost have already be remove from the uk through this and similar scheme since january that be a increase compare with the equivalent period a year early we have also sign a robust new agreement with albania which have restart transfer of albanian offender the large single cohort in our prison and we be legislate in the criminal justice bill to rent prison overseas as other european country have do 
 this be important progress but we must build on it by make sure that even more fno be remove from the country and spurious barrier to their removal be quickly remove i can tell the house that we will radically change the way that fno case be process we have create a new taskforce across the home office and ministry of justice include the prison service immigration enforcement and the asylum and modern slavery team we have surge additional caseworker who will be in place by the end of march to prioritise these case and we will streamline the end to end removal process 
 we be also expand the number of fno we can remove for example by bring forward legislation to allow we to remove foreign offender with limited leave to remain under conditional caution and amend our deportation policy so that we can remove those on suspend sentence of month or more we be make more use of the diplomatic lever we have to remove people back to their home country include by expedite prisoner transfer with our priority country conclude new transfer agreement with partner country such as italy and be prepared to make use of the power provide under the nationality and borders act to restrict visa for any country where no progress on fno removal can be make that will allow we to deport more fno directly from prison in more than double the we remove last year and more than in any year since 
 let i now turn to the unsustainable growth in our remand population since the pandemic and the criminal bar association action this be important when covid hit we be confront with momentous judgment call the be whether to order mass release of prisoner public health advice in this country as in many other be to release thousand and thousand of prisoner give fear that the pandemic would rip through the prison estate and take countless life we decline to do that and in the event although every death be of course a tragedy the total number of life lose in prison be under thank to the excellent effort of his majesty ’s prison and probation service officer other nation take a different approach in america where i discuss the matter recently with my counterpart ten of thousand be release in california alone the figure be in france nearly be release it be for each nation to take their own course but i be clear that we make the right decision for public safety in our country 
 the judgment call be whether to heed the clamour to end jury trial i believe that would have be a grave mistake shatter a fundamental british freedom and dismantle the centrepiece of our justice system the decision that we make be right for access to justice right for public protection and right as a matter of principle but have contribute to the increase in the number of defendant hold on remand while await trial or sentencing by over since to about today 
 let i turn to what we be do on pre trial detention the lady chief justice have confirm that if bail application be make to the magistrate court or renew before the crown court the court stand ready to hear they within the short time limit provide in the criminal procedure rule we be also explore at pace with the judiciary the roll out of a remote nationwide pilot crown court capable of hear new bail application the pilot would monitor whether these additional measure result in an increase in the use of tag and appropriate support package in bail application 
 to support that the government will invest £ of additional funding to expand the bail information service part of the productivity package announce by the chancellor at the budget which will enable our court system to operate as efficiently as possible by increase the court base staff and digital system that can provide critical information to the judiciary make the bail process more streamlined to support that work a furth £ of additional funding will be available over the next year to fund community accommodation we will also increase awareness about the availability of tag especially high tech gps and alcohol monitor tag to ensure that offender can be monitor in the community where appropriate 
 we will also extend the exist end of custody supervise licence measure to around to day we will enable that to happen for a time limit period and work with the police prison and probation leader to make further adjustment as require that will be only for certain low level offender where necessary electronic monitoring will be apply to enhance public protection minister will of course continue to keep use of this measure under review the extension have be request and support by leader in the prison service and the police 
 all these measure rely on a probation service that focus its resource on the most critical point of the justice system especially when an offender be release from prison in the government reunify the probation service which bring together all probation function into a single national organisation we have invest £ of extra funding each year in the service and onboarde more than trainee probation officer since then and i will be take step to refocus probation practice on the point that matter most to public protection and reduce offending 
 from april we will reset probation so that practitioner prioritise early engagement at the point where offender be most likely to breach their licence condition that will allow frontline staff to maximise supervision of the most serious offender similarly for those manage on community order and suspend sentence order probation practitioner will ensure that intervention and engagement be prioritise towards the third of the sentence as experience show that that most effectively rehabilitate offender to be clear   none of the change will apply to those convict of the most serious offence include those subject to multi agency public protection arrangement 
 i express my deep gratitude for the effort of all those work in the criminal justice system prison probation and court staff the police prosecutor lawyer and the independent judiciary they be exceptional public servant the government will do what be necessary to remove foreign national offender from our country and we will do whatever it take to ensure that the british people be keep safe from the most dangerous criminal i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i be grateful to the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement late in the hour of yesterday evening the government try to slip out quietly an announcement that they will be release prisoner up to month early to deal with the lack of space in our prison let we be in no doubt that this be the most drastic form of early release for prisoner that the country have ever see yet in the secretary of state ’s page minute statement it merit just paragraph this measure will cause shockwave and deep concern across our country and he seem to think that a quiet write ministerial statement publish late last night and paragraph today be good enough it be not 
 prisoner will now be release not day early but up to an unprecedented day early no other government have ever find themselves have to do that on such a scale it be nearly time the number of day on licence see under any previous scheme let i be clear that there be consequence this scheme will seem wrong in principle to victim and the public that people who have do wrong and have be sentence under due process of law can be release as much as month before a court intend that mean that people who have break the law and in many case pose an ongoing threat to the law abide public be directly benefit from the government ’s complete incompetence 
 it be small wonder that the government have refuse all request to be transparent about the scale and the impact of the scheme that be no way to run the criminal justice system or indeed the country not least because when the secretary of state announce the scheme last october he be explicit that the power would 
 be use only for a limited period and only in target area 
 he say that the scheme be to be 
 a temporary operational measure to relieve immediate pressure ”—[official report   october vol c. 
 last month we learn from a leak to the medium that the scheme have be expand to more prison and accord to unpublished guidance to prison governor activate for an undefined period he will surely acknowledge that this will strike many people as a novel definition of temporary 
 now we learn that the scheme be due to be expand very significantly an unprecedented day ahead of when a prisoner would ordinarily be release i repeat the question that i raise all those month ago how many prisoner have be release early under the scheme to date which prison be use the early release scheme which type of offender be be   release early under the scheme be domestic abuser and stalker eligible for release under the scheme why have it be expand to early release of up to day why have the scheme be activate indefinitely will the secretary of state finally commit to publish all the relevant statistic about the early release scheme on the same basis that prison datum be publish on a weekly basis rather than the wholly inadequate commitment to publish on an annual basis not least because there will have be a general election before then 
 the secretary of state have acknowledge at last that all the change put real and profoundly concern additional pressure on our already overstretch and understaffed probation service he tell we that there will be a reset for probation to ensure that it prioritise early engagement but it be not clear what that mean or what part of its vital work he be suggest probation officer will not do as a result of today ’s statement what be glaringly absent be any additional resource to support the thousand of case that will now have their release date bring forward 
 it be wholly inevitable that rush out such measure will increase the risk to the public i hope the secretary of state will have the honesty to admit that in his response again what measure have be put in place to ensure that probation have the time and the resource to assess risk adequately and protect the public have there be a risk assessment of the expansion if so will he publish it how will the government ensure that inexperienced probation staff be not leave unsupported to supervise dangerous offender 
 the government tell we that they will free up more space in our prison by crack down on the number of foreign national offender who be take up space that we can ill afford to spare when they have no right to be in this country the secretary of state have not point out that the number that the government deport last year be significantly low than those they inherit in 2010—5,383 foreign national offender be deport in the last year of the labour government meanwhile thousand of foreign national offender be live in the community post release for several year without be remove we welcome any improvement that the government intend to make on this pretty poor record but if the public be to believe that any of these measure will make the necessary difference the secretary of state need a more credible plan such as a new return and enforcement unit with up to new staff more than double his announce today 
 unprecedented be a term that be far too often bandy around in politic but these change be by any measure truly extraordinary the secretary of state have not be transparent with this house or with the public they deserve answer and it be about time that he start give they 
 i thank the hon lady for her point she address a number of issue but not the fact that when labour be in government it run a similar scheme for year do she want to explain how many be release during that scheme i be sure that she will welcome the opportunity to update the house she talk about risk and she be right to raise these important issue but it be also important that we set they out clearly and calmly unlike the labour scheme in   which those who have be sentence to under month be release with no licence condition everyone will have a licence condition we need to be clear about what that mean under labour ’s scheme which run for year there be no licence condition at all under our scheme there will be licence condition 
 secondly labour ’s scheme operate in a blanket way across every prison ours be target and calibrate thirdly and importantly under this scheme there will be the opportunity for a gold command veto where the governor have concern about an individual—[interruption if the hon lady could just listen for a moment those concern will be escalate to a panel of senior official who will make a decision base on the offender ’s history the propose bail address and the condition that could be impose not to contact not to enter to abide by a curfew or potentially to be tag if the governor have concern about safety that person will not be release that safeguard be not available under the labour scheme which run for year it be critical to prioritise public safety which be our focus 
 in the hon lady ’s response there be the eloquent sound of silence in relation to the specific question that this government and every government around the world face should we have let out thousand of prisoner she have give no answer to that question but it be important because if she aspire to stand here she will have to say whether that should have take place not do so have contribute to the pressure that we face but it would have be the wrong thing to do because it would have prioritise prisoner safety over public safety we do not do it and we be right not to do it principle have a cost and we have take a sensible decision 
 the thing that the hon lady do not address be whether we should have listen to those who clamour for the end of jury trial i do not think she be suggest that we should have but there be an inevitable effect to that when we come into office the number of case in the crown court be around pre covid it be but as it have go up inevitably as a result of keep the jury trial system a high proportion of people have be in custody await trial that be a matter of remorseless arithmetic logic there be an additional people now we make the right decision but we have to take a sensible step 
 the final point that the hon lady fail to address be what she would have do in these circumstance she know as i know that she would have take exactly the same step to seek to make political capital be beneath she 
 i call the chair of the justice committee 
 i commend the secretary of state for his characteristically thoughtful and measured approach do he agree that it do no any good service to try to reduce this issue to simplistic argument the truth be that deal with prison capacity where everyone have recognise for many year that there be real pressure demand a careful set of check and balance do my right hon and learn friend agree that those be in place do he also agree that we need to be honest with the public in say that however much we try prison place be expensive and finite therefore the system must make judicious and intelligent use of prison which include   lock up those who be dangerous and have alternative way of deal with and punish those who be not dangerous to the community be that not the objective 
 my hon friend make an exceptional point we have to proceed on the basis of evidence not emotion we choose to lock up the most dangerous offender for long which be why those who murder in the context of sexual or sadistic behaviour should be in custody for the rest of their life because the threat to the population be so great where people can be reform use technology which be not available a long time ago we should use that not just because that work as a matter of common sense but because the data show that it work 
 on my hon friend ’s specific point anyone who look at this issue calmly and in an adult way will see that there have be pressure in moment in history there be in and another in when jack straw have a terrible argument with lord falconer about the use of cell in inner london crown court those of we who have be in the system remember that the key be whether to deal with that in a sensible calibrated and proportionate way we will take every step to look after the safety of the public and we will not score political point in the process 
 last week the prisons minister and i visit wormwood scrubs where we find double up in single cell with unshielded toilet and overcrowding affect people ’s time out of cell and access to work the education service be describe as poor and food budget be £ a day staff tell we that assault on officer be not be prosecute what be the lord chancellor do to improve condition in our victorian prison as that be vital for the welfare of staff the rehabilitation of prisoner and the protection of the public 
 i commend the hon gentleman for visit his local prison as do so be extremely valuable and i be grateful for his feedback he raise a number of issue and i would be happy to write to he but may i just deal with thing in particular we ask prison officer to do an extremely difficult job they need to be robust but sometimes they have to be sensitive to assist they in do so we be ensure that they be pay properly and so we accept every last penny of the prison service pay review body recommendation secondly we be roll out body wear video so that they know that if a situation look like it be escalate the evidence will be there that provide a powerful deterrent effect thirdly and finally we be reduce attrition i hope he will agree that experienced prison officer be the one who can make those tough decision on when to be tough and when metaphorically speak to offer that hand of support 
 clearly there be pressure on the prison estate i appreciate that some of the challenge to the justice secretary ’s statement today be about many thinking that we be not keep in prison people who should be there but there be also a problem of some people be send to prison who should not be there he will be aware of my police officer constituent who minute be hail a hero for apprehend a violent criminal and the next find himself in wandsworth prison 
 there be a slight irony give this statement that the government intend to put further pressure on the estate through clause in their criminal justice bill propose the imprisonment of beggar and rough sleeper give what he be say today will he consider support the amendment table by my hon friend   the member for harrow east bob blackman and support by myself my hon friend   the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken   and many other from across this house that would remove the intention to imprison rough sleeper and beggar 
 my hon friend assiduously raise matter on behalf of her constituent and be go to be such a loss to this house she indicate in that question why she will be of course i can not comment on the specific circumstance relate to her constituent because of the independent trial process the criminal justice bill contain home office measure but i will ensure that the home secretary be aware of the point she have raise 
 the number of case dispose of by our court be down by from its pre pandemic level a reduction of what be the secretary of state do to eliminate that backlog what impact do he think there will be on prison number in the event that he be successful 
 that be a fair question it be always worth remember that more than of case be dispose of in the magistrate court where we be get through a very significant number he make a fair point about the crown court because we be prosecute more rape offence than before so the plea rate be low because guess what?—people do not plead guilty to rape in the way that they might plead guilty to handle steal good for example so we address that by put additional money into the system with £ go into legal aid and by ensure that section be use with pre recorded video evidence and so on we make no apology for the fact that we have to let the system take its course on these appalling crime and we will do everything we can to increase resource so that people victim and witness get the justice they deserve 
 i very much support the carefully consider move announce today by my right hon and learn friend which reflect the reality of the pressure on our prison estate and on our excellent prison officer follow the extraordinary impact of covid i especially welcome the additional step he have announce to remove more foreign national offender he speak of a reset in probation so will he set out in a little more detail how he hop it will reduce reoffende and so cut crime what we all want to see of course be few victim of crime 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for raise that point probation be critical and i have make a point since come into this role of speak not only to senior probation officer important though they be but to probation officer on the frontline that have be an incredibly instructive experience i speak to in luton and dunstable tell i that the measure we have take to roll out week guarantee accommodation be the most significant step that any government have take in the year he have be a probation   officer the reset i refer to will follow evidence not emotion in other word it will allow probation officer to calibrate and prioritise their resource to those part of the licence period where reoffende be most likely to take place that be common sense and it follow the evidence ultimately measure such as that be why reoffende have go down from to thus save a number of people from be victim of crime in the place 
 i thank the minister for a comprehensive response as always he be certainly across his subject it be great that action have be take to ease prisoner overcrowding an element of concern must however be express at the thought of criminal be release early even though their crime be be deem low level what procedure will be follow to ensure that those be consider for early release pose absolutely no threat to the public what be the minister ’s plan should reoffend upon release 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that matter because it be important that we in this house no matter where we sit ensure that a clear and accurate message go to the public the people who be out will be out on condition if a condition be breach this be not necessarily about commit an offence not only will they be recall for the period of the end of custody supervise licence but they could be recall for the entire balance of their sentence that be an important point to understand we could be talk about a contact condition a residence condition a co operate with probation condition or a not to go to strangford town centre condition these thing be important condition to ensure that the public be protect and society be keep safe 
 i welcome today ’s statement on foreign national offender but this be ultimately about law abide british people do the justice secretary agree that we should instantaneously remove any right to remain at the end of their sentence for those who abuse our hospitality by commit the most serious crime 
 my hon friend be absolutely right about this people who come to our country and enjoy its hospitality should expect short shrift if they repay that with crime because that be an offence against not just the individual but our entire community that be why we be take robust action to deport foreign national offender i be afraid to say that this be action not share by the opposition in a letter be send to the then prime minister urge he not to allow a planeload of foreign national offender to take off who sign it it be the shadow secretary of state 
 be the lord chancellor alive to a principal concern and source of frustration among crown court judge the frequent delisting of case at short notice with all the consequence that then follow for delay and increase number of prisoner on remand occasion by a grow shortage of criminal barrister that in turn will lead to a reduction in both the quantity and quality of future judge 
 i be so grateful to my right hon friend for raise that issue because ensure that there be a vibrant profession be crucial not only in order for the machine of justice to continue but to provide the pipeline to which he refer as for the specific issue of list or delist as he refer to it that be a judicial discretion it be a matter for the judge however he be right about want to ensure that there be a pipeline which be why we be invest more than £ into legal aid so that instead of talented young professional think i be off to the private sector to earn a fortune at the chancery bar they will be there at the legal aid bar follow in the footstep of my hon friend   the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill the chair of the justice committee prosecute and defend criminal so that we can ensure that justice be serve in our country 
 do my right hon and learn friend agree that under the new scheme victim will see justice prevail while foreign national offender will efficiently be process to leave the country that contrast with what happen under the previous labour government who have people who have already serve their sentence languish in prison beyond their sentence while the deportation court catch up with the process 
 my hon friend be absolutely right it be a matter of basic justice the british people expect that those who offend against our country as well as against victim of crime should receive short shrift that be why we be absolutely clear that if violent thug who rape murder steal and rob be in our country from overseas we will put they on a plane and get they out

 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to require provider of electronic communication network to allow their customer to access certain public sector website free of charge and for connected purpose 
 it be a pleasure to present the bill which would make a significant difference to the financial security of so many struggle household up and down the country as we all know the cost of living crisis have squeeze the household finance of million the last thing our constituent need when they be already worry about choose between heat their home or put food on the table be to run out of datum to access vital public service on the internet 
 in october the digital inclusion all party parliamentary group find that nearly household in the uk be struggle to pay for broadband nearly double the number in the year before indeed a citizens advice study in may last year report that of household survey say they have have to cut back or stop spend on broadband entirely during the previous month for those on universal credit the situation be even starker the study find that of claimant say they be behind on their broadband bill compare with just of non claimant some of universal credit claimant who say they have to cut down on their internet usage due to cost also find it difficult to manage their universal credit account as a result 
 in an age when we be increasingly able to access public service via the internet particularly via mobile browser we must ensure that we do not leave people behind during this digital revolution our reliance on the internet become acutely clear during the pandemic nhs digital record visit to nhs webpage between october and september with visit to the vaccination book page the increase prevalence of public information and resource available online be a good thing as a former nhs worker i know it have the capacity to make our public service more efficient more agile and well value for money for taxpayer but be able to access the nhs website should not be constrain by someone ’s financial situation likewise someone on universal credit should not have to worry about not be able to access their account because of their datum allowance simply put we know that those with the great need to access online service be often the one face the great barrier to do so 
 during the pandemic operator such as vodafone ee virgin media o2 and give their customer free online access to the nhs website covid information the nhs app and online education resource such as bbc bitesize and oak national academy the operator recognise the huge surge in need and the barrier that some people would face as a result this procedure be know as rating whereby access any of those website would not consume a user ’s mobile datum allowance indeed since the pandemic virgin media o2 and continue to offer rating to their customer   for various public service website after see what a vital help it can be for the least well off during the cost of living crisis my bill simply propose that we continue the good work that some operator have already do by extend this precedent into a legal requirement for all network provider operate in the uk by make the gov.uk and nhs.uk site rat we can extend universal free access to the most vital service such as universal credit local authority service and nhs health information to everyone no matter their financial situation 
 rat public service website be by no mean a silver bullet but it would help to ease of the many financial burden that household currently face by give user free access to gov.uk webpage for instance we could ease some of the financial pressure and stress for some of the most vulnerable in society many household rely on a mobile phone for all their internet access but they be often dependent on expensive datum top up to stay online by remove cost from gov.uk and nhs.uk site household who visit these service will not have their datum affect and will still be able to access they even when they be out of datum 
 in my constituency of wakefield we have a fantastic organisation call wakefield technology all which provide vital digital access support as well as digital device themselves to so many household a young woman who come to its support hub last year need help to rebuild her life after multiple incident of sexual violence as well as have a tight budget to support herself and her child she have to deal with have no carpet no bed and no curtain what she do have be a donated laptop from wakefield technology all but she struggle to find money for datum access website for government service the nhs and local council service would often be reactive and unplanned and she would often find herself run out of datum when she need to access those vital service during unimaginably stressful circumstance she would have to rely on see someone face to face at another location or simply do without the service until she be able to purchase   more credit 
 many of the poor and most vulnerable household have enough on their plate without the constant worry about how they will access crucial public service and information if their datum allowance run out my constituent should not have to worry about the lack of datum prevent they from access the vital public service and information they need
