 i thank the minister for that answer nuclear must be an important part of our energy security strategy it be both clean and reliable and create good job for local community what more can the secretary of state do to encourage and incentivise new nuclear power in wales and across all part of the united kingdom 
 as the hon gentleman will know great british energy nuclear have confirm that subject to final government approval and contract signature it have select rolls royce smr to build the uk ’s small modular reactor no decision have yet be take on siting we will be set out our plan in due course far to that as i have already mention the project at sizewell c will create enough power for home and in the peak of construction support job it will boost supply chain across the uk some of the construction value be predict to go to british supplier include company such as william hare group in south wales support new job in construction welding and hospitality 
 i be thrilled to hear that boccard will today be open its new nuclear manufacturing facility in north wales do the minister agree that north wales have the skill and the site to realise the economic potential of our nuclear industry and labour governments ready to deliver on it 
 absolutely i agree with my hon friend i be very pleased indeed today that boccard be open its new nuclear manufacturing facility in deeside this be an example of the uk government and the welsh government work together to onshore our nuclear supply chain thus safeguard job in this instance and create in excess of new position 
 what discussion she have have with the welsh government on the potential impact of the spending review on wales 
 what discussion she have have with the welsh government on the potential impact of the spending review on wales 
 through the spending review we be provide a record £ per year on average for the welsh government invest   at least £ in welsh rail invest £ a year in local growth funding and provide £ of new funding for coal tip safety this labour government be invest in wales ’s economy public service and people we have end conservative austerity 
 i be pleased to see funding for a number of transport project in wales in the spending review not least because my city of edinburgh be now link directly by rail to the secretary of state ’s city of cardiff lumo which run service in scotland through open access be hop to begin a service through south wales do the minister agree with i that the spending review present a fantastic opportunity for such project which create job strengthen the union and boost the uk ’s economy 
 i very much agree with the hon lady about the benefit to the union of the significant investment that this government be make in transport i be very happy to take away her comment on lumo and open access and talk to the rail minister on her behalf 
 i be pleased to hear the secretary of state explain in evidence to the welsh affairs committee last week that wales will receive a barnett consequential of some £ as a result of transport announcement for english mayoral combine authority area make in the lead up to the spending review could the secretary of state clarify whether she be refer to the transport for city region funding which be announce on   june the chief secretary to the treasury state in an answer to a write question that it be not possible to identify the specific barnett consequential arise from that programme 
 my understanding be that the just over £ figure that i refer to in my evidence to the welsh affairs committee relate to the combined mayoral authority announcement that be make prior to the spending review 
 i call the chair of the welsh affairs committee 
 i be delighted that the £ announce for the steel industry in the spending review have already be translate into boot on the ground and high vis jacket with the commencement of the building of the electric arc furnace safeguard job will the secretary of state join i in welcome the fantastic progress that have already be make in the steel industry and in supply chain all across wales 
 i thank the chair of the welsh affairs committee for her question monday be a really significant day for welsh steelmaking i be at the groundbreaking ceremony to begin construction of the electric arc furnace which will be of the large in the world secure job and the future of steelmaking in port talbot for year to come it have be make possible by £ of investment include £ from this government as well as our £ to support worker and the wide steel community and will benefit not just port talbot but downstream site this have be a really challenging time for steelworker across wales but i think this week mark a real turning point secure a bright future for year to come 
 as a result of the uk government ’s half a pound investment in the future of steel in port talbot construction have now begin on the new electric arc furnace will the secretary of state share what this fantastic news mean for port talbot and the surround community like my own of neath and swansea east 
 the government ’s investment in the electric arc furnace show how serious our commitment be to the steel industry not just in south wales but across the uk it be why we have slash energy cost for steel producer and other energy intensive industry through the industrial strategy strengthen procurement rule to use even more uk steel in construction ensure that the uk be the only country in the world not pay tariff to the united states and boost trade defence to protect the sector against foreign import the steel strategy which we will publish later in the year will also deliver up to £ of investment to help to maintain job and growth 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the uk government say that wales be get record break funding to tackle nhs waiting list but for my constituent melanie walker the reality be the opposite after wait week for a hip operation she have now be tell she must wait another because powys teaching health board be artificially extend waiting time for patient treat in shropshire and   herefordshire to match low welsh average a cost cut move drive by the welsh government do the secretary of state think that be fair to melanie or consistent with her government ’s pledge to reduce waiting time 
 i be very sorry to hear about melanie ’s situation however i would say to the hon gentleman that his party be in government with the conservatives during the coalition year that government deliver horrible austerity on wales which lead to public service in wales be degrade his party be the architect of that 
 the chancellor say that cut red tape for banker will trickle down to household interruption the financial crash teach we that that be utter nonsense interruption the secretary of state have just mention thing that happen in the past in she say 
 year of trickle down and trickle out growth strategy have fail to deliver for britain 
 do she stand by what she say in opposition or do she now toe the line for the sake of the chancellor ’s friend in the city 
 i apologise to the right hon lady i be afraid i do not hear the start of her question on tax and what the chancellor have talk about we stand by our manifesto commitment not to increase income tax employee national insurance contribution or vat the chancellor have say that it would be irresponsible to write future budgets month in advance especially give the global situation there be clearly cost and implication to every decision this parliament make but we remain focused on grow our economy in wales and across the uk 
 that be way of avoid answer the question mr speaker my point be that labour ’s skewed sense of fairness do not stop at prioritise the interest of the bank over other it be also hit our farmer and rural community the farmers union of wales have warn that labour ’s plan reform to agricultural property relief will do irreversible damage to the welsh family farm look ahead to next week ’s royal welsh show will the secretary of state agree at last that what we really need be a tax on extreme wealth instead of a tax on those who feed we and sustain our rural economy 
 at the autumn budget we demonstrate our commitment to our fiscal rule while maintain high level of investment to rebuild our public service an investment in farming as well after the mess that the tories leave behind we have repeatedly say that those with the broad shoulder should bear the great burden and that have be reflect in the decision that we have take so far tax change as the right hon member know be a matter for the chancellor 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the industrial strategy publish on june on wales 
 our industrial strategy will unlock growth right across wales and support ten of thousand of new job we will target area of strength from aerospace in north wales to the world ’s compound semiconductor cluster in south wales we have announce a new centre for doctoral training in compound semiconductor lead by swansea university plus a new defence growth deal and £ for a local innovation partnership fund to name just a few development 
 like many member in this house i welcome the government ’s industrial strategy and its focus on growth for our local community across wales we have a number of former mining town which face the challenge of retrain and upskille their local workforce my constituency of tamworth a former mining town face similar challenge will the minister tell i how the industrial strategy will support former mining town across wales and in my constituency of tamworth 
 there be many job opportunity come to wales through the industrial strategy we be also ensure that local community have the money available to secure the safety of the coal tip which be the industrial legacy of those community that mean £ of additional funding on top of the £ that we have already dedicate to those area as my hon friend will know we be also forge ahead with the industrial zone and freeport in wales and also the supply chain for the various industry that i mention in my previous answer and they will include i know industry in tamworth 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 let we have some reality today inflation hit the high across the g7 this uk labour government have a glossy shine on their so call industrial strategy but it be simply prove that their action and ethos deliver only bad outcome for wales business across wales be now face a disgraceful double whammy as just this week labour in cardiff pass plan to impose a dire tourism tax have the minister actually carry out any meaningful assessment with the welsh government of how many job will be lose as the vital strong welsh tourism sector will be impact by this tax and by the fail approach to wales by the labour government 
 the welsh tourism sector be thrive last year british resident take over overnight trip to wales and spend more than £ as the shadow secretary of state will know more than country and holiday destination around the world include greece amsterdam barcelona and california have introduce a form of visitor levy and many of we have pay taxis abroad without even noticing if a visitor levy be introduce by all welsh local authority it could raise up to £ which would help support the long term thrive industry in wales as well as provide facility such as toilet that local people can use i be confident that the welsh government will work with business and tourist alike to get this right 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to improve rail connectivity between north wales and the north of england 
 what step she be take with the welsh government to improve cross border rail connectivity 
 we be invest at least £   an historic investment in welsh rail to right the year of underfunding by previous conservative governments and to unleash wales ’s economic potential this funding will support the permanent closing of level crossing on the north wales main line enable increase service across north wales that will improve cross border connectivity create job and boost economic growth 
 the chancellor ’s announcement of at least £ for welsh rail will be transformative for welsh passenger and well connect worker with job across north wales and manchester but only if we be pull in the same direction what step will be take by the wales office to ensure that national government devolve government and our combine authority in greater manchester be work together to improve connectivity and bring the people of the north west and north wales close together 
 my hon friend be absolutely right that be why i be pleased to see the welsh government ’s cabinet secretary for transport ken skates recently launch network north wales in wrexham that really exciting plan will well connect community in north wales and north west england through more rail and bus service and great integration benefit will include more timetabled service on the north wales main line boost cross border connectivity and drive economic growth between north wales and north west england in addition the investment in rail infrastructure will boost capacity on the wrexham to liverpool line 
 bore da do the secretary of state agree that the introduction of the midland rail hub project which will see an additional train per hour from cardiff in south wales to the midland be a great sign that this government be invest not just in wales and the midland but in the whole country 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for his very good welsh the phase of the midland rail hub will enable additional train between birmingham and south wales strengthen cross border connectivity between wales and england that be absolutely what this government ’s investment be about create job and growth and connect wales and england 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 let we have another reality check information provide to we by the department for transport confirm that conservative expenditure on welsh rail exceed £ over our time in office underpin by our plan to   deliver the north wales main line yet in a january sitting of the welsh affairs committee the welsh secretary roundly criticise welsh rail before claim 
 that be a direct consequence i be afraid of the last year of underfunding 
 as usual this government ’s word and belief and the reality be pole apart this labour government be now offer peanut just a miserable £ over an entire decade will the secretary of state retract her past claim to the welsh affairs committee and the similar one that have be make on the wales office government social medium account 
 no i will not 
 what discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the classification of the oxford to cambridge rail line as an england and wales transport project on wales 
 the hon member will know that that be an error make under the previous conservative government heavy rail infrastructure be reserve in wales and like every heavy rail project in england barnett consequential do not apply the uk government ’s rail network enhancement pipeline fund east west rail or ox cam rail as it be more commonly know and also directly fund project in wales such as the historic at least £ investment in rail in wales that be announce in the june spending review 
 the government have claim that list the oxford to cambridge rail line as england only on past document be just an accounting error by the conservative government and that the project have not be reclassify to deprive wales of funding but separate government document list it as england only and over £ in barnett consequential be already pay to wales on that basis do the secretary of state honestly stand by her claim that it have just be reclassify and that this be not intend to deprive wales of fair funding 
 as i have just explain an error be make by the previous conservative government heavy rail be and always be reserve the welsh government will not be require to re pay any barnett consequential provide to they as a result of any error that take place under the conservative government 
 the welsh government allocate over £ to transport in their recent budget this investment come after year of critical under investment by the conservatives and it should hopefully provide funding to station such as ely mill in my constituency can the secretary of state tell i why the welsh conservatives and plaid cymru vote against this investment which would mean extra funding to fix our road build new train and improve our bus 
 the opposition ’s decision to vote against the additional funding be inexplicable as be their decision to vote against extra money for the nhs for    education and for business i could go on they stand here and criticise this government while they vote against extra money for wales 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of the autumn budget on family farm in wales 
 the government be steadfastly commit to family farm in wales which be why we protect the farm budget at its current level and allocate £ to the welsh government at the autumn budget furthermore at the uk eu summit on   may   the prime minister announce that the uk would deliver a new agrifood deal with the european union routine sanitary and phytosanitary border check will be eliminate with less paperwork and few cost british good such as dairy fish egg and red meat currently subject to documentary check and up to physical check will see those remove entirely 
 although the aim of the sustainable farming scheme be laudable many farmer across wales be express real concern about its complexity the potential reduction in food production and the adequacy of the financial support on offer what assurance can the minister give that the scheme will be simplify sufficiently fund and implement in a way that support both the environmental goal and the economic viability of welsh farming community 
 the scheme will have a transition period with the basic payment scheme available for those not in the sfs although that will be reduce by next year the welsh government be prioritise their money on the sfs to encourage farmer to join the scheme and start benefit from it the farming union of wales have say that the plan provide 
 workable payment rate and much need stability for the sector 
 the welsh government ’s budget contain over £ to support welsh farmer be it not the case that plaid cymru and the tories put welsh farmer livelihood at risk by vote against that crucial money 
 indeed it be absolutely shocking that plaid cymru and the tories in the senedd vote against a budget that be give that money to welsh farmer 
 what recent discussion she have have with cabinet colleague on support for offshore wind in wales 
 in june the crown estate announce that it will partner with equinor and gwynt glas to develop float offshore wind in the celtic sea those project will create over new job and will leverage £ in private investment this will deliver generational   change in wales we be support the industry with an £ investment in port talbot port and a £ clean energy supply chain fund to support offshore wind across the uk 
 meur ras ha myttin da mr speaker or should i say diolch yn fawr the propose float offshore wind farm in the celtic sea lie between the ancient celtic nation of wales and cornwall the celtic sea not only will be a valuable source of renewable energy but have the potential to create thousand of job across south wales and cornwall do the secretary of state agree that local funding for economic development be essential to realise that potential and that work hand in hand with cornwall wales will play a key role in help to unleash the cornish celtic tiger 
 my hon friend be right that float offshore wind present significant opportunity for wales and the uk in the leasing round that just take place we have a mover advantage in this technology of the future early this month the energy secretary grant development consent for the mona offshore wind farm which will bolster north wales ’s offshore wind industry all of that be contribute to secure our energy independence and bring down bill for people in cornwall wales and the rest of the uk 
 i call jim shannon interruption 
 i know that cheer be not for i mr speaker when it come to offshore wind in wales the water in which that offshore wind energy will be generate be the same water that flow by northern ireland the same water that flow by england and the same water that flow by scotland be it not time to have an offshore wind strategy for the whole united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland if we do it together we will do it well 
 i always believe that we do thing well when we do they together 
 what assessment she have make of the potential impact of increase in defence spending on wales 
 we be committed to spend of the uk ’s gdp on national security by the spending review invest to keep our people safe with a £ real term increase to the ministry of defence budget   this will help grow the welsh economy and our thrive defence sector which be home to over company employ more than people right across wales 
 this government ’s commitment to spend of gdp on national security will be transformational for wales and for my constituency where thousand be employ in the defence sector and where we welcome a £ boost for the atomic weapons establishment do the secretary of   state and the minister agree that both our national security and our local economy be well off with labour 
 absolutely our ambition be to become a defence industrial superpower by we be make defence an engine for growth boost prosperity job and security for work people across the uk as part of this we will establish the uk defence innovation fund with £ to fund and grow uk base company we be also launch the new regional defence growth deal across the uk include a cluster in wales 
 the prime minister be ask 
 if he will list his official engagement for wednesday july 
 there have always be support across this house for the united kingdom fulfil our obligation to afghans who serve alongside british force we warn in opposition about conservative management of this policy and yesterday the defence secretary set out the full extent of the failing that we inherit a major data breach a super injunction and a secret route that have already cost hundred of million of pound minister who serve in the conservative government have serious question to answer about how this be ever allow to happen the chair of the defence committee have indicate that he intend to hold further inquiry i welcome that and i hope that those who be in office at the time will welcome that scrutiny 
 president macron ’s state visit last week see we secure historic agreement co ordinate our nuclear deterrent a major investment in sizewell c and a landmark return deal which be a crucial next step in restore order to our immigration system tomorrow i will host chancellor merz for further talk on our security and the economy this morning i have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house i shall have further such meeting later today 
 family in burton and uttoxeter be watch their smart meter like hawk and dread the moment when their energy bill land on the doormat i therefore welcome labour ’s warm home discount which will mean £ off energy bill for million of people across this country provide meaningful support in these difficult time will the prime minister set out how that will help support family in my constituency and across the country 
 i meet my hon friend ’s constituent nicola in her kitchen and she tell i how hard she be work to support her child but that the past decade have let she down with false promise and public service a wreck she tell i about the difference the warm home discount will make and that £ off her energy bill she have a meter in her kitchen if i recall record how much energy she be use would make all the difference to she i promise nicola and my hon friend that there be much more to come 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 yesterday the head of the office for budget responsibility warn the government that high and high level of taxis be bad for growth do the prime minister agree 
 mr speaker i will tell you what be bad for growth year of a tory government that mean stagnant growth for year leave a £ black hole in the quarter of this year we have achieve the high growth in the g7 which we promise before the election investment of £ in this country which be a record in the year of any government and trade deal all of which will boost growth 
 the prime minister be talk about what he have achieve but we have just hear that inflation be up again the bad in the g7 we leave he with inflation we have borrow up unemployment up and tax up under his government the fact be that the prime minister do not get it so let i tell he his budget last year have high taxis that be why the economy be contract the government have say that they will not put up taxis for people on modest income but they also seem incapable of explain who be in that category so can the prime minister clear up the confusion and tell we what he think a modest income be 
 i think of the work people across this country who put in every day and do not get back what they deserve that be who we be work for and that be who we be fix the country for they be the sort of people that work hard but have not necessarily get the saving to buy themselves out of problem that be who we be work for and that be why we put the national living wage up with an extra £ the national minimum wage be up with an extra £ a year the triple lock mean pension go up by £ and of course we be extend childcare open free breakfast club and extend free school meal we know exactly who we be work for the right hon lady come here every week and just talk the country down 
 i be not talk of the country down i be talk the prime minister down i ask he what a modest income be he answer with what a work person be he do not know what a modest income be and they can not even define who work people be the chief secretary to the treasury say that work people be people who get a payslip but million of self employ people do not get a payslip so be the self employ next in line for a labour tax raise 
 the self employ be the very people who suffer repeatedly under the conservatives watch particularly during covid as i remember when they do not get the support that they need the right hon lady talk the country down and she cherry pick since we have be in government we have create job the employment rate be up and inactivity be down the complete opposite of what we inherit 
 i do not know where these job be come from unemployment have go up every month under his government perhaps the prime minister   should speak to farmer and small business people and find out what those work people think about his government but that be not all because we know that the chancellor be launch a review into pension contribution it be as clear as day why this be it be because the government be consider tax they do the prime minister agree with i that a tax on pension contribution be a tax on work people 
 we make absolutely clear manifesto commitment which the right hon lady ask i about last week and we be keep to they i be not go to write the budget month out from the budget i be proud of the decision that we take to invest in our nhs and to invest in our public service all decision that the conservatives oppose it be no wonder that after the year of a labour government business confidence be at a year high that be long than she have be in government—[hon member withdraw i be not withdraw that i be go to repeat it business confidence be at a year high 
 the prime minister say that he be not go to write the budget but his chancellor be on the front of the daily mirror talk about what she be go to do on taxis so why can he not do the same in the chamber i ask he about pension contribution the truth be that he do not want to talk about pension contribution it be all right for the prime minister because he have his own special law to stop his personal pension from be tax but let we be honest this be really about choice my party know that there be an alternative to tax rise cut spending something that the government be too scared or perhaps too weak to do we offer to work with he to reform welfare and make meaningful saving but his refusal send a signal and now the cost of borrowing be rise the budget be in november which be month away and the market may not wait what will the prime minister be do over the summer to get a grip on the cost of borrow 
 the conservatives leave the most incredible mess in the economy and now they think that they can lecture other just last week their chairman say that they have do the necessary apologising for the year of failure i do not hear an apology for the low living standard in live history i do not hear an apology for the £ black hole i do not hear an apology for the liz truss mini budget maybe the right hon lady would like to stand up and make that apology now 
 the prime minister be not plan to do anything this summer to fix the economy the shadow of the last budget be hang over the entire country just yesterday only the conservatives support the child benefit cap because only the conservatives believe in live within our mean not labour not the liberal democrats not reform 
 but it be the end of term so why do n’t we go through the prime minister ’s end of term scorecard the economy be contract inflation be the high in the g7 unemployment be up every month under this government spending be out of control borrowing cost be more expensive than in greece and this be just the year the labour party should be ashamed of what it be   do to the country interruption labour member can shake their head as much as they like but the fact be that this summer they will have to go to their constituent and explain why the government have be make such a mess over the past month and be it not the case give that this be just their year that the bad be yet to come 
 we be happily go to go to our constituent we will tell they that we promise extra nhs appointment and have deliver extra appointment i have to upgrade that it be now extra appointment so we will tell our constituent that then we will tell they about the free school meal we be roll out the free breakfast club the free childcare and school uniform cost we will tell they about that when we have do that we will move on to affordable house and tell they about the £ we be invest when we be finish with that we will tell they about the rail and road upgrade across the country the £ investment and of course the trade deal and we be only just get start 
 the prime minister will never know exactly how much it mean to victim of the trouble in northern ireland from right across society when he come look they in their eye and promise they that no murderer would be immune from prosecution can he tell we when he last speak to the taoiseach about the shared approach to this issue and will he recommit today to those victim to ensure that no murderer will be see to be above the law 
 this be a really important issue and can i begin by say that i have a profound respect and debt to our veteran who serve this be a complicated issue and we have to get it right veteran be at risk because of the false promise of the last government let we be clear the last government make a false promise of immunity that do not exist it be unlawful it be strike down and it be undeliverable their fail legacy act leave veteran expose with no settled process we will create a secure transparent system that protect veteran from unjustified persecution and give victim family and survivor the confidence they need in the process 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 may i associate myself with the prime minister ’s word about the shocking afghan data breach under the previous government which be keep secret for year he will have our support if he decide to pursue a public inquiry 
 i know that the prime minister will agree that the shocking rise of antisemitism that we have see since hamas ’s   october   terror attack have no place in our society british jews should not have to live in fear of hatred racism and abuse on our street or online a new report from the board of deputies commission on antisemitism chair by lord mann and dame penny mordaunt have set out recommendation to tackle this appalling scourge will the prime minister study this report and will his government respond to it in full 
 yes we will we must fight antisemitism wherever we find it as we must fight all hate offence crime and incident wherever we find they 
 i thank the prime minister for that reply i hope that we will see more action to tackle antisemitism 
 turn to the middle east the world be look on in horror at the scene from gaza and now netanyahu ’s ministers want to lock the whole population of gaza into what be effectively a giant prison a plan that would clearly amount to ethnic cleansing as former israeli prime minister olmert have say do the prime minister agree that that be utterly abhorrent and unacceptable will he make it clear to the israeli government that the uk will not stand idly by and will act start by sanction prime minister netanyahu himself 
 i be appal by the suggestion in relation to gaza just as i be appal by the report of yet more civilian be kill while try to access aid on both front i be appal by what we be see and hearing and we raise that regularly as the right hon gentleman would expect in relation to the civilian be kill i would expect that to be fully and transparently investigate with full accountability for any failing israel must clearly put in place measure that properly protect civilian in line with international law and that be the case that we be press repeatedly alongside that we want to see an immediate ceasefire so that the remain hostage can be bring out aid can be get in at volume and at speed and a political process can be open which in my view be the only way in which we be go to get a lasting solution 
 last week year old eli testa be kill in rawtenstall cemetery when a memorial stone fall on he all of rossendale be shock by this tragedy so i hope the prime minister will join i in offer his deep condolence to eli ’s parent and family 
 family in rossendale be also deeply concerned about report that reform lead lancashire county council be consider cut to nursery funding which would raise cost for work parent and might force some nursery to close if this be an example of the sort of efficiency that reform be consider then all of lancashire indeed all of we should be worried will the prime minister join i in ask lancashire county council to think again 
 i send my deep condolence to eli ’s friend and family i join my hon friend in urge the new reform council to think again and change its mind on damaging cut that hit child and young family my hon friend be do a much well job than his predecessor the conservative party chairman under liz truss who have now join reform that prove once again that if people vote tory they get reform and if they vote reform they get the tories while both party be cut service at home we support family with free school meal and free breakfast club and by extend free childcare 
 jack straw tell we that the human rights act place on we no expectation that we will    remedy a declaration of incompatibility issue by a court so the prime minister be wrong to say that the legacy act be strike down his own proposal which open the door to compensation to gerry adams and place in jeopardy our own servicemen present enormous difficulty to those of we who have serve that be increasingly the case on the prime minister ’s own bench will he consider that 
 the fail legacy act be strike down by the court in northern ireland and that leave veteran expose we be create a secure transparent system that protect veteran from unjustified persecution but that also give victim family and survivor the confidence that they need in the process 
 worker in rochdale on the minimum wage receive a much need pay rise this summer thank to this government but honest business be be undermine by the menace of illegal working particularly by illegal migrant from iran and iraq in bogus barber shop and fake vape shop do the prime minister agree that we need to speed up the roll out of digital id particularly to help our police and immigration staff crack down on this grey market that ruin our high street and undercut the pay of british worker 
 my hon friend be an excellent champion for rochdale and i know a strong supporter of his local police and trading standard team since we come to power we have ramp up enforcement raid on illegal working arrest have go up by and we be tighten the law on delivery driver digital id will help we to tackle illegal working and we be roll out the use of e visa to have digital record of immigration status and allow on the spot check of anybody ’s right to work 
 severe   pregnancy sickness hyperemesis gravidarum or hg can mean vomit more than time a day it cause physical discomfort acute malnutrition and severe dehydration which often lead to hospitalisation it have profound and long last mental health consequence it be recently report that a woman take her own life after be deny access to the only licensed treatment xonvea tragically her unborn child die too the drug be license and available yet woman face a cruel postcode lottery to access it will the prime minister work urgently with the department of health and social care to end this scandal so that every woman who need xonvea can get it wherever she live will he meet with i and campaigner to look at this as a matter of urgency

 a much well understanding of the particular need of autistic and neurodiverse child be vital to expand capacity in mainstream education for pupil with special educational need and disability as the prime minister look at the send bill over the summer can i urge he to introduce mandatory training for all teacher and staff on autism and neurodiversity

 i begin by warmly congratulate the prime minister on his year in office i acknowledge that the labour manifesto be beautifully write deeply move and like that other great blockbuster of hope and redemption the salt path a total pack of lie with joblessness inflation and debt ballooning with   his personal rating collapse and with his back benchers on a work to rule could the prime minister recommend 
 order come on let we get on with the question 
 could the prime minister recommend a summer recess read in order to take all our mind off the calamitous journey on which he and the chancellor have embark 
 from look at the opposition benches i think most conservative back benchers be already on their summer recess we be very proud of our manifesto it be a very successful manifesto give we a landslide victory and now we be very proud to be implement it 
 let we be clear in this house israel be starve palestinian child that be a war crime israel be kill palestinian child as they queue for food that be a war crime our government have quite rightly impose thousand of sanction on russia for its war crime in ukraine how many more horror must we witness before the prime minister act with the same scale of sanction against israel to stop this genocide do palestinian life not matter 
 as i say early i be appal by report of more civilian be kill in gaza particularly when they be try to access aid each of those incident need to be fully and transparently investigate with accountability for any failing that of course have to happen alongside the ceasefire that be desperately need and that we be work hard with other to achieve in order to release all of the hostage who remain but also to protect civilian and get much more aid into gaza at speed and at volume 
 i can see why you call these session prime minister ’s question and not prime minister ’s answer mr speaker 
 more 
 order if this carry on there will be no more come on lincoln jopp 
 thank you mr speaker follow the magnificent success of the england cricket team early this week and the triumphal return of mr jofra archer do the prime minister agree that what he need from his ministers over the next month be more pace and less spin 
 my ministers have deliver on the nhs on the economy on rail etc the hon gentleman need a break 
 successive conservative governments fail to invest in the transport infrastructure of the north east but the labour government be already change that with the £ that be recently secure for the region    upgrading moor farm and seaton burn roundabout can build on that unlock growth and be support by local people and business do the prime minister share my disappointment that rather than support my campaign for upgrade the conservative leadership in northumberland county council be actively undermine my lobbying effort to deliver this game changer for the north east 
 my hon friend be do a superb job for northumberland and i be happy to set out what we have deliver we have deliver more than £ of funding for northumberland county council this year a increase as well as an increase in the number of home on which construction have start in my hon friend ’s area a near £ increase in funding for northumbria police and free breakfast club in northumberland support more than child that be the difference that a labour government make 
 during my meeting with guest who be in my constituency under the homes for ukraine scheme they have tell i that they be worried about their visa run out even with the month extension they see report of ukrainians be refuse asylum in the united kingdom because it be say to be safe to return to ukraine even while putin ’s missile explode in record number in ukrainian city some of their child be work through or year education course and be frightened of have to leave will the prime minister meet they and i to hear about their plight and offer they some hope in this uncertain and dangerous world 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise this matter we be proud to have offer or extend sanctuary to more than ukrainians and their family throughout the operation of the visa scheme since the invasion in we do need to provide certainty and security for ukrainians in the united kingdom and we will provide an additional month permission to remain in the uk as well as continue right to live work and study here 
 in i lead a select committee inquiry that warn of an emerge disaster in special educational need and disability service those warning go unheeded by the conservatives who leave behind a broken system which even they have since admit be lose lose lose can the prime minister confirm that this labour government ’s rebuild send system will be shape by listen to the need of sen family never again ignore but serve in the good tradition of a labour government 
 my hon friend be right i think there be general agreement across the house that the system be break just like almost everything the conservatives touch at the end of miserable year it do not work for parent and it let child down and we will reform it we be already invest an additional £ but we need a system that truly support every child we be develop proposal and i want to work across the house in order to secure the right outcome 
 for the final question i call pippa heylings 
 yet again we be suffer record break heatwave and drought that be worry people in my constituency which be both the fast grow and the most water stress area in the country the propose fen reservoir be important but will provide water only for the already ambitious house building plan not the thousand of new home that the government propose do the prime minister agree that the water crisis in greater cambridge be a deal breaker for the government ’s growth plan and will he as a matter of urgency help i to convene a ministerial roundtable with the cambridge water scarcity group 
 the hon lady be right to draw attention to the drought and more generally the question of reservoir it be shocking that a new reservoir have not be build for a very very long time none at all in the previous year we be build now and we be do that alongside the infrastructure and housing that we also need to build we will work across the house on that 
 urgent question to ask the minister if she will make a statement on britain ’s response to the worsen situation in sudan 
 sudan be the bad humanitarian crisis on record over people need aid and people have be displace famine be spread fast and new report confirm that the situation will deteriorate in the next month cholera be also now widespread 
 lifesaving assistance continue to be block by the party last month aid worker be kill in an appalling attack on a un convoy that be deliver lifesave aid to those flee violence in el fasher the deliberate targeting of aid worker clearly violate international law as the united nations security council penholder on sudan the uk lead call for accountability for such attack include through the uk pen press statement on   june last week the international criminal court ’s office of the prosecutor find reasonable ground to believe that war crime and crime against humanity may well have be and continue to be commit in darfur the perpetrator must be hold to account 
 the uk continue to play a lead role in ensure that aid get to where it be most need in april the foreign secretary bring together a broad coalition of partner to build consensus on strengthen humanitarian access the co chairs statement call on the party to facilitate humanitarian access in accordance with their commitment in the jeddah declaration over £ of funding for sudan be announce include £ of uk aid which will support over people this year 
 in the absence of a ceasefire the humanitarian situation will only worsen we continue to call on the war party to place the interest of the sudanese people over their pursuit of a military victory the uk be work with our international partner to push the war party to return to the negotiating table and commit to a meaningful sustainable ceasefire 
 any process that follow must be inclusive we underline the importance of a return to civilian rule that be democratic and representative of the whole country move by the sudanese armed forces and the rapid support forces to establish their own parallel government will only exacerbate de facto split and could lead to the permanent partition of sudan that be in no ’s interest 
 we will continue to use all diplomatic tool at our disposal to protect civilian get aid to those who need it most and support a sudanese lead peace process with civilian at its heart 
 thank you very much mr speaker for grant this urgent question today 
 i make no apology for raise the dire and desperate strait of the sudanese people again in this house not least because britain lead on the sudanese situation at the united nations on behalf of all other nation as the minister say the people of sudan be in the throe   of the bad humanitarian catastrophe in the world and the situation be worsen even if such thing can hardly be imagine early this month the united nations and international organisation report the mass displacement of ten of thousand of people follow the combatant force advance across the kordofan state there have be month of increase mobilisation of fighter include the recruitment of child from across darfur as fight expand the kordofan state be the next deadly front 
 in the recent and welcome ministerial conference host by the foreign secretary much need money be raise but the goal of a high level contact group to drive political effort towards achieve a ceasefire and protect sudanese civilian meet with an impasse we must accept that despite our effort the past year have be a story of falter international endeavour where world event have cast sudan into the shadow as its people have face only deepen peril 
 i ask the minister question what lesson have the government learn from the siege of el fasher and the overwhelming of the camp for displace people at zamzam to prepare for and protect civilian from the spread of violence across the kordofan state how be the government support the local emergency response room secondly can she confirm that the prevention of atrocity remain a key pillar of british policy and be unaffected by the recent cut in the development budget thirdly and finally what be the government do to advance international effort to protect civilian alongside their pursuit of a ceasefire be we to assume the jeddah process be dead what discussion have she have with her counterpart in the united states over recent week 
 i thank   the right hon member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell   for his question and his long stand interest not just in africa in general but particularly in this awful conflict in sudan of course sudan be also a personal priority for the foreign secretary which be why he bring together foreign ministers to try to find a resolution the prime minister have reiterate that the uk will continue to play a key humanitarian role evidence by the £ of uk aid announce for sudan this year 
 on the right hon gentleman ’s question in relation to the work post jeddah we be work to sustain the momentum of the action agree at the conference we continue to work with multilateral institution include the african union to ensure strong african leadership in response to the conflict we have also join the eu convene consultative group on sudan in june and we have initiate a friend of sudan group in geneva to advance our work on the protection of civilian because the right hon gentleman be right to say that international law in this regard place a heavy emphasis on prevention of conflict and of atrocity we continue to identify opportunity to use our role as penholder on sudan in the un security council and to galvanise un security council action on the conflict in sudan 
 the right hon gentleman also specifically ask about the situation in the el fasher camp and i want to reassure he that the uk be do all it can but the question be always about access we have the money we have the worker it be access that we need in order to provide that lifesave aid that be the nub of the issue which we be work on 
 not a single person in my sudanese diaspora community in sheffield have not be affect by the horrific violence in sudan but the most harrowing part for they be not the regular communication jam block parent from child and brother from sister or the multiple displacement of million of the most vulnerable people or indeed the famine rip through the population the bad part be that while this the bad humanitarian crisis in the world be break every boundary we know world power continue to look away 
 the uk government have a unique position as penholder for sudan and at the un security council i appreciate that we call for a ceasefire through a resolution but the resolution set no deadline for conclude the ceasefire and authorise no enforcement mission so minister what be we do to enforce accountability for the shameful complicity of state back the war side and when will we push for an agreement to a ceasefire so the people of sudan can be free from this horror 
 i thank my hon friend who be a loud voice here on behalf her sudanese diaspora the most important thing the uk can do to build on the momentum of the important london sudan conference bear in mind that we be the to have such a conference be to continue to base our work on the statement from its co chair to continue as she say to use our role at the united nations and to work through the new friend of sudan group to keep push at the high level use our position on the un security council to galvanise its action and continue the important supply of aid into the region 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be grateful to you mr speaker for grant this urgent question and my right hon friend   the member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell   for pursue this matter 
 the situation in sudan be dire we be deeply concerned by the international criminal court ’s finding last week that there be reasonable ground to believe that war crime and crime against humanity may be be commit in darfur the humanitarian situation continue to deteriorate with the un warn on   june   of drastic cut to life save food aid for sudanese refugee flee to neighbouring country sudan have be identify as the global hunger hotspot of high concern and without immediate humanitarian assistance the risk be terrible with recent attack on un aid convoy can the minister provide her late assessment of the situation and the extent of aid block how be she ensure that uk aid include the £ announce at the april sudan conference will reach those who need it and that aid worker be protect 
 more broadly what new measure be the government take to compel the war party into a ceasefire to allow more aid in and to facilitate deconfliction for its delivery in the meantime how have the minister support sudanese civilian and political force to engage in constructive dialogue process such as the cairo conference and what be her assessment of the effectiveness of these process despite the spending review we be yet to   understand what the figure mean for bilateral aid so will she confirm the bilateral spend for sudan this year 
 sudan matter it be not in the uk ’s national interest for the crossing of red line in this conflict to persist to have the displacement of people on this scale nor to see the further destabilisation of this region of africa 
 the right hon lady ask about the last week ’s icc find we acknowledge the icc office of the prosecutor ’s critical finding that there be reasonable ground to believe that war crime and crime against humanity may have well be commit and be continue to be commit in darfur this be an important milestone in the icc ’s investigation into crime commit in darfur and the uk remain steadfast in its commitment to ensure that international humanitarian law be respect and breach be call out and investigate the uk remain committed to secure accountability for those responsible for atrocity crime this include report the fact find mission ’s mandate and the icc ’s ongoing investigation 
 the right hon lady mention the attack on el fasher and the targeting of aid worker that be an absolute disgrace and a clear violation of international law and we condemn it she ask what more we have be do recently we attend the important consultative group on sudan in brussels on   june and contribute to discussion with the un secretary general ’s personal envoy on sudan ramtane lamamra on his plan to convene proximity talk with the war party include on protection issue 
 finally the right hon lady raise the important question of the spending review as i be sure she be aware we have a lot of lesson to learn from last time the aid budget be reduce because the national audit office criticise the way those reduction be make in year without consultation and question whether that be value for money instead the government will take a long term look at this and have a glide principle over the remaining year of this parliament 
 that this urgent question could have be relevant at any time in the past year be a damn indictment of the failure of the international community this morning my hon friend   the member for huddersfield harpreet uppal   and i host sudanese community voice alongside médecins sans frontières the british medical association and other and we hear harrowing story about what be happen on the ground medical centre and hospital be become battleground and as ever woman and child be bear the brunt of the devastation the united nations have call what be go on the world ’s large humanitarian crisis there be credible allegation of genocide back by both the us and the un and there be well document case of war crime this be a war on civilian 
 the uk in its role as the un penholder must lead by example and convene international actor and leader to urgent concrete action will the minister set out what urgent action she plan to take in the next week particularly give that parliament will not be sit again until september by which time many more life will have be devastatingly lose 
 i thank my hon friend she for her important work in pull together group in particular aid worker whose focus be on medical relief and for her role on the foreign affairs committee i be sure she share with i the worry about the news of a cholera outbreak in the region i thank she for her important work in that regard she also impress on the house the importance of the uk ’s support to woman and girl 
 the foreign secretary visit the sudan chad border in january to raise awareness of sudan speak directly to refugee include survivor who share harrowing story of sexual violence and torture and in march lord collins the africa minister chair a un security council briefing on commit to the prevention of violence against woman and girl in sudan but my hon friend be quite right to say that this week as the house come towards its rise we must do even more i will undertake to share this particular dialogue in the house with the minister for africa so he can redouble his effort in the month of august to ensure that the uk be well represent in international discussion 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the ongoing war in sudan be the world ’s large humanitarian catastrophe and the big since aid begin i thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question but i regret that in the past month there have be only statement on sudan from the government 
 local and community lead emergency response room be central to the on the ground response will the minister outline how the uk be increase support to those err since the london conference what bilateral conversation have the government have with regional actor and the us about sudan war crime be be commit on an almost daily basis the principal war party oppose a democratic sudan so what be the government do to support sudanese civilian group and civil society fight for the democratic future 
 since the new york times have repeatedly report that the united arab emirates be funnel weapon to the rapid support forces and the un ’s expert panel on sudan deem those allegation credible what be the government do to address the proliferation of outside weapon in sudan and to uphold and expand the arm embargo how be they clamp down on the illicit international trade in sudanese gold which be finance this war finally what assessment have the government make of the american judgment that chemical weapon be be use in sudan 
 the hon lady quite rightly push we to say more in this house there have be lot of question from member when the foreign secretary have be answer broad question such as on g7 or nato meeting so members across the house have ask question under the umbrella of international affair and the foreign secretary have reply to they but we can always do more 
 as the hon lady be aware we need to keep up the momentum from the london sudan conference she ask who we be work with we be of course work with the african union this be and foremost a   question of promote leadership of african country to deal with issue in africa the foreign secretary have redouble his effort as a well respect foreign secretary within the african union dialogue and recently join the eu convene consultative group on sudan in june which i know the hon lady will appreciate and think be a worthwhile forum for we to be in as mention the friend of sudan group in geneva will also advance the work to protect civilian 
 the hon lady mention the uae our message to any partner who may have an element of involvement in the conflict be clear we need to press for a peaceful solution all those support behind the scene need to come together in the spirit of the london sudan conference and talk about a peaceful solution for all 
 on the hon lady ’s last question which be about gold in sudan i shall have to write to she 
 in response to an urgent question in april the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend   the member for lincoln mr falconer   confirm that the london sudan conference include a commitment from the uk government to provide a furth £ of aid for to support people which the minister reference early with that in mind can the minister today confirm to the house what progress have be make in the intervening few month to ensure that the additional aid reach the most vulnerable people in sudan flee conflict sexual violence and famine 
 my hon friend raise the most important point it be not just about money it be about access our diplomatic heft and knock head together so we can get that aid through to the people most in need he mention the £ for this financial year a portion of that uplift provide support to local responder both through the sudan humanitarian fund which support the emergency response room and the mercy corps lead cash consortium of sudan which provide direct cash assistance to mutual aid group on the ground the reason for that be that there be often a de banking situation in conflict zone formal banking collapse that be why it be so important that the uk be able to assist the small group on the ground to get that vital aid in 
 such an enormous civilian price be be pay in sudan but of the great horror be the use of rape and sexual violence against woman and child as a weapon of war and it be be use systematically as a weapon of war i appreciate that the minister have limited option but i urge she to look at every single way that we can be more robust and strong and really lead the charge to ensure that vital aid not only to combat hunger but to help people who have be rap and who have suffer so much be deliver as quickly as possible let we please lead the way 
 i thank the right hon member for his question the uk fund support for the protection prevention and care service respond to gender base violence and conflict relate sexual violence in sudan   and they provide emergency support to survivor long term uk programme also work to tackle female genital mutilation and to empower woman and girl 
 i echo the word of my hon friend the members for stratford and bow uma kumaran and for sheffield central abtisam mohamed about the terrible and desperate suffering of woman and child i thank the minister for her update in which she highlight the outcome of the london sudan conference and the urgent need for access for aid when i speak to my constituent from the sudanese diaspora community they talk about their desperate sadness in the conversation they have with their friend and family who be still in the region will the minister update the house on the consular arrangement for the friend and family of my constituent 
 my hon friend be a doughty campaigner on behalf of her constituent in westminster and the city i encourage she and her staff to use the mp hotline because that be the good way of get through in order to get consular advice and to reassure our community in the diaspora of sudan 
 i thank my right hon friend   the member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell   for secure this urgent question on the world ’s bad humanitarian crisis i welcome the leadership step that the uk government be take but will the minister tell the house what conversation be be have with both the african union and the united nations about the possibility of surge peacekeeper into sudan to protect civilian 
 i thank the hon lady for her leadership role in the previous parliament as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on sudan and south sudan and as international development minister 
 there be a number of partner she have mention some of they the participant at the london sudan conference include egypt the kingdom of saudi arabia the uae qatar south sudan chad kenya ethiopia and uganda and of course the like minded norway canada the usa and switzerland it be a perfect moment and the hon lady ask how we can continue that we will redouble our effort to work with the multilateral such as the un and the league of arab states there be quite a lot on their agenda at the moment but it be very important that sudan be not bring down the agenda just because it be in africa that be a fear which be why it be so good to see the reporting in the financial times the guardian and many of our other mainstream newspaper to keep it in the spotlight we will ensure that we work bilaterally with the country we work with in normal time and on a multilateral level to maintain our leadership role 
 the humanitarian situation in sudan be horrific with the grow perpetration of atrocity crime against civilian this be part of a grow pattern of mass atrocity crime be perpetrate across the world but the uk government ’s strategy on prevention of and   response to mass atrocity crime have not be update since do the minister agree that it be time for a fresh approach to this vital issue 
 my hon friend know of what she speak with her role before she come to this place i shall take that as an action from today ’s dialogue 
 will the minister explain to the house what in practical term the security council could do even if all its member be neutral on the question of back side over the other if side be determined to fight another and neither be dependent on outside military assistance to pursue the conflict be there anything practical that the security council could do even if it be united and in agreement on the need for an intervention 
 the un security council be not just about military intervention in term of the security as the right hon gentleman be aware it be also about the impact of the diplomatic solution as the penholder the uk have the most important role to try to bring everybody together around the table which be why we have the london sudan conference there be some who throw their hand up and say we have not achieve anything but i think the important thing be that we lay down a marker and that we be now follow up with other partner and be see as leader in the area it be by use the un security council leadership role that we will eventually get to a solution however the right hon gentleman be quite right to say that there be a lot of finger in the pie 
 what be happen in sudan in darfur in particular be of the world ’s deep and long run humanitarian crisis unfortunately we be see rise tension and military action in neighbour south sudan particularly in the upper nile region the ugandan army have recently enter south sudan and there be a real risk of regional conflict and civil war which would create a much deep humanitarian crisis across the whole region what be the uk do to de escalate that potential conflict such as talk to uganda and south sudan 
 my hon friend be quite right to say that the long the war last the great its ripple effect we should give credit to country like egypt chad and south sudan alongside other nearby for manage this crisis and for take so many people in there have also be aid from country like the uk but the impact within the region be devastating i will certainly take back to the minister for africa my hon friend ’s point about the impact on south sudan and reply in writing with what we be go to do this month not wait until september as my hon friend   the member for stratford and bow uma kumaran   say 
 as a former aid worker and resident of darfur i feel deeply for the people of sudan will the minister say whether there be plan to increase the amount of spend for the emergency response room they be clearly do very valuable work at the moment 
 i thank the hon gentleman for all the work he do before come to parliament and his important support for so many country i have be in debate with he on myanmar and other it be important that we lay on the record that £ be a lot of money and that we have to follow that money as i explain before de banking sometimes occur in certain contexts which be why we need to have those relationship on the ground with the sort of aid organisation that my hon friend the member for stratford and bow speak about cover the situation as it be today and how to maintain those relationship my personal view be that it be not always just about the impact of the budget sometimes it be about the diplomatic work that go on around the funding so that we can maximise that money 
 the brutal violence be perpetrate against sudanese civilian be only fuel by external actor from the uae egypt russia and beyond will the minister ensure diplomatic intervention with each of those nation and report back to the house on the outcome of those dialogue will she also ensure that the uk lead on ban the use of mercenary in area of conflict we have not sign a convention as the uk government and it be time that we lead a new convention on the use of mercenary 
 i thank my hon friend for her work as the chair of the appg for sudan and south sudan we have now hear from both the former chair   the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin and the current chair i know that my hon friend have a sudanese diaspora in her locality too 
 may i just emphasise that the uk be not protect any country with an interest in this conflict we have be very clear that we expect all country to comply with exist un sanction regime and the arm embargo and we continue to work closely with partner at the un security council to enforce they we need to move on to the political resolution of the conflict i also ask for my hon friend ’s patience i will fold the part of her question into the challenge i have from my hon friend   the member for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward   on update some of our policy and procedure that have not be update since 
 i thank the minister for her answer to all the question and her strong word on our commitment i believe those word will encourage we all and hopefully thereby encourage our constituent sudan rank on the open doors world watch list for christian persecution with more than church and christian building forcibly seize in the conflict with the late church destroy just last week christian be afraid to practise their faith and the recent murder of people in north kordofan have underline the valid reason that they live in fear how can the government assist more importantly will the government intervene and help the people of this region who be be exterminate just because they be christians 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his relentless work in this house on freedom of religion or belief of course the region use to be so much more diverse but the space for religious freedom have really   narrow he be quite right to challenge that with his permission i will share his thought with our freedom of religion or belief champion my hon friend   the member for north northumberland david smith so that we can work together on this issue and shine a spotlight on the lack of freedom for christian community in particular but also for other minority community in the darfur region 
 i be sure all hon member will want to praise british diplomat for all they be do on this difficult issue the potential catastrophic loss of ever more civilian life not merely in the armed conflict but in the result humanitarian catastrophe mean that the conscience of the world must lead to action and foremost through diplomacy have the government consider work with ally to ensure that all option remain on the table give concept like the responsibility to protect give that sudan have previously see a genocide in darfur do the minister agree that we must ensure that the international community do not once again have to say if only we have act more robustly or never again 
 i thank my hon friend for his extensive work in civil society on these sort of issue the current position be for we to engage extensively through diplomatic mean to encourage all party to come to the table we be very aware of the complexity of this particular conflict and the fact that it be not just side within the region but a lot of other player we be uniquely position with our role on the united nations security council and with our other partner for instance we do a lot with the league of arab states and the organisation of islamic cooperation we be use our diplomatic effort double time at the moment but i do hear what my hon friend say 
 give that certain un initiative and effort to address this humanitarian catastrophe have encounter a degree of reluctance if not opposition from state such as russia i be pleased to hear the minister say that the government be work closely with regional partner will she elaborate on the work that be be do to support country such as egypt and multilateral organisation like the african union to address this humanitarian crisis and if not to broker a ceasefire to ensure the unblocking of humanitarian aid 
 i thank the hon member for his long stand interest in development i know that he will be pleased to hear that the participant with whom we work at the london conference continue to be our partner in this endeavour they include egypt the kingdom of saudi arabia the uae qatar south sudan chad kenya ethiopia and uganda within my own brief as the indo pacific minister i be able to talk about terrible conflict such as those in sudan and myanmar with like minded people include with those in the association of southeast asian nations which also care deeply about their brother in sudan and myanmar we must redouble our effort to have on our agenda in future diplomatic intervention those terrible ongoing conflict that be not enjoy the spotlight of public attention 
 i thank the minister for her response so far she will be aware of the indiscriminate aerial bombardment in the conflict and the failure to distinguish between military and civilian target be the government consider far target sanction on those leader responsible for or accuse of atrocity and war crime in the area 
 i thank my hon friend for his important question since the outbreak of the conflict in the uk have freeze the asset of commercial entity link to the party involve in the conflict as a permanent member of the united nations security council the uk have also sanction general of sudan ’s rapid support forces for their crime against civilian in november he be also right to emphasise the use of drone in this particular conflict and how difficult it be for civilian to know how to shield themselves against they this new method of war be very much at the top of our agenda when we speak with like minded people 
 may i take this opportunity to thank   the right hon member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell   for keep the plight of the sudanese at the forefront of our thought we often hear the adage out of sight out of mind and unfortunately the conflict in sudan do not engage the mainstream medium in the way that it should we know about the recent harrowing event in north kordofan where civilian include child and pregnant woman be massacre we know that historically there have be international peacekeeping troop on the ground will the minister explore that opportunity with the relevant nation do she believe that that be something that can be consider 
 just last month we join the un eu consultative group on sudan for the time alongside our partner from the us the kingdom of saudi arabia the african union and the league of arab states that be at the top of the agenda our role at the moment be very much focused on be the penholder at the un but all channel be open and we be listen to all view the important thing be that we try to get round the table again and maintain the momentum that we have for that brief moment at the london conference 
 with man woman and child dead people displace attack on humanitarian worker and report of ethnic cleansing and genocide sudan be undoubtedly the bad humanitarian crisis in the world today yet almost nobody know about it we have have no march on the street comparatively little medium attention and very few statement and urgent question in the house will the minister set out what more the government can do to raise awareness of the desperate need to address this conflict 
 i thank my hon friend for his spotlight on this issue the uk condemn the grow body of evidence of serious atrocity be commit against civilian in sudan the escalation of violence   the killing of civilian the sexual assault of woman and the restriction of humanitarian access that be why the foreign secretary visit the sudan chad border to raise awareness of the conflict in sudan and its impact on neighbouring country he speak directly to sudanese refugee include to survivor who share harrowing story of sexual violence and torture the minister for africa for whom this be probably the high priority area host an event with his dutch and swiss counterpart to discuss the alarming rate of conflict relate sexual violence in sudan and the inadequacy of current response and we will redouble our effort follow this urgent question to ensure that we follow that up 
 the unfold scenario in sudan almost defy description the minister have quite rightly speak about the importance of accessibility do she agree that for accessibility to work in term of aid resource and assistance there need to be a comprehensive international approach in order even to offer the prospect of hope and delivery within the next few month 
 the hon member be absolutely right to talk about the importance not just of our bilateral meeting but of work at that multilateral level at the same time we need to provide support in that important area of gathering fact as we go along because the fog of war can prevent that let i give example the uk provide £ to the sudan witness project start by the centre of information resilience which investigate attack against civilian and work with sudanese civil society organisation as well as the united nations fact find mission to support evidence gathering and accountability so that day justice will be serve 
 i thank the minister for her answer today and   the right hon member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell   for bring this urgent question to the house the event in sudan be undoubtedly an ongoing stain on the conscience of the global community i be deeply concerned about increase the accountability of those who be complicit or guilty of war crime or crime against humanity follow the question of my hon friend   the member for high peak jon pearce can the minister assure i and my constituent that she will leave no stone unturned in make sure that people face justice for the thing that they have either enable or take part in 
 my hon friend be right to say that the report come out of darfur be horrify some of the violence have show the hallmark of ethnic cleansing and may amount to crime against humanity the foreign secretary hear this at hand from survivor when he be in adre in january irrespective of any determination in the international criminal court we know that we will strongly and always support its active investigation into the situation in darfur include allegation of crime commit since april and that be why the uk have provide technical support in this regard
