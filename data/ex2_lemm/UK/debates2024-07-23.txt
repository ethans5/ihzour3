it be truly an honour to rise as the new member for fylde to give my maiden speech in this historic house the global seat of democracy for century before we i have choose to make my maiden speech today because have serve as lancashire ’s police and crime commissioner until may this year it feel incredibly poignant to speak in the home affair debate it give i the opportunity to thank the police officer and staff i work with for their bravery their sacrifice and their service 
 during my term of office i be truly inspire by so many people at lancashire constabulary i throw myself into a job i love spend as much time on the frontline as i could i learn the most about police when there be no camera around sit in the back of carrier on the way to drug raid walk the beat on a cold wet evening or take part in training side by side with officer they seem to make the most of the commissioner be there with they not spar i the newbie treatment just because of who i be i have be set on fire twice have drainpipe sawn off my arm and despite do all the video people would expect from a politician the most watch video from my whole term of office be the in which i get bite by different police dog with hindsight give that the public appear to enjoy the video of i get bite by dog more than the one about my budget i suppose i should have see my election defeat come in that particular election 
 in all sincerity though i place firmly and proudly on the record my gratitude to everyone i have work with at lancashire constabulary and in the office of commissioner as this house debate the future policy and funding of police in the uk we should never forget those at the heart of it on the frontline work and make sacrifice to keep we safe every day 
 i be able to give this maiden speech today only because the people of fylde have give i the honour of serve as their member of parliament and it truly be   an honour be elect to represent an area where my family connection go back before i be even bear that we as a family love and where my year old son walter will grow up and call home be an incredibly special and humble moment 
 fylde be a proud and beautiful area steep in the history of lancashire and our country nestle on stunning coastline with many town and village across the countryside each with their own history might i add that it be also an area that we intend to fight to keep green and beautiful for generation to come 
 fylde be far more than coastline countryside and be part of our county ’s history some of the most advanced technology in the world be be develop and build here in fact often when out near warton and freckleton we can hear the jet fighter take off from the site where they be construct while i be out on the election battlefield campaign every day it feel strangely reassuring to hear the incredible noise as the fighter jet power overhead to be honest i need all the back up i could get in the battle to keep fylde blue this time 
 from the defence sector to farming and agriculture tourism and hospitality the care sector and other there be a strong local economy however to build on that to create more opportunity for young people and to well connect our business and those seek opportunity across lancashire and beyond we need to improve infrastructure and public transport i be grateful to the work that my predecessor as the member for fylde do to secure million in extra funding work with the government local council and other partner he be critical in secure the £ that enable the m55 to heyhouses link road to be construct and it have recently be open 
 a few month early the £ windy harbour to skippool bypass open an important link road for the people across poulton le fylde the boundary review bring this historic market town of poulton in wyre to the constituency of fylde i therefore also place on the record my thank to the former member for wyre and preston north and former defence secretary the right hon ben wallace and not only for the role he play in secure the funding for that major project but for his unwavering work as secretary of state for defence in such critical unpredictable and dangerous time the global leadership he demonstrate in galvanise the international response to putin ’s illegal invasion of ukraine be a legacy that he should be incredibly proud of 
 go back to fylde we need to focus on continue to improve the exist road network as well as expand it equally as importantly we need to secure investment for the rail network and i will be campaign hard for a pass loop on the south fylde line to improve the regularity and reliability of service 
 i would also like to talk about an important personal area of work that i will undertake as a member of this house i would not be here today i would not have survive the journey to this moment without the support encouragement and love of my wife caroline we have be each other ’s strength through good time and difficult one and the fact that caroline have always have the strength to support i in such magnitude when she have have her own battle to fight be testament to the   person she be caroline like thousand across this country live with what be often know as an invisible disability it mean that she have often conceal just how sick and in pain she be she have have to explain why she be in hospital when just week early she may have be visibly well to everyone and therefore suffer in silence 
 i want to champion the work of crohn ’s colitis uk and other charity and organisation that support and advocate for those with disability that be not visible and to help remove the stigma indifference and even hostility that they receive for example when need to use facility mark as for disabled people the hurt and humiliation that can cause only add to the incredible difficulty of live with these condition and we must do much more to raise awareness 
 to conclude fylde be a place where some of the most advanced fighter jet in the world be build and it be at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and other technology but it be also a place where town from lytham to kirkham and village from stain to singleton still crown the young rose queen each year and hold gala and parade and a place where people take pride in look after the countryside and preserve our heritage i intend to spend my time in this house fight for fylde yes for the investment in our future but also the preservation of our history our coastline and our countryside 
 thank you mr deputy speaker for allow i the opportunity to give my maiden speech it be a privilege to follow so many excellent maiden speech in this important debate i congratulate   the hon member for bridgwater sir ashley fox   on his powerful and witty speech i must also congratulate in particular my hon friend   the member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman   on his excellent speech too as a former professional golfer it be fitting that he win his seat on such a huge swing and his brilliant speech show we why the bar have be set intimidatingly high in this debate 
 i feel all the more honoured to be elect by the people of glenrothes and mid fife to be their representative in the house and follow in the footstep of predecessor who serve the constituency with such distinction i pay tribute to the outgoing mp peter grant who serve with such commitment and so diligently on behalf of his constituent he will rightly be proud in particular of his contribution to the successful campaign for the reintroduction of the levenmouth rail link both as fife council leader and as an mp for his service on the public accounts committee and for campaign for the right of victim of financial scandal through his role on the all party parliamentary group on personal banking and fair financial service 
 i also pay tribute to peter ’s predecessor lindsay roy who be such a brilliant mp for the constituency today lindsay be a tireless advocate for parkinson ’s uk make the case with passion and eloquence for improved support for people with parkinson ’s and for investment in medical research his example should not only give hope to people with parkinson ’s he be an inspiration to we all 
 i be a new member in this parliament but i be privileged to serve in the scottish parliament for year i have already observe some of the difference between holyrood and here this institution be old and often more complex as indeed be many of its member and there be many procedure and protocol to learn but while there be difference between the parliaments the purpose we have be a common to serve our constituent we have hear over the past week how it be vital to have strong relationship between the uk government and the devolved administration that be of course true however i believe that there be still too few opportunity for member of each of our uk parliaments to work together on many matter of share responsibility and interest i hope that there can be great collaboration between all our parliamentarian in the course of the next year 
 on a personal note may i say that i be proud that my wife claire baker continue to serve the people of mid scotland and fife in the scottish parliament with such skill and dedication i be delighted that claire and our daughter catherine could be in the gallery when i be swear in 
 i have also be greatly privileged to work for disability charity in my time away from elect politic for the past year i have work with the charity enable in a role support people with learn disability on campaign for their right not to speak on their behalf but to support they to be their own advocate for change as expert by experience in the medium in public forum and in parliaments enable member ambassador have tell their own story and powerfully argue the case for a more equal society the need to tackle these inequality be clear when people with learning disability have a life expectancy of year less than the rest of the population only about be in pay employment they have few opportunity in education and they be twice as likely to experience bullying i will miss work with they but i will not miss the opportunity in this parliament to make our country a fairer and a more equal place for disabled people 
 i will also not miss the opportunity to be a champion in the chamber for the people of glenrothes and mid fife the constituency stretch across fife from methil buckhaven and the wemyss village on the coast to ancient markinch and the new town of glenrothes and from kinglassie and cardenden and the village of benarty to lochgelly and kelty those and other community in the constituency have their own history and priority but so many be link by their proud connection to the mining industry that be why the decision by this government to end the injustice of the miner pension scheme so that fund in the scheme be keep for its beneficiary will be so important for so many of my constituent 
 the community of my constituency can look back on a proud industrial heritage but it be vital that they can also look forward to their future as a hub for innovation technology and our grow renewable sector the biomass plant at markinch the hydrogen for domestic energy pilot at buckhaven and the fife energy park at methil be all example of how our contingency can benefit from the exciting plan for gb energy and our goal for scotland to play a lead role in make britain a green energy powerhouse 
 we have to seize this opportunity buckhaven and methil have the high number of deprive community in fife which be why we have to realise the ambition for the area and increase employment through expansion in renewable it be vital that uk ministers work collaboratively with management union the scottish government and fife council to ensure that despite the financial difficulty of harland wolff which operate the fabrication yard at methil the skilled job and apprenticeship at the yard be secure along with its infrastructure and facility that skilled workforce and the facility at the yard will be instrumental in realise fife ’s ambition to be a thriving hub for the renewable sector in scotland 
 it mean so much to i to be give the chance to be a champion for our part of scotland my mother be a teacher at beath high the school attend by of our most celebrated novelist sir ian rankin who grow up in cardenden in the constituency in sir ian ’s book set in darkness inspector rebas carry out criminal investigation at the scottish parliament we can only wonder where he find inspiration for the plot of his novel but i be sure we can all agree that fife can be proud to call of our fine writer of our own 
 i also know how resilient our community can be and how we can look to well day even after the tough of time when i be grow up in fife my father be a vicar in lochgelly during the miner strike my father in law jim be a proud member of the national union of mineworkers when i stand for election to this place in he give i a miner ’s lamp to bring with i to westminster if i win to remind i what i be here to do i be not elect in and after that election nearly year ago many would have think that the flame of the labour and trade union movement be fragile and flickering but today in this parliament it burn bright than ever year later the lamp will be with i here in westminster and it will remind i why i be here to deliver the change that our country need and to show that through political action we can deliver the strong fair society that so many people in my constituency give so much to achieve 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for call i to make my maiden speech during this important debate   on the king ’s speech which set out the agenda of change that the country vote for and which this labour government will deliver i congratulate all new member who have make maiden speech today 
 it be the honour of my life to represent my home of hastings and rye i know that you be very familiar madam deputy speaker with all that we in hastings and rye have to offer visitor especially our famous fish and chip in recent year our fisherman have work hard to keep our local fishing industry go in the most difficult of circumstance and they will always have my full support hastings and rye host the world crazy golf championship every year and we also hold the world record for the big gathering of pirate in any place a record that we try to beat every year on pirate day although of my predecessor in represent rye be himself a real pirate i be relieve to say that that can not be say for many of they 
 sally ann hart work extremely hard for our constituency and i thank she in particular for her work in support of woman and child feel domestic abuse a legacy that i hope to build on another thing that we wholeheartedly agree on be speak out about the unacceptable level of abuse and intimidation that too many member of this house have face particularly woman the plaque of the late jo cox be face we and that of sir david amess be behind i they be a constant and tragic reminder of where that can end i also pay tribute to my labour predecessor michael foster he be well know in our area for help so many resident and for have be a passionate champion for hastings and rye during his time in this house 
 many members will know our area for a very famous battle that take place in historian may still be argue about where exactly it take place but it be safe to say that it have cement our place in the history book since then we have continue to play our part in british history from be immortalise in the novel the ragged trousered philanthropists to be the birthplace of television perhaps what define we most though be our community spirit underpin by our volunteer and charity who do so much our calendar be full of carnival and festival from jack in the green to bonfire night those event be make possible only by volunteer who give up their time to give back to the community and raise money for our local charity volunteer also maintain and protect so many of our amazing public space from hastings country park to rye harbour nature reserve and camber sands 
 there be also some point of our history that we would rather forget such as the unveiling of a certain stone tablet in hastings during the general election campaign by my right hon friend   the member for doncaster north ed miliband that stone may have be consign to history but i know that my right hon friend will be back very soon to unveil some new green energy infrastructure and that it will be long last than the stone 
 although we have often find ourselves at the centre of historical event we have not always feel all of the benefit our road and rail infrastructure be stick in the past we may be a similar distance from london as brighton be but our train line take twice as long we lie    at the end of the a21 a road that have be describe as the least develop in the south east of england as any driver will tell you we have the bad pothole in the country and our water infrastructure be also fail we southern water have a lot to answer for in my constituency dump record level of sewage along our coastline from st leonards through hastings to fairlight pett camber sands and winchelsea beach some sewage have even come into people ’s home and garden in my constituency and when the water pipe have fail we have face major flooding in home and the town centre and be leave without a water supply for day on end i be pleased to see that the water special measure bill which will start to clean up our water industry be part of this king ’s speech 
 the cratered state of our road and crumble water infrastructure be symbolic of how we have too often be forget by westminster life expectancy be low than the national average a trend that have get bad over the past year people wait long for an ambulance in my constituency than anywhere else in the south east of england and the situation be particularly bad in our village and rural area such as winchelsea where people wait minute on average when have a stroke or heart attack that be why this government ’s plan to cut nhs waiting time can not come soon enough 
 as a seaside destination our area have benefit hugely from tourism but we be also at the sharp end of the housing crisis with spiral rent and simply not enough home be build too many of my constituent be leave in poor quality rental accommodation whether by southern housing or private landlord that be why i so welcome the measure in this king ’s speech to get britain build again build more home and give all renter more protection 
 this government have a mission to break down the barrier to opportunity that be sorely need in my constituency where almost of child be grow up in poverty and over half our young people be leave school without the essential qualification of a grade in english and math how we treat our child say a lot about we as a society before join this house i have the privilege of see that up close in many different country as an aid worker with save the children it be always child who suffer the most in war and conflict i have sit with young mum in yemen hold their starve baby so hungry that they do not have the energy to cry and have hear harrowing story from rohingya woman who have flee ethnic cleansing and sexual violence at the hand of the myanmar military i always promise those woman that i would share their story with the world and my time in this place will be no different 
 we be at a time in history when more child be grow up in conflict than ever before rightly much focus have be devote recently to the appalling event in israel and palestine there too it be child bear the brunt of war we must redouble our effort to bring about peaceful solution to all these conflict and must remember that all the global issue we face from climate change to migration can only be solve by work across border with our international ally and through strong multilateral institution such as the united nations 
 just as i have be so inspire by the woman i have meet live in some of the tough place on earth i also want to acknowledge some of the woman whose   shoulder i stand on close to home madam deputy speaker i know i speak for many labour members when i say how much we miss your sister the late great baroness margaret mcdonagh hon member hear hear she always have such wise counsel to offer we and that be the reason why many of we sit on these benches today i also thank my family and friend for all the support they have give i in get i to this place 
 this king ’s speech will begin to deliver the change and renewal that hastings and rye vote for i look forward to work hard for all my constituent across hastings and rye and deliver that much need change 
 it be a privilege to make my maiden speech among such an outstanding group of people i hope that people who have see the maiden speech over the past few day and will watch they in the day week and month to come might see some of the warmth kindness and decency that i have meet in my fellow mps in these couple of week in parliament 
 i be the newly elect member for the beautiful constituency of worthe west nestle between the south down and the english channel we be often describe as that area just west of our big sister brighton but as with all young sister we have many often unsung merit about which it will be my absolute pleasure to tell the house a little today 
 worthe west be make up of third of worthe town the other now be ably represent by my hon friend   the member for east worthing and shoreham tom rutland in this part of my constituency people can find worthe town centre our beautiful old lido building and the recently return worthe wheel before be elect to parliament i have the great privilege of be the leader of worthe council our vision for worthe be for it to be both the fair and the green coastal town in the uk an ambition that i be sure my coastal colleague will try to wrestle from i alongside an ambitious decarbonisation plan work on worthe ’s town centre garden will begin this autumn in a community and council lead project we be also privileged to be part of the sussex bay project a movement of radical collaboration initiate by adur worthe councils with the mission of restore a healthy blue ecosystem to our sea and waterway in which nature people and the local economy can thrive 
 worthe west be also home to the beautiful coastal and country village of ferring east preston angmering findon clapham and patching i can tell any keen camper i have not be in parliament long enough to know how many mps actually like be without wi fi and a good latte but i be hop to find a few that the fox wood campsite in patching be a firm local favourite there be very handy pub near the site the fox and the worlds end which serve the most excellent food when your fire will not light and even the kid be sick of bean on toast 
 i be only the member of parliament to represent worthing west it be form in and for the past year have be represent by sir peter bottomley who i know be very well respect here as the father of the house he be know for work cross party on a variety of important campaign include leasehold reform and the infected blood scandal sir peter and i share a great affection for worthe west and during the election campaign we often bump into each other enjoy a quick cuppa with constituent i should confess at this point that i be a northerner originally adopt by the south as of its own and a good brew be a must have for a day to start and end well    we have many excellent cafés in our area to anyone who be listen to my speech and think that this newbie mp be not do too bad a job of sell the merit of her home town i can thoroughly recommend the cake at sea lane café on goring beach the coffee at both coast café and finch in worthe town centre and the breakfast at the bluebird café in ferring among many other 
 at this point i should also confess that my extolling of the virtue of cake and all credit to the house staff for the incredible muffin in the parliamentary café be temper by the fact that i be by profession a medical doctor and as my child will testify i be reasonably obsess with make sure that cake be part of a healthy balance that allow we to enjoy all the different type of food to be fair my child would not necessarily recognise that description and might just say that their mum be a bit of a nag with a carrot obsession and an aversion to play computer game for too long but such be the joy of parenthood 
 when people ask what type of doctor i be and i definitely do not have the patience for a phd the response that i be a public health consultant be often meet with slightly puzzled stare a recalibration of what they have hear and the decision that i be probably a gp by another name however i be delighted to join my hon friend   the member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams   to represent public health here in the house it be the reason i choose to go into politic it be the art and science ofkeeping population well and help people to live healthy life i appreciate that today ’s debate primarily concern home affair and immigration so i will talk about public health on the basis of the explicit principle that health be essential in all thing to ensure safety and security for all people 
 as part of my public health training i spend time with the health protection agency now part of public health england that training stand i in particularly good stead during the pandemic when i find myself with a daily slot on bbc radio sussex talk about covid debunk myth and provide reassurance that our fantastic scientist and public health specialist be do everything possible to develop vaccination and to keep we safe the result of the covid inquiry publish last week reveal the clear conclusion that investment in preventive measure be always money well spend and that be sadly lack before the pandemic public health funding be cut by between and so there be some salient lesson to be learn quickly about prevention be well than cure 
 my time in local government as a public health consultant and subsequently as a councillor and council leader teach i that politics be often the frontline where we grapple with the issue that arise from inequality and inequity indicator which tell we that the decision make by those of we in a position of influence be not yet decision that be maximise the health and wellbeing of the people we represent the resource require to meet basic human need should be available to everyone regardless of where we live or which family we be bear into for people like i in public health and politic there be a wealth of datum and evidence as well as i would contend basic common sense show    that when resource be not allocate fairly to allow everyone ’s basic human need to be meet we all suffer for it 
 people do not thrive without clean water clean air access to green space and good food our physical body become far less resilient to illness when those be not available to we and the same be true of poor housing poor education and poor job the causal link between poor housing condition and poor health outcome be long establish with health outcome associate with poor housing cost the nhs an estimate £ every year we know that exposure to poor housing condition include damp cold mould and noise be strongly associate with poor health both physical and mental inequality in life expectancy be increase especially for woman in worthing west a woman live in of our poor area will live an average of year less than a woman live in of our wealthy area and for the population as a whole the time spend in poor health be increase as sir michael marmot so saliently put it 
 if health have stop improve it be a sign that society have stop improve 
 when people become physically and mentally ill potential be lose and before you know it your country do not have a national health service it have an overwhelmed national sickness service 
 i be so proud and privileged to be part of the labour intake of for too long now our politic have be make people sick this be the start of a journey that i very much hope will lead to a politics that help to keep people well for many generation to come reduce inequality and inequity will allow everyone to do well the politic of health be the narrative of our nation a government who focus on the health and wellbeing of the people we serve be a government who enable we to rise together to face the challenge of both today and tomorrow 
 i be grateful for this opportunity to make my maiden speech in this important debate i be in awe of the maiden speech and all the other speech that have be make today and on previous day the standard and quality of both this intake and long serve members be inspire i be fill with excitement pride and belief in what we can achieve in the year to come it be a truly exciting time 
 i be honour and privileged to speak as the member for rossendale and darwen my home i be very aware that this could happen only because of a huge amount of hard work by friend and labour colleague across the constituency and of course because of the decision make by so many of my fellow resident to put their trust in i and a change labour party i offer my heartfelt thank to everyone who put i in this place i will do my very good not to let they down 
 my constituency and home be a special place indeed i be tempt to say that it represent the very good of lancashire but wary of controversy i will simply say that it be a wonderful part of a wonderful county it be a post industrial place of moor hill and valley that frame the community of darwen whitworth bacup crawshawbooth stacksteads weir waterfoot rawtenstall edenfield helmshore and the west pennine village i will have miss out so i be sure i will be shoot as soon as i get home 
 in represent my home i succeed sir jake berry who serve our constituency for year i pay tribute to he for his service and in particular his work campaign on provision for child with special educational need 
 rossendale and darwen be very much a swing seat prior to we have be splendidly represent by janet anderson i be pleased and proud to call janet a friend we sadly lose she last year but i will always remember she as a true role model of a constituency mp she be always available always responsive always engage and always willing to roll up her sleeve and get stick in 
 what more can i say about rossendale and darwen i will spare member a full geography lesson and go for some fun ish fact the constituency be a quirk of boundary commission methodology that will forever remain a mystery to we there be little historical or   physical connection between rossendale and darwen indeed driver have to leave the constituency to travel between the half 
 rossendale be once know as the golden valley and lie at the very heart of the industrial revolution indeed a book on that time by local author chris aspin be subtitle when rossendale lead the world we be also refer to as the valley of stone and the flagstone in trafalgar square come from a rossendale quarry crown in darwen be britain ’s old paint maker 
 in mahatma gandhi come to meet mill worker in darwen seek to understand the hardship they be face on reflection that in itself be quite remarkable he say they treat i as of their own i shall never forget that this sense of inclusion and understanding remain we have many wonderful community organisation and while be reluctant to single anyone out i must pay tribute to the vital work do in my hometown by the bacup family centre and bacup pride and across the constituency by our volunteer lead food bank and credit union and keep darwen tidy and civic pride rossendale to which i wish the good of luck in britain in bloom judging this week 
 something we be less proud of be that rossendale be the only local authority area in the north without any sort of commuter railway service which be a fact that i hope the secretary of state for transport my right hon friend   the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh do not become too bored of hearing 
 i have a few more darwen be home to darwen live the uk’ and possibly europe’s big free music festival mr fitzpatrick ’s in rawtenstall be britain ’s last survive temperance bar darwen football club be form in and be the club in the world to have professionally pay player and brent peters manager of bacup borough football club be say to be the long serve manager in world football 
 rossendale and darwen be distinct place each with a deep history at the same time they have much in common i be in many way hearten that during the campaign of my most frequent ask be for a well politic the people of rossendale and darwen be honest and hard working they value integrity co operation and community service and they want to see this in their politician i believe this reflect a feeling across the country and hence it be a great opportunity and responsibility for we with over new mp we have a real chance to set a new tone to work together across the house and to hold to the standard that our resident expect of we 
 a less positive thing that rossendale and darwen have in common be a concern about the direction in which too many of our school have be head too many parent agonise over the choice or lack of choice available to they it simply must not be the case that a child ’s future be determine by an education lottery that every school be a good school be an imperative we must hold to and i be proud to see our new labour government commit to remove barrier to opportunity raise school standard and ensure that the school system be fair for every child 
 another commonality be our topography hill crag moor and valley i be a climber and cyclist and these be my playground i be fortunate to have enjoy an active life which have turn into a career it have take   i to amazing place and i know that i be healthy wise and happy as a result in many way what these sport have teach i be what have bring i here it be a sad fact that in the uk today nearly of the population be not active enough for good health this contribute to in death and be estimate to cost the uk economy £ annually yet physical activity can help to prevent and manage over chronic disease and condition include some cancer heart disease type diabete and depression overall it be recognise that £ spend on physical activity generate £ of benefit in return in short invest in physical activity be a no brainer it have be hearten to see the importance of prevention recognise so clearly in our manifesto in this debate and indeed at question time this morning 
 sport and physical activity can change life and they can save life active life start young yet around of under-18s do not get enough exercise how often do we hear kid tell we that there be nothing to do around here i believe that every child should feel they have full and inclusive access to the countryside and to recreational facility that give they the opportunity to live active life escape constraint and explore their potential i believe this mission underpin many other and i look forward to speak again on this subject in the year to come 
 the hill of rossendale matter to i in other way on the moor close to home we scatter the ash of our daughter mallorie she have be bear in burnley hospital with edward ’s syndrome a condition we be tell be not compatible with life her time with we be short but her impact on our life be great the support we have from burnley hospital and local baby loss charity friend of serenity be vital 
 while edward ’s syndrome be rare it be far from be the only cause of baby loss every day an average of family suffer the pain of baby loss that be around family a year some report suggest that up to in of those family tragedy be avoidable there be a grow movement around baby loss awareness indeed in october we have baby loss awareness week i hope to use my time in this house to support the ongoing drive for great care and support for the family affect by baby loss and for continued improvement in its prevention

 i need no lesson on how a lack of money impact on child grow up i live it but that experience teach i something far more valuable in understand the impact of poverty and inequality because what my   family lack in money we more than make up for in love and in hope and dream i be bring up to believe in i and what i could achieve my mother get herself out of poverty because of the open university and my father make a choice all too familiar today he give up his engineering job to be a sainsbury ’s warehouseman to guarantee cheap food and of course he serve as a shop steward for usdaw i remain proud of both my parent for what they do for i i be a free school meal kid separate queue of course and a free school uniform kid with clothe from the jumble sale and no new smart bright white sock for i but i have no poverty of aspiration no holding back no shutting down of my dream that be good parenting back by their hard work i commute hour every day to complete my own study take my newborn baby in a carrycot with i that be what learn to aspire result in 
 i get the little me so common in bassetlaw and elsewhere they be my people my responsibility money be often a problem but poverty of aspiration be much a big to overcome you be tell that you can not do that that this door be not for you that you stink that you be thick that your hope be only ever dream and can never be realise well this kid never stop dream today ’s little me the one who do without the flashy trainer who play outside but never go inside the big sport stadium or the posh restaurant and the cafés who do not fly on aeroplane or get take to museum or theatre who have never see the king or his palace or big ben in my area in my constituency of bassetlaw be too often expect by this place to celebrate a rapidly change world by get to the back of the queue and behave themselves i be not have that i drive truck across the channel the only woman in the driver section on the ferry small boat new problem the flight case i drive be huge with ventilation and a false bottom the border sniffer dog be an infrequent luxury i regularly run the gauntlet of organised crime and desperate people

 it be inspirational to listen to the story of   the hon member for bassetlaw jo white   and her determination to never stop dream it be also inspirational and fantastic to hear maiden speech from many other i be interested to hear the competition among some member about the length of pier in seaside town i hail from the great town of eastbourne while some hon member might have a long pi than mine it be important to remember that what you do with it be what be most important on our pier we have cafés we have bar and we have a former nightclub at which i once organise party we have get it all go on on eastbourne pier 
 but it be also an inspiration look around this house and read about its member to see and be part of the most diverse parliament ever more woman than ever before more lgbt people than ever before and more joshes than ever before this house ’s population of joshes go from to overnight on   july that be what we call an open door policy if member struggle to remember which josh i be i can make it very simple for they this josh represent eastbourne officially the sunny town in the uk as an eastbourne lad bear and breed it be the honour of my life to represent my home town and in particular to fight to protect service at our local hospital where i be bear the eastbourne district general hospital as our member of parliament i be so grateful to the people of eastbourne for place their trust in i 
 gorgeous sunray aside my town shin brightly in the many other accolade that it hold too we be the home of the roller skating ice rink in the uk in the a side football tournament in and the birthplace of the arctic roll in most personally eastbourne be the town that make i i 
 home be not always safe when i be grow up but thank to a wonderful family who love i thank to scout leader at seaside troop who challenge i and thank to teacher at cavendish school who believe in i eastbourne give i opportunity in fact there be a particular supply teacher i have who i want to pay tribute to right now caroline ansell who go on to become the conservative mp for eastbourne and be my predecessor mrs ansell and i meet in the religious education classroom room in cavendish school when i be year old perhaps she would have give i a detention or have she know at that time that day i would come for her next job at the ballot box some year later but seriously caroline dedicate herself to eastbourne and i put my recognition of her commitment on the record 
 i also pay tribute to another predecessor stephen lloyd my good friend whose service to our town inspire my own he be a complete and utter legend there be another predecessor as the member of parliament for eastbourne whose memory this house can and must   never forget ian gow who serve from until he be appallingly assassinate in a few year before my time ian gow be remember and still admire by eastbournians as an extremely hard work member of parliament the shield that honour he in this house serve as a reminder of his service his grave sacrifice and our duty to pursue debate and disagreement with civility respect and peace 
 turn to the subject of this debate i want to share a migration story that say a lot about the character of my town it start on a summer ’s day in 1960 eastbourne when a sweet retired lady mrs baker notice a curious sight she see another lady also white push a small black boy in a pram mrs baker curious strike up a conversation with that woman and ask what be go on mrs baker learn that the boy have be send to live with that woman by a young nigerian couple and she be care for the boy while the couple study in london inspire mrs baker say that she would love to do the same coincidentally the black boy ’s mother be pregnant again and be for a time a couple of year later baby and be send to live with the baker family in eastbourne they be toki babarinde and wale babarinde my uncle and my dad and it be part of a sort of private fostering arrangement that be not uncommon between west african family and white family at that time although it be not without its complication 
 in my dad ’s case and for his brother too move to eastbourne be a ticket to opportunity they love their upbringing and eastbourne embrace they sadly my uncle toki die early this year sat in the chapel during his funeral i turn behind i and among a sea of nigerian face be white lady also pay her respect charmaine baker from the baker family that moment give i goosebump just like those moment when old school eastbournians look at i in all my brownness all my gayness and all my working class rootedness and say josh you be of our own 
 i share that story to say that while eastbourne ’s hospitality tradition be often associate with the mighty bucket and spade they go far deep eastbourne ’s true hospitality tradition be of generosity welcome tolerance multiculturalism and compassion the story of how i end up in this house be testament to that and i believe that with those value the same go for our country regardless of what other member in various place in this house may say 
 while our town benefit from more sunshine hour than any other in the country that blare sun sometimes cast shadow too i be gutte to say that eastbourne be also home to the busy food bank in the country last year it distribute more food parcel per head than any other food bank in the uk accord to the trussell trust that be why work with eastbourne food bank ’s inspirational ceo howard wardle i lead eastbourne to become the council in the country to declare a cost of live emergency and to unlock emergency funding for those struggle most it be also why i sincerely believe that the government should be even more ambitious in lead the fight against poverty by scrap the child benefit cap 
 a compassionate state be by no mean a state that make we soft or weak in fact care be power we can not have enterprise innovation or justice if we do not have a culture of care and compassion that have underpin   my career ’s work found and run an organisation support vulnerable young people out of crime out of gang and into employment 
 our constituent have send we here to be bold in rebuild and reimagine our great country ’s spirit of have another ’s back as eastbourne ’s mp i will strive to achieve nothing less 
 i be honour to deliver my maiden speech and i thank the wonderful people of barking who have elect i if you will indulge i mr deputy speaker i would also like to thank my wonderful husband who have be by my side every step of the way this year have be quite the year for we with a new baby girl month old and a general election be call sleep have not be on our side as a household but of course it have all be worth it and i now have the absolute privilege of represent the east london constituency of barking 
 i would like to pay tribute to my predecessor the right hon dame margaret hodge who serve diligently as the member of parliament for bark for decade dame margaret have become know not only   for her tenaciousness but for her warmth she hold several ministerial post in the last labour government and serve as chair of the public accounts committee from take on and win against the far right in barking to campaign against tax evasion and avoidance dame margaret be always fiercely brave in stand up for what she think be right regardless of political party 
 as i prepare for my maiden speech i think about some of the parallel between margaret ’s family and my own margaret ’s family be jewish escape nazi occupy europe and margaret herself flee egypt for the united kingdom in in fear of persecution my grandparent osman and neriman tango be of turkish cypriot muslim background they escape violence in cyprus arrive in london on christmas eve in my mum alev be bear in cyprus in and be care for in a united nations tent the of they seek safety in the melting pot that be london ’s east end they speak no english they have no qualification and no money but they be safe 
 as i stand in this chamber and address hon member i can not help but think of my grandfather my late grandmother and my mum i do not think my grandparent could have envision that in generation their granddaughter would be a member of the mother of all parliaments it show what be possible in this country and i feel so deeply honour to be here i thank my mum who teach i and my sister neri and eda that we must always try our good work hard look after and care for other when they need our help be grateful for an education and when we can find a way to give back those be my value and i know that they be the value hold by family in my constituency 
 barking and dagenham be a special community in london and a place that i have come to know and love many of my constituent have a similar story to my family with heritage from different part of the world there be also community in my constituency that have live there for generation deeply proud of their barking and dagenham root and so they should be bark constituency be a place with a rich history whether it be industrial heritage include the former barking power station open by king george v or the uk ’s large council estate build after the world war as part of the government ’s home fit for hero scheme now barking be young and more diverse than the london and national average that be of the thing that make it such a vibrant place in which to live but it face challenge the unemployment rate in the constituency be bad than in any other london borough and average earning be much low than elsewhere shamefully of child in barking be live in poverty 
 economic growth be critical for the whole country and for my constituent economic growth be what allow government to invest so that we can all benefit from public service school our nhs frontline service run by local authority and a welfare system that value dignity for the individual economic growth mean additional investment in crucial work deliver by child ’s service tackle youth crime and violence in our community but economic growth do more than just pay for decent public service it can deliver people good well pay job that secure a roof over their head food on the table and hope for the future it be the   only route out of poverty and indeed it be how my grandparent break away from the cycle of poverty that be why i wholeheartedly welcome the government ’s commitment to economic stability and growth outline in the king ’s speech last week include plan for a national wealth fund alongside a new deal for work people 
 i also support the government ’s commitment to address the housing crisis especially because it be of the driver of poverty the average house price in barking have go up by over the last year and rent have soar there be thousand of people in temporary accommodation and a quarter of my constituent live in the under regulate private rent sector that be why the government ’s plan to bring forward a renter right bill to end section no fault eviction be so important for barking as be their commitment to speed up planning and infrastructure to get more home build 
 the king ’s speech be an agenda from a government who be on the side of my constituent it be a plan that give hope to people in this country who for too long have feel abandon hope for the future with deliverable plan to improve life be why i enter politic and i be sure why member on both side of the house enter politic it be why i serve as a council leader before come to this place and why i decide to run to be member of parliament for barking politic be perhaps the great vehicle for change and it be why this place matter build more home give child a well start in life with free breakfast club and more qualified teacher cut nhs waiting time lower bill with great british energy these thing matter and they will improve the life of people in my constituency they be all possible and only possible with economic growth 
 so to the good people of barking i say i promise to be on your side i will represent you faithfully and i will fight for a well future for barking so that every person have the opportunity to fulfil their potential something that be possible only if people feel safe in their community i will always champion public service and i will stand up for investment so that local people benefit 
 i be honour to speak in the chamber and i will repay that honour by work hard for my constituent as the mp for barking 
 thank you mr deputy speaker for call i to speak in this debate it be an honour to follow   the hon member for rotherham sarah champion   who speak on a subject on which we can all agree safeguard our woman and child there have be many excellent contribution today and it be an honour to follow each and every of they 
 in my short time in this house it have become abundantly clear to i that the most important person be you mr deputy speaker with your desire to keep speech and contribution short and that that be the good way for i to curry favour with you with that in mind i shall make my maiden speech 
 i arrive in this country as a toddler from the heart of africa to the heart of the midland leicester that city nurture school and shape i it would be fair to say that no matter where i be in the world there be a corner of a foreign field that be forever leicester the vibrancy the diversity and occasionally the complete rawness of the city be the backdrop of my upbringing 
 i remember very well as a child those free small cold bottle of milk that i use to get at school i remember very well when it be steal from i as well i remember embark on my life journey with friend from all different creed colour religion and no religion and we make a life for ourselves in this amazing country i remember also moment of racism that come to mind be with my late mother we be in a park and be set upon by a group of people who hurl abuse and foul thing include language and object in our direction but those incident be supersede by kindness love and understanding from the great people of this country 
 as the young child by a distance i be often refer to by my family member as the mistake but my mother always refer to i as a miracle and ever since then i begin to believe it my mother who do not get the opportunity of a formal education in her lifetime ensure all her child make the most of what this country have to offer it be this mother who when i suggest when i grow a bit old that i want to study history at university look at i as if i be about to become history so like a dutiful child i do optometry at university 
 and that bring i to here i have check the archive and it appear i be only the optometrist to have ever become an mp so i hope i can bring a little of my professional skill to help the house to focus on what matter and not be myopic in our decision making with laser like reflection i believe we can bring vision to matter before we and not make a real spectacle of ourselves but the serious point be this with well usage of optometrist our gp service and our pharmaceutical colleague we can ease the burden on secondary care in our hospital we all need to work join up and together 
 as we be on the topic of health at this juncture i would like to pay tribute to my predecessor jon ashworth a shadow health secretary for more than year before latterly taking on the shadow paymaster role he have the honour before i of represent the wonderful leicester south constituency in his maiden speech in he say it perfectly 
 i be privileged to represent a constituency of huge diversity vibrancy and tolerance and while we must never be complacent our community generally live harmoniously together we be part of a city renowne across the world for welcome incomer family have come from across the globe to make their home in leicester south our diversity 
 ethnicity 
 enrich our cultural social and civic life and contribute immensely to our economy too ”—[official report   june vol c. 
 he represent leicester south with distinction for year and i hope i can live up to the reputation he earn as a dedicated champion for our city 
 talk of champion leicester be the city of champion another miracle i be from the city that defy all the odd in the season when leicester city become premier league champion prove again that miracle can happen i have be a diehard fan ever since i be a child when of our favourite son gary lineker be still on the bench we have the tigers for our rugby force and the foxes for the cricket whilst the rider be usually top of the court in basketball and in mark selby we have a snooker world champion but on a serious note   we must invest in sport facility not only to continue this rich tradition but to give our youth opportunity to improve their physical and mental wellbeing and occupy their time in positive pursuit too many of my young constituent tell i they have nothing to do and we must give they that opportunity 
 young people also bear the brunt of the housing crisis and in leicester we face overcrowd and waiting list of over year bad than some london borough we urgently need more affordable home 
 leicester another miracle be where we find the remain of the last plantagenet king the bone of richard iii have be lie undisturbed for over year until they be discover under a car park in please do come and visit he at our beautiful cathedral we be a friendly bunch regardless of what you may have read and hear about we to quote shakespeare 
 my heart be time light than my look 
 my city be a united city we celebrate all religious festival christmas diwali vaisakhi even the caribbean carnival with equal vigour and have live in harmony for over half a century however in recent year fracture have appear sow by those who wish to divide we often by weaponise language i understand that our isle have finite resource but we must always have infinite empathy infinite sympathy and an infinite vocabulary to build bridge not to destroy they in the word of the great muslim sufi poet rumi we must raise our word not our voice it be rain that bring forth flower not thunder 
 during my campaign i be humble i think i know my city but i really do not within my city there be an underbelly a shadow a city within a city while i use to speak about people who have a conflict between eating and heating during my campaign i meet they food bank at o’clock on a tuesday morning have over people queue and i be tell that be of the quiet day they have ever have we must tackle the cost of live crisis and reduce the wealth inequality in our country it be not ethical or sustainable for any civilised nation to go on that way 
 poignant incident from my campaigning be when i knock at a house and a lady peer through a partially open door i could not see her whole face but see enough to see a life of sadness and tragedy she explain that she have have a relatively successful life but something have happen a work a little bit of bullying and she go into a depression cycle and never really recover she say to i i will vote for you if you can do of thing what do she ask i she say if you could just plant i a tree so i can see it that would make i smile and if you could get i a fountain so i can see some water trickle i ’ll vote for you forever 
 it be important to remember that it be the simple thing that people want and that make the big difference to their life they want someone to speak up for they in these corridor of power to speak about the injustice in the world to give a voice to those who do not have who have no might authority or power whether that be the forget in yemen the victim of conflict in sudan or the victim of the ongoing devastation in palestine regardless of where they be in the world   i will always endeavour to speak truth to power and demand that this new government take action for the poor and dispossess not just the powerful 
 finally if my campaign ever have a catchphrase it would be the chinese proverb that say the good time to plant a tree be year ago in order to enjoy its beauty its shade and its fruit but the next good time be today we must plant that seed of unity equality and justice now to ensure that our future generation can enjoy the fruit of friendship fairness and peace 
 i thank   the hon member for leicester south shockat adam i be sure many of we will find he a very hard act to follow i congratulate all the hon member who have make their opening contribution to this chamber i have listen intently and be impress by their passionate delivery and the personal content they have share 
 from the outset of my speech i would like to thank my family for the encouragement and strength they have give i on my journey to this place without their unwavering support i would not have become a local councillor and then an mp it be with gratitude and with enormous pride at be elect as the ever member of parliament for alloa and grangemouth that i take my turn to address the chamber 
 i also take this opportunity to highlight my respect for all the candidate who be on the ballot paper i admire anyone who want to dedicate themselves to public service and i pay special tribute to mr john nicolson those hon member who be re elect to this place a few week ago will all know that mr nicholson ’s sartorial elegance be match by his trademark eloquence in this chamber and in represent the constituent he serve with great distinction 
 with the forth run through alloa and grangemouth many people on both side of the river feel it be not a natural constituency but when we look at the community and town that make it up our new constituency make perfect sense 
 clackmannanshire be the small county in scotland be affectionately know as the wee county but be under no illusion although it be small in size it be mighty in its industrial heritage industry be a tradition that stretch right across our constituency alva and tillicoultry be the home of luxury woollen mill both run along the foot of the impressive and beautiful local hill as do menstrie the westernmost village of the which be synonymous with yeast manufacture vital of course for of scotland ’s national drink indeed alcohol production have be a fixture in alloa for decade and it be once regard as scotland ’s brewery town but sadly nowadays only a few remain 
 cross the forth we leave scotland ’s brewery town behind and come to grangemouth which be once know as scotland ’s boom town the grangemouth refinery start operate in this be the centenary year mean that it should really be a time of great celebration but it have be announce that refining oil in grangemouth be to stop possibly as soon as may   what happen next to the grangemouth refinery will reverberate around all our constituency oil will be part of the energy mix for year to come that be a fact but we also know that we need to accelerate the clean green energy industry that will combat climate issue low our bill increase national security and reindustrialise community 
 the term just transition have enter the modern lexicon but many people i speak with while out campaigning do not know what it actually mean it simply mean move from industry to another without leave worker and their community behind to deal with devastating economic and social consequence historically many worker in alloa and grangemouth have be victim of deindustrialisation and so call market force in a system that have value profit over people and create a society of gross inequality 
 we be at a crossroad we know what will happen if grangemouth stop refine before a new industrial cluster be ready it would mean that hundred of worker lose their job worker and family have to leave their community in search of work and the pub cafés and shop of grangemouth all lose custom allow a gap between cease refining and the new greener energy be operational be as unfair as it be unpalatable grangemouth can not go from be boom town to ghost town in the past few week my government colleague have engage with the union the company involve with the refinery and the scottish government and we be commit to exhaust all possibility of make grangemouth the site that we all need it to be 
 my constituency be call alloa and grangemouth but it be also my honour to represent larbert stenhousemuir and many surround village across both the falkirk and clackmannanshire council area as a football fan it would be remiss of i not to mention of sauchie ’s favourite son multiple european cup winner scottish internationalist and respected pundit alan hansen i know that the house will join i in express relief at his recovery from a recent health scare it would also be remiss of i not to congratulate stenhousemuir football club the warrior on their league championship win last season i be very much look forward to the alloa and grangemouth constituency derby between alloa athletic and stenhousemuir fc in league next year 
 on the subject of sport before come to this place i be a golf professional it might not seem it at but be a golf professional have transferable skill for be an mp the building of relationship the creation of rapport serve people and try to improve thing for they be skill that will stand i in good stead in this place also work in golf for year have get i use to deal with tories work in golf be fantastic it take i to place that i would never have be and allow i to speak with people i would never have meet we truly be rich when we encounter people from other part of the world and learn about their culture and custom that apply not just when we go to different place it also benefit we here in britain when we welcome people into our community 
 our community need action that improve people ’s life and give they not just hope but the route out of struggle rest assure i will work with local business charity and sector organisation in my constituency and with uk government colleague and counterpart   from the scottish government to deliver the change that people need i know that my voice carry the necessary weight to bring about that change not because of who i be but because of the position i hold the people of alloa and grangemouth have give i the responsibility to use my voice and i intend to do so for the benefit of everyone from every community across the constituency that i be so proud to represent 
 it be my honour to stand in this chamber as the member of parliament for the beautiful town of cheltenham and it be a pleasure to follow   the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman i heartily commend what he say about alan hansen who i watch on television on many occasion as a young football fan 
 since last summer when my wife return to work after maternity leave i have be enjoy the unusual combine role of wannabe member of parliament and stay at home dad they tell i it be a job require endless patience a great deal of tolerance the ability to understand almost inhuman form of communication and boundless enthusiasm for clear up a never end supply of mess and i hear a toddler can be tough too
