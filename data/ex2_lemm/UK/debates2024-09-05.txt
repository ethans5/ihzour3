the minister shake his head but if we have shut down all that capacity if we can not generate the electricity ourselves we will have to get it from other place there be phenomenon call wind drought which can go on for very long period what be we go to do when the wind turbine be not turn and the sun be not shin during a very cold spell in the middle of winter we have or close scare this winter the generate margin that we use to enjoy have go the great risk of accelerate the decarbonisation of the electricity system be that there will be more appeal for voluntary or compulsory restraint from industry because industry be the hide customer that be shut off when we be short of electricity or we risk more brownout or even blackout that not impossible so where be the datum that the minister be place so much confidence in that show these forecast to be wrong i be not make they off my own bat there be plenty of people out there make they 
 that bring i to the final brief point i want to make i understand the logic that the minister explain in his letter to i 
 i absolutely share that ambition but the question be how quickly we can get there at the moment tidal power produce almost nothing as a proportion of our electricity requirement it be also intermittent by the way time a day there be a period during which it do not generate anything and we need to replace that supply with other thing the real challenge be how we get to the objective that the hon gentleman and i share in a rational way that carry the british public with we it be noticeable that what people be complain about most be the price on their electricity bill today the constraint cost balance cost infrastructure cost and import cost that i mention make up perhaps of domestic electricity bill if that figure be wrong let the minister produce some figure of his own that explain what proportion of consumer bill arise from all those factor because it be not explain there be no transparency on our electricity bill 
 on the hon gentleman ’s point about the objective of decarbonisation we be not go to get there at all if we lose the public if the light start brown out or go out and we find that we can not meet demand   to some extent we be pile up that demand by decarbonise transport and other part of the system include decarbonise building heat through heat pump the demand for electricity will rise but our capacity to produce it reliably at all hour and in all condition be be reduce 
 on the question of import and export we might become a net exporter of electricity but perhaps the hon gentleman can explain how the price at which we be export compare with the price at which we be import the difficulty be that we will be import when the wind be not blow or the sun be not shin and it be likely that the wind will not be blow across the entirety of the north sea so we will be import fossil fuel generate power at a very high cost to compensate for the fact that we have get rid of our own gas production and gas fire power station i be not sure that situation will be very good 
 if the hon gentleman would look at the arup report on the tarchon interconnector which will come into my constituency under the present plan he will see that that interconnector will not actually contribute very much to security of supply but will be use almost entirely to export when there be too much wind it will export at below the strike price because there be too much wind and it will export at a loss and the cost will finish up on the bill of the british consumer so the british consumer be pay for all the investment pay for the strike price pay for the infrastructure and then pay to subsidise the export to the germans who will be the beneficiary of all this investment 
 i appeal to the minister to just read the arup report and look at this that be why i ask about the offshore co ordination support scheme work that have be do i be not go to ask for the impossible and ask he to revive the ocss but i would like from he an assurance that the work eso have do will not simply be throw away and waste please can he assure the house that that work will be incorporate into the spatial plan that eso say it want to produce some very interesting innovation come out of that work but there be also a lot of work discredit the long term viability of norwich to tilbury and look on a different timeframe in the long term that could produce a much more viable alternative than be currently on the table there be still work to be do on that but i have no doubt that fintan slye will want to do that work as part of his project for the government 
 i would like to know that the minister be go to support the holistic approach to which the secretary of state refer because norwich to tilbury be certainly not the product of a strategic approach to electricity grid upgrading we need a much more strategic approach and i be look for that from this government but it certainly will not come from this bill

 when the opportunity come to stand and make a difference i choose to stand where i live northampton i meet my wife katie who also join we from the public gallery just down the road in wellingborough and northamptonshire have be my home for nearly year now i still have a place in my heart for my home town of romsey which be well represent by you madam deputy speaker hon member hear hear but i be proud to call myself a northamptonian and to represent the town that i live in and love 
 northampton south be a vibrant constituency from duston and upton in the west the hunsburys and shelfleys wootton collingtree hardingstone and great houghton in the south and area such as weston favell billing and rectory farm in the eastern district each area of my beautiful constituency have its own individual identity in the centre of my constituency remain the legacy of the shoe and boot trade that be once the main employer in my town the church ’s shoe factory remain in st james and the surround terrace   in far cotton and delapre be still stand strong nearly year after they be build as my hon friend   the member for northampton north lucy rigby   note yesterday church ’s hold the honour of be the choose cordwainer of a renowned former member for sedgefield

 the formation of the newly shape northampton south constituency mean that i have have the opportunity to take over from former member of parliament who have have very different experience and career in this house and i would like to pay tribute to they both andrew lewer the previous mp for the former northampton south constituency be focus on parliamentary business and tackle the challenge that he see as the most important to the uk he champion the motor neurone disease association which be headquarter in northampton as well as independent school and house building locally he will continue to be recognise through the annual spencer percival debate that he help to set up in the town he be also the only person to have hold the position of leader of a council member of the european parliament and member of this house a testament to his public service 
 i also take over in part from dame andrea leadsom the former member of parliament for south northamptonshire many of the southern village that have now join northampton south be in her constituency dame andrea serve as a secretary of state under the previous government and have a formidable record of championing parent and child include by establish the northamptonshire parent infant partnership in my county many of the people who have write to i since my election have praise her advocacy for they as their constituency mp it be clear that she make a massive difference not only in this house but in our county 
 northampton may hold the accolade of be the large town in the uk i will take that up with hon member for read after the debate but our town have have a continual lack of investment and a lack of vision and drive to make it well unfortunately we have have no shortage of conservative scandal public loan to our football club go miss our county council be make bankrupt the former police fire and crime commissioner stand down over misogyny complaint and allege domestic abuse mean that that the leader of the council resign and now stand as an independent trust in politician in northampton be at an all time low but there be hope for northampton and it come with a labour government 
 this labour government will make northampton a place to be proud of we will tackle our chronic air quality challenge fix our road improve our bus network ensure that housing be affordable of good quality and highly sustainable make work pay and a route out of poverty grow the co operative social enterprise and mutual sector in our town bring nhs dentist back to northampton end the am scramble for gp appointment face head on the funding gap leave in our public service and address the special educational need and disability crisis that be rock our county 
 it be clear that there be a lot of work to do but as i say in my acceptance speech at the count the hard work start here and i really mean it i can not wait to get start 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to give my maiden speech in this important debate the ongoing transition of our energy system be have a profound and sadly often harmful impact on many of the community in my constituency so i be very hopeful that the provision in the bill will begin at last to put the future of renewable energy in the service of those i represent i warmly commend to my hon friend on the front bench the proposal of which i be sure they will be aware for great british energy to be give a duty to deliver nature recovery alongside its other objective 
 i begin this speech by pay tribute to my predecessor who serve our constituency and this house faithfully for many year the clear proof of the diligence with which he carry out his duty and the respect he earn from his constituent be plainly obvious from the feedback on the doorstep throughout the general election i especially want to thank my predecessor for the work he do to support the campaign for hugh ’s law to secure well financial support for parent care for seriously ill child and also for his work fight for the restoration of the several internationally significant chalk scheme that flow through north east hertfordshire i look forward to do what i can to further both of those important project during my time in this place 
 although the many year of my predecessor ’s incumbency have all but erase it from our memory i be not in fact the member of my party to represent community in north east hertfordshire the late great trailblaze shirley williams when she be elect as a labour mp represent many of the area that make up my constituency despite the intervene year i find read her maiden speech from very helpful in prepare for this moment for as she say then the constituency i represent be in many way a microcosm of much of our country 
 north east hertfordshire from hinxworth to bayford contain many small rural community full of important history and culture from the home of george orwell in wallington to the stain glass window design by william morris and pre raphaelite artist in waterford in baldock buntingford and royston we have quintessentially english market town home to fantastic independent business as well as nationally significant company such as johnson matthey in letchworth we have the world ’s garden city build on the principle of the common ownership of land which to this day offer a radical example of how to well design and build the community of the future surround it all we have some of the good agricultural land in the country with local farmer such as those near groundswell in weston and finches farm in benington spearhead the ecological innovation we need to grow fantastic food in harmony with nature 
 yet in my experience of speak to resident right across north east hertfordshire the recur theme be of community dispirit and frustrate at have their need put aside in the interest of what other have call progress so i will close by mention debt of honour that i want to bring to hon member attention at this time i have be ask to keep the follow story anonymous by the family in question but i believe it illustrate powerfully how the community outside our urban centre be too often treat

 i will also take a quick moment to thank my incredible team for lead such a brilliant and hard fought election campaign and my family for their support most of all i thank my incredible partner louise for all her love and backing over the year it be here however where i must   confess to break my election pledge not long before the general election be call lou and i find out that we be to be expect our child while we be of course over the moon that news come off the back of a very hard local election campaign and amid lou experience extreme morning sickness so be the supportive partner that i be i assure lou that this would be a trimester of absolute peace tranquillity and calm as there be absolutely no way that the prime minister would call a general election in the summer we all know how that turn out i put on record my apology to lou for break that promise i will endeavour to ensure that be the and last time i break my word to a constituent 
 cheadle be truly a brilliant place we have wonderful green space brilliant school and some fantastic high street but what make the constituency so special be the people the area be build on the foundation of so many community group and organisation all campaign and work to make our community a well place for everyone there be allotment group such as billy ’s lane who invite local school to learn about grow food and healthy eating there be cheadle civic society lead by the inspirational phillip gould bourn who protect cheadle ’s heritage and historic character there be many faith group include cheadle masjid grove lane baptists and yeshurun hebrew congregation who provide support for our most vulnerable resident and there be hundred of community organisation and friend group such as the friend of carr wood who be the guardian of some of our most precious green space and rightly challenge those who would do they harm those be the people who make cheadle so special and i thank they for put their faith in i as cheadle ’s member of parliament i have always say that i would be their voice in westminster not westminster ’s voice in cheadle that will always be my goal 
 there be much to do our local hospital stepping hill be in dire need of investment for too long staff and patient have have to make do with a hospital that be literally fall apart the out patient building be condemn and be now demolish and in march the intensive care unit which look after some of the most critical patient be temporarily close because the ceiling be come in nurse have even tell i about bucket squad for the uninitiated this be a term they have coin for an extra duty they now have on shift where they each have a bucket to place down when it rain to catch the water come through the roof this be a disgrace 
 no hospital let alone as busy as stepping hill should operate in those condition that be why my act as the member of parliament for cheadle be to write to the secretary of state for health and social care ask for the fund that stepping hill desperately need for repair i be pleased that the government have since say that funding will be make available but until we get the detail and the money i will keep fight to ensure that stepping hill its staff and its patient get the funding they deserve 
 i will also keep fight to get my resident the support they need during the cost of living crisis this be an issue of huge importance to i when i be my mum brother and i be threaten with homelessness because mum who work several job to make end meet could not afford the private rent we face   rely on friend who could offer couch or spare room to help we the idea be sell as a fun holiday to i and my brother but i can remember how anxious and worry my mum look and how conversation between adult would suddenly stop as i walk into the room life feel unsettled and i could tell that my mum be scared and need help 
 it be a lib dem councillor call david bruce who that help we by fight and get we a council house because of he we have a home give we the security and stability to get on in life home be no long an anxious place mum be happy and my brother and i could focus on our schoolwork that experience inspire i to get into politic because i see at hand the positive impact that it can have on people ’s day to day life without that councillor i can honestly say i would not be stand here today but that be not the end of our story we still struggle face with rise bill mum would sometimes have to decide whether to put money into the electric meter or food into the cupboard if i think about it i can still hear the clunk of the pay meter go off and plunge the house into darkness mum would often joke that that be the cue for we to go to bed 
 sadly i know from speak to my constituent that this story be still be live out all too frequently the choice that many family have to make be horribly familiar the choice to heat their home or feed their child should never be force on anyone yet thousand of family across stockport face that choice every day i be proud that the liberal democrats on stockport council lead the way by establish a warm space programme support community organisation with the fund to help shelter vulnerable resident who could not afford to heat their home during the winter month many authority be now do that across the country but as wonderful as that be we can not sit back and accept this situation 
 great british energy be a step in the right direction i welcome the move to restore british investment in clean energy and if great british energy actually bring down cost for my constituent that will be nothing but a good thing i will do all i can to help my resident in cheadle when it come to the cost of living i will hold this government to account when i believe they be not do enough to support those who need it well health service support for the cost of live crisis and champion my amazing community those be some of the thing that i will do as cheadle ’s member of parliament it be truly the honour of my life to be stand here work for the place i call home the place i be now raise my family i hope i will do cheadle proud here 
 thank you madam deputy speaker i pay tribute to   the hon member for cheadle mr morrison whose experience and passion will be of great benefit to both his constituent and his local hospital and to my hon friend   the member for stratford and bow uma kumaran who will be a very worthy successor to those suffragette 
 it be a real honour and a privilege to be stand here as the mp for truro and falmouth i arrive in cornwall quite by accident nearly year ago have be sweep off my foot by a naval pilot who tempt i away from life as a london trade union lawyer with image of beach and sunset he fly search and rescue helicopter at culdrose naval station unfortunately as be often the case our military marriage be short and i be leave as a single mum with a small son but i choose to stay and bring he up in cornwall and it be very much our home become a single parent be sudden and difficult but i be fortunate i benefit from the opportunity offer by the last labour government and be able to get back on my foot i retrain and take a job as a teaching assistant work in a local secondary school for year in special educational need and later as an unqualified teacher which show the journey that education have be on 
 i pay tribute to my predecessor cherilyn mackrory she serve in a number of role in this place she show her passion for the environment in her work on the environmental audit committee and as chair of the ocean conservation all party parliamentary group she also draw on her own personal experience to help other she do a huge amount to shape the woman ’s health strategy and maternity safety awareness and be integral in introduce the new pregnancy loss certificate both cherilyn and her predecessor sarah newton work to secure a new woman and child ’s unit at treliske hospital in truro of the previous government ’s new hospital or unit it be desperately need and a long time come i have my son in the exist unit nearly year ago and the building be not fit for purpose then i really want to ensure its speedy completion 
 truro and falmouth have exist as a constituency only since it sit in the middle of the duchy of cornwall spread from falmouth on the south coast to crantock on the north coast falmouth be my home and where i have sit as a councillor for the past year it be a vibrant and welcome town envelop by the ocean falmouth have play its part in the history of great britain in the late 1600 the town be appoint the royal mail packet station receive and send mail and message all around the globe make falmouth for year at least the information superhighway of the british empire 
 however falmouth be more than its seafaring past we still have splendid castle pendennis and st mawes protect the entrance to the carrick roads but the constituency be also the site of falmouth university build on the legacy of the famous art school that be still find on woodlane but now anchor across the border in the state of the art tremough campus in penryn which it share with the university of exeter the area brim with creative scientist and engineer whom dawn french the university ’s chancellor describe as enterprise dreamer 
 if we follow the river fal upwards we reach truro cornwall ’s capital and only city with its impressive cathedral and award win theatre hall for cornwall it have lys kernow the home of cornwall council as well as treliske the acute hospital the constituency also have a large rural element with an array of beautiful village and area such as the roseland peninsula where farming and fishing be still vital industry 
 when research for this speech i be strike by the word in the maiden speech of of cornwall ’s most well known and love members of parliament david penhaligon exactly year ago in this house he refer to an economy that rely on tourism traffic condition in the summer month that strangle much of the industry that keep the place go for the rest of the year tremendous pressure on hospital service sewage problem pressure on housing the problem of summer let and the low average wage in britain i be pleased that the measure in this government ’s programme a real living wage the water bill devolution and renter right will help to address some of those issue but it be shocking that many of the issue that he mention then be sadly still very much in evidence today half a century on for a place on the edge of the map cornwall be too often at the edge of our thought in this place like penhaligon i believe that cornwall with its proud and independent heritage deserve well 
 turn to the topic of this debate there be so much to be excite by as well as cornwall ’s potential for onshore wind we have of europe ’s requirement for critical mineral and geothermal energy beneath our foot bury in our granite we only have to look at a horizon dot with the ruin of engine house to know that the people of cornwall be more than happy to dig for their treasure falmouth be a town with its face turn to the sea the port still have a very busy harbour and dock which have business service both military and commercial ship as well as host cruise and leisure vessel but there be potential for so much more and the port of falmouth be poise to take advantage of a new generation of offshore wind production in the celtic sea with the support of the new energy company gb energy the £ port fund and investment in the skill train we so desperately need our young people will be able to grasp with both hand the well pay job of the future while secure our own home grow energy and face down the challenge of climate change a challenge that be so important to a place like cornwall which star the impact of the change climate in the face every day we be the large rural authority to declare a climate emergency and the net target now we will play our part in get the country to meet a similarly ambitious target falmouth ’s time truly have come again as part of the government ’s mission to become a clean energy superpower 
 truro and falmouth be the most magical place to live it well and truly hook i and my small family and have become part of i my journey despite its up and down have be a charmed and happy truro and falmouth have give so much to i and it be overflow with promise and brilliant independent minded enterprise dreamer i be determined to serve my home as well as it have serve i a bright future lie ahead for it 
 thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to make my maiden speech during a debate that be so relevant to my own wonderful constituency of camborne redruth and hayle in the heart of cornwall i come to this place and i be disappointed that the hon member   for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin be not present to hear i say this with year of business experience in the automotive sector and latterly in the renewable electricity sector i thank all those who have give their maiden speech today they be all truly heartfelt wonderful speech my own inspiration for be here come from my child my daughter and my son who join we in the public gallery today 
 i want to pay tribute to my predecessor george eustice for his work on animal welfare as secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs as well as his support for local project in cornwall such as kresen kernow the cornish archive and despite our profound difference on our relationship with the eu the honourable way in which he be prepared to criticise trade arrangement make by the conservative party 
 it be an unparalleled privilege to represent ’s home constituency and the tie that bind cornish man and woman to our homeland be weave into every sinew of our being the constituency of camborne redruth and hayle be a truly remarkable place the place where i be bear and grow up and where i live to understand camborne redruth and hayle i respectfully ask you madam deputy speaker to transport yourself in your mind to the summit of a single rocky hill smack bang in the middle of the constituency this rocky hill be call carn brea which be in fact cornish for rocky hill at the summit of carn brea sit the basset monument look down from foot across the constituency the monument be fund by public subscription in after basset himself petitioned the other place against slavery in 
 to the north of carn brea just mile away the celtic sea sparkle in the sunlight and lap the beautiful beach of gwithian portreath porthtowan st agnes and perranporth the celtic sea which offer the prospect of vast quantity of electricity generate from offshore wind an opportunity that i dearly hope this government will grasp look to the west from carn brea we see the town of camborne pronounce kammbronn in cornish mean crooked hill it be a town that along with its near neighbour redruth be synonymous with our tin mining heritage the town be once among the wealthy in britain help to drive the economy for more than century nestle in front of camborne a large flag of st piran flutter in the breeze this flag sit at the top of the south crofty tin mine there can be no fine physical symbol of the potential for the return of the cornish economic powerhouse than south crofty the last tin mine to close in 
 the economic wind have dramatically change since then and tin which be use in the production of virtually every electrical device be now also be use in the production of solar panel and along with lithium form the cornerstone of our critical mineral industry we import tin from as far afield as china and australia with all the damaging environmental impact that come with such import yet in camborne and redruth we sit on the high grade tin deposit in the world and there be plenty of it our sense of pride in our mining heritage which be mention by my hon friend   the member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham and the possibility of our tin mining renaissance be a constant source of hope and optimism for an area that have be damn by industrial decline for decade 
 but back to the summit of carn brea and basset ’s monument far over to the west on the horizon behind camborne be hayle the large town in the constituency although the official title of my constituency be camborne and redruth woe betide i if i do not mention hayle in the same breath hayle be a vital natural seaport ready to serve the new opportunity in the celtic sea and it include a very large estuary indeed the cornish word for estuary be hayl i have strong familial tie with the town where my great uncle the slade family once run a steel engineering business on south quay 
 let we look directly south from carn brea now to the gentle rolling hill lead down through the beautiful cornish granite village of stithians mawnan smith and constantine and then on to the stunning subtropical garden of glendurgan and trebah which in turn lead down to the helford river from where thousand of american troop set off on d day to free europe from fascism 
 to the east of carn brea lie redruth the cornish meaning of which be red ford the cornish word for red be ruth and the word for ford be red”—obviously redruth be rapidly become a cultural hub and i strongly recommend visit to krowji creative hub kresen kernow the aforementione archive centre the buttermarket and the ladder art and culture hub our former prosperity be evident throughout the centre of redruth with impose granite building that be awaken with new life after a deep slumber 
 far to the east beyond redruth can be find the village of carharrack and st day which serve as a hub for the of the world ’s wealthy copper mining district from the century to the 1830 just beyond they be united downs where cornish lithium geothermal engineering and ground source heat pump company be base these business have the potential to play key role in britain ’s economic transformation we have tin lithium geothermal and ground source heat but we be also bless with the opportunity of offshore wind in the celtic sea onshore wind solar and tidal there be very few place in the uk in which renewable energy and critical mineral opportunity be so abundant 
 the renewable energy opportunity be not the only factor that make this land so distinct let i quickly give other example year ago cornwall be grant national minority status under the european framework convention for the protection of national minority our language our culture and our heritage as well as our economic potential mark we out on this island secondly the positive reaction receive by all cornish mps on both side of the house for take our oath in cornish be tell almost half our child and young people consider themselves and foremost cornish finally on saturday my brother dickon will be make a bard of the gorsedh the high honour that can be bestow on a cornish man or woman this be an honour award to people who have give exceptional service to cornwall by a manifestation of the celtic spirit or by service to cornwall 
 it be these cultural difference that mark we out it have be clear on the doorstep over the past year that there be a strong desire for a non mayoral model of governance arrangement with westminster my hope and my focus in come week and month will be to   persuade the government that the most appropriate devolution arrangement for cornwall be an assembly similar to that of our celtic cousin in wales 
 in term of economic development culture and governance the time have come to throw open the cage door and unleash the cornish celtic tiger for my part i will put all my energy into represent the people of camborne redruth and hayle to the good of my ability to do so will be the honour of my life meur ras thank you

 i will end with this the day before his tragic untimely death the late leader of the labour party john smith end his last speech by say 
 the opportunity to serve our country that be all we ask 
 i promise to serve my constituency to the good of my ability 
 thank you for call i madam deputy speaker i also thank   the hon member for frome and east somerset anna sabine   for her maiden speech make on what i understand be a very difficult afternoon for she i be sure that everyone in the house would join i in send condolence to she and to the family of her friend 
 this have be a most entertaining and enjoyable debate any debate that marry abba stan laurel and shane warne be that i want very much to be part of so i be delighted to have the opportunity to make my maiden speech in this context it be also apt that i make it during a debate on great british energy it be apt not just because the transition to clean energy and tackle climate change be critical to carlisle flooding have already decimate our city twice during this century and local village be too often cut off by localise flooding and not just because we need to remove the obstacle that prevent cumbria ’s farmer from connect their solar and wind farm but because people right across carlisle and north cumbria tell i that they be desperate to see that cut in their energy bill 
 it be also personally apt that i speak on this topic my great grandfather a conservative alderman and councillor for carlisle be a man of unusually progressive thinking in he urge our city ’s industry to set aside coal and instead harness the hydroelectric power of the river on which our great border city stand i like to think that whatever our political difference my great grandfather and i would have agree that great british energy be not just right but essential for carlisle for cumbria and for our country 
 i be the carlisle bear member of parliament since and the very woman to represent england ’s most northerly city it be a city of many little know fact for example in the 1830 it be home to britain ’s black police officer in david lloyd george nationalise all our city ’s pub and brewery declare that their intoxicate effect on munition worker be do more damage to the british war effort than the entirety of the german submarine fleet in the beatles be throw out of carlisle ’s crown mitre hotel after a complaint from the local golf club that the young liverpudlians be too casually dress my predecessor john stevenson be himself a keen golfer and i like to think that while he might be a stickler for the rule he would have recognise the fledgling talent of the fab and would not have be so hasty in demand their removal i say this because john be a strong advocate for the potential of our young people and play an important role in secure the new pears medical school at the university of cumbria which will open its door next year 
 in over year of city history the university of cumbria be a relative newcomer and its creation be testimony to the work of the last labour mp for carlisle eric martlew who do so much to secure a university for our city i look forward very much to the opening of the new medical school and the contribution that it will make to our government ’s mission to rebuild our nhs and train the next generation like my own daughter of home grow doctor nurse and paramedic 
 my constituency lie between the lake district and hadrian ’s wall it be plentiful in sheep and cattle and be populate by folk know for good craic and a love of xl crisp for the uninitiated let i explain that the xl crisp be a savoury cheesy no onion delight whose availability in the catering outlet of this house i shall passionately campaign for i shall also campaign for more critical matter such as the completion of our flood defence defence that be promise but not deliver by the last government the rebuilding of nhs dentistry across north cumbria and the growth of carlisle ’s night time and visitor economy 
 carlisle and north cumbria already have much to offer visitor i challenge member to name another uk city than can boast not only citadel city wall and a norman castle but a victorian railway station a cathedral and original turkish baths at this point i must declare an interest as chair of the charity work towards the refurbishment and reopening of carlisle ’s historic turkish bath it be of only original bath still in work order in the uk the only leave in the north west of england and the only with a tile interior make by the company responsible for the exquisite tile here at the palace of westminster 
 we be also bless with a rich industrial heritage over the year carlisle have be a hub of food manufacturing with the sweet manufacturer teasdale famous for its liquorice nipits cavaghan gray which produce not just any ready meal but m&s ready meal and carr ’s biscuit home of the table water and employer of generation of cracker packer 
 i could not be prouder to represent the city where i be bear and raise i owe a debt to robert ferguson school and trinity school for help a working class child from denton holme to become the in her family to go to university without university i would not have become involve in politic and would not have have the privilege of campaign for john smith a great parliamentarian to become leader of our party nor would i have realise the ambition of my distant cousin ernest lowthian who be labour ’s parliamentary candidate for carlisle back in 
 in conclusion i return to my great grandfather at the opening of of the bridge that cross the river whose energy he seek to harness he say 
 our job as servant of our great border city be to leave it a little well than we find it 
 that madam deputy speaker be the task that i have set myself 
 thank you madam deputy speaker in the interest of save time i be sure you will grant i permission to skip to the part of my speech where i celebrate my great constituency of leeds south west and morley 
 it be the great responsibility and honour of my life to stand before you as the labour mp for leeds south west and morley alongside be a husband and a dad this be the most important job i will ever do and i give sincere thank to my constituent and neighbour for send i to this place
