what an absolutely astonishing intervention by the shadow minister it be his government who introduce the emission vehicle mandate and we be not propose to change the trajectory that they introduce i would gently remind he that many fleet vehicle be in fact private vehicle as people choose to lease their vehicle or access they through a salary   sacrifice scheme last year the uk be the large market in europe in fact in the world for ev vehicle he be talk nonsense 
 protect vital banking service be important for local community like my hon friend ’s we be accelerate the roll out of at least banking hub more than of which be already open and plan be announce at the end of last year to open a banking hub in his constituency 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help support people to purchase electric vehicle 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help support people to use electric vehicle 
 what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help support people to use electric vehicle 
 the government support emission vehicle through taxation incentive vehicle grant and fund infrastructure roll out in january ev sale be high than in january the recent national audit office report show that we be on track to meet the public charging point need for expect demand in 
 meur ras ha myttin da mr speaker electric vehicle demand be increase the government ’s commitment to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicle by will have a significant impact on uk emission but there remain many misunderstanding and myth about electric vehicle they be safe and clean and whole life cost be significantly cheap what can the government do to increase consumer confidence by dispel some of the nonsense peddle by vested interest 
 my hon friend ’s expertise in the field be welcome showcase the benefit of ev ownership and the growth of the public charging point network be vital to support the transition away from diesel and petrol power car as he will know ev driver can save hundred of pound a year and the average range of a new ev be now mile that be about week drive for most people and of course it be   clean and greener we be work closely with industry stakeholder to promote positive messaging around evs and to improve consumer confidence 
 of the challenge face people who be move to electric vehicle be the charge infrastructure particularly in inner city local authority have work to try to help that but they have limited resource my old team at newham council do a deal with uber to supply on street charge unit do the minister agree that that sort of partnership use public sector actor with private finance could help resolve the issue could the government look at way they could work with local authority to secure those public private partnership 
 it be great to hear about newham council ’s partnership that be develop under my hon friend ’s leadership the £ local ev infrastructure fund do just as he suggest and be expect to deliver charging point across the country support those driver without off street parking to switch to electric vehicle 
 the future of the car industry be important to west brom and that future lie in electric vehicle of the key issue on the demand side be that consumer do not have enough confidence in hand ev despite manufacturer warranty and increasingly good battery life what step be the government take to improve consumer confidence when buy second- hand ev 
 my hon friend will be pleased to know that in use electric car be now under £ and datum suggest that owner should expect an ev to last just as long as an internal combustion engine car the united nations economic commission for europe have develop a new global technical regulation which would set standard for the lifespan of an ev battery and its minimum durability we be analyse option for the implementation of such regulation in the uk 
 what the minister say be all very well but why do the government not support my exemption from value added tax public electric vehicle charging points bill 
 as the hon member know matter relate to taxation be for the treasury rather than the department for transport but i be sure that the chancellor will be look at the proposal that he bring forward 
 i welcome the increase uptake of electric vehicle indeed we do still need to dispel many myth in my constituency charge infrastructure be still a big issue and the distribution network struggle to speed up connect to the infrastructure that be need will the minister outline what work she will do with distribution network to increase the expansion of ev charging network 
 as i be sure the hon member know there have be a rapid increase in the roll out of electric charging point it be up by more than   last year however she be absolutely right that in some case   that roll out be difficult because it be hold back by the availability of capacity on the network that be precisely why we be work across government include with my colleague in the department for energy security and net to unblock those thing so that we can ensure that everyone can access the electric vehicle charging point that they need close to home 
 i thank the minister for her answer i be not a petrolhead but i do love my diesel vehicle those of we who live in the countryside understand that have a diesel vehicle be incredibly important and there be no electric charging point across the rural countryside there need to be more of those charge point on the high street and in the shopping centre and there definitely need to be more of they in the countryside since those of we who live there be be disadvantage by the electric car process as it go forward what be be do to help the rural community those of we who live in the countryside and those of we who represent they take advantage of electric car as well the charge point be not there the system do not work 
 i think the hon gentleman have already be charge 
 the hon member make an important point we need to ensure that there be access everywhere across our nation to electric vehicle charging point in the autumn budget we commit £ to support the roll out of charge infrastructure which be bolster by over £ in private investment that have be commit up to the hon member will be pleased to hear that there be over public charging point in the uk over have be add in the past year and there have be a increase in rural charging point over the past year 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i draw the house ’s attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 last year just in consumer buy a new car choose battery electric and in the private market for battery electric be low than government intervention have try to manipulate it to be without fleet sale which we know be warp by huge tax incentive promote they over practical vehicle choice electric car demand just be not there when will the minister understand that people be cry out for a different way to defossilise and decarbonise their private vehicle battery electric just be not popular so when will the government stop try to tell people what they should want this be just a government know good attitude at its very bad be it not 
 what an absolutely astonishing intervention by the shadow minister it be his government who introduce the emission vehicle mandate and we be not propose to change the trajectory that they introduce i would gently remind he that many fleet vehicle be in fact private vehicle as people choose to lease their vehicle or access they through a salary   sacrifice scheme last year the uk be the large market in europe in fact in the world for ev vehicles.[official report   february vol c. 10wc correction he be talk nonsense 
 the society of motor manufacturers and trader january report simply do not back up what the minister have just say i repeat that only in consumer the people we all represent in this house actively choose a battery electric vehicle as the minister know from her time on the transport select committee when we look at the future of fuel there be other technology out there the government like to say that they be technology neutral but the zev mandate ’s myopic focus on the tailpipe rather than whole system analysis effectively deny our innovator the room to defossilise and decarbonise in a manner that consumer want surely the minister see that so instead of try to force people to buy battery electric will the government just get the bureaucracy out of the way and let our innovator innovate 
 i wonder whether the shadow minister have actually meet any vehicle manufacturer if he have he would know that they be invest incredibly heavily in the switch to battery electric vehicle i and my ministerial colleague have meet manufacturer represent of the uk car market to understand their concern and we will be work with they to ensure we support all uk vehicle manufacturer who have as they would put it bet the house on the transition to electric vehicle 
 what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the condition of local road 
 we have empower local council to tackle the highway maintenance backlog which be the result of a decade of under investment by the previous government we have make an immediate start by provide an extra £ next year represent an increase of nearly for most council we will end the pothole plague on our road and ensure safe journey for everyone 
 i thank the secretary of state for that answer i recently meet the road minister the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend   the member for nottingham south lilian greenwood and national highways about the need for investment in seaton burn and moor farm roundabout those critical piece of infrastructure be already struggle with capacity and congestion the local council and the north east combine authority have all highlight the fact that upgrade will be crucial for growth in the north east will the secretary of state consider how this government could support the project and whether the scheme can test a new form of transport business case for project intend to deliver growth in all of our region 
 i be very grateful to my hon friend for her question i know she be a committed advocate for improvement to the road network in the north east i recognise the importance of moor farm and seaton burn roundabout to her local area and i assure she that both be be consider as part of a pipeline of project for our future road investment strategy 
 a recent freedom of information request reveal that of identify highway spend across the bradford district by bradford council over the past year £ be spend within bradford city itself but only £ be spend in keighley and my wide constituency despite street such as elliott street in silsden be in a very poor state of repair will the secretary of state write to leader at bradford council and remind they that highway spending need to be spend equally across the whole bradford district include place such as keighley and ilkley and not just within bradford city centre 
 i be not the sort of secretary of state who would sit at my desk in whitehall and instruct local authority to spend certain amount of money on certain road i expect local authority to take strategic decision base on where the investment be need and i will leave it to local leader to make those decision 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 too many of britain ’s road be in a shocking state of disrepair as the secretary of state say in my constituency labour run merton council have the bad road in london and the bad in the country some of our local road be rat as poor by her department although i welcome the come year ’s increase in funding that be only a short term measure and not base on need merton and other have receive less than authority whose road be in a well condition as labour run merton have fail to maintain its road and have not be bail out by its friend in the government will the secretary of state meet i to discuss what action can be take 
 i would be very happy to meet the hon gentleman to ensure that road in his constituency and across london be maintain to an adequate standard the increase of £ in this year ’s allocation to highway maintenance represent an average increase for local authority it will be make the difference and i would be happy to discuss this issue with he far 
 what step she be take to help improve local bus service 
 what step she be take to help improve local bus service 
 what step she be take to help improve local bus service 
 the government be commit to deliver the well more reliable bus service that passenger deserve we have already make significant progress by introduce the bus services no bill to help local leader get the power they need and by announce investment of over £ to support and improve bus service 
 i thank the minister for that answer the cost of transport be a huge cost of live pressure for child and young people in my constituency who be try to access education and social and leisure opportunity what assurance can the minister give i that the bus bill will end a system in which bus service be control by ideology and make it a system that put they at the service of local people 
 i thank my hon friend for his question the government know how important local bus service be in provide access to education and allow young people to get around empower local leader to improve service be at the heart of our reform include through the introduction of the bus services no bill so that bus service deliver for hard work family and community throughout the country 
 my constituent in worsley and eccles face high level of congestion on our road especially during their rush hour commute we benefit from greater manchester ’s bee network but it only take a temporary set of traffic light roadwork or an accident to back thing up will the minister outline what step be be take to give the necessary power and encouragement to our local community and decision maker to create join up public and private transport network that will alleviate congestion 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight this issue and will know that this government be act quickly to respond to his concern as outline in the english devolution white paper we will empower strategic authority to play a great role in co ordinate their local road network that include remove unnecessary secretary of state consent requirement for certain local highway decision potentially include lane rental scheme which will speed up decision making 
 so many people who live in rural town across my constituency rely on bus service to go to work school and hospital appointment but too often bus be run late or never turn up at all last week i meet local resident nicola from emley who tell i that when she be unable to drive it be nearly impossible for her daughter olivia to attend after school club will the minister advise i on how this government will hold fail bus company to account and will help improve service in our local area 
 my hon friend be my constituency neighbour and i understand the challenge her constituent face we know that local bus service be not currently deliver for people around the country we be committed to change that and our bus service bill will give local leader the tool they need to deliver reliable bus service that truly meet the need of local community include in rural area 
 i know that the minister be s truly passionate advocate for bus service but if he be privileged enough to live in the beautiful village of hixon in my constituency and want to get to the surgery in great haywood he would have to travel into stafford on a bus and then on a bus from stafford to great hayward will he update the house on what   additional help and support staffordshire county council might look forward to receive so that hixon resident be able to get directly to great hayward 
 the government be determined to empower local leader to make decision about their local bus service they can choose from a variety of option in that toolkit include franchising which be now open to all local transport authority we be lift the ban on municipal bus company and improve enhanced partnership it be for local leader to make those decision and we be empower they to do so 
 rural community such as mine rely on bus service as a vital lifeline but too often these service be limited and infrequent private operator dominate the market in my area yet there be no minimum service requirement to ensure that people can get to work school or medical appointment will the government guarantee a minimum level of service so that rural community be not leave strand 
 the hon member will be pleased to know that the bus service bill include the socially necessary local service measure under the new measure local transport authority operate under an enhance partnership will need to identify local service which they consider socially necessary and put in place requirement that must be follow before such service can be change or cancel they will also need to consider the alternative option that be available 
 last week i hold a hour question and answer session with disability action yorkshire issue that come up be the inability of disabled people to use their bus pass before o’clock limit they in get to work access leisure opportunity or see family and friend do the minister agree that of the good way to improve local bus access would be to be allow disabled people to use their pass before o’clock 
 the government already invest £ in the national concessionary travel scheme in order to fund those bus pass and at the last budget we announce over £ of funding to support bus we change the formula for bsip bus service improvement plan away from the competitive hunger games style contest under the previous government the hon member ’s local area will have receive funding and it be able to use that funding to go above and beyond what be set on a national level 
 what step she be take to maintain open access railway service 
 open access operator will continue to have a place in our reform great british railway we have support new proposal from wrexham shropshire and midlands railway and exist track access right will be honour open access can provide benefit but it must not come at the cost of well service for passenger and well value for taxpayer 
 in her recent letter to the office of rail and road the transport secretary appear to push against open access agreement yet last week as she have mention today the government signal their intention to support the request to license the wrexham to london euston line which will come through aldridge in my constituency will the transport secretary clarify her position on the wrexham to euston line particularly in regard to the inclusion of aldridge train station as she will be aware thank to the labour mayor the funding for that station have be raid and put into his pet project 
 i appreciate the right hon lady ’s commitment to make the case for a new station at aldridge but i gently point out to she that in the year of her party ’s government include her own stint in the department for transport the station fail to materialise the west midlands combine authority have have to prioritise the delivery of scheme that be in construction that seem to i to be a reasonable approach but i appreciate that she will continue to make the case for her own station 
 open access operator grand central already run service daily from sunderland to london king ’s cross through my constituency but unfortunately they currently do not stop my constituent have endure year of poor rail service from northern rail with just overcrowded carriage train an hour which be often cancel or delay while i welcome this government ’s investment in new train for northern rail we need some immediate solution will the minister urge the orr to approve the application from grand central to allow these train to stop at station in my easington constituency 
 open access operator currently account for of our railway and they do not always have the same public service obligation as other train operate company we have always support open access operator where they genuinely add value and do not divert revenue away from exist operator all of which be support by the taxpayer in some form i would add that we need to make good use of constrain capacity on the rail network ensure that the railway can recover from problem on the railway be also important to i 
 talk of access several year ago greater anglia demolish half of wickford station to extend some of the platform however after nearly year of endless excuse miss deadline and frankly broken promise it still have not rebuild it i regret to say that i have lose all confidence in the senior management of greater anglia if they tell i today be a thursday i would double check it can i go over their head and ask the secretary of state for a personal meeting with the rail minister so that we can finally get wickford station rebuild despite greater anglia rather than because of it 
 i will happily ask the rail minister to meet the right hon gentleman to ensure that progress can be make at wickford 
 i know that my right hon friend will be delight by the news that go op will be operate a new mandate for return   service between swindon and taunton do she agree that this demonstrate the government ’s commitment to improve connectivity across the country can we hope for such improvement to connectivity in my little corner of the world in berkshire 
 i be pleased that my hon friend have raise this proposal which demonstrate the pragmatic approach we take to open access operator go op will be the co operatively own train service run anywhere in the uk if there be any investor out there think about invest in that service i encourage they to look closely at it 
 what assessment she have make of the potential merit of use alternative funding model to purchase roll stock 
 as part of our reform to the railway we have set out that we will continue to lease rolling stock when we take contract into public ownership but we will apply a single direct mind approach to eliminate barrier to share roll stock well across the network we will consider the good funding and financing structure for future order and contract in partnership with private capital 
 at the moment the rolling stock leasing company take more than £ of profit out of the railway a substantial amount of that could be reinveste in improve the railway network with the bill for great british railways due to come to parliament soon will the secretary of state look seriously at alternative financing model such as eurofima the european company for the financing of railroad rolling stock or even a publicly own rosco that could deliver roll stock at a considerably low price indeed will she be more socialist and more ambitious with the bill 
 i assure the hon gentleman that i do not lack any ambition when it come to great british railways it would cost billion in taxpayer money to buy exist rolling stock at a time when there be many pressure on the public purse my official have be engage regularly with eurofima to consider the potential for uk membership and how eurofima finance could be deploy in the uk 
 what step her department be take to improve reliability on the east coast main line 
 the department recognise the critical importance of the east coast main line and have invest £ in a combination of infrastructure enhancement and roll stock upgrade that will help to deliver journey time reliability and capacity improvement the full benefit of this investment will be feel with the introduction of a revise timetable in december   the department continue to work closely with network rail to explore opportunity to improve performance and resilience 
 my constituent have raise concern about the reliability of service on the east coast main line with constituent receive delay repay compensation for out of journey he take over a month period i welcome the correspondence i have have with the rail minister on the action that the department for transport be take with rail partner include through the east coast digital programme will my hon friend confirm that the train utilise new digital signal technology will be on the track by the end of the year when do she expect passenger to feel the full benefit of this welcome upgrade 
 the east coast digital programme be deliver digital signal on mile of the east coast main line the technology will deliver an inherent improvement to service reliability and uplift performance and capacity across the line include for my hon friend ’s constituent the train be forecast to start run under digital signal from early the number of service run under digital signalling will increase until the full programme be expect to be complete in the early 2030s 
 what step she be take to reduce the cost of rail service 
 what step she be take to reduce the cost of rail service 
 it be our ambition through public ownership to deliver a more affordable railway this year ’s fare increase of be the low absolute increase in year we be committed to reform the overcomplicate fare system and expand ticket innovation like pay as you go in urban area across the country 
 when the secretary of state finally step in and knock head together and we get our azuma train to grimsby via market rasen will she instruct the railway company to name the locomotive margaret thatcher to remind we all that the good way to reduce the cost of rail service be to end restrictive trade union practice 
 i hate to disappoint the father of the house but i be afraid that i will not be make such a commitment today 
 the british people pay some of the high rail fare in europe however the government seem to prioritise the size of the socialist state by kowtow to trade union with radical public pay rise and nationalisation plan will the secretary of state instead please focus on improve the lot of commuter particularly romford ’s hard work commuter and take real step to reduce rail fare and improve railway service 
 i be surprised that the hon gentleman have the gall to raise this issue when under his party ’s government fare rise at around twice the speed of wage i also point out that since train operating company have pay out nearly £ to their parent company sign off by conservative ministers in the previous government if the hon gentleman want to talk about cost and value for money on the railway i suggest he start by look in the mirror 
 it be in fact a conservative secretary of state who force fare rise on transport for london in exchange for covid emergency funding what step will my right hon friend take to put tfl on a well footing in the future include back great project such as the in my constituency to upgrade and provide step free access at of the busy station in the country at south kensington 
 my hon friend be absolutely right in the middle of a global pandemic the conservatives be still obsess with settle old political score over fare in london rather than do right by the capital i vividly remember a meeting with the then secretary of state to discuss how we could keep service safely run which end with he tell i this would have be so much easy if you have n’t freeze fare unlike the conservatives this government will always do right by the capital as well as the rest of the country 
 can i ask that this uk government do not follow the approach take by the scottish government on public ownership scotrail fare be set for another inflation bust increase in april follow an hike last year and the reintroduction of peak fare in september do the secretary of state agree that the snp should be make rail more affordable instead of hit passenger with painful fare hike time and again the increase be bad for scotland ’s rail passenger bad for our economy and bad for the environment 
 i assure my hon friend that we will bring the train operate company into public ownership properly and that we will not repeat the mistake we have see in scotland 
 i call the shadow minister 
 i be very interested by that last answer because the government do think that nationalisation will reduce the cost of rail travel what lesson have the secretary of state learn from the snp ’s nationalisation of scotrail 
 we will be increase value for money in the way we operate our railway to start off with we will be get rid of up to £ a year in management fee that we be currently pay out of the public purse to the train operating company we be determined to drive up performance on our railway and give well value for money to the taxpayer 
 the late experiment in nationalisation have show in just year that state inefficiency have push up cost not reduce they by £   force fare to rise alongside an increase in delay a slump in customer satisfaction and cut instead of improvement to service the data show that in england greater anglia have be the good perform operator save money for taxpayer while serve passenger with modern punctual train the secretary of state be about to launch a public consultation on nationalisation that have be as delay as scotrail train i be tell that even the plan to publish it today have be far delay with the excuse of no on the line if the secretary of state consult she have to be prepared to listen will she now listen to the deep concern of the rail industry and not just the ever generous union and avoid another disastrous nationalisation 
 i assure the hon gentleman that the consultation on establish great british railways be come soon and i look forward to discuss it far with he i be confident that by bring together the management of track and train we can strip out duplication in our railway provide well value for the taxpayer and ensure that train be turn up on time with reliable and punctual service that be what we will deliver 
 what step her department be take to improve transport infrastructure in rural community 
 the government recognise the importance of high quality transport infrastructure as part of a well function integrated transport network we be support all local authority to improve transport infrastructure include through our £ investment in local road i know that my hon friend ’s road be litter with pothole which be why they be get a share of our uplift 
 norfolk ’s economy to fire on all cylinder need a decent rural road network the thickthorn junction in my constituency be outdated and urgently need upgrade to support growth and unlock new home will the minister back the project and visit to see at hand why the government should put norfolk at the heart of our investment plan 
 my hon friend be a fantastic champion for the need of his rural constituent the central mission of this government be to support economic growth and this be of a number of road investment under consideration in the past week we have approve upgrade to major road project across england on the specific scheme i hope to be able to say more in the come week and perhaps i will be visit his constituency 
 sleaford have a beautiful grade ii list railway station in popular use however it be very difficult for those with disability to access the platform because there be no lift i have long campaign for a lift and i work with east midlands railway with the financial support of the previous government on a feasibility study for a lift that be in keep with the   heritage station will this government back access for my constituent and access for people to come and visit our beautiful town 
 i thank the hon lady for that question improve accessibility in our railway station be incredibly important i be sure that the rail minister will be happy to write to she on the specific of her station and to consider the proposal that have be make 
 what step she be take to improve road safety 
 the last labour government halve the number of people kill on our road each year under the conservative that progress stall with only a reduction between and when almost people be kill or seriously injure on our road that be about casualty every minute that shocking statistic be why improve road safety be of my key priority we be develop our road safety strategy the in a decade and will set out more detail in due course 
 i thank the minister for that answer nearly of my constituent have fill in my survey about the dangerously short slip road on the a34 at east ilsley and beedon they include nick who never use the beedon junction when his young family be in the car and be even consider move house because he believe it be a real risk to their life will the minister meet i and raise the issue of dangerous junction with national highways so we can make they safe for local people 
 i commend my hon friend for her support for safe road national highways have undertake several safety study on section of the a34 i be aware that improvement work take place on the east ilsley slip in include work to widen resurface and add new road marking it continue to review concern about safety on the road and be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss the issue far and plan a site visit i will of course keep up to date with progress 
 bridgwater railway station have a bus stop that have remain unusable since its construction due to road layout and safety issue despite this be a relatively small fix somerset council have yet to take action what additional support can the government provide to ensure that bus can stop at the station safely and improve connectivity in my constituency 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise that question it do sound like it be a matter for his local council but i be sure that my official would be very happy to work with it to provide any advice and support it may need to work out how to provide a safe service in that area 
 what step she be take to improve passenger rail performance 
 improve performance be a top priority for this government as we establish great british railways we regularly meet manage director of train operating company and their network rail counterpart to demand action to raise standard great british railways will reunite the management of track and train and will make join up whole system decision that will improve performance for the benefit of passenger and taxpayer alike 
 the transpennine route upgrade be the big rail infrastructure project in the country and my constituency be at the centre of it of the main benefit for passenger will be fast and more reliable train will the secretary of state update the house on the project and tell we what step be be take to ensure that local community such as those in huddersfield benefit fully from improvement in rail performance 
 my hon friend be right to draw attention to the importance of this investment to her constituency the rail upgrade will double the number of seat between huddersfield and manchester and will increase the number by between huddersfield and leeds service reliability will also improve moreover of the workforce will be employ within mile of the route and of spending will be within the local supply chain which will lead to local growth and job so it be good news all round 
 i want to improve rail performance in my constituency and the extension of the borders railway from tweedbank to hawick and newcastleton and on to carlisle have strong local and cross party support have the uk government ’s share of the funding for the feasibility study secure as part of the borderlands growth deal be confirm and will it be release to scottish borders council imminently 
 i understand that official in my department be speak to scottish colleague and i hope to be in a position to say more about that soon potentially as part of the spending review 
 what discussion she be have with airline to encourage the operation of flight from airport outside london and the south east 
 this government be commit to growth which regional airport support by serve their local community create job and act as gateway to international opportunity heathrow expansion could give more region access to a big international network through their local airport thus boost productivity far 
 in my constituency the large sectoral employer be logistic tamworth sit within the golden triangle for distribution centre around the european rail link within this hub be east midlands airport which handle approximately tonne of freight   each year only to heathrow what step will the minister take to fuel economic growth across the west midland review capacity at our regional airport include birmingham 
 as my hon friend say freight be hugely important for growth that be why the chancellor recently announce plan to build a new advanced manufacturing and logistic park at east midlands airport which will unlock up to £ of investment and job on the site 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 we be get on with deliver this government ’s plan for change last week i approve upgrade to major road project across wiltshire leeds essex and buckinghamshire that £ investment will reduce journey time ease congestion and improve safety it be on the back of driver switch to electric car in record break number with sale in january more than high than those last year and nearly public charge point add in alone we be back with a £ investment the west midland metro extension which will take tram from wednesbury to brierley hill we be cut journey time and improve connection for town with poor public transport link and yesterday we announce a £ investment to get britain walk and cycling with hundred of new footpath and cycle lane we be deliver the basic of a well transport system which mean improve the everyday journey that drive economic growth and make people ’s live well 
 i meet key scottish stakeholder recently to discuss proposal to bring to the glasgow city region a metro scheme interconnect more and more part of our region include the town and village in my constituency do the secretary of state agree that it be vital for the scottish government to show the same ambition for growth in scotland as the uk government have show in their recent transport announcement and will she work with the scottish government to ensure that this project maximise investment and opportunity for my constituent 
 i will always work closely with colleague in the scottish government to ensure that this government ’s ambition for transport reach all corner of the uk the scottish government have have a record settlement through the budget so i look forward to hear more about plan for a great glasgow metro scheme as they develop 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 heathrow airport be already the large single site payer of business rate in the country pay approximately £ annually to fund the chancellor ’s next spending spree the valuation office agency be currently revaluate airport in england and wales and any significant increase could impact   heathrow ’s ability to fund airport expansion and a runway be the secretary of state aware of the late estimate of how much heathrow ’s business rate will increase by 
 this be a policy cook up by the valuation office agency under his majesty ’s revenue and customs by the last government we have engage with airport on this matter and ask they to continue to engage with the valuation office agency 
 i notice that the minister do not answer my question so i will assist he the estimate be that heathrow ’s rate bill will increase fivefold to £ annually put substantial additional pressure on heathrow ’s finance in the light of that will the minister confirm the long stand policy that the full cost of a runway include related work such as relocating tunnel or bridge over the m25 will be fully fund by the private sector and not by the taxpayer 
 the airport national policy statement from which be government ago make it clear that any proposal we have not have a proposal come forward should treat surface access appropriately and that should be fund by the private sector where possible 
 resident in ashbourne have be leave feel hopeless and frustrated after wait decade for a relief road more than heavy good vehicle pass through the town each day endanger local pedestrian increase pollution and cause significant congestion will the minister meet i regard the need to install a relief road for ashbourne 
 as my hon friend know deliver a transport system that meet local regional and national need will play a vital role in deliver the mission of this government i encourage he to continue to work with derbyshire county council which will hopefully be under new leadership in may and with our excellent east midlands mayor claire ward to advocate for his constituent priority i would of course be happy to meet he to discuss this 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 in her previous role as deputy london mayor for transport the secretary of state state she be clear in her opposition to a runway at heathrow be she still clear in her opposition and if not what have change her mind 
 when i be deputy mayor for transport in london i be speak in that capacity at that time reflect the view of the mayor of london and city hall on a previous heathrow expansion scheme as secretary of state i will consider any airport expansion proposal on their merit and in line with exist process balance economic growth and our environmental obligation be central to all my work in this role and i will always act in the national interest do what be right for the country as a whole 
 at least major road in my constituency will be affect by roadwork in the next week seemingly endless utility work and roadwork be a crucial issue for my constituent who have tell i it make they late for work school pick up and even hospital appointment can the minister tell i what step her department be take to improve the situation for my constituent 
 this government stand with local road user who be frustrate by roadwork that cause unnecessary disruption while council and utility company should always work together to minimise the impact of their work we be also take action we be double fix penalty notice for utility company that do not comply with certain requirement for carry out their street work and we have extend overrun charge of up to £ per day to weekend and bank holiday to prevent overrunning roadwork 
 open access operator such as hull train offer excellent cheap unsubsidised inter city service to location across the north so why be minister try to block their expansion and stifle growth 
 there be a balance to be strike here i welcome service such as those that run to hull they open up new route and new connectivity i have however ask the office of rail and road to consider the balance in the revenue that they abstract from public operator and to ensure that we be use constrained capacity in our network appropriately to deliver excellent service for passenger 
 the rac recently report that pothole in derbyshire be the bad in the country but rather than welcome over £ of funding for the east midland the conservatives at derbyshire county council claim that this be not new money and that it be bind up in red tape do the minister agree that these be just more excuse and that the conservative control derbyshire county council should stop complain and start fix our road 
 my hon friend be absolutely right the state of our road be a daily reminder of tory failure which be why this government have provide record funding to fix they derbyshire be get its share of the extra £ go to the east midlands combine authority we expect the council to get on with the job and to tell local resident how it intend to use the extra taxpayer money that it be get 
 i call dave doogan not here

 minister and official be in regular contact with northern rail we recognise that its performance be totally unacceptable and with the challenge that northern rail face it will take time to become a stable and reliable service i would be absolutely delighted to work with my hon friend 
 as you will know mr speaker i rarely if ever agree with the mayor of london sadiq khan the secretary of state have set out the position in relation to her change of heart but will she commit to ensure that any proposal for a runway at heathrow will have a full impact assessment before it be approve or deny 
 i fully support the chancellor ’s call for fresh proposal for heathrow some of our airport in the south east be run at or near capacity we can not pretend that that be not the case and i be not prepared to be part of a government who duck the difficult decision as the person who may ultimately be take planning decision on any application for a runway at heathrow i will judge any scheme on its merit we will update the airport national policy statement and any expansion scheme must meet our legal and environmental obligation 
 as the secretary of state know the south west peninsula already contribute significantly to the uk economy include through life science and climate tech we be however hold back from reach our full potential by under investment in transport connectivity which be make bad by upcoming work at old oak common and the continue bottleneck on the a303 will the minister commit to develop a strategic investment plan to ensure that the south west peninsula have the transport infrastructure it need to unlock further growth 
 as i have say before growth be the priority mission of this government and we be commit to empower local leader a regional transport strategy and a strategic investment plan for the south west have be develop by the sub national transport body peninsula transport 
 as well as be home to both gchq and nato ’s allied rapid reaction corps headquarters gloucestershire have the large concentration of cyber tech business and aerospace engineering firm outside london but the county and particularly tewkesbury be subject to slow unreliable and grossly outdated rail service it be also underserve by road transport link eastward the government recently announce that they will develop a silicon valley between milton keynes 
 order we be on topical i think you need an adjournment debate who be go to answer that 
 i will certainly meet the hon gentleman to discuss this matter 
 i call the chair of the transport committee 
 department for transport analysis carry out in show that expand heathrow would displace job from the uk region to london by with few passenger use non london airport do the minister hope that the same analysis if do now would come to a different conclusion in order to ensure that uk economic growth really do benefit all uk region and not just west london 
 the government be commit to regional airport i be proudly wear my yes to r2 badge from when we build a runway at manchester airport in the position be quite the opposite of what my hon friend describe under the airport national policy statement the number of connection from heathrow to regional airport be expect to increase if heathrow expand increase productivity in those region 
 northern trains run train per day on the gainsborough brigg cleethorpes line do the secretary of state agree that train per day be pretty pointless will she arrange a meeting with the appropriate minister for i and other affected mp so that we can discuss how to secure a well service 
 reliable frequent train service be important no matter where in the country we live i will ask the rail minister for a meeting 
 do the minister agree that achieve economic growth require sustained investment in our transport infra- structure would she be willing to visit glasgow international airport to learn more about how transport infrastructure can assist with the further development of the propose investment zone in my constituency 
 i agree that investment in our transport infrastructure across the country be essential to our growth mission i be aware of the investment zone bid involve glasgow airport and the aviation minister my hon friend   the member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane would be delighted to visit in the near future 
 i do not know whether the secretary of state be aware that large swathe of british airways flight between london and scotland be automatically cancel when there be serious weather or technical issue at heathrow british airways say that if the secretary of state ’s official the civil aviation authority heathrow and airline work together the number of cancellation could be minimise even in those circumstance so will she facilitate those discussion 
 the right hon member raise an important point the resilience of the uk aviation sector be important and key to its success so we will facilitate any discussion to make sure we be always on an improvement trajectory 
 access for disabled people be a condition of open up planning for the york central development however   i hear that the condition will be bypass and that planning will go ahead without disabled access be put in place that clearly impede disabled people can we ensure that difficult engineering work be undertake before planning permission be grant 
 the accessibility of all mode of transport be extremely important to this government i would be delighted to meet my hon friend to discuss this matter far 
 despite my constituency be only a stone ’s throw from heathrow we have no direct rail link to the country ’s busy airport last week heathrow southern railway submit a business case to the government when will the government consider it to ensure that my constituent can get a train to heathrow 
 alongside the question of how many plane should take off and land at heathrow there be the critical question of how people get to the airport the hon gentleman make an important point and i would be happy to discuss it far with he 
 learner driver in basingstoke have be leave strand for month in some case year unable to book a driving test that be affect their job their education and the local economy do the secretary of state agree that urgent action be need to extend test centre hour to ramp up the recruitment of examiner and to clamp down on the rip off company that book multiple slot only to flog they at high price 
 my hon friend be right to raise these concern on behalf of learner driver on   december the driver and vehicle standards agency set out a point plan that recognise the need to fix the drive test booking system so that we can get new driver on the road i will hold it to account for delivery of that plan and the change that my hon friend and his constituent need to see 
 when the previous government cancel high speed they promise more than £ for project in the north and the midland do the government still plan to deliver on that and when should we expect to see that money in the north 
 i hate to tell the hon gentleman this but that be fantasy money we be work through a pipeline of transport infrastructure project and will make announcement alongside the spending review 
 the long promise platform lift at hertford north station due to be deliver under the access for all scheme have be delay yet again this leave some of my disabled constituent have to travel back up the line to get a different train to platform so that they can use the lift there will the appropriate minister meet i to discuss how we can urgently drive forward the lift project for my constituent 
 my hon friend be absolutely right to raise concern about disabled access at his local station we want to ensure that everyone can access our public transport network and i would be happy to ensure that i or of my colleague meet he 
 on economic growth which we have discuss will the secretary of state clarify for the benefit of the conservative party that economic growth depend on rather more than a well oil revolve door between the tory party and big business a door through which a former tory transport minister and member of the other place unsuccessfully attempt to walk last week 
 deliver economic growth require a proper plan for investment in our transport infrastructure that be exactly what this government be determined to deliver 
 once birmingham ’s camp hill line reopen we will need track investment if we be to restore the pre pandemic service frequency on the cross city line include to northfield and longbridge will the minister look fully at the case for upgrade king ’s norton station 
 my hon friend be an assiduous and informed campaigner for improved rail service for his constituent he will know that funding for the midland rail hub include funding for design for reinstated island platform at king ’s norton decision    still need to be take on future investment but i know that he will push for construction to start as soon as possible 
 the calder valley line be list as a top priority for improvement by transport for the north ’s electrification taskforce year ago back in yet my constituent be still wait for those improvement will the minister commit this government to deliver the infrastructure for my constituent that the last government could not 
 network rail be complete a strategic outline business case cover electrification of the calder valley line the business case will be consider in the context of the wide electrification strategy so that we can determine how to deliver the good possible benefit across the region 
 next month railway enthusiast from around the world will come to my constituency where we will mark the anniversary of the stockton and darlington railway which take off from the town of shildon will my right hon friend ask the rail minister to meet i and other mps along that route to talk about how the government can be part of those celebration 
 i be sure that be an invitation that the rail minister could not possibly refuse 
 on that basis i look forward to a minister open the coppull railway station or at least do an impact study on the main line 
 urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make a statement on ukraine 
 yesterday at the ukraine defence contact group chair by the defence secretary we see almost nation and partner stand together ukraine be back by the member of the group and by billion of dollar worth of arm and ammunition that have be commit to keep its warfighter equip that will increase pressure on putin help force he to the table and bring a sustainable peace close 
 we be pleased that secretary hegseth confirm the us ’s continue commitment to the group to ukraine ’s pursuit of what he call a durable peace and to the importance of security guarantee we hear his call for european nation to step up we be and we will nato ally pledge € in and go on to provide € the majority of that come from european nation while non us nato ally boost wide defence spending by in just the last year so europe be step up 
 finally we see a clear commitment to ratchet up the pressure on putin use both military and economic tool we all agree that will be the critical year for ukraine at this crucial moment we will not step back but step up our support for ukraine president trump and president zelensky have both speak of their desire to achieve peace through strength the commitment make yesterday provide the collective strength that we need to achieve peace for our part the uk will spend £ on military support for ukraine this year which be more than ever before 
 we have now provide more than artillery shell worth over £ yesterday the defence secretary announce that we will provide an additional £ of new firepower include drone tank and air to air missile ukraine ’s security matter to global security that be why the vital ukraine defence contact group coalition of nation and partner stretch from the indo pacific to south america this war be never about the fate of just nation when the border of country be redrawn by force it undermine the security of all nation 
 the us be serious about stability in the indo pacific as be we that be why the prime minister announce that the carrier strike group will go there next year if aggression go unchecked on continent it embolden regime on another so on step up for ukraine we be and we will on step up for european security we be and we will 
 i be grateful to you mr speaker for grant this urgent question we be in recess next week and the day that we return will be the anniversary of putin ’s unprovoked illegal invasion of ukraine in the past year russia have inflict unimaginable suffering on ukraine there have be military and civilian loss of life on a vast scale at the hand of a dictator oblivious to consequence and only too willing to sacrifice his own soldier to the meat grinder 
 in the face of so many casualty and so much pain of course we all want peace we all want the senseless slaughter to stop and for ukraine to once again thrive and enjoy the trapping of peace and prosperity which we all take for grant it be clear that an end to this suffering be a goal that president trump wish to achieve rapidly he set that out to the american people before secure their support for his election to the white house and for a mandate 
 we remain steadfast in our support for ukraine and in our backing for the government in deliver that they give we the same backing when in opposition we agree in principle with they and believe as we stress repeatedly in government that it be for the ukrainians to decide the timing and the term of any negotiation on end the war do the minister agree that negotiation without the direct involvement of ukraine would be unthinkable what more can the minister say about how the government will work with ally to ensure that any negotiation be drive by the primacy of ukraine ’s need not least give its status as the democratic nation invade without provocation by a dictator 
 we welcome the news from the minister about the commitment give by other european nato nation this week but be not president trump right to consistently highlight the point that some nato nation spend far below what be expect and require on defence will the minister assure the house that the government use every lever at their disposal will remind all nato member that a win for putin in any settlement may bring a temporary end to the conflict but will not make the world a safe place far from it it would be an illusion of peace and would be likely to send a very dangerous signal to other potential adversary 
 of course the position express by both the us president and his defence secretary yesterday have huge implication for our defence policy they have make it abundantly clear that the us will play no role in any future peacekeeping effort in ukraine should that be necessary although the government will of course be cautious about contemplate publicly the implication of that be not the key point straightforward if high defence spending be urgent before it be now critical 
 i welcome the fact that in the main there be still consensus across this house on support ukraine that have be a tremendously important part of the support that we have give over the last year and before to the ukrainians 
 the hon gentleman say that there should be no negotiation about ukraine without ukraine my right hon friend the defence secretary make that clear in his remark yesterday nato ’s job be to put ukraine in the strong possible position for any talk but there can be no negotiation about ukraine without ukraine ’s involvement we want to see a durable peace and no return to conflict and aggression that be the only way in which this war can end with the kind of security that president trump and secretary hegseth have refer to 
 we be all conscious of the year anniversary of the invasion of ukraine and our thought be with the people of ukraine at this time however there can be no peace without justice it be therefore welcome that country be collaborate to try to bring about a de escalation   of the war what be the government do to focus on the justice system to ensure that war criminal be try and justice be bring to the ukrainian people 
 my hon friend make an important point we have always say that this have to be a just peace and that those who have commit war crime during the invasion of ukraine need to be pursue for they 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 yesterday the leader of my party warn the prime minister that we might be face the bad betrayal of a european ally since poland in the hour since have confirm our fear this be a moment of great peril for we all do the minister agree that the us ’s action be a betrayal of our ukrainian friend who have fight so hard for their freedom of the uk and of all our european ally will the government step up and show british leadership start by pass urgent legislation to seize frozen russian asset so that we can support ukraine whatever the us do clearly in the light of the event of the past hour the government need to look again at defence spending do she agree that the decision of the previous government to continue with a cut to the army of troop at a time when war be rag on our continent now look utterly unforgivable 
 i do not accept what the hon gentleman say about be betray by our ally the us defence secretary have make it clear that he that he want a durable peace that be what he and the president be proceed to try to obtain so i do not accept that point in term of our own force we be seek to ensure that recruitment which have fail to meet target over the last number of year be improve so that the number in our armed force be up to full strength 
 i thank the minister for her statement and the additional support that the government have announce it be essential that the uk support ukraine and that the annual £ pledge continue do she agree that work alongside our ally be even more essential in these turbulent time to bring about an end to the war 
 i agree with my hon friend it be clear that any such negotiation must involve ukraine and that the ukrainians must be happy with the peace that be negotiate our role at present while fierce fighting be still go on be to put they in the strong position that we can in order to enable they properly to negotiate 
 i welcome what the minister have say from the dispatch box do she agree that in this new world and in the event of any peace deal the united kingdom and its european ally must lead in provide ukraine with military support and potentially military presence across land air and sea to give ukraine confidence that any peace will endure i assure the government that they will have my support if that be what they decide to do 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for his remark of course when he play a part in these matter he be in office so he be very knowledgeable   about they i can confirm that we aim to put ukraine in the strong possible position to enable it to negotiate that involve continue to supply the ukrainians with the arm and weapon that they need in order to fight because the fighting be still fierce we need to step up and ensure that we do that certainly over the last period the eu and european nation that be involve in the coalition to support ukraine have give the majority of military aid and support as the secretary general of nato confirm yesterday of the support that ukraine receive last year be from european nation so european nation be step up we must continue to do so 
 i welcome the minister ’s comment about ukraine ’s security be indivisible from global security do she agree that the uk must stand firm against those who believe that they can take land through aggression and that we must continue to send a strong signal around the world that large nation can not just grab bit of small nation as and when they please 
 my hon friend be correct as i say in my initial response to the urgent question it be important that we deter that kind of behaviour wherever it be see around the world 
 it be quite clear from event of the past few hour that the atlantic and the high north be of increasingly critical concern indeed i be a member of the scottish affairs committee that consider that in the previous parliament i know that the government have have conversation with denmark but what conversation be they have with our other joint expeditionary force partner to ensure that those force be give the support and the resource that they need 
 the government have ongoing discussion with our partner in europe and the high north 
 do the minister agree that this announcement should not affect the support of this house and the uk for ukraine and will she work with our armed force and our defence industry to do everything possible to support ukrainian force on the frontline 
 my hon friend be correct we be do that but we must continue to step up our capacity to support ukraine with weapon and the force that it need to deter ongoing aggression and to ensure that it be in the strong possible position in any negotiation that it decide to enter 
 will the government impress on president trump at every possible opportunity that the reason why appeasement lead to world war be that it leave a vacuum in europe whereas the reason why the occupation of eastern europe at the end of that war do not lead to world war be that the united states fill any possible vacuum and contain further aggression if he be go for a settlement against the wish of the ukrainian people the least he can do be guarantee directly the security of that part of ukraine which remain unoccupied 
 no matter which side of the chamber he be sit on the right hon gentleman have a long history of support deterrence whether nuclear or short of that threshold and he make the same point again the us secretary of defence make it clear in his remark to the contact group that deterrence be important around the world so i think there be agreement there 
 i welcome the announcement of the new £ package of military firepower for ukraine include drone tank and air defence system how will that boost ukrainian resilience and the uk defence sector 
 it do both there be only way in which we can provide the ukrainians with increase amount of munition and drone which be develop and change rapidly and that be by boost the strength of our defence industry that have the additional importance of enable we to boost our capacity to deter any potential aggression so in that sense we can do both and we be do so 
 view from washington the idea of carve up the map in europe might look like a pragmatic deal even if history tell we that that always end badly surely we in europe understand that no matter what we give vladimir putin he will always want more be that the context in which the strategic defence review be be carry out and do the minister accept that this moment require a fundamental reset of our relation with our european partner not just in defence and that we need to get real about the financial and economic implication 
 i assure the right hon gentleman that the strategic defence review be about identify threat that we face now rather than threat we perhaps face before the ukraine war begin so i can tell he that the review be be conduct with that in mind on the deterrence that we need to be able to provide and the money we need to spend to provide it the commitment be as it have be as the prime minister have say he will set out a path to once the strategic defence review have be publish and we expect that to be in the spring 
 as the minister will know from her many welcome visit my constituency be home to many defence company that be play a vital role in this conflict do she agree that it be crucial that we continue to support company here in the uk to get military kit into the hand of those in ukraine who need it most 
 i very much agree with my hon friend i have have the pleasure of visit her constituency on several occasion and when it be her predecessor ’s constituency as well so i be well aware of the strength of its defence industrial base we need to strengthen that base across our nation and region and we be do that that have the additional importance of provide deterrence for our nation as well as support ukraine 
 will the minister agree that this clarify what the benchmark of success for the defence review must be   as some of the defence chief have be express we must be ready if necessary to fight a war with russia if we be to deter it and if we be to be in any position to guarantee the security of an independent and sovereign ukraine after whatever be agree between president trump and president putin 
 i agree we all agree with the hon gentleman that defence spending need to increase that must be do in the context of we set out in the sdr precisely where we see the threat it be important to spend money correctly and in the good possible way and i do not think that there be any real disagreement across the chamber about that we will see in due course whether those challenge be meet when the strategic defence review be publish and we set out the path to 
 when 
 in the spring 
 i welcome the statement that any negotiation about ukraine must involve ukraine in that spirit have the minister or any of her colleague have conversation with their counterpart in ukraine follow the recent development to find out how they be feel if not do they plan to soon 
 i have not but i know my right hon friend the secretary of state have be have discussion and indeed our discussion be ongoing and frequent i have have contact with my counterpart in ukraine just not since yesterday 
 yesterday no matter that we in this house wish it be not the case the people of ukraine be betray and the crime of aggression and annexation be reward in a telephone call between washington and moscow right now we have to be build close partnership with our european ally for whom democracy sovereignty and the rule of law still actually mean something i welcome the government ’s announcement that they defend the territorial integrity of ukraine but how will the government do that in the face of man who believe that because of their military superiority they can do whatever they want to whomever they want 
 the us secretary of defence make it clear yesterday that any peace negotiation that the americans be involve in need to lead to a durable peace that do not see a resumption of the aggression that have lead to this war and we support that we have also make it quite clear that these negotiation must involve ukraine of course they must that be the way in which this war will finally end 
 i welcome the minister ’s statement particularly the commitment that any negotiation about ukraine must involve ukraine because if report of the call between president trump and moscow be to be believe this be less the art of the deal and more a charter for appeasement will we be work with nato ally to   establish a clear road map with define timeframe for ukraine ’s nato membership ensure long term deterrence against inevitable further russian aggression 
 we have always say that ukraine ’s rightful place be in nato and our position be that ukraine be on an irreversible path to nato membership however we have also always be clear that the process will take time i have already say quite clearly that the fate of ukraine in these negotiation can not be determine without ukraine be fully involve and that be our priority at the moment warfighting be still happen to put ukraine in the strong possible position to negotiate from strength 
 in russia along with the uk and the us sign the budapest memorandum pledge to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine give russia ’s flagrant breach of that undertaking why should ukraine believe a word that putin say without concrete security guarantee 
 the right hon gentleman be correct that there must be security guarantee and the us defence secretary say as much these be all matter for any negotiation that take place of course we will be support ukraine and we have make it quite clear that there can not be a peace that do not involve ukraine or that it do not support 
 can the minister assure the house that it be uk government policy that not only must ukraine be involve in a peace and in secure its territorial integrity but it be only the ukrainian people not president trump nor president putin who can determine the destiny of ukraine 
 we have say that ukraine must be involve in those negotiation and that peace negotiation need side to come an agreement it therefore clearly follow that the ukrainians must be content with whatever the process come up with there must be security guarantee and the peace must be durable everybody agree with that 
 be the minister concern that president trump be repeat false kremlin propaganda and perpetuate a gross misrepresentation of the war in ukraine by suggest that for ukraine this 
 be not a good war to go into 
 will the uk government be make it clear to the us president in no uncertain term that ukraine have just defend itself from invasion bombing rape murder and occupation and that it be an outrage for president trump to suggest that ukraine should give up its sovereign territory to russia 
 we have make quite clear with our year partnership with ukraine that we back it in the long term we have provide ukraine with support from many party across this chamber over a number of year to ensure that it can continue its fight and we will continue to support ukraine during any negotiation that take place so that it can get the peace that it wish to have 
 the minister ’s commitment to continue defence support for ukraine be essential and i be sure the house ’s thought be with ukrainians who be fight for their freedom and all the ukrainians in our own community who have find sanctuary in this country do she agree that any settlement can not be a repeat of the budapest memorandum or the minsk agreement which fail to deter future russian imperial aggression 
 i think everybody agree that any peace that be negotiate must be durable that will require security guarantee give the past experience that the ukrainians have of russia and russian aggression 
 as the minister will be aware much of the russian war effort be be sustain by other nation include several of the bric nation which be support russia through direct military aid or dual use product what be the minister do to try to deter the flow of arm that be continue to sustain russia 
 the right hon gentleman will know very well that there be sanction which we do our good to police and they have have some impact i think they have to continue both while the war be still ongoing and while the peace be be consider and negotiate 
 all war end but i know it be the feeling of member across the house that we very much owe it to the man and woman fight for ukraine that when this war end it do so with ukraine in a position of strength at the table and in the drive seat on the term and timescale 
 i agree with my hon friend that we need to continue to support ukraine to put it in the strong possible position both while it be fight the war and during any negotiation that take place 
 could we take a moment to reflect on the hundred of thousand of life that have be lose in this war ukrainian civilian ukrainian soldier russian soldier and all the family who be mourn today 
 effort be make early on by latin american and african leader and the pope to try to negotiate an end to this war and we may now have an opportunity to demonstrate that country should never occupy another do the minister believe that there be any possibility in the near future of a ceasefire ahead of negotiation that would be acceptable to the people of ukraine as well as the rest of europe because we need to see an end to this ghastly conflict 
 the right hon gentleman be correct that conflict such as this need to come to an end as soon as possible so i acknowledge the point he make about the death on all side and how bad that be however i think it be important for any peace that may be negotiate to be durable and lasting so we need to focus our mind at present on support ukraine as much as we can so that it go into any such negotiation in the strong possible position 
 give putin ’s illegal invasion and declare intent do the government agree that any negotiation must result in a sovereign ukraine and that the uk will play its part in provide security guarantee that be meaningful unlike those of the past because that be crucial to secure a lasting peace 
 the hon member be right that security guarantee be likely to be an important part of any peace agreement give the past history we have a year partnership with ukraine and we be commit to ensure that it can defend its sovereign capability to continue to exist while it be too early to talk about any detail of what those security guarantee may be we be committed to make sure that ukraine can continue as an independent state 
 on monday there will be a concert in bath abbey in support of ukraine my constituent have be unstinting in their support for ukrainians live among we but also for ukrainian community such as in oleksandriia now be not the point at which to weaken our support how will the government ensure that ukraine ’s voice be hear loud and clear in any peace talk and that no european country may potentially or will ultimately be bully by us president trump 
 i agree very much with the hon lady when she say that our ukrainian friend here in this nation have receive a lot of support not only in her constituency but across the uk from their friend and neighbour and that that will continue we have a year partnership with ukraine we have support the ukrainians through the tough time of this war with arm and other necessary support and we will continue to do so 
 i be sure the minister will acknowledge as i do the huge effort of the ukrainian diaspora in the uk of which a large proportion be in scotland particularly in and around my constituency give the huge effort they have make do she agree that we must not convey the idea in the come week that we have in any way let they or their countryman down 
 i do agree with that and we have no intention i think in any part of this house of do so 
 i call jim shannon 
 thank you mr speaker i be surprised to be call so early 
 do you want to wait a minute 
 no no i will grab the chance 
 i thank the minister for her answer it be obvious to i and other member of this house that she have a heart that want to help those in ukraine and we appreciate that especially since it come from government i welcome the potential peace that might come but of course it have to be a peace of justice it have to be fair to the ukrainians and we hope a way can be find do   she agree that any sign of negotiation be to be welcome but that there can be no doubt that ukraine retain the support of this house she have say that and everyone have say it what role will the uk have in ensure that the people of ukraine have security from further russian aggression when putin recalibrate his force a year or from now 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise these concern it be clear that any peace that be negotiate which must have the consent of the ukrainians themselves have to be durable and to the extent that that require security guarantee those have to be present for it to work 
 it be a truism from ancient roman time that if we want peace we must prepare for war and i be glad the strategic defence review be prepare we for war sadly although in slow motion unfortunately will the sdr consider the unlocked back door that be ireland which sit outwith nato it be clear that alarm bell be ring in nato but ireland cash rich sit outside nato and have a critical role in defend undersea cable we learn from the irish press that its navy be set sail without sufficient officer to man its main gun it be send out gunboat without gun what can we do to encourage ireland to play a full role in what will i think be a confrontation with russia 
 the hon gentleman be right that we need to prepare the strategic defence review will set out the threat that we face and we will then turn our attention to make sure we obtain the capability to deal with they obviously we will look at any weakness there might be and try to shore they up 
 every time president trump make a statement about ukraine i hear from constituent that they be terrify for the future of ukraine and never more so than in the last hour will the minister confirm whether the british government be consult on or tell about president trump ’s call with vladimir putin beforehand 
 i be afraid it be above my pay grade to know the answer to that question but i be sure the hon gentleman will have an opportunity to ask those whose pay grade it be not above at another question session as far as i be aware we have have friendly conversation at the ukraine defence contact group with member of the us administration 
 what practical help be the government provide to ukraine ’s legal system and judge to ensure the prosecution of war crime 
 we have a year partnership with ukraine which have be sign that will be support it in any way it feel it need support that we might be able to offer i can not answer the hon gentleman ’s question today about what help we have give but i be absolutely certain that if ukraine ask we for help and it be consider that our legal profession be able to supply it we will think about do so 
 do the minister not agree that the lesson to draw from this be the importance of military strength work with all our nato and european ally but critically be able to stand on our own foot militarily we need to see defence spending as investment and in that light do she wish we be not give however many billion of pound it be to mauritius and that we could invest that money in our defence instead 
 we have a commitment to get our defence spend back to of gdp and the last time it be at that level be at the time of the last labour government

 like some of our lead podcaster we love a storm cloud or in business question sure enough the poor government have be desperately hop that recent event in america would drive the storm cloud away from the uk economy even though the news from washington dc have be startling to say the least it have not be enough to dispel yet another week of adverse economic headline both the office for budget responsibility and the bank of england have reportedly downgrade their growth forecast the latter cut its by half to a measly for the year so much for the chancellor ’s much vaunted dash for growth 
 meanwhile the national institute of economic and social research have report that fiscal headroom remain to deal with any shock in the same week that president trump have announce tariff on steel it be easy to see what have happen here labour never expect president trump to win it send a team over to campaign for his opponent the government pass an anti growth budget and they do not build enough leeway into their financial planning indeed the chancellor promise no new taxis or spending now we be have to live with the consequence 
 it be also hard to miss the continue controversy that the attorney general be create and hard still not to notice the extremely critical word of his labour   colleague lord glasman i do not propose to repeat those word here but they point to issue that demand this house ’s full and proper attention in both case the concern be not over the legal position take by the attorney general as such but the contradiction that they offer to the rest of government policy people can agree or disagree about the policy but the contradiction can not be fudge they can not be blame on other and they require explanation 
 the contradiction be in relation to international law on   february the attorney general tell the council of europe that the government would 
 never withdraw from the european convention on human rights or refuse to comply with judgment of the court 
 in do so he be simply restate settle uk policy for many decade a fact that he somehow neglect to mention the difficulty arise however because the government ’s new legislation on small boat appear to retain a measure ban migrant from claim protection under the modern slavery law that be a ban that the prime minister go out of his way to denounce when it be introduce in in his word 
 it be a cry shame that we face legislation that drive a coach and horse through our world lead modern slavery framework which protect woman from exploitation ”—[official report   march vol c. 
 that be quite a u turn you see the deep problem mr speaker which be it to be will the government abide by international law in this instance and protect woman from exploitation as the prime minister say or will they reverse his newly adopt position in support of the ban 
 the problem relate to domestic law last november the attorney general strengthen his official guidance to government lawyer on possible legal risk he specifically caution against offer legal support for policy that have only a tenable case elsewhere he have pledge to restore check on executive that is government action this come at a time when the prime minister have specifically pledge to end vexatious litigation while build a huge amount of new housing and infrastructure you see the problem mr speaker it be the problem that the noble lord glasman be point out when he praise the rule of law but not of lawyer this edict will have a chilling effect on what i think we can already agree be pretty sluggish decision making by ministers 
 will the government now take less legal risk as the attorney general require will their lawyer now require ministers to act only when they can defeat a legal challenge or will they curb the judicial review and other legal case that will otherwise inevitably disrupt their building plan i do not expect the leader of the house to tell we how the government plan to resolve those obvious problem today but the house would be grateful for a debate in government time on what on earth the government ’s approach will be to resolve they 
 may i update the house on the work of the modernisation committee which i chair we establish the committee to rebuild trust in politic raise standard improve culture and make parliament more effective in recent year the role of an mp have change significantly with many more demand and   expectation in the constituency the make up of the commons have change a great deal too many more party be represent and member well reflect the country we serve so how we do thing need to change too i thank all of those who contribute to our wide range call for view

 the right hon gentleman raise a number of point and give a list of economic statistic i might give he some alternative one if i may inflation be down mortgage rate be come down wage be grow at their fast rate in year business investment be at the high level for year and the international monetary fund and the oecd be both say that britain will be europe ’s fast grow major economy in coming year he support the former prime minister not   the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak who be in his place but the who crash the economy and send mortgage rate fly and inflation to record high so i will not take lecture from he
