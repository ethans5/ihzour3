i congratulate my hon friend   the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns   on secure this timely and very important debate i pay tribute to she for her work as chair of the foreign affairs committee along with her tireless and very active effort to secure a more stable peaceful and prosperous future for the people of the western balkans the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my hon friend   the member for wealden ms ghani the minister for europe would have be delighted to take part in the debate she be currently travel on ministerial duty so it be my pleasure to respond on behalf of the government i be grateful to hon member for their many thoughtful and emotive contribution which help we to understand the significance of the region 
 the people of the western balkans clearly deserve the opportunity to live in stable inclusive and democratic society where they can heal the scar leave by conflict and grasp every opportunity to thrive and prosper that be what we be strive towards all country play their full part in the euro atlantic family of nation with the opportunity and benefit that bring sadly as we have hear today we be a long way from the peaceful and stable balkans we all wish to see the contribution from my hon friend   the member for rutland and melton and the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady   and for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty highlight the context within which we be work democracy be fragile at well political elite be ramp up ethno nationalist tension for their own benefit and russia as be highlight by member across the house be fan the flame of division to distract attention from ukraine and move the region away from the west it be good to see the house unite in call out that behaviour 
 we must of course avoid a return to conflict in the western balkans at all cost we be painfully aware of the serious consequence that that would have in the region and beyond meanwhile it be clear that political weakness and instability in the western balkans be threaten the uk ’s security endemic corruption be fuel illegal migration and allow serious organise crime group to thrive and operate in this country include in the drug trade 
 with that in mind we be take a multi faceted approach we be address the driver of instability whether that be dodik ’s push for secession or heighten tension between serbia and kosovo but we be also focus on the underlie factor enable that we be engage with all country take a cross government approach underpin by our programme in the region last year we spend over £ on support security and defence prevent conflict and promote media freedom along with effort to tackle corruption and organised crime and to empower woman and girl 
 give the grow instability with all the risk it pose we be prioritise the western balkans in our diplomatic engagement as other have point out the fact that of the foreign secretary ’s visit be to kosovo in january demonstrate the importance that we place on our tie with the region indeed the prime minister ’s special envoy to the western balkans lord peach visit the region time last year and make a further trip to other interested country as well as engage regularly with international organisation such as nato and the eu 
 the uk have long work with serbia on share priority and will continue to do so make clear the point on which we disagree and judge individual by their action it be not for we to comment on the appointment of individual minister but it clearly raise question when we see a us sanction individual in the government 
 a number of issue have be raise today about the relationship between kosovo and serbia we have see an increase in violence include last september ’s terrible attack in banjska which be describe very clearly by my hon friend the member for rutland and melton in every meeting every call and every letter that we exchange with serbian and kosovan leader we urge they to avoid inflammatory rhetoric and escalation and engage constructively in the dialogue only through genuine dialogue and mutual good will can we normalise relation between kosovo and serbia and start to build the bright future that their citizen deserve we also continue to make it clear to the serbian authority that they must co operate fully with effort to hold to account those responsible for the banjska attack take step to tackle cross border arm smuggling and encourage kosovo serbs to return to the institution and serve the community that they represent we have also make clear to the kosovo government the need to ensure that minority community can play a full and equal role in the country ’s future 
 we be disappointed that the mayoral recall referendum on   sunday april   be boycott by kosovo serbs it be arrange specifically to return kosovan municipality to representational governance and it be important for a route back to that to be find i can confirm to member if they do not already know that the uk will vote for kosovo to join the council of europe 
 point have be raise about investigation of the banjska attack the kosovan police and prosecutor be the appropriate authority to investigate it and it right for we to wait for that investigation to conclude we have previously sanction radoičić as well as the kosovan criminal charge with organise the attack we have urge serbia to hold perpetrator to account and address the ongoing problem of cross border arm smuggling 
 along with other   the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord   rightly speak of the role of lord ashdown in bosnia and herzegovina but i think we all recognise the important role perform there by my right hon and gallant friend   the member for beckenham bob stewart he remind we that that country matter and highlight the tension that exist there i will never forget visit sarajevo with my family can not but be move by be in that great city meet its people and be remind of the horror of the past 
 we recognise that we be face the threat of republika srpska secede from bosnia and herzegovina we have condemn dodik ’s secessionist action and have under- line our steadfast support for the high representative   we be work with our international partner to deter further attempt at destabilisation and to support the reform that be necessary for progress towards eu accession 
 the right hon gentleman be quite right we have note a bit of a move towards sole trustee in a number of case which clearly give rise to concern about how person can represent the interest of the member of a pension scheme we be reflect on that in our work but of the member of the hewlett packard scheme write to i this week he may well also have write to other member about 
 the further fear and despair they be now feel as it dawn upon they that their company and pension scheme trustee be meanwhile prepare plan to derisk by transfer their pensioner responsibility to an insurance company 
 something the right hon gentleman touch on that transfer will quite possibly mean 
 no subsequent possibility ever for pre-1997 increase 
 he call that a frightening prospect and it be hard to disagree 
 the committee also look at concern about the new define benefit funding regime to be introduce for scheme valuation from september we note that the regime have be develop 
 in a different era when the vast majority of db scheme be in deficit and amidst concern that employer be seek to evade their responsibility to underfunde scheme 
 there have be big change since then especially in the wake of the liability drive investment crisis follow the budget of month or so ago in particular there have be significant improvement in scheme funding but the principle of the new regime have not be change scheme be expect to target a position of low dependency on the sponsor employer mean low investment risk at the point of significant maturity that have promote concern that the funding code will when introduce force more unnecessary de risking particularly among open scheme as well as among those that be close but have long time horizon which would increase cost to employer and result in premature closure 
 we say that the dwp and the pensions regulator need 
 to act urgently to ensure they do not inadvertently finish off what few open scheme remain by far increase the risk aversion 
 in a letter to the committee on   december the minister tell we that both the department and the pensions regulator be 
 acutely aware of the need to take account of the specific need of open scheme 
 and he agree that 
 open scheme should not be force into an inappropriate de risking journey 
 we welcome that assurance but it need now to be reflect in the final wording of the funding code and in the regulator ’s approach 
 the vote in parliament on the statutory instrument come before the final version of the funding code be publish so member do not quite know what they be vote for at that point we recommend that the department and the pensions regulator should work with open scheme to address their concern particularly on the employer covenant horizon the length of time for which they be confident in the sponsoring employer ’s willingness and ability to support the scheme and report back to we on how they will do so before the new funding code be lay before parliament 
 since our report be publish feedback from scheme suggest that thing may not be move in the right direction in a consultation response last week the university superannuation scheme a large and still open scheme describe the regulator ’s propose approach as 
 university superannuation scheme 
 in its view the statement that it will be require to complete under the term of the new code will demand 
 significant resource for little or no benefit to our member 
 to the uss and to i that appear inconsistent with the assurance that open scheme will not be adversely impact by the new funding regime the uss add 
 not have have sight of the revise funding code and accompany covenant guidance have exacerbate 
 their worry 
 i know that the minister understand these concern well closure of those scheme would reduce pension fund investment in the productive economy at a time when the chancellor want absolutely rightly to increase investment from pension scheme into the productive economy can the minister tell we when he expect the new funding code to be publish whether he will report back to the committee before then on how the concern of open scheme have be address and whether he be open to consider a separate chapter in the funding code set out how the code will apply to open scheme 
 let i take a few minute to talk about what be happen on the define contribution side of the picture 
 the secretary of state be ask 
 if she will introduce legislative proposal to ban product from uk market that be make with or transport use force labour 
 the government recognise the importance of ensure that uk business respect human right throughout their operation we continue to keep this area under review and will work with our international partner to understand the most effective way of tackle force labour in supply chain 
 i thank my hon friend for his answer however company with well document link to uyghur slave labour be dump their good here in the uk that be because the united states have introduce the uyghur forced labour prevention act and the eu have act similarly last month i along with member of this house and human right organisation write a joint statement call for import control on solar panel will the minister agree to meet i to discuss that and to finally bring forward measure to clean up our supply chain 
 the government be clear that british business and solar developer should not stand for receive solar panel from company link to force labour we have already take step to address the issue through the procurement act and the modern slavery act in addition the forthcoming uk solar road map will outline a clear path to reach our solar deployment ambition include on energy security i reassure my hon friend that sustainable solar supply chain will form a central chapter of that road map and i would be happy to either arrange or have a meeting with she 
 what step her department be take to support postmaster affect by error in the horizon it system in northern ireland 
 on monday the house agree a government amendment to the horizon exoneration bill the post office horizon system offence bill to include conviction in northern ireland the northern ireland executive face unique challenge in deliver their own legislation in a timely manner include northern ireland in the bill ensure that postmaster there be not leave behind and receive exoneration and access to compensation on a uk wide basis 
 let i put on record my thank to the minister who have be an industrious assiduous and great champion for the postmaster and postmistress across this united kingdom there be not a person in the house who do not have great respect for he 
 far to monday ’s business in the house regard that northern ireland provision in the horizon bill which be bring forward by my hon friend   the member for north antrim ian paisley   and my right hon friend   the member for east antrim sammy wilson will the minister outline a timeline so that postmaster and postmistress across all of northern ireland can see an end to the reputational and financial damage and the heartache cause by the disgraceful operation of the horizon scheme 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his kind word it be always a pleasure to work with he and his colleague it be our intention that the legislation will clear both houses by july although obviously not all of these thing be within our gift should that be the case as we fully expect it to be the conviction will be quash in july and compensation redress will be pay from august 
 what progress she have make on help business to reach her target level of export 
 what progress she have make on support business to reach £ in annual export 
 uk export be £ in the month to february uk service export reach a record £ in the same period which be an increase of 10%—they go up by £ business include small and medium sized enterprise can access my department ’s wealth of export support at great.gov.uk that support include the uk export academy which have have more than registration our international trade adviser who help about sme each year and export champion across every part of the uk 
 be we really the large exporter in the world 
 i be pleased to tell my right hon friend that we be there be many many more good statistic which he will find in the publication my department produce at the end of january it contain further good news story on uk export the uk be a global export superpower and the world ’s   big service exporter service export to the european union be at a record high and have increase by since 
 my right hon friend have just detail very encouraging datum much of which result from the hard work of sme will she give a bit more information about what support be available specifically to sme to help they grow and export more of their product and service 
 the department have declare this year the year of the sme people often hear news that sound as though it be just about big business but sme employ most of the people in the uk we have a network of international trade adviser and our export support service we have also put in place scheme such as a help to grow management course which participant have complete by november we also have a business support service which provide support to about people in england every year 
 far to those comment about sme in the light of the termination of the trade show access programme which support sme in gain international market exposure what be the government ’s strategy to provide equivalent or enhanced support to ensure uk food product remain competitive within eu market 
 we know that a lot of people be disappointed that we close the trade show programme but it be a pilot programme and it do not yield the business success that we have hop we be invest in those thing that be provide success and demonstrate real benefit the uk export academy be of they along with the export support service as i mention and the international trade adviser many of they will have expertise in food and drink if the hon gentleman write to we with a specific case we will be happy to help 
 i call the shadow minister 
 unfortunately for government members and more importantly for the country the office for budget responsibility ’s recent figure which i know the secretary of state struggle with show that export have drop on her watch and be set to have decline again this year if she have a moment to spare from her leadership campaign she might read the landmark report publish by aston university last week on the significant boost for british export that a veterinary agreement could deliver through british farmer and the agrifood industry why will she not pursue an agreement that be so obviously in britain ’s national interest 
 the obr put out lot of figure and the opposition cherry pick the one they think will be most helpful think that we have not do our homework i encourage the hon member to look at the obr forecast for growth for this country which be very high and i ask he which specific period he be   refer to he should look at what have happen to export overall not just period include covid which explain why we have have some drop in food export 
 i ask the secretary of state about the veterinary agreement i suspect no on the opposition benches will be surprised that she have not show any interest in a trade agreement that would help british farmer accord to the house of commons library under the last labour government export rise by but since then export have rise by only be the truth not that british exporter always do well under a labour government 
 that be absolute rubbish it be not true the veterinary agreement that he be talk about would create dynamic alignment with the eu which be not what this country vote for in we be deliver what the people vote for yes there will be difficulty we be sort they out it be time that the opposition move on and accept the will of the people 
 what recent progress her department have make on negotiate a free trade agreement with south korea 
 i thank my right hon friend for the valuable work he be do as the prime minister ’s trade envoy to the republic of korea i look forward to his upcoming visit there he be famous for his timely intervention detailed round discussion on an upgrade fta take place in london from to   march which provide an opportunity to conclude the exploratory phase of negotiation we now look forward to text base negotiation in round which be due to take place in seoul from   june 
 i thank my right hon friend for his answer ahead of my visit to korea next week do he agree that the indo pacific region offer huge opportunity for global growth particularly as it will be home to something like half the world ’s middle class consumer over the come decade and therefore that upgrade this agreement be likely to bring huge benefit to the uk 
 my right hon friend be absolutely right the indo pacific be a vital part of the world for the uk and form the centrepiece of our strategy go forward diplomatically and on trading tie he be right that the republic of korea will play a vital role in that the recently sign downing street accord with korea outline the breadth and depth of the ongoing relationship we look forward to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership come into effect later this year and we look forward to see if the republic of korea will apply 
 i be sure   the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale   do a very effective job in south korea i visit myself with the digital culture media and sport committee a couple of year ago and see those opportunity however there be some concern about transparency around the use of trade envoy will the minister confirm   to the house that under this government no trade envoy have ever demand and be give the use of a house for their exclusive use 
 the hon gentleman have slightly jump the gun as the next question on the order paper relate to trade envoy may i say how proud we be of the cross party trade envoy programme which i think he will hear about in a moment we think they do an excellent good value for money job for the united kingdom in promote trade in a number of key market 
 what the travel cost of parliamentary trade envoy be in each of the last year 
 the prime minister ’s trade envoy provide invaluable support in progress the uk ’s trade and investment agenda in market across the world the travel cost incur by the prime minister ’s trade envoy be £ for the financial year £ for and £ for these cost be for flight for accommodation when the official british residence be unavailable and for other sundry expense 
 there be a great deal of murkiness about the trade envoy i note that in answer to my hon friend   the member for cardiff west kevin brennan the minister point blank refuse to deny that at least trade envoy have explicitly ask for the exclusive use of a house while act as a trade envoy the minister have point blank refuse to publish the breakdown of all the trade envoy and their cost for absolutely spurious reason if a select committee visit south korea for instance all the detail of the cost be publish but not if a trade envoy go how can we possibly judge whether the £ that have be spend so far in the past year have be well spend be there any accountability whatsoever or be this really just a means of provide sinecure for people who be like in government 
 well there be a lot of bluster there and not a few accusation the hon gentleman may wish to try to stack these thing up a bit it be a cross party programme not a government only programme many labour mp labour peer and other be member of the programme gift and hospitality be already publish in departmental register if i may say so mr speaker qualification for this cross party role be diplomacy and discretion which might explain why not everybody have be ask to do it 
 what recent discussion she have have with the scottish government on the promotion of scottish product in overseas market 
 my department work closely with the scottish government and their agency to promote scottish product in overseas market we have recently deliver   our made in scotland sell to the world exporter roadshow in glasgow on top of that i be pleased to say that the pg paper company a brilliant scottish business have just receive an award in this year ’s make in the uk sell to the world award 
 the value of scotland ’s oil export to the eu reach £ in with total oil export up so the value of oil as an export commodity can not be overstate those billion of pound in export can be balance against the modest £ investment that would increase grangemouth ’s profitability threefold secure its long term future and save grangemouth from closure do the secretary of state accept that it would be absurd for scotland to be the only major oil produce nation without a refinery capacity and will she agree to meet i to discuss this matter far give that the scottish government be otherwise occupy 
 the hon gentleman be right to raise this issue it be something that we be concern about and the uk and scottish governments be work together to understand all the option for the future of the refinery and work closely on the issue through forum such as the grangemouth future industry board i be very happy to meet he as be other minister to discuss this matter far 
 do the secretary of state agree that while there have be great progress in promote and increase the export of traditional scottish product such as whisky we also need to support new business such as in south lanarkshire that be keen to expand electronic vehicle infrastructure into the united states 
 yes my right hon friend be quite right our export need to be about the future not just about the traditional industry such as scottish whisky which be the pride of scotland and of the uk electric vehicle be way that we will hit our net target and this be an area that the department for energy security and net be focus on and that i support in business and trade if there be anything specific that we can look into for his constituency we would be very happy to help 
 what step she be take to support job in steel supply chain 
 the uk government ’s £ grant will safeguard steelmaking in port talbot job in the company and thousand more in supply chain across the uk that would otherwise have be under serious threat the transition board with a furth £ of funding—£80 from the uk government and £ from tata will also support those affect that funding will help supply chain business to strengthen and diversify their customer base create sustainable job and business opportunity in port talbot and the wide region 
 when it be finally introduce the carbon border adjustment mechanism will provide a vital tool to ensure that british steelworker have a level playing field so that they can compete against heavily pollute steel industry in other part of the world but recent medium report have indicate that india be lobby no for an exemption from the uk cbam do the minister recognise that cbam work only if they be comprehensive across all country and sector and if we start give exemption here or there the entire policy will unravel that be particularly important give that tata ’s plan for port talbot be base on import million of tonne of semi finished product steel from india a country that produce its steel with significantly high carbon intensity will the minister confirm that under no circumstance will india be give an exemption from the uk carbon border adjustment mechanism a yes or no answer will suffice 
 i be pleased to visit the hon gentleman ’s constituency as part of my round of visit in this new role i look forward to meet he again later this month he be right that the government be commit to ensure that uk decarbonisation effort lead to a true reduction in global emission the cbam policy be still be design the consultation be ongoing and i recommend that he contribute to it 
 resident in scunthorpe be particularly concerned about steel supply chain job relate to virgin steelmaking my hon friend ’s predecessor my hon friend   the member for wealden ms ghani be very clear from the dispatch box that we obviously need a place for virgin steelmaking in the uk and that that place be scunthorpe will he confirm that he agree with she and that nothing be off the table in his negotiation with british steel 
 i be pleased to visit my hon friend ’s constituency to meet steelworker and british steel management during my visit last month i know that she be a passionate and dedicated champion for her community and for steelworker there i look forward to meet she again next week ahead of the visit of the secretary of state to her constituency and to discuss these matter and other 
 i call the shadow minister 
 no commitment to virgin steel from the minister then what a shame i welcome he to his place and note that he visit port talbot steelwork last week but he fail to meet any actual steelworker of course instead of avoid discuss the government ’s plan for £ of taxpayer money for the loss of nearly job will he please commit to meet some port talbot steelworker and will he publish his economic assessment of the impact of the uk lose its capacity to make virgin steel or be his actual plan to just keep his head down until the prime minister finally have the gut to call a general election and leave all these problem pile up for somebody else 
 this conservative government have give more support to the steel sector than any government before we when i go to port talbot i be pleased to   meet steelworker and i will continue to do so i also sit on the transition board i will continue to support steel in south wales and all the opportunity that the sector will bring 
 what recent progress she have make on increase level of trade with caribbean community member state 
 my hon friend be a great champion of international trade as the prime minister ’s trade envoy for mongolia he will be pleased to know that annual trade between the uk and the caribbean economic community caricom in be £ up in current price on the previous year in december i represent the uk at the inaugural joint council of our economic partnership agreement where i meet representative of caricom and the dominican republic collectively know as cariforum underline the importance of our trading relationship and explore opportunity to far boost trade 
 i speak as the chairman of the all party parliamentary group on st kitts and nevis guyana and the caribbean it be an extremely important region for the united kingdom of the large concentration of british overseas territory and commonwealth nation in the world with historic link with the united kingdom but the copy and paste trade deal that we have with they carry over from the european union be not sufficient we need a more tailor make specific trade agreement between the united kingdom and the caribbean community to ensure that some of those protectionist measure that the european union impose on our caricom friend can be rescind when will that happen 
 i thank my hon friend for his engagement in the region in st kitts the caribbean as a whole and guyana which remain in all our mind at the moment give the situation on its border he be right to highlight the cariforum trade deal it be a deal that the uk value and i mention that we have have the inaugural meeting of the body design to ensure that the deal have good effect on our trade with the caribbean i might suggest arrange a meeting between my hon friend and the trade commissioner jonathan knott who i be sure would be delighted to meet he to discuss caribbean trade possibility still far 
 what step her department be take to reduce non financial reporting requirement for small business 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and for his work as of our trade envoy to the kingdom of morocco i know he be a true diplomat and the soul of discretion we recently announce that we be raise the monetary threshold that determine   company size reduce burden on small business and remove low value and overlap reporting requirement around medium sized company will be reclassify as small company and small company will be reclassify as micro company this will save small and medium sized company around £ a year 
 i visit many small business in my aylesbury constituency and i be always incredibly impressed by their spirit of entrepreneurship and the huge effort and hard work that they put in to succeed they want to be able to devote as much of their skill and time as possible to find new customer sell more of their product and create job not to bureaucracy admin and onerous regulation as the true party of business our government have already make great progress support business as the minister have just outline but what more can his department do to help the small and micro firm that be the engine of our economy 
 my hon friend be a real champion of small business and we meet often talk about these matter this government ’s policy have push the uk to place in the oecd ranking for start up out of country and we have a suite of programme to help small business most importantly we offer access to finance with our start up loans company growth guarantee scheme and equity investment scheme the seed enterprise investment scheme and the enterprise investment scheme we offer supportive advice through our help to grow management suite include our newly launch help to grow management essentials course which be hour free online training for small business we be also remove barrier through non financial reporting as well as the monetary size threshold we be consult on increase the employee size threshold from employee for a medium sized company to which will save medium sized company a furth £ a year 
 i call the shadow minister 
 alongside the despair and financial pressure face by small business the british poultry council recently report that unreciprocated eu border check have unfairly saddle uk exporter with £ a year in extra cost while their eu counterpart pay absolutely nothing do the minister agree that this government ’s failure to negotiate a fair sanitary and phytosanitary agreement with the eu have directly undermine british business and expose our exporter to severe competitive disadvantage 
 i be surprised that the hon gentleman ’s question be put that way we be try to make sure that we have a fair and level playing field for uk exporter and eu exporter of course we need check on the border on that basis it would not be fair to uk producer if that be not the case but what he be push for in a sanitary and phytosanitary agreement be what his hon friend   the hon member for harrow west gareth thomas   be push for dynamic alignment with the eu which would lock we into eu rule permanently we do not believe in that we believe we have a bright future outside the european union he would lock we back into the custom union and the single market 
 what recent assessment she have make of the contribution of the manufacturing sector to the economy 
 the uk be a global hub for advanced manufacturing and accord to the oecd the uk ’s manufacturing sector have have the fast growth in the g7 since the importance of the sector be highlight in the manufacturing technologies association ’s recent the true impact of uk manufacturing report manufacturing contribute £ gross value add to the uk economy in and play an outsized role in the key driver of growth include by account for over of uk export 
 the uk lead the way in area such as artificial intelligence robotic and the internet of thing which be important for our future especially in manufacturing how be that strengthen british business and the british economy 
 it be well know across the house that my hon friend be a strong champion for manufacturing and advanced technology the government be also strongly committed to support research and development and innovation because they contribute significantly to our economic growth in particular industrial technology such as robotic and ai be support manufacture business to be more productive and sustainable that be why the government have increase r&d investment to £ a year and be expand make smarter our highly successful industrial digitisation programme for small and medium sized enterprise 
 mainly because of this house ’s worship of the false idol of net electricity cost to business in the uk be and a half time high than those in china and time high than those in india can the minister explain how manufacturing business in the uk can compete with that on world market 
 i hope that the hon gentleman will join i in welcome the introduction of the british industry supercharger which reduce electricity cost for major energy intensive industry i hope that it will benefit business in his constituency and across the country 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 a key sector of the manufacture economy be the plastic industry which employ people and have an annual turnover of £ in july the uk government begin a consultation on the plastic packaging tax and the methodology behind it in february some organisation sign a joint letter to the government urge the swift publication of that consultation when exactly do the government expect to be able to respond to that long overdue consultation 
 the hon gentleman be right the uk plastic industry be highly important and contribute £ to the economy last year i be aware of the consultation which be lead by the treasury and i will ensure that he get a reply

 whether uk wine company have seek advice from her department on preparation for produce wine in pint measure under the weights and measures intoxicating liquor amendment regulations 
 the ml pint quantity be of several change to pre packed wine size that be expect to come into force on   september support the thrive uk wine sector by provide opportunity for innovation and great choice in light of those change wine gb which represent producer say 
 we welcome the chance to be able to harmonise still and sparkle bottle size and we be happy to raise a glass to the great choice that allow uk producer for domestic sale 
 that answer be nowhere near as definitive as the press release that the minister ’s department put out on   december   last year which be still on the government website with the headline 
 pint of wine stock on britain ’s shelf for the time ever 
 that headline do not say will be stock might be stock could be stock or to be stock it imply that pint of wine be and be available to buy right now in shop across the uk will the government admit that the reality be that there have be little to no demand for or interest in that supposedly glorious brexit benefit and that in fact it be entirely possible that pint of wine will never be stock on uk shelf 
 it be never difficult to distinguish the hon gentleman from a ray of sunshine be it our wine industry be thrive with over vineyard across great britain the uk wine industry produce bottle of wine in and our new post brexit power provide we with new option those include new legislation that align exist size across still and spark pre packed wine so that both can be sell in ml and ml quantity for which we know there be good demand 
 whether she have make an assessment of the potential impact of new zealand ’s propose fast track approvals bill on its obligation under the uk new zealand free trade agreement environment chapter 
 in march the uk and new zealand highlight the importance of our environmental commitment at the ever environment committee under our new free trade agreement we continue to engage with new zealand on implement the environmental chapter and will monitor the propose bill that the hon lady mention during its passage through new zealand ’s parliament 
 the new zealand fta enter into force on   may it contain a commitment in article that each party will not 
 waive or otherwise derogate from or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from its environmental law in a manner that weaken or reduce the protection afford in that law 
 be there not a danger that the fast track approval will erode those protection what step will the government take to ensure that new zealand absolutely uphold its commitment under the fta 
 as i say we will continue to monitor the passage of that propose legislation but the hon lady must recognise that the uk and new zealand be incredibly like minded in these area on climate the environment and clean growth the environment chapter in our free trade agreement be of the most ambitious in any fta anywhere in the world it break new ground for both the uk and new zealand in support our share climate and environmental goal clean growth and the transition to a net economy 
 if she will make a statement on her departmental responsibility 
 post office governance be a priority for the government and i have say many time that it be vital   that we have the right people lead that organisation i be therefore pleased to tell the house that on wednesday i announce the appointment of nigel railton as its interim chair have previously be chief executive of camelot nigel bring a wealth of experience of transform organisation and i be confident that he be the right person to lead the post office through this period nigel railton will take up his post as soon as possible and will be invite to give ministers his view on the future direction of the post office in due course

 the business for next week be light with no vote until wednesday we can guess why the prime minister would want to keep his parliamentary colleague off the estate the internal politic of the tory party have become so febrile that they be get in the way of good governance while our constituent face ever high bill the government have simply run out of steam tomorrow we will hear the verdict of the voter in recent month we have begin to see the runner and rider for the next tory leadership contest the leader of the house say that she have the prime minister ’s back coincidentally she have be support her colleague up and down the country follow on from schnapps with shapps can we look forward to gin with jenrick or perhaps pimm ’s with penny i be a scrabble fan but there be a new game of political cluedo come along who could be the to strike the fatal blow against the prime minister will it be cocktail with kemi in the garden my money be on the leader of the house with the sharpen telegraph column in the drawing room 
 another possible leadership contender be the foreign secretary lord cameron have he recuse himself from part of his role that point be raise twice last week at cabinet office question with no clarity provide our parliamentary scrutiny be weaken when the foreign secretary be out of reach in the other place lord cameron have unanswered question from member of this house he be yet to reply to my letter ask about his time at scandal hit greensill capital question be about his use of private plane and personal taxation we learn this week that lord cameron still enjoy vip air travel taxpayer have to foot the bill for his trip to central asia in a luxurious private jet how do the leader of the house think that look to struggle family across our country deal with a cost of living crisis 
 we wish the leader of the house the foreign secretary and fellow leadership rival well we may well see they tour the tv studio the prime minister have hint that he may call a general election this summer if his party perform well today or he may cling on as the clock run down mr speaker you can understand the prime minister ’s hope that something will crop up but after year in charge it be clear that it be time for change each thursday morning the leader of the house put on a good turn some say it be a dress rehearsal for the following wednesday lunchtime who know this time it may come to pass 
 of all i would like to join the hon gentleman in pay tribute to lord stunell of hazel grove who sadly pass away on monday he enter the house of commons in leave for the lords in he be parliamentary under secretary of state for communities and local government in the coalition government and i know member on all side of the house will mourn his loss on our benches we be particularly grateful to he for be an effective and collaborative minister in the coalition work alongside colleague to bring in the localism act and draw up the national planning policy framework i hope that the many tribute pay to he in the come day will be a comfort to his loved one 
 i join with the many remark make by colleague regard the tragic loss of daniel anjorin and also the incident in sheffield my thought and i be sure those   of the whole house be with all those affect especially daniel ’s family i also pay tribute to the police for their courage they often get a hard time from we in this place but we should never forget the risk they take and the service they do we i know the house will also be glad to see his majesty the king out and about with the public again i wish all candidate in today ’s election good luck 
 the hon gentleman tempt i but i be go to resist because there be nothing i could say that would be more detrimental to   the hon member for central suffolk and north ipswich dr poulter to his character his integrity his standing in his community and his future prospect than what he have do to himself i think that be just about dawn on he 
 i too welcome the progress on the infected blood issue the hon gentleman know that the paymaster general have set out the timetable for the body to be establish on   may we now have a clear timetable that i hope will give confidence to all those infected and affect by this terrible scandal 
 i will certainly make sure that the hon gentleman ’s comment on tata steel be hear by the secretary of state 
 i have to break it to the hon gentleman that it be not go to be pimm ’s with penny i be more of a pint with penny person but yes i too have read that i be to be instal rather like a new boiler into no next week i have to say mr speaker that there be as much truth to those story as there be to labour ’s assurance to its business community that it be not actually go to do the thing that it have be say it be go to do and have promise its union paymaster 
 let i say again that i support our prime minister and i will continue to support he after this weekend and beyond because his plan be work i will do everything i can to ensure that labour do not get a chance to wreck the nation again the nation have choose a new trajectory to protect its border to enable growth and to trade more with the world to strengthen its partnership with ally our export be above level and we be the large exporter overall and the large net exporter of financial and insurance service in the world trade barrier have lead to a £ uplift for uk business in the last year and since uk manufacturing growth have be high than that of any other g7 nation we be on the right path and we have to stick to it i do not want to give labour the chance to unpick all that we have do from brexit to trade union reform 
 the hon gentleman ask about a general election and whether something be go to crop up i think that something be go to crop up whether it be pension the nhs rail tax or welfare the labour party claim that it be go to do thing but be plan another and i think that the public will see through that it be the most audacious deception since the big bad wolf don a winceyette nightie and ask little red riding hood to admire his upper denture but unlike red riding hood the british people have meet this wolf before and they remember that the story do not end well 
 the british people remember how disastrously labour run our train and we have read this week that to improve efficiency labour plan to run few train   they remember mrsa infect hospital and they be now see the unforgivable state of the nhs in wales as it struggle with a reduce budget labour be responsible for that as it be labour that cut the nhs budget they remember labour council tax hike for pensioner and other on fix income which constitute the large increase in their outgoing in government labour double council tax and in wales it have triple it the british public will look at the council league table out today and notice that the bad service be provide by labour council those charge the high taxis be labour local authority and the area with the bad crime rate be labour control and where do we see the low employment rate the small pay packet and the bad nhs waiting list in the whole uk in labour run wales 
 always every single time labour be in office every single time the british people give labour a chance they find themselves bad off poor and less safe badly serve and with more unemployment and they see that the nation be weak at least those in the labour party be consistent so i say to the british people do not give they the chance to do it again 
 further business will be announce in the usual way 
 i call the father of the house 
 the question of local council election have be raise those who want some amusement can read acts 5:41 quote in today ’s times and provide by the bible society although i be not suggest that my right hon friend should read it now 
 i walk here today through victoria tower gardens where it be still impossible to walk along the river because of the barricade around the buxton memorial fountain which be far too extensive if people care about memorial in victoria tower gardens they ought to make sure that the garden be properly accessible whenever that be possible 
 the select committee on the holocaust memorial bill report recently in document hc121 and i have table early day motion i do not expect my right hon friend to respond to this today 
 that this house note the special report of the holocaust memorial bill select committee hc121 on the problem with the current proposal and the restriction face by the committee consider the hybrid bill respect the conclusion and recommendation on page agree with the list of matter relate to the current proposal for a holocaust memorial and believe these need update attention on deliverability from the infrastructure commission from the national audit office on likely capital cost and recurrent annual cost from the chancellor on future funding control and from the police and security service on maintain unfettered public access for use of victoria tower gardens while protect the memorial ask his majesty 's government and the holocaust memorial foundation agency to commission the view of the property consultant on a comparison of the current proposal by sir david adjaye in victoria tower gardens with viable alternative to commission the full appraisal and to hold a public consultation on the selection of site and far ask his majesty 's government to commit to have this or an amend proposal consider by the local planning authority before consider whether to call in   the application note that an open minded observer could doubt another minister in the levelling up department should be ask to make an independent decision on an application by the secretary of state 
 as the committee have clearly indicate before the government think of bring the bill back to the chamber of the house of commons they need to do a number of thing they must review security we have see the holocaust memorial in hyde park cover up because of march go on around london and everyone know that a memorial in victoria tower gardens of the kind that be propose would be a major target the only way of provide security be to exclude the public from this park which be the only park for local resident 
 secondly the national infrastructure commission have say that this project be undeliverable will the government please ask the member of the commission whether they have change their mind last year the national audit office report that the cost have rise in year from £ to £ will the government please ask its member whether that can be review how will the chancellor agree to pay run cost of between £ and £ 
 i think that the government ought to delay do what be suggest in my early day motion and then report back to the house 
 it might be more helpful if the father of the house apply for an adjournment debate 
 i be sure that my hon friend know how to apply for a debate and will listen to your encouragement mr speaker i will certainly ensure as i do every week that the secretary of state have hear the issue that my hon friend raise i will feed they in on the matter of security he will know that there be a work group lead by the houses of parliament and those in government to make sure that all these very important issue be look at 
 i call the snp spokesperson 
 just when we think the government can stoop no lower they release a sicken detention video use real life trauma to show their voter how tough they be who instruct the civil service to produce such a piece can we have an apology from the home office for its appalling misjudgment in electioneer with this footage and a debate on whether the concept of electoral purdah still exist if it do who the heck regulate it 
 meanwhile the disastrously handle brexit border check be cause further chaos as predict the leader of the house may have see the report from the sevington inland border facility about lorry with perishable good the prospect of rot food and flower be bin compromise biosecurity and of course crash it system we have confusion delay and additional crippling cost otherwise know as brexit i be in the house yesterday for the statement that the business and trade secretary hurriedly bring out and she seem to brush aside these failure to prepare as mere supply chain issue prefer to brag about brexit the thing be her figure rely on a growth in service export city pal be do very well 
 meanwhile the british chambers of commerce which know a thing or about the issue describe the much warn of mess at sevington as 
 the straw that break the camel ’s back 
 for many uk business this be terribly serious for our small and medium sized enterprise particularly our farmer and fisher do the government care for the time i ask the leader of the house for an urgent debate specifically on the tory trade tax so that someone can be hold responsible to the house for this cack handed mess will she take it up 
 it seem that business question have become nothing more than a venue for parade opinion as madam deputy speaker have to remind the leader of the house and the shadow leader of the house last week business question be about the business of this house so can we leave the scripted opinion on scotland and her government to side for once and have a debate in government time on the unbelievable mess at sevington and its impact on the wide supply chain or will she too just ignore this crisis of her own government ’s making raise a laugh for her nervous back benchers and opine on scotland instead a country about which she know little and care less 
 the issue that the hon lady raise be a matter of taste about video that i understand the home office have produce which show i assume for the reassurance of the british public that those who do not have the right to remain in the uk will be deport there be image of people be put into the back of police vehicle scotland have produce quite a few similar video although the people be put into the back of police car have be member of the snp i will certainly ensure that the home secretary have hear the hon lady ’s concern and that they be take into account 
 the hon lady assert various thing about the border operating model many of the thing that she point to be not true the system have not go down and she be incorrect about the other issue that her party have be report some customer be have issue but they be be resolve i really hope that the snp will day acknowledge the hard work of scotland ’s business community include business that be provide service and export they around the world 
 we be the large net exporter of financial and insurance service and many of those business be in the hon lady ’s constituency and the surround area edinburgh be the large financial centre in europe behind only the city of london which be something to be immensely proud of the work that we be do not just on trade deal but on our memorandum of understanding for example with the united states at state level mean that it be easy for an accountant in her constituency to work on a project in the united states than it be for an accountant in the state next door that be something to be celebrate and have lead to our be the large exporter overall i hope that the hon lady might reflect on that and consider it in her exchange with i next week 
 i be proud of the work that i and colleague across the house do along with our dear depart friend sir david amess to raise the issue of endometriosis a terrible   disease that affect million of woman across the country it be only since we start to raise the issue around it that its profile have rise i be surprised to learn how many young woman do not know about the disease which be not in the sex and health education curriculum in school can we have a debate through the department for education on ensure that gynaecological disease be in the curriculum for both girl and boy because if someone do not know a disease exist how will they know they might have it
