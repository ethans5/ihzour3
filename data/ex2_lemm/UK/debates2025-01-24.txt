the deputy chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no 
 i beg to move that the house sit in private 
 question put forthwith standing order no 
 a division be call 
 division off 
 question negative 
 reading 
 i beg to move that the bill be now read a time 
 the climate and nature bill have be year in the making the enormous amount of support that it have garner from campaigner trade union scientist faith leader non governmental organisation business and especially young people mean that it be both an honour and an enormous responsibility to set out what it entail what it add to exist law and why i believe it address the most important existential challenge of our generation the intertwine climate and nature crisis 
 this country have sign up to various international commitment but we still have work to do to fully connect they to real and measurable action we need to close the ambition gap between what be need and what be promise and the delivery gap between what be promise and what be actually happen that be what the bill aim to do because too many metric be still head in the wrong direction 
 it be important as the hon lady have underline that we move forward together she have not mention the national farmers union can she reassure i and other in the house that the national farmers union and the ulster farmers union in northern ireland be happy with the bill and accept the impact that its proposal will have on they 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his intervention i would be delighted to have that conversation with representative of the nfu in northern ireland and to reassure they on that point 
 as an environmental campaigner for the past year it have sometimes be easy for i to fall into doomism wild fire have ravage los angeles flood have devastate valencia and the recently elect leader of the free world be urge we to drill baby drill in the name of make america great again but i do not believe that    doomism be helpful yes the good time to take bold action on climate and nature would have be year ago but the good time be now 
 the bill be very ambitious for a private member ’s bill but not ambitious enough for a climate and nature bill it be not try to be over ambitious or pretend to be a silver bullet but it aspire to answer the question from where we be now what be the right next step to take the bill ’s guide principle be that we have a duty to be good ancestor now that we know what we know about the impact that human activity be have on the liveability of our planet how do we strike the right balance between present and future thriving how do we ensure that we be not steal health wealth and wellbee from generation not yet bear while we enrich our life how do we ensure we do not impoverish future life what do we want our legacy to be a world with a strip mine next to a rubbish tip next to a shopping mall or a world with clean air and drinkable river regenerated soil and vibrant ocean teem with wildlife and alive with birdsong 
 as i speak i be look around to spot my young friend in the gallery polly amber and bobby from gloucestershire youth climate group i speak to the group recently and by chance bump into they on the train into london this morning when i be their age i be blissfully ignorant of the loom environmental crisis they do not have that luxury they and the rest of their generation will face the consequence of our choice here today i want to be able to look into their eye after today ’s debate and feel proud that this house rise to the challenge that we do what be necessary rather than what be politically expedient and that we pledge to protect their future 
 what be in the climate and nature bill the bill have be draft by world lead climate scientist ecologist and conservationist and aim to deliver an integrate plan to tackle the twin climate and nature crisis it would bring massive benefit for local community include my constituent in the south cotswolds improve the air we breathe give we clean water to drink swim and row in revitalise local population of cherished wildlife such as vole otter kingfisher and shrew and provide cheap energy bill warm home green job well food and happy life 
 the bill would create a join up strategy for the uk to tackle the interconnected climate and nature crisis together it be the only proposed or actual piece of legislation to create the link between the uk ’s response to climate change and nature loss we can not solve without tackle the other we risk make each crisis bad if they be tackle in silo so the bill support a whole of government approach to prevent the issue become siloe everything in nature be connect with everything else in nature but sadly not everything in government be connect with everything else in government but it need to be housing transport and even health be inter related with climate and nature so we need a strategy that transcend departmental boundary 
 the can bill would enshrine international commitment make by the uk into national legislation to cut emission and to restore nature by as outline in the global biodiversity framework the bill would bring the uk public along with that agenda via a climate and nature    assembly which be key to ensure that all voice from across our country be hear enable worker to transition to low carbon job and ensure vulnerable community be protect it provide for a fair and just transition that do not come at the expense of the rest of the world for century britian prosper by exploit resource overseas animal vegetable mineral and human the bill require the accounting for our environmental footprint to be honest take into account the carbon emission and impact on nature that be incur overseas in produce the good and service that we enjoy it be disingenuous to offshore most of our manufacturing and then congratulate ourselves for have reduce our environmental impact 
 i be delighted to say that the bill have a long history of be support by the party now in government i trust that their ecological concern while in opposition have survive their transition into power as they be now in a position to act on their pledge labour members may try to tell we that his majesty ’s government be already do everything that be in the bill but look at the metric we be still far adrift of where we need to be ultimately our future will not be determine by our strategy and intention nature care only about result 
 the office for environmental protection recently publish its progress report on the government ’s environmental improvement plan it find that the government be largely off track in achieve their legal environmental commitment i acknowledge that this government have be in power for less than month so i do not hold they entirely responsible for that state of affair but i struggle to see how expand our airport by approve new runway will help they get back on track the oep assessment show that on their current trajectory the government will meet only of their environmental target 
 the state of nature report show that nearly in specie be at risk of be lose from great britian and the uk now have less than half its biodiversity remain out of the wildlife habitat assess only in be find to be in good condition only in woodland and a quarter of peatland be in good ecological state none of the seafloor around the uk be in good condition just of woodland be sustainably manage and only half of fish stock be sustainably harvest 
 it be my view that the government need to prioritise thing the be support for nature friendly farming around of land in england be use for agriculture support farmer to manage their land in a nature friendly way will deliver significant environmental improvement at scale 
 the key steward of our landscape for hundred of year have be our farmer no have do more to make our countryside as beautiful as it be or have a big stake in protect its health for the future do my hon friend agree that the path to net and sustainable local food production lie through our farming community with the support provide by the bill if we be to get the good from   our farmer it be time to use rather more carrot and few stick 
 i wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend report by the department for environment food and rural affairs show that nature friendly farming scheme can be a major pathway for halting and then reverse the decline in species abundance as well as deliver the majority of habitat creation need to meet the uk government ’s nature and climate target 
 my hon friend be make a powerful speech and i congratulate she on bring forward this important legislation like many farm in glastonbury and somerton camel hill farm ’s focus on regenerative farming have improve soil quality and nature loss however the farming budget have see a real term funding cut after inflation since leave farmer try to restore nature with reduced support 
 order if we be to get member in we all see how many be present in the chamber intervention will have to be short and not pre prepared speech there be plenty of time for those who have put their name down to speak member should not use up the time of the hon member for south cotswolds for her opening 
 i thank my hon friend for her intervention and applaud she for her work as an effective spokesperson on behalf of the farming community indeed she pre empte what i be about to say farmer should be properly reward for restore soil planting hedgerow and reduce pesticide use with an expand nature friendly farming budget at the upcoming comprehensive spending review they need a clear long term strategy from the government so that they be able to plan and invest accordingly 
 i commend the hon lady for bring this bill forward do she recognise that the sustainable farming incentive be move to reward farmer who be furth towards the bottom of the scale rather than at the high end of it as we would wish to see to reward farmer for rotation of crop for example seem to be go back to the century rather than ensure a high level of stewardship 
 my understanding as a non farmer be that crop rotation be an effective way to regenerate soil 
 the priority be to create more join up space for nature on land through the global biodiversity frame work the government have commit to protect of land and sea for nature by with less than year to meet that target a wildlife and countryside link report state that the amount of land in england effectively protect for nature have fall to less than the government should put by at the heart of upcoming planning reform to ensure that all development be play an active role in nature recovery and expand the protect site network by designate more significant and rare natural habitat such as ancient woodland and chalk stream 
 my point be about the urgency of delivery because urgency be lack in the implementation of positive action the oep state that the rate of tree planting need to increase substantially to achieve woodland creation goal meanwhile long await major initiative such as a uk chemical strategy and land use framework   and the national action plan on the sustainable use of pesticide as well as the ban on the sale of horticultural peat and the reintroduction of specie such as the beaver be delay 
 i say a big thank you to the hon lady for her excellent speech this be clearly something that she be passionate about and have be for a long time do she agree that tree planting be hugely important tree be part of our biodiversity but they also give life to we and i celebrate the work that harlow council do in plant tree across harlow 
 i applaud the fantastic work be   do in harlow to increase the number of tree they be indeed life enhance and valuable self contain ecosystem 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for have engage with i about her bill she share with i the frustration she have have in discuss its content with the government can we get to the key issue here she talk about urgency but be it true that the government be intent on kick the bill into the long grass because they do not want to be see to be oppose it yet they do not really support it 
 that be not my interpretation of the government ’s position and we have have some fruitful conversation 
 i shall move on briefly to the climate while sector in climate power and greenhouse gas removal be on course to meet or even exceed the require emission reduction significant challenge remain in agriculture and land use transport and heat and building 
 some have query the urgency or indeed the need to reduce emission from fossil fuel but do my hon friend not agree that with people in somerset alone estimate to die early from air pollution accord to public health england there be other reason why we urgently need to reduce carbon emission 
 i wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend that we can not go wrong in move away from fossil fuel give the implication for air quality as well as for the climate i call on the government to commit significant additional funding to support farmer in environmental delivery on the least productive agricultural land 
 transport have the big gap of all sector between confirm policy and the emission reduction need we need to improve public transport reduce bus fare increase provision for walking and cycling and decarbonise the freight sector 
 much more need to be do on building and clean heat too in the budget the chancellor pledge an initial £ towards household energy efficiency and heat decarbonisation but the current warm home plan fall short of the pace and scale need a strong future home standard need to be introduce this year mandate technology such as solar photovoltaic as per the new homes solar generation bill the sunshine bill introduce by my gloucestershire neighbour my hon friend   the member for cheltenham max wilkinson 
 i commend the hon member for what she be do with the bill when talk about the future of housing and property we often focus on energy and water do she agree that it be important to focus on rainwater harvesting and what can be do in that sense too 
 i very much agree with the hon gentleman that the right thing to do be to be much more intelligent in our use of water which will reduce the demand for clean water and reduce run off from rainfall which be become increasingly heavy as climate change kick in 
 the most significant addition that the climate and nature bill would make to the exist strategy be its join up approach of the word in its title perhaps the most important be and many people be aware that a change climate be damage nature the wildfire in california this year have claim million of tree and thousand of home we see expand desert melt ice cap and british moorland on fire we see natural cycle get out of sync so that newly hatch bird insect and amphibian no long find their favourite food available when they need they 
 we be less aware of how the loss of nature the cutting down of forest the warming of the ocean and intensive agriculture affect climate it be a way relationship forest ocean and soil be some of our most effective ally for natural carbon capture and sequestration healthy soil along with tree re wiggled river and water meadow help to mitigate flooding and run off which be on the increase with ever more intense rainfall nature ’s ability to perform this moderate role and regulate climate be be compromise by the rate at which we be destroy it we be damage nature ’s capacity to self regulate by kill reduce pollute and compromise natural ecosystem activity such as deep sea mining threaten to make extinct specie that we have not even discover yet specie that we may day find to be enormously useful to humanity 
 we often hear that the uk be of the most nature deplete country in the world nature deplete be a rather sterile phrase what do it actually mean many of the alarming stat on nature use as a baseline just a couple of year after i be bear i remember a time when if we put bread out on the back lawn within a minute dozen of starling would be squabble over the crust i can not even remember the last time i see a starling 
 head off on holiday in my father ’s triumph we would have to stop while he clean squashed insect off the windscreen we do not have to do that any more we often see hedgehog okay they be mostly squash on the road because it turn out that a fear response of curl up in a ball be not all that effective when the threat be an oncoming car but i ask you madam deputy speaker and the house when do you last see a hedgehog the collapse in the hedgehog population be not entirely due to roadkill they lose their habitat their source of food and their ability to range and forage as woodland be cut down and urban garden be fence in 
 if the half of my life perhaps the third on a less optimistic estimate have see such huge damage inflict on our natural world i hope that in the rest of my life i will see nature put well back on   the path to recovery of my team member be expect a baby in may and i would like to commit to poppy ’s future daughter that by the time she be year old we will have halt the degradation of nature and that at least of land and coastal water will be protect i would like to promise that unborn little girl that by the time she be we will have reverse nature loss and will be live in harmony with nature as state in the global biodiversity framework 
 i thank my hon friend on behalf of those on the liberal democrat benches for her truly impassioned speech and for her work on the bill chichester harbour have lose of its saltmarsh since the equivalent of football pitch every year do she agree that that need to stop today to ensure that that national landscape and site of special scientific interest be protect for generation to come 
 i thank my hon friend for her intervention i know chichester harbour well and absolutely agree that this be vital work 
 there be hope nature be enormously resilient and have an amazing capacity to regenerate when we give it a chance the royal society for the protection of birds appropriately name hope farm have demonstrate that food production can coexist with benefit to wildlife breed bird population there increase by over a year period we need to encourage people to get involve a new kind of land army work together for nature we need to unlock the local knowledge energy and passion for nature that i see every day in my constituency of south cotswolds i be sure every hon member in the chamber have see it regardless of whether their constituency be rural or urban 
 of my especially passionate constituent jonathan whittaker put together the shroud for nature an art piece make of double bedsheet cover with heartfelt message about the climate and nature bill i have choose a few of those message to read out today they be 
 care for the planet not just for this generation but the next one it ’ your responsibility to make sure i have a home i be year old 
 we all come from nature by destroy it we be destroy ourselves 
 when will those in power listen and commit no nature no us 
 and 
 what you do today will change my life forever 
 that be from william who be year old they continue 
 we have the solution we have the skill be we willing to make the change 
 and 
 leave politic aside make change for humankind 
 now we have a little poem dedicate to the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs 
 secretary of state steve reed do we a good deed 
 order i appreciate that the hon lady be quote from a poem but we do not refer   to right hon and hon member by name in the chamber can we please ensure that the courtesy of the house be observe 
 thank you madam deputy speaker as the poem will no long rhyme i shall move on to its half it continue 
 make the power pay and make the water clean for our play 
 i have well skip the next quote too as it refer to the prime minister rather too directly i hope that the next line will not get i into further trouble 
 we bloom elect you listen to we 
 to end on a more positive note 
 you have a chance to do something important and good so do it 
 back on to safe ground i would like to conclude with a few word about why this bill matter so much to i personally after i have my environmental wake up call year ago i want to find a way to draw attention to my environmental message for reason well know to myself it seem like a good idea at the time to embark on a series of massive ocean crossing alone in a rowboat use my expedition as a campaigning platform to get my message across through blog social medium podcast talk and book 
 for year i ride solo across ocean the atlantic pacific and indian at the risk of state the obvious it be really really hard i spend up to month alone at sea row for hour a day what keep i go be my sense that our environmental crisis be literally the most important issue on the face of the planet 
 i learn a lot on the ocean and i would like to share insight that be relevant here the earth be surprisingly small i manage to row across a large portion of it at something less than walk speed in just day and night this small blue dot be now have to support of we and our ever increasingly materialistic lifestyle with all the extraction pollution and waste that entail 
 secondly nature be incredibly powerful there be nothing quite like be alone in a metre rowboat in the middle of a storm to make that very apparent we may think we have nature tame but we do not the recent wildfire flood and other not so natural disaster have make that very clear even movie star wealth have not be enough to save home from the flame as a species we have only be on this earth for the blink of an eye but we have transform it out of all recognition we have gobble our way through its resource in a way that be by any definition unsustainable there be law of human and there be law of nature whether or not the bill make it into human law for sure the law of nature will ultimately prevail 
 thirdly on my journey i see the human face of climate change when i stop at the republic of kiribati on my way across the pacific i have a lengthy conversation with the president with only point of land more than foot above sea level his island nation face existential risk later that year i see he at cop15 in copenhagen just as the talk have fall apart year later we be still not on track to save the republic of kiribati how would we feel if our island nation where we be bear where we have grow up and where our ancestor be bury be about to disappear beneath the wave 
 the bill be about more than target and strategy it be a covenant with the natural world and with future generation it be our promise to threaten specie like the turtle dove the hazel dormouse and the red squirrel to the black poplar the paperbark maple and the star magnolia to the european eel the atlantic salmon and the arctic char that we will not abandon they to extinction 
 take bold action on climate and nature be the good way for the government to demonstrate true global leadership and do what be right know that in the long run the cost of inaction be far far great than the cost of action be we willing today to do what be require in the long term rather than what be expedient in the short term be we willing to do not what be politically possible but what be scientifically necessary to ensure a future for our planet the choice be ours and the time be now let we be the generation who choose to save our natural world not the generation who stand by and watch it die 
 nature know no border it do not recognise our political division it be time to write a new chapter in our nation ’s story where we finally understand that in save climate and nature we save ourselves 
 i invite my colleague to look up at my young friend in the gallery look they in the eye and show they we be willing to do the right thing for their future i commend this bill to the house 
 i thank   the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage the promoter of the bill for the hard work that she have do to get to this point it have i believe be a baptism of fire i be sure many people across the house would like to thank she for what she have do to get the bill back before the house once again i also thank the hour campaign or the climate and nature bill campaign as it be sometimes call and all my constituent who have not give i pause to breathe in tell i to get here today once again to vote for the bill i be sure many other member have experience that too 
 do the hon gentleman not think that the member who before they come to this house campaign in support of the bill and agree to vote for it should be present today to vote for it 
 we all understand that it can be difficult for member to come to the house on thursdays and fridays we need to spend time in our constituency and many people also have family commitment i would not for want to stand here and judge anyone for what they may have go on in their personal life or in their constituency however i know that most member across the house care deeply and passionately about this subject and be here if they can be i know that many could not be here today for good reason some have sickness and some have other commitment i be sure that all member present today will make fantastic contribution and that those who can not be here be still root for the bill and will be punch the air at their tv screen 
 many of we have have constituent come to we on this matter and the bill have make many headline reason be that it be emblematic of the shortfall that   people feel there be between the political ambition and the on the ground delivery that we all know need to happen people may be critical of my government and some of the thing they have do in their month i may come on to that in a minute i would say though that they be do a lot well than the government who come before that is i accept a low bar in fact it be so low i would have difficulty limboe under it none the less that be the bar and we be do well than the previous government i think many labour members understand that we have far more to do there be much more to do and a lot far to go and i believe this government will do it there will be a debate and a discussion and i will be part of that as i be sure will many member on the government benches and across the house 
 we can not get away from the fact that there be grow concern in this country and across the world about what be happen to the natural world today we have a weather bomb off our coast which be something i have never hear of before in all my something year we all know in our heart that that have come about because of the climate and ecological crisis we know that we be see this kind of thing more and more often we understand that we may be head into a dystopian future where food and water crisis become more and more frequent we can already see the impact of climateflation as economist be now call it the stubborn inflation where the basic staple of life such as food and water increasingly become more costly many people be increasingly be price out of be able to buy the basic food staple they need that also have an impact on central bank and the political and economic obligation we have give they to tackle inflation 
 we have this stubborn inflation that will not go away and we can not seem to get growth in our economy this be the climate crisis this be what it look like we be warn about it by stern decade ago but it be here now we need to do something about it in fact we need to do a lot about it interruption   the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew   be chuntere away he be more than welcome to make an intervention if he wish if he do not i will continue 
 we understand the situation the hon member for south cotswolds outline very clearly brilliantly in fact the scale of the challenge before we the fact be that of the biodiversity in this country have be completely obliterate we be of the most denude country in the world when it come to biodiversity and wildlife i believe of the few country ahead of we be singapore which have of the natural world leave that be on the edge the tipping point of ecological collapse and we be not far behind we should be on and we be on we need to improve we need to move ourselves we need to act the bill can help we do that 
 i want to talk about something that we in this place still do not quite get the interconnectedness between climate and nature the hon member for south cotswolds discuss that very well and i want to tease it out a bit far many of we now see tackle the climate crisis as an economic opportunity i understand that and there be a lot of mileage in it however it be quite possible to tackle the climate crisis to build solar farm and wind farm and do all the thing that decarbonise yet still kill the biodiversity of the planet it be entirely   possible to do both now that many of we in this place understand the climate crisis we have to ensure that we also understand the nature and biodiversity crisis 
 in my constituency of norwich south we have something call the western link which be a massive road that be go to go through an ancient woodland 
 i do not want to give the hon member a lesson in geography but he will recognise that the western link road be in my constituency and not his 
 obviously i like to expand the border of norwich south as far as possible i will caveat that by say that it be a big issue in my constituency and many of my constituent will use that road if it be ever build which hopefully it will not be i have oppose it as have many people and it may no long be build because of public pressure that example be instructive because we be tell that if we want economic growth in norfolk it be necessary to build the road 
 i be invite down to the ancient woodland and yes there be bat there i know that the propose carbon offsetting would have mean the planting of ten of thousand of new sapling to replace the ancient woodland which would have ensure that the carbon sequestration take place and that we could still hit our climate target however i go down there and see a flint axe head i see an ancient oak woodland that have be there for ten of thousand possibly hundred of thousand of year the complex biodiversity that be there the insect the bird the mycelium network underneath the ground be beautiful i could feel how old it be and it be go to be bulldoze over and replace with ten of thousand of sapling somewhere else in norfolk 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 no i will make some progress 
 at that point i understand that it be entirely possible for we to hit our climate target as we rip up and destroy a or year old woodland at that moment i realise that i could never allow the road to be build we can look at the amazon forest and campaign about what should not be happen there but what about our own backyard there be a question for the government my government or any government about growth what kind of growth do we want no be answer that question do we want sustainable growth what be growth about what be we grow be we grow pollution in our river be we grow road that go through ancient woodland yes that be growth but be it the growth we want do we not want to see growth in well pay adult social care or renewable technology do we not want to see growth in rewilding or sustainable farming those be the area where i want to see economic growth i do not want to see growth that come at the cost of my daughter and her generation ’s future that be the kind of decision that we in this country and this government have to make 
 i be afraid to say that we can not have growth on a dead planet politician need to understand that for too long we have not we can not pick growth out of the air   and say biodiversity will come in place climate will come after they be all interlink we can not have a viable economy unless the climate and nature of our country and the economy be work well together in unity and in synthesis that be what need to happen 
 i agree with the hon member ’s point about the kind of growth we want do he agree that if the government be to proceed with expand luton airport as rumour suggest that would fly in the face of advice from the government ’s own climate expert and economist who say that it would not deliver the kind of growth that airport expansion use to deliver 
 i thank the hon lady for her intervention and that be a great pun—“fly in the face this decision have not be take i for do not believe that it be compatible to have expansion of aviation at these airport london which have already be agree luton gatwick and heathrow 
 choice need to be make here many of my constituent can not afford to fly everyone want to see their constituent benefit from the economy and if we go down that path of expansion we will be head in the wrong direction there will be many member on both the government and the opposition benches who do not want to see that i believe that expand heathrow be incompatible with have a genuine approach to biodiversity and climate the climate change committee have already state before we even get to the carbon budget that this should not happen we will need to have a very hard honest conversation about that i do not think it should happen 
 i pay tribute to   the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage   for bring forward the bill and to all the academic and campaigner behind it listen to the debate i think the point we need to draw out be that we need robust scrutiny and we need to be able to hold government to account through tight mechanism do my hon friend agree that it be crucial that the mechanism in the bill be expedite to ensure that government get on with achieve the target that we have all be talk about 
 i thank my hon friend for that contribution and indeed for the work she have do on climate and nature throughout her political career of course i agree everyone understand that in government there be pressure on ministers there be pressure from the treasury from business and from vested interest many of they big and powerful with big pr and the ability to lobby ministers in way that our constituent can not and in way that nature can not squirrel bat and newts can not lobby like blackrock and other who want economic growth and profit this need to be lock in and legislate for that be what the bill be all about 
 there be organisation and individual billionaire who have benefit very much from the last or year of rapacious growth and wealth building 
 will my hon friend give way 
 i need to conclude because i believe other member want to take part 
 we have to understand that there be people who have do very well from this growth the problem with growth be this when we get gdp growth in unequal society and we bulldoze over beautiful woodland forest and expand airport 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 i will make progress 
 when we get that gdp growth in deeply unequal society it be those in the top or top who accrue the benefit a working class woman in of the brexit debate and i be a remainer be tell you ’ve never have it so good you ’ve have growth of or for so many year she stand up and say but that ’s your growth not our growth this be what i be talk about 
 if we want a sustainable economy and sustainable biodiversity and if we want to protect nature and ensure that future generation have somewhere to live and have food security and water security we need to ensure that this bill or something like it become law we need to ensure that labour member do the right thing for climate and nature it be what our constituent want to see 
 i congratulate   the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage   on her good fortune in have secure a place in the ballot and be able to introduce a bill that i believe will be very important i be proud to be a sponsor of it it be deeply flawed in place we all know that i have be in this place for quite a long time and i know of no private member ’s bill that be perfect when it start its journey however i hope and believe that it will receive a reading if it come to a vote i shall most certainly support it 
 old man can bore for britain as the grandfather of the house i be probably just as capable of that as anybody else in this place 
 i would like to put it on the record that the right hon gentleman be not bore the house 
 give i time young man 
 at the risk of go down that path i should like to take a short ramble down memory lane i be bring up in poole in dorset my grandparent house have a lilac tree in the garden in flower it be smother in red admiral peacock tortoiseshell and all manner of butterfly at night the garden be full of moth these day we be lucky if we see a cabbage white 
 the little house that we live in be on the edge of poole park lake i play in the park daily i use to pluck conker from under the tree during the season for it i see stag beetle in abundance hedgehog which we have hear refer to roam free out in the hill alongside cerne abbas in dorset i walk along country path where my father and i see fox vole stoat weasel rabbit and up in the sky bird of prey feed on they where be they now the world wildlife fund say that in the past year well within my lifetime   but sadly not within the lifetime of most albeit not all hon member present our wildlife have be deplete by 
 as a poole member i recognise those place will the right hon gentleman join i in congratulate dorset on be of the only place in the country that have turn around the depletion of nature thank to people like mark and mo constantine we be restore osprey and other bird of prey to our wonderful county 
 with great respect to the hon lady who be fortunate to represent a beautiful place the poole that i know be not the poole that she now know not even in the town never mind in the countryside although or place such as branksea island to give it its proper name may have improve the overgrowth be take down about year ago in a fire a lot of our national habitat have nevertheless be lose that be the point that i be try to make 
 i be bless with grandchild additionally i have surrogate ukrainian grandchild and infant florence the daughter of of my dear young friend whom i care about passionately i want they to be able to grow up in at least some of the world that i know and to enjoy the natural environment that i enjoy that be why i be stand here today i have no other reason sadly i believe that a lot of that be at risk 
 the planning change that have be partially announce this week i assume that there will in due course be a further statement to the house seek effectively to abolish the right to judicial review in my constituency national grid be plan to build a monstrosity foot high and the size of football pitch on the thanet marsh which it have just discover be wet immediately adjacent to a site of special scientific interest if build it will indeed be a monstrosity and will be accompany by a string of high power high voltage pylon if we be deny the right to challenge that to whom do we look for redress in the future 
 like the last government this government be subsidise drax to the tune of billion of pound for why to transport million of tree felled and ship across the atlantic at god know what carbon cost to burn in the interest of some sort of future carbon free fuel which of course it be not why be we allow this and why be we pay for it 
 those who oppose the bill which as i have already mention be flawed and will need to be amend have describe it as ideological rhetoric an assault on our individual freedom and a direct threat to our way of life that will lead to food rationing constituent write to i to say that only of our food be produce naturally why should we be dependent on import the other the answer to that i be afraid now lie with the government ’s house building policy if the planner have their way acre of farmland in thanet that be now produce this year grade agricultural wheat from which bread be make will in a couple of year time be grow house not food the national farmers union have say please do not undermine uk agriculture by import agricultural product produce to environmental standard that be different from ours here 
 a couple of week ago i be visit a friend in thanet who allow i to hold a facsimile of part of the skull of a tyrannosaurus rex the tooth be about inch to a foot long those beast that rule the earth have be extinct for million of year we be supremely arrogant if we believe that drill baby drill be the answer if we believe that we have a right someone who write to i describe it as a god give right to carbon fuel 
 a couple of week ago there be an exhibition in the house organise by helping rhinos which seek to defend the black rhino and someone who attend make the case that the black rhino could outlive the human race we be about to become if we do not listen today the author of our own demise and that be why i believe that the bill deserve at the very least a reading 
 from old fogey to another i presume i have never enjoy a speech by   the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale   as much as the he have just deliver he do not bore the house in any way 
 i pay tribute to   the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage   for introduce the bill it have have a very long gestation involve many member on both side of the house but it be good that it have cross party support indeed the thing i want to focus on be the importance of cross party support these issue have cross party support in the house for many year follow the climate change act and that continue until about that be tremendously important in the progress that not only we but the world be able to make people see that it be possible for parliament to come together and do thing that be consider radical to tackle climate change latterly unfortunately that consensus have break down somewhat and it be important it be the duty of all member of the house to try to repair that consensus and to build on it unless we do we will face the sort of future that the hon lady and the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich outline 
 i be conscious that many people want to speak in the debate so i will pick up quickly on just issue in the bill clause 2(2 state 
 the strategy must include annual interim target consistent with the achievement of the objective 
 those objective be the climate and nature target and it be great that the bill make the link between the that be fundamentally important however i want to counsel against annual target in this regard as we know it be well document in the oep report that the hon lady refer to as well as in the climate change committee ’s report there be natural fluctuation annually in what happen around we sometimes that be because of the el niño effect and sometimes it be for other reason nobody in the house will be more familiar with the el niño effect on the ocean than the hon lady it be important that we understand that sometimes an annual target to be consistent with the year target and the overall long term target will look like it be go backwards we need to look at that very carefully in the bill 
 another issue i want to pick up on be clause on the establishment of the climate and nature assembly in the last parliament select committees come together to convene a people ’s assembly on the climate that be a wonderful moment for the house because instead of our tell the people this be what you have to do the people be tell we this be what we want you to do on our behalf it be really important that that take place and it be great that the hon lady have include that measure in the bill 
 i gently point out however that the climate assembly disagree with some of the thing that the committee on climate change tell we be essential to do the figure in the clause be actually quite a low threshold sometimes the report from the climate assembly be clear that people be not prepared to go as far as the committee on climate change and other nature organisation such as the joint nature conservation committee believe be imperative on who be in charge there be a failure to connect thing up because the clause say that if something be recommend by of the assembly it must be include in the strategy we will need to go through those area in serious detail 
 finally it be important that the bill talk about the impact of climate biodiversity and nature on each other i pick up on what the right hon member for herne bay and sandwich the grandfather of the house as he style himself say about drax we be go down the wrong road with drax i understand the reason why drax power station provide of uk electricity in the power sector it see as an important area so the question be if we take it away how will we fill it but we can not allow the damage to old growth and to virgin forest that we know be happen in canada more than that as have be say by the noble lord birt who have also see some of the whistleblower account as i have those account make it clear that the ofgem investigation be correct in say that the sustainability of the feedstock have be not only misreporte but deliberately misreporte that mean that the people concern in drax be not fit and proper to run the company and we should not be pay they at the moment—£9 we have now to decide whether we will subsidise that even far the impact on biodiversity be disastrous and although they say it be renewable it be not within the timeframe to meet the climate target it be salient that the previous secretary of state after she cease to be the secretary of state say we know all along that this be not sustainable if that be the case perhaps she should have do something when she be secretary of state but it be this government who must now act to ensure that no further subsidy be pay to drax 
 i rise in support of the bill as a co sponsor i congratulate   the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage   for not just introduce the bill but the way in which she introduce it echo   the hon member for brent west barry gardiner i congratulate my right hon friend   the member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale   on what be a truly outstanding speech 
 as a number of people have reference we only have temporary hold of our planet so let ’s start with a good old biblical quote genesis 3:19 
 for dust you be and to dust you shall return 
 we have only the light of step on our planet and we need to remind ourselves of that the arrogance that as the apex specie we have take on our shoulder the idea that we can do anything and some brainbox somewhere will find a way of ameliorate or attenuate it at some point so it do not matter should be part of historical political thinking in that respect   the hon member for norwich south clive lewis   be absolutely correct 
 i want to speak to my colleague and my party and to those who would describe themselves as centre right in the political spectrum conservative conserve we be and have be champion of a notion of hand thing on to successor generation that must mean in today ’s parlance not just physical capital of pound shilling and penny and of asset but natural capital my party have a proud and innovative track record on these issue it be geoffrey howe ’s early 1980 budget in response to the issue of acid rain that through the carrot and stick policy seek to make unleaded petrol cheap than star thereby drive people another pun i be afraid to have catalytic converter my noble friend john gummer introduce the landfill tax and the hypothecate environmental tax in our country it be a conservative government who introduce the wildlife and countryside act and a conservative government who put through the environment act of and the clean air act be introduce by a conservative government excellent work be do by former colleague in this house such as michael gove rebecca pow and other who take these issue seriously make the case and we legislate 
 the right hon gentleman outline articulately how government legislation can make a positive difference to our environment do he agree that as well as a relentless focus on housing target we should also have target for amenity and for nature and green space so that we can achieve lot of objective and support the aim of the bill 
 the hon gentleman be right and i want to echo the point raise by the hon member for south cotswolds i note the word or but i like the word and indeed i will share with the house that i be on a particularly stringent january diet it be slightly work i think but there be still a long way to go ask any member of my family and they would say now simon would you like custard or cream and my eyebrow would shoot up at the word or as i much prefer and the hon lady be right climate and nature be side of the same coin and have a close interwoven symbiotic relationship 
 i say to   the hon member for didcot and wantage olly glover   in response to his intervention again echo the hon member for norwich south that of course we must have growth but too often the didact from both side of the debate say that it be either or we can either have a biodiverse natural environment and address climate change or we can have growth but we can not have both well it depend on what type and kind of policy we pursue when address co2 emission and the drive to net but also on what    type of growth have it must be a legitimate anxiety but i be pretty confident that many people who elect the labour party into government believe that they would get that fact that the definition of growth need to be reset in order to meet the challenge that we now face 
 the budget i shall be charitable do not quite land as the chancellor of the exchequer hop or expect and some of the economic indicator be not point in the direction that any government would like to see i hope it will not fall on deaf ear the ministers on the front bench have a long and respected track record in address these issue when they sit on the opposition benches which i hope they will continue now that they sit on the treasury bench i hope that in order to prove this to people who be anxious about economic growth and the fact that there do not appear to be very much it will not be foot to the floor growth of any type anywhere in order just to nudge the figure it have to be the right kind of growth and sustainability have to be at its heart 
 as my right hon friend the member for herne bay and sandwich ask be this bill perfect no and i do not think that the hon member for south cotswolds would claim perfection my right hon friend say that he have never see a private member ’s bill that be perfect and beyond amendment i have to say to he that in my nearly year in this place i have yet to see a government bill that could be describe as perfect and without the possibility of improvement by amendment 
 i say to my right hon and hon friend let we not sacrifice the good in pursuit of the excellent we have to make progress be many of the issue address by the bill difficult yes but what do we all usually say to our child thing which be difficult be usually much more worthwhile seeking to attain than the easy low hang fruit will the bill come with cost let we be frank we must all be conscious that we have come through or be come through a cost of living crisis and inflation have erode people ’s ability to spend and fuel cost be high but to those who simplistically say well we can not afford to do this now be not the right time in the economic cycle i say with the great of politeness if not now when i do not believe that we can afford not to do this failure to do so would be the long suicide note in history for our specie 
 on our coastline there be place that be build below sea level think of canvey island so this be not just something that be happen elsewhere about which we should be slightly anxious but not at all concern rise sea level and other change will affect we here at home as well we need to be careful in our consideration of that for those who claim a drive concern about the need to control immigration i say in all sincerity that i do not believe that can divorce from that address the change to our planet that climate change be introduce as it will be a major spur for fellow member of our specie to pack up their belonging meagre or otherwise and try to find a place of safety for themselves and their family where they be able to grow a bit of food and sustain their lifestyle meagre as they may be 
 to those who say hang on a moment our emission be not too bad and we ’ve get to look to china and everybody else i say pollution do not respect   international boundary it move on the tide and the wind we have lull ourselves into a false sense of security because in essence we have export the production of many of our commodity need desire and want overseas we have say look our manufacturing emission have go down but the production of those product be still create emission elsewhere there be some noble aim in the bill that we should think about 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 to my neighbour from west dorset of course 
 i thank my dorset neighbour for give way as always i find myself agree with a lot of what he say not least on the cost of inaction be far great than the cost of action he make many good point about the fact that we have outsource our carbon emission to place far away but do he agree that we often fail to sell the opportunity around tackle climate change especially for british business such as those provide by tidal and wave technology we should celebrate those opportunity the government talk about growth there be so much opportunity for growth in this sector and we should do more 
 this be get rather worrying because i agree with the hon gentleman either he be do harm to his political career or i be do harm to what might be leave of mine i shall leave it to my hon friend the shadow deputy chief whip to jot that down in his little red book 
 i find uk manufacturing really strange in this respect because the trajectory of policy for the past several year have be very clear we be not try to make our petrol combustion engine go fast we be try to make electric vehicle more reliable less costly travel far and so on why have uk plc manufacturing not grab hold of that as a industrial revolution and lead the way in the way that our forefather do at the start of the industrial revolution we have to look to private equity and other to invest 
 i be pleased to see an investment in a solar farm in my constituency i visit the site to see where it be all go to go and how it be go to plug in and i ask if you break down a solar panel where do the component part come from not a single component have be manufacture in the united kingdom they have come from about different country the only thing that we have do be assemble they i say to our entrepreneur and our leader of industry and commerce that we be well than that we be not just assembler we be maker and innovator we be an island race that have work on free trade and export value idea and product across the surface of the globe this be a time for we to lead in the export of actual hard power and drive forward an international alliance on these important issue 
 will my hon friend give way 
 dorset be well represent this morning i will of course give way to my hon friend the member for christchurch 
 my hon friend have not mention china specifically but china be still intent on increase its co2 emission until at least as a result it be able to compete unfairly with what would be uk enterprise if we have not put a stranglehold on it with all these regulatory restriction how do he expect to deal with the issue of china 
 let i respond to my hon friend by quote of his great political hero the noble lord cameron of chipping norton just because we can not do good everywhere that do not mean we can not do a little bit of good here i understand the point that my hon friend make of course we have to be conscious of cost differential production cost and all the rest of it but i say to he respectfully that if the rest of the world do something that be to the good and or country decide not to or go at a slow pace or on a different path i do not believe we should just stop shrug throw it up in the air and say oh well if not everybody ’ do it why the hell should we we lead the abolition of slavery nobody else be do it we do it because we think it be right we introduce factory act nobody else be do it we do it because we think it be right we introduce vote for woman interruption not i personally i be not as old as my hon friend i have just have a hard life 
 we have lead it be what the united kingdom do we be not a nation that follow we be a nation that sculps lead form challenge cajole and encourage 
 will the hon member give way 
 the hon lady need encouragement she have get it 
 i rarely need much encouragement the hon member be make an impassioned speech about the fact that this country have lead and it can continue to lead in this area he talk about hard power do he agree with i and my liberal democrat colleague that if our country be to be well than just assemble part we need urgently to rip up the red tape that be stop so many of our home grow manufacturer build the climate technology of the future because of the trade barrier that exist with our eu neighbour 
 the hon lady be push at an open door there be much merit in the trade and co operation agreement that we have with the european union that should never have be see as an event it should be an evolutionary process respond to event in a pragmatic and sensible way while always maintain the integrity of the result of the brexit referendum she and i be on the same side in that debate we lose and we now have to play the hand of card that we have be deal 
 i have receive email describe i as a dangerous radical and a stalinist i have be call many thing in my time but a stalinist dangerous radical be new to i my north dorset constituency be about square mile of which only be build upon the rest be open farmland hill land ancient woodland and so on 
 i have hop that i might have be able to finish my speech by now madam deputy speaker but i be just get into the romantic prose i notice that the clock   stand at am and i understand that you want the statement to be give at am i be now in just a minute talk down the clock without hesitation repetition or deviation 
 proceeding interrupt standing order no 11(4 
 it be almost a shame to interrupt the flow of   the hon member for north dorset simon hoare with permission madam deputy speaker i would like to update the house on an important development relate to our royal navy submarine fleet that will boost national security and economic growth and deliver saving to the taxpayer 
 this morning my right hon friend the defence secretary be visit the rolls royce nuclear skill academy site in derby to announce our new unity contract with rolls royce submarine unity be worth around £ over year and as its name imply bring together contract into cover the research design manufacture and in service support of the nuclear reactor that power the current and plan royal navy submarine fleet which help to keep the nation and our ally safe 
 this be the big contract that rolls royce have ever have with the uk ministry of defence the contract will help rolls royce to operate in a more integrated and efficient way drive efficiency reduce waste save more than £ and deliver on the government ’s commitment to provide value for money for the taxpayer it will ensure that our committed submariner who alongside their family sacrifice so much to keep we all safe can continue to protect we around the clock every minute of every day 
 not only be this new deal a boost for our national security but it underpin the government ’s triple lock guarantee to our continuous at sea nuclear deterrent and our important aukus defence and security partnership with the united states of america and australia by enable the development of our next generation ssn aukus nuclear power conventionally armed submarine 
 the unity contract be also a boost for british industry for the resilience of our defence supply chain and for job skill and economic growth in community in the east midland and across the country the unity deal will create more than new job sustain around skilled and well pay role in total the majority in derby but also around in glasgow and cardiff the deal will also help to deliver the next generation of skilled worker we need in our nuclear defence enterprise with the rolls royce nuclear skill academy offer apprenticeship each year unity also pave the way for the use of safe and more sustainable material in our fleet support the commitment make by defence to well environmental performance 
 the new contract with rolls royce an historic british industrial success story come as we consult industry partner and trade union on our new defence industrial strategy and as we seek to create a new partnership with government fit for our more uncertain age the government recognise not only that defence be critical for our national security but that it be a key driver for economic growth it make the uk more resilient through our defence industrial strategy we aim to strengthen the virtuous circle that connect a more resilient uk base defence sector and economic growth across the country that virtuous circle will enhance our   military capability and in turn make they more resilient which not only deter our enemy but act as an engine of growth for opportunity skill and well pay job across our devolved nation and region 
 by onshore and put british manufacture wherever it be in our national interest to do so we will build on the skilled british job currently sustain by mod expenditure deliver on the government ’s plan for change and our primary mission to kick start economic growth while simultaneously deliver on the duty of any government to keep their people safe 
 we in this house be all passionate about defence the defence of our nation should be too important for political point scoring and i hope we have a consensus on that it be in that spirit that we be consult on our strategic defence review so that we have a national plan for defence not just a labour plan for defence that will inform our path towards spend of gdp on defence in that spirit i thank my predecessor in the role the current shadow secretary of state for defence   the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge for the groundwork he put into this deal what he start we be finish 
 on wednesday the defence secretary update the house on the key role of our submarine fleet and the role it play in deterrence we all see it ward off the russian spy ship yantar from uk water we should be under no illusion this be just the late example of grow russian aggression target the uk and our nato ally in our increasingly dangerous world the uk ’s nuclear deterrent be our ultimate insurance policy that protect our freedom and our way of life 
 this deal underpin that insurance policy for the next year as we begin to phase in our new fleet of dreadnought nuclear power and nuclear arm submarine this deal also foreshadow a bright future for the uk defence sector guide by our defence industrial strategy which will make we more secure and prosperous at home and strong abroad i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the right hon lady not only for early sight of her statement but for her kind word in recognise my contribution to deliver this deal unity by name and by nature as with the annington deal and the uk germany barrel make deal i can safely say that this deal be profoundly to the benefit of our country while i would have dearly love to conclude those deal while in office it be well that such deal be deliver under any government than not at all and i be delighted to be respond to the statement today 
 while it be unusual to have statement on a sitting friday i thank the government for announce this deal to the house today because it speak to its huge importance to our national interest before explain why the deal be so important may i thank all those involve in bring it forward those at the ministry of defence and the royal navy and in particular the commercial team who have work so hard to iron out   all the complex detail need to get it over the line and of course rolls royce itself on that note i thank everyone in the defence nuclear enterprise and as the right hon lady say we give particular thank as we always should to those who crew our nuclear submarine and in particular the continuous at sea deterrent 
 my personal experience i be sure the right hon lady will have discover this in the many international engagement in the export role that be so important to any ministry of defence procurement be that rolls royce be the single uk defence company possibly only match by bae that seem to have great success in penetrate major export market visit raynesway last april to keep this project move forward i see the sheer scale of rolls royce ’s commitment to apprenticeship and manufacturing excellence that underline how it be a domestic and international industrial success story for uk plc and we should do everything possible to support it the deal be economically crucial help sustain our sovereign defence nuclear industry as the right hon lady say and in turn sustain thousand of skilled job 
 i be strike while speak to apprentice at both barrow and raynesway that of particular appeal to they be the assurance of a long term career pathway today ’s announcement will underwrite not just a major corporate investment but the life plan of thousand of young people and i wish they all well skill remain a challenge give the sheer scale of the nuclear undertaking so will the right hon lady update we on how she be take forward the work of the pan civil and defence nuclear skill taskforce which i launch together with the then civil nuclear minister my hon friend   the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie in august 
 this deal clearly build on the good work do by the previous conservative government who always back our armed force our continuous at sea nuclear deterrent and our defence industrial base and who bring the mighty aukus partnership to life with the us and australia can the right hon lady provide further detail on her very welcome confirmation that this deal will underpin aukus 
 in talk about the economic importance of this announcement we should also be clear about its military significance the right hon lady be right to refer to the secretary of state ’s statement on wednesday regard the russian spy ship yantar and its grey zone activity in our water and economic zone i say in response that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the government not just on ukraine but in stand up to the russian threat which i still regard as by far the most immediate and serious in term of the uk homeland i urge he to lean into be more open with the country about the russian threat while of course protect operational security so that the country can understand the nature of the treat and what it will inevitably mean for defence expenditure 
 the strategic defence review be expect in the spring and i hope that it will be publish as early as possible ideally in march but whenever it be it appear likely that there will be a particular focus on homeland security and missile defence that be entirely right but we must all understand a fact of military reality there be uk capability that matter above all in the kremlin and    that be our continuous at sea deterrent there be a strong argument for reinforce our conventional missile defence capability for the uk homeland but that be not what deter putin from strike our city rather it be our potential to retaliate for that reason we must continue to give absolute priority to the deterrent in our defence budget and that budget must be urgently increase whatever else be announce in the sdr i hope the right hon lady will confirm both that investment in our deterrent will remain central to all future plan and that we will hit during this parliament 
 while the deterrent be inevitably a multibillion pound undertaking it remain a way to guarantee our security for a fraction of overall public expenditure today have show that it also offer a huge economic return to the country underpin manufacturing excellence as such and give the threat that we face it have never be more vital that we continue to strengthen our defence nuclear enterprise 
 i find myself agree with a lot of what the shadow defence secretary say unity indeed he ask about i think we all agree that defence spending need to increase and he know well that we have just increase it by in real term this come year it be up by £ as a step on the way to get to which be a cast iron guarantee 
 the hon member refer to the strategic defence review which as he know we say will be come in the spring and that be still the plan he will have to wait a little long to see the precise detail of the threat that that identify and therefore the capability we need to develop 
 i think there be general agreement across the house about the danger of thing like the yantar incident which the secretary of state speak about on wednesday and we will all have note that it be deal with by of our nuclear submarine that reinforce the point that the hon member make about the importance of our deterrent 
 the contract that our defence secretary have announce at rolls royce in derby today be the big ministry of defence contract in its history it will make a major contribution to the long term investment in our city that i and neighbouring mp have be call for create job and protect more it be an investment not only in industry and nuclear but in the skill and expertise for which our city be famous do the minister agree that this represent a landmark deal for british defence 
 i thank my hon friend for make that point she know a lot about the subject and she be correct that it be a landmark deal it be particularly beneficial for derby as she say there be many skill there already but the nuclear skills academy will be create apprenticeship and opportunity a year for young people to get into nuclear skill of course those be transferable skill that be relevant not only on the military side but on the civil side which will give young people with those skill great opportunity in life that be of the most important part of the deal 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i welcome this announcement of the uk ’s new unity contract with rolls royce submarine this £ investment will create new job in the industry and this sort of investment represent a boost for not only our national security but community across the uk 
 it be right that we celebrate this success for british industry and its skilled workforce however while we welcome this development the government must go far to create the stability and certainty that business need to thrive long term growth require an industrial strategy that incentivise investment in ethical inclusive new technology such as artificial intelligence and clean energy we must position the uk as a global leader in these sector so that we tackle the climate crisis while create good job and drive economic growth 
 furthermore we urge the government to work in close partnership with business of all size small and medium sized enterprise be vital to the defence supply chain yet too often they be leave out of the major procurement process what be the government do to ensure that sme be include in the mod procurement process we also want to unlock british business global potential by bring down trade barrier and build strong relationship with our close trading partner include by fix our broken relationship with europe 
 universal liberal principle be at the core of what we believe as liberal democrats not least among they internationalism human right the pursuit of peace and the rule of law that be why we continue to champion the liberal rule base international order which provide a strong basis for multilateral co operation to address the world ’s big problem 
 the liberal democrats believe in a policy of pursue global disarmament however in the meantime and in the light of all the current threat we call on the government to maintain a minimum credible nuclear deterrent and maintain the current posture of continuous at sea deterrence 
 i urge the government to rebuild trust with our european ally our security be inseparable from europe ’s and we must work towards a uk eu defence and security agreement recent agreement with germany be promise but they must be a starting point for deep co operation what step be be take to strengthen the aukus partnership with the united states and australia particularly in the light of concern about potential shift in us foreign policy national security and economic growth 
 order the liberal democrat spokeswoman will be aware that she be allocate minute which she have already exceed significantly 
 i welcome the hon lady ’s support for the deal and for our continuous at sea deterrent that have not always be the liberal democrats position so i welcome the fact that consensus have increase in this house 
 the point that the hon lady make about enable sme to get involve in the defence supply chain be tremendously important we be currently consult on the defence industrial strategy and i be particularly keen to ensure we take step to make that well because   the potential for innovation agility and pull through of new technology be tremendous i invite she to contribute to the consultation and to watch out for the defence industrial strategy when it be publish 
 i very much welcome this statement as   the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire   say we need sme to support our defence sector of the key challenge face our defence sector as ukraine have show be that we need to speed up the pace of innovation in this new era face defence in stevenage we have many excellent sme support our local defence prime airbus and mbda will my right hon friend show her support for what sme be do and support they in the future 
 i completely agree with my hon friend ’s point which be that sme form a central part of our industrial base and can do more if we encourage and enable they to do so to boost our defence boost job and boost economic growth in all region and nation i invite he to get involve in our defence industrial strategy consultation which be ongoing 
 i welcome the unity contract and the work do by the previous government to initiate it it be a critical step in maintain our submarine fleet and facilitate our continuous at sea nuclear deterrence the minister recently confirm to i that exclude trident our defence spending as a percentage of gdp be actually only that put the uk of nato country below north macedonia montenegro albania and other our non nuclear nato partner currently spend proportionally more than we do on conventional force while trident be a measure of last resort to ensure that we be properly resource for high intensity multi domain collective defence should our nato spending commitment not be to meet that target on conventional force with our nuclear capability in addition to that 
 i be not sure that be even the policy of the conservative party the shadow defence secretary can confirm whether that be the case if i may say so it be a bit sleight of hand to say that take out a big chunk of our spending which we be actually spend will leave we well in deficit of course it would however i understand the point that the hon gentleman make and the importance he attach to spend on conventional defence that be an important point and once the strategic defence review be publish he will be able to see the threat it identify and how we will improve our capability to deal with they 
 i congratulate the government and rolls royce on their fantastic and innovative unity project as today ’s welcome announcement show defence be a fantastic pipeline for building skill and refine the job and growth that this country need that be feel and need nowhere more than in my constituency the home of the royal navy and of so many defence company be they national or sme alongside my hon friend   the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan i intend to hold a roundtable later this year on growth strategy   can the minister assure the house that the defence industrial strategy will have a focus on training and skill and will promote and prioritise british industry 
 i commend my hon friend for hold a roundtable i have do a few of those around the country lately it be quite illuminating to hear what come back particularly from small firm and it will be inform our defence industrial strategy i agree that there be much potential in all our constituency across the nation and region to get economic growth and job from boost sme 
 i very much welcome the minister ’s announcement but can she tell we where we be get to with the industrial strategy in utilise rolls royce ’s expertise to produce small modular reactor there seem to have be a lot of delay in actually deliver on those yet rolls royce have demonstrate by this contract that it be a lead global player in that field 
 i thank the hon gentleman for his question he be right that there be much innovation in the defence industry in our nation and often with dual use technology which mean that it be not just about defence but about a broad range of potential opportunity i see no reason why all those opportunity can not be exploit use our defence industrial strategy to kick thing off i hope to see that in future 
 as a former official of the gmb shipbuilding and ship repair union i warmly welcome today ’s announcement do the minister agree that an aim of the defence industrial strategy should be to open up opportunity for job and apprenticeship to people from disadvantaged community 
 i very much agree with my hon friend our defence industry be largely base outside of london and the south east and be in all our nation and region quite often they be focus already in area that have some deprivation my hon friend be right to identify that defence industry across our nation and region can be a part of regional development as well as boost national growth 
 the nuclear defence enterprise for the uk be an extortionate vanity project we would much rather the money be spend on conventional defence capability the minister state that the contract will drive efficiency to reduce waste and save over £ give that no major nuclear contract have ever come in under budget how do she expect this to happen on the job that will be split between cardiff and glasgow can she let we know when during the course of the contract these job will be deliver will it be at the end or early on and what will the split be between cardiff and glasgow 
 i open the centre in glasgow that have some of those job and i can assure the hon lady that it be well under way and although the cardiff centre be not quite up and run yet it soon will be so those job be already there i disagree with her point of course but that be fair enough i hope that she will see   the importance of manufacturing skill and job opportunity many of which have dual use application as indeed do the apprenticeship at rolls royce in derby there be nothing to suggest that the young people who obtain those nuclear qualification will not go and work on the civil side of nuclear in the future and even she ought to be able to see the importance of skille up young people and create job opportunity across the nation and region 
 i think we all want to live in a world where we do not need a nuclear deterrent but it be clear from some of the conflict we have see recently that that be not the world we currently live in do the minister agree that the duty of a government be to protect the country and will she welcome the work be do at raytheon which we both visit it seem a lifetime ago but it be actually only month ago to ensure that we be manufacture and produce defence system in house rather than rely on foreign import 
 i very much agree with what my hon friend have say and i fondly remember that visit to his constituency during i think the general election campaign defend the country be clearly the duty of any government my hon friend will have note from the statement of intent in respect of our defence industrial strategy that of our key aim be to build more in britain and to improve british job and economic growth through the money that we spend on our defence and i think that that be a win win 
 this deal be absolutely the right thing to do and i very much welcome the minister ’s commitment to our continuous at sea deterrent which have not always receive universal support on the labour benches my hon friend the shadow secretary of state ask the minister a very clear question about how she see this underpin the aukus deal for the long term but unless my hearing be even bad than i think i be not sure that she give a clear commitment in that regard may i give she another opportunity to make absolutely clear this government ’s commitment to aukus and this deal ’s central role in its long term future 
 i be attempt to answer a great many question from the shadow defence secretary and do not reach that so the hon gentleman be right to raise it with i again the deal enable we to boost production and the capacity that we need in order to deliver ssn aukus as a follow on from our dreadnought submarine without it we would be in much more difficulty in ensure that we can do everything that we need to do on time to deliver those commitment it be essential to the delivery of our aukus commitment as it be to the delivery of our own continuous at sea nuclear deterrent 
 like many people from gateshead i be proud to say that i come from a long line of people work in the defence manufacturing industry can the minister assure i that this deal and other defence manufacturing deal will benefit those in all the nation and region of the country especially gateshead 
 yes i can assure my hon friend of that this be the big deal that rolls royce have ever sign it be a long term commitment between the government and rolls royce it increase efficiency and resilience create job and make saving these be virtuous circle and if we can achieve they in other part of our defence spending they will benefit the entire nation and all the region within it 
 immediately before the minister come to the house we be debate environmental protection to secure our country and the future of our globe in the spirit of unity will the minister agree that there be little point in talk about environmental protection and security without also secure our world through robust defence spending there be nothing bad for the environment and humanity than war and we need to invest in defence in order to secure our globe and to secure this country 
 in the spirit of unity that pun be become a bit wear but i have just use it too i very much agree that the foundation of security and deterrence be a key part of we be able to advance as a nation without that security we can not secure any of our public service or our way of life 
 today ’s announcement will help deliver long term growth boost british industry and create and support thousand of skilled job can my right hon friend confirm that a key ambition of our defence industrial strategy will be to deliver job in every nation and region and indeed in small town such as rugby where ge vernova be do fine work to support the royal navy with advanced hybrid electric propulsion technology for the royal fleet auxiliary ’s frontline fleet 
 yes i can confirm that mod spending already support over job directly and many more besides and my hon friend have set out an example from his constituency the defence industrial strategy will aim to create job in every nation and region of this country 
 i thank the minister for a very positive statement it be always good to have positive statement and today be of those occasion it be great news to hear of the wonderful investment which be need to shore up not only defence but our manufacturing industry look at the job allocation i see that there be job for derby in england and for glasgow in scotland and cardiff in wales i have no doubt whatsoever about the minister ’s commitment to job creation but will she outline how the government will ensure that business and factory in northern ireland can be involve in the supply or provision of part particularly will she outline whether the skill of harland and wolff can be utilise in fulfilment of the contract and whether uk wide involvement be a stipulation of the deal with rolls royce 
 the hon gentleman as ever be fight for his constituent he make some good point about harland and wolff and skill we do have defence contract base at harland and wolff and i will be visit belfast in due course i will not give he the   exact date but it be soon in order to galvanise and understand what be available particularly in the sme community in northern ireland i look forward perhaps to talk to he about that at the time 
 today ’s announcement be a fantastic boost to british industry and british manufacturing in my constituency we have a proud history of support our national security what step will the minister be take in the defence industrial strategy to support local economic growth in constituency such as mine in west wales 
 my hon friend be right that there be great potential for economic growth in all of our nation and region and in every of our constituency in respect of the extra spending that the mod be now able to offer to keep our nation safe i be sure that he have sme in his constituency that can benefit from defence contract if we can make it easy for they to engage with defence which be of the problem that they all tell i they have at present 
 as the final word come back to the east midland i thank the minister for her hard work many of my constituent in rushcliffe work for rolls royce and will wholeheartedly welcome the announcement today could the minister briefly explain how skill development will link to the evolve defence industrial strategy and how she will work with our fantastic mayor of the east midlands claire ward to maximise the opportunity for our region 
 my hon friend be right that skill be key which be why this deal have establish a defence nuclear skill academy to ensure that apprentice a year can benefit from gain those skill i have no doubt that long term partnership with defence industry will enable we to do that on a broad scale the defence industrial strategy will be a key part of give that confidence to company that it be the right time to invest in skill 
 i thank the minister for her statement while the ministers switch place i inform member that we be go to return to the climate and nature bill 
 proceeding resume 
 as i be saying—[laughter i be tempt to scare the house by say have conclude my opening remark but i think i have well not 
 if i may i will address directly the minister on the treasury bench   the hon member for coventry east mary creagh i want to do so sincerely because i like and admire she enormously and i hope she know that she will know that a vast number of her colleague on the benches behind she and elsewhere support the general thrust of the bill and be look for a generous response from the government both to avoid have to divide the house and more importantly to make progress on these issue which i know full well she hold close to her heart i say to she not in the spirit of any sort of ransom or blackmail that how the government respond to this debate will in many way shape and sculpt how those of we who support the bill respond in kind 
 i will bring my remark to a conclusion some have say that those who support the bill be dangerous stalinistic anti farming land grabber i open my speech by say that i want to speak specifically to my fellow conservative both in this place and across the country where the siren voice of simplistic populism call to we and try to drag we on to the rock that we would be well advise to avoid let i close with the word of a dangerous left wing activist 
 it be mankind and his activity which be change the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous way we must use science to cast a light ahead 
 the same dangerous leftie say 
 but the threat to our world come not only from tyrant and their tank 
 appropriate give the statement we have just have 
 it can be more insidious though less visible the danger of global warming be as yet unseen but real enough for we to make change and sacrifice so that we do not live at the expense of future generation we must remember our duty to nature before it be too late 
 which radical stalinist be i quote from which guardian writing journalist be i purloin phrase well it be that dangerous leftie herself margaret thatcher the quote be from her united nations speech in her view and the view of my party be form by science and the fact with her basic university training at somerville college oxford the quote be from the world climate conference after she have leave office in i say to conservatives today that we would still be well advise to heed her caution her advice and her word
