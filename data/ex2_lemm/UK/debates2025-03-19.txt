 i thank my hon friend who do a superb job for peterborough we be proud of the fact that our employment rights bill be tackle the cost of insecure work and that we be deliver that pay rise for of the lowest pay we know that the leader of the opposition oppose all that she think that the minimum wage be a burden and that maternity pay be excessive it be the same old tories they oppose the minimum wage in the place they have learn absolutely nothing 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 the chancellor claim that her budget be a once in a parliament reset so why be we have an emergency budget next week 
 we have deliver record investment into this country we have have interest rate cut in a row and wage be go up fast than price which be a massive cost of live boost that be in only    month after year of absolute failure what do the conservatives leave interest rate be at and there be a massive £ black hole in the economy they crash the economy we be rebuild britain 
 the prime minister know why we be have an emergency budget it be because since the last since the chancellor deliver her budget in october growth be down borrowing be up and she have destroy business confidence do the prime minister now regret raise taxis on business 
 the office for budget responsibility will present its number and there will be a spring statement next week we have record investment into this country and interest rate have be cut the leader of the opposition talk about national insurance we have to fill the £ black hole that the conservatives leave we have invest in the nhs school and public service we be press on with planning with infrastructure and regulation 
 i understand the leader of the opposition be straight talk so perhaps she can help we with this be she go to reverse the national insurance contribution increase if not what be the point if so what other taxis be she raise to fill the hole way or another 
 the only black hole be the that the prime minister be dig he have show absolutely no regret but everybody know that the chancellor have make a mistake that be why they be have an emergency budget later today conservative will vote to exempt hospice pharmacy and care provider from her national insurance rise will he at the very least support exempt those vulnerable service from his job tax 
 i notice the leader of the opposition do not say that the conservatives would reverse the national insurance rise that be exactly it she want all the benefit but they can not say how they be go to pay for they she carps from the sideline but can not make her mind up whether she support or do not support national insurance rise we have make provision for hospice and we have make provision for charity but we have to secure the economy we have to fill the £ black hole that they disgracefully leave 
 the prime minister have not make these provision he keep talk about budget benefit unemployment be not a benefit business close be not benefit i ask he whether he would exempt hospice even child ’s hospice from the job tax he do not answer that question his mp know that this could affect end of life care so i will ask the same question again will he exempt hospice from pay his job tax 
 we have already invest £ for adult and child ’s hospice with an additional £ in funding through the child ’s hospice grant but we can not get away from the root cause of what we be do in that budget which be fix the economy the conservatives leave so badly damage a £ black hole perhaps the leader of the opposition will start the next question with an apology 
 i remember when the prime minister made—[interruption if labour member want i to answer question we can swap side 
 i remember when the prime minister make that announcement he have forget because the money he be refer to for hospice be for building it be not for the salary hit by the job tax as st helena hospice in colchester say 
 we can not use this funding for salary which be where we need urgent help 
 why be the prime minister not listen to hospice 
 i have already set out the position in relation to hospice the leader of the opposition say that she want to swap side heaven forbid after year of break everything we be get on with the job of fix it and all she can do be carp from the sideline with absolutely no policy 
 winter fuel payment have be snatch the job tax be hammer everyone from business to charity the chancellor promise a once in a parliament budget that she would not come back for more in that budget she say 
 there will be no extension of the freeze in income tax thresholds”.—[official report   october vol c. 
 ahead of the emergency budget will the right hon and learn gentleman repeat the commitment that she make 
 the right hon lady have such pre scripted question she can not adapt they to the answer i be give i think she now call herself a conservative realist well i be realistic about the conservatives the reality be that they leave open border and she be the cheerleader they crash the economy mortgage go through the roof the nhs be leave on its knee and they hollow out the armed force this government have already deliver extra nhs appointment breakfast club record return of people who should not be here and a fully fund increase in our defence spending that be the difference a labour government make 
 a lady come to see i recently who need help she have a disability which mean that her child have to help she cut up her food they have to help she wash beneath the waist they have to supervise she as she go to the toilet under the tory welfare system we be able to get that lady on to a personal independence payment under the prime minister ’s new propose system she will get nothing after year of the tory government and many of we want to see the back of they can the prime minister answer question what be the point if labour be go to do this 
 i have live with the impact of disability in our family through my mother and brother all my life i do understand the human impact but the current system be morally and economically indefensible we be right to reform it and nobody should be defend the broken status quo we be proceed on principle if you can work you should work if you need help into work the state should help you not   hinder you and if you can never work you must be support and protect they be the right principle and we can not leave the current system as it be 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark on ukraine and gaza i also pay tribute to group captain john paddy hemingway and all our hero from the battle of britain 
 member across the house will like i have hear from gps dentist community pharmacist and care home who be all deeply worried about the impact of the national insurance rise on the service they provide to patient that be why the house of lords pass a liberal democrat amendment to exempt nhs and care provider that amendment come before this house this afternoon but we be hear worrying report that the prime minister will order labour mp to vote against it will the prime minister reassure the house and patient across the country that those report be not true 
 i start by point out that because of the change we make at the budget we be able to put record amount of money into our national health service it be vitally important that we do so it be not right simply to oppose the measure we have to take to raise the money and at the same say as the right hon gentleman do that he want the benefit of the increase in funding to the nhs the can not sit together we have already invest an additional £ of funding in social care include £ to increase the social care grant we be take step but the basic point remain we can not make the investment in the nhs if we do not raise the money he can not simply oppose any raising of money and at the same time welcome the money into the nhs 
 i think the whole house be disappoint by that reply i hope that ahead of the spring statement the prime minister and the chancellor will think about take that money from the nhs and reverse that 
 i would like to turn to the issue of illegal hare course criminal gang be terrorise rural community across our country from cambridgeshire to devon from oxfordshire to wiltshire man in balaclavas be threaten and abuse farmer as these criminal tear across their field in 4x4s farmer be warn that it be only a matter of time before someone be kill do the prime minister agree with i that we must act urgently against this appalling criminality will he back our call for a comprehensive rural crime strategy so that we not just stamp out hare course but keep our rural community safe from all crime

 my constituent in birmingham northfield be deeply concerned about the scourge of knife crime and i pay tribute to the professionalism of west midlands   police for its response to these horrendous attack however there be still few police officer and police community support officer in the force than in and a new bid for more officer have be submit to the home office will the prime minister look at this issue so that the police can do more to keep our street secure and safe 
 i join my hon friend in commend west midlands police for keep his community safe we be double our investment to £ towards the recruitment of neighbourhood police officer give every community a name officer to help tackle violent crime and we be currently work through bid with force to ensure that we do so i will ensure that he get a meeting with the policing minister 
 we have a deeply unfair and unequal economic system where vast number of people be struggle while billionaire be get rich and rich do the prime minister really think that the way to tackle this situation be to put the onus on old people child and now sick and disabled people rather than on the shoulder of the super rich those who can most easily afford to pay with a wealth tax if the prime minister use the phrase difficult choice in his answer will he specify difficult choice for whom 
 we do have a proportional tax system and we have raise tax on the wealthy under this government the hon lady ’s advice would count for a bit more if her party ’s manifesto have not be a recipe for £ of extra borrowing which would have do exactly what liz truss do to the economy that would not help any of the people she be claim to support 
 i welcome the government ’s ambitious growth plan for the oxford cambridge arc which promise to reverse year of decline and transform the eastern region by drive prosperity create job and deliver much need housing do the prime minister agree that the crown achievement of these plan would be the establishment of a world class theme park in bedford borough which would transform our local economy create thousand of job and opportunity and elevate bedford as a national hub for leisure and tourism 
 my hon friend be right to raise this important project which we be work on it be vital that we unleash the potential of the oxford cambridge corridor and of course bedford by generate growth job and opportunity we be do that by speed up the delivery of new infrastructure project slash red tape and get britain build

 the hon gentleman be right too many people with eat disorder be not get the treatment they need the nhs be expand eat disorder treatment service with a focus on access treatment early and close to home and we be provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school i will make sure that he be keep update 
 labour ’s flagship crime and policing bill be design to tackle the rise in antisocial behaviour theft and shoplifting that occur under the tories it will grant police the power to confiscate disruptive off road vehicle which will help to tackle the scourge of off road bike in my constituency do the prime minister agree that we be the party of law and order and that we be fulfil our commitment 
 it be totally unacceptable for anyone to feel intimidated or unsafe due to the action of reckless and selfish individual whatever the vehicle our bill give police force strong power to seize they immediately and put a stop to antisocial behaviour that be our plan for change in action make our street and community safe 
 have have year to get ready labour come into power with no plan to reform welfare now in a panic because of their economic mismanagement the government be cut benefit for disabled people without consult they at all it probably say in the prime minister ’s folder that the high court rule that the conservative consultation be too short but at least we consult the government be not consult at all will the prime minister explain why he be do thing to disabled people and not with they

 the liberal democrats have long call for a uk eu youth mobility scheme polling have repeatedly show that the majority of brits support the idea include my constituent in epsom and ewell a well structure and control scheme would show that the government be serious about provide opportunity for young people and back british business will the prime minister stop sit on the fence and finally commit to a youth mobility scheme 
 we be work closely with our european colleague and the eu in particular on a reset of the relationship we will not be return to freedom of movement i have make that clear repeatedly but we be make good progress 
 the previous government fail to properly support further and adult education over the past year in contrast the prime minister ’s personal commitment to technical qualification have be encouraging last year ’s budget provide a welcome boost to some part of the sector but need and demand be outstrip available funding skill be crucial to the government meet their mission to deliver economic growth build home and transition to a green economy will the prime minister reassure i that the funding model will be review so that we do not see college have to turn away people who want to gain the skill that our country so desperately need

 i come to this chamber every week to ask sensible questions—[interruption]—and i expect sensible answer but all i get be glaze expression and waffle from those on the government benches i want to ask the prime minister a simple question on behalf of all the net sceptic if we become net tomorrow by how much would that reduce the earth ’s temperature it be a simple question 
 net be of course not easy but it be a huge opportunity to boost our growth our job and our economy the hon member know my view on that he complain but reform would have well idea if it stop fawn over putin i understand that   the hon member for clacton nigel farage   want to be prime minister but he can not even lead a party that fit in the back of a taxi 
 in disabled people in social housing and in disabled private renter live in inaccessible housing of my constituent with severe fibromyalgia and post traumatic stress disorder live in a floor flat    with no lift access as we build the new home that the country need will the prime minister ensure that they be build to be accessible and adaptable so that disabled and old people can live independently for generation to come

 despite ukraine be the victim in russia ’s illegal aggression president zelensky have show leadership to his people by commit to the us plan for a ceasefire however it be clear that putin be play for time and be still carry out daily attack on the ukrainian people be now not the time to take those frozen russian asset seize they and give they to the ukrainian people to strengthen their hand at the negotiating table and punish russian aggression 
 on both point last night follow the discussion yesterday i speak to president zelensky to discuss the way forward on the wide question of asset it be complicated it be not straightforward but we be work with other to see what be possible 
 the release of project willow today be a step forward in secure good job and an industrial future for grangemouth however the government need to work at pace to ensure that the recommendation in willow be act on will the prime minister outline what step he will be take to ensure that barrier to a rapid transition at grangemouth be remove and investment be progress as quickly as possible 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for raise grangemouth again for the time in this session that be because it be centrally important he will have hear what i have to say about the project that we be look at to ensure the long term future of grangemouth the interim measure that be be take and of course the £ of the wealth fund that i announce just a few week ago 
 the prime minister and i disagree on much the family farm tax the national insurance job tax and the cut in winter fuel payment but we surely agree that the common good be build on public order crossbow in the hand of killer cost life they cost the life of innocent woman last year the previous government move to consultation over a year ago on the regulation of crossbow their sale and use and yet we have hear nothing since they be as powerful as gun as silent as knife will the prime minister agree for of his ministers to come to the house before easter to give we a clear instruction about what the government intend to do before any more life be lose 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise this shocking issue he be right to do so the case he refer to be truly shocking as i think be agree across the house we be work on this and i will make sure that he get an update so that he be across the detail of what we be do 
 most member of this house will be aware that the welfare system can be a nightmare to navigate and do indeed need reform but could we have less of this rhetoric about the prime minister ’s £ package of disability benefit so call reform be moral there be nothing moral about cut benefit for what may be up to a people this be not about morality this be about the treasury ’s wish to balance the country ’s book on the back of the most vulnerable and poor people in this society 
 my right hon friend be a passionate advocate on this issue and have be for a long time and i pay tribute to she for that however as she rightly acknowledge the current system be break this be where i disagree with she i think that in young people not be in education or training that be a young people be a moral issue all the evidence suggest that someone in that situation at that stage of their life will find it incredibly difficult ever to get out of that level of dependency that cut across the opportunity and aspiration that be the root of my value and labour value about how we take work people forward i do see it as a moral issue and i will not turn away from that i be genuinely shocked that a young people be in that position and i be not prepared to shrug my shoulder and walk past it 
 on a point of order mr speaker the shadow minister for women   the hon member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies just before prime minister ’s question state at the dispatch box that imam adam kelwick post that he pray for victory of hamas over israel that be totally inaccurate he make absolutely no mention in the post to which she refer of hamas or against israel that be add wrongly by the shadow minister he in fact call for prayer of peace the truth be that adam have spend year work on counter extremism and even unite people through food and conversation when rioter come to attack his local mosque in liverpool last year i ask that the hon member correct the record and i remind she that should she have make such statement outside the house there would possibly be legal action what advice can you give to member to ensure that they do not abuse parliamentary privilege by slander people 
 i be not responsible for hon member question or for minister or shadow ministers answer i do not want to extend this question but i can assure the hon lady that the table office will be able to advise she on how to pursue the matter i be sure without doubt that it be on the record and that people will reflect on that 
 motion for leave to bring in a bill standing order no 
 i beg to move 
 that leave be give to bring in a bill to make provision about the groceries code adjudicator to require co ordination between the groceries code adjudicator and the agricultural supply chain adjudicator to make provision about public procurement in respect of british food product to make provision about the labelling of food product and for connected purpose 
 i remind the house of my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 in march at the height of the world war the then prime minister david lloyd george send a letter to an orkney farmer charles paterson he write 
 in the nation ’s interest i urge you at whatever personal sacrifice to overcome all obstacle to throw your full energy into the work and to influence and encourage all who assist you so that every possible acre shall be sow 
 at that time there be no question at the heart of government about the vital importance of farmer in the isle and across the country in the century since farmer have continue to play their part in supply the nation ’s table but their income have stagnate the market for agricultural produce in the uk have not be a free market since at least the end of the world war successive government have intervene through the payment of public subsidy to farmer initially in the name of food security and more recently in the name of cheap food for consumer that intervention have over the year distort the market and allow a range of unfair practice to be hardwire into the system 
 as a consequence the market today have a handful of behemoth retailer the supermarket at the top hundred of thousand of farmer at the bottom and a variety of processor distributor and other in the middle everyone take their cut and then at the end of it all the farmer get whatever be leave the power imbalance between the supermarket at the top and the farmer at the bottom be more pronounced than any other market i can think of and it be well document that those at the top who have the power wield it to their own advantage 
 the extensive debate that we have have in this house in recent month have lay bare the shocking truth about the lack of profitability in farming just last week a new report from the food farming and countryside commission find that real income for farmer have stay stock still for the past year 
 shortly after the autumn budget a group of young farmer in my constituency come to see i and bring with they their farm account they be despondent in point out to i that their business earn a net profit of on their capital they be not much cheer when i point out that they be do well than many of their contemporary as figure from the department for environment food and rural affairs show that the average return be as low as of those farmer be the great grandson of charles paterson a generation farmer who work the same land   as his great grandfather we really could not ask for a well illustration of the shift in priority of our government over the past year 
 this can not go on farmer be see a rapid withdrawal of funding support in england the accelerate withdrawal of basic payment follow by the closure without notice last week of the sustainable farming incentive have leave many farmer desperately worried about the viability of their business elsewhere in the united kingdom the removal of the ringfencing of money give to devolve administration for agricultural payment leave farmer there feel vulnerable to adverse change that be why this market now need direct and meaningful intervention without it we risk lose domestic food production and any notion of food security if as the prime minister say food security be national security his government should act urgently to allow our farmer to get a fair price for the food they produce 
 i be in government when the groceries code adjudicator be set up i do not think anyone believe that the gca would be the last word in the regulation of the food supply chain but we all take the view that it be well to have something than to have nothing year on from its creation the limitation of the adjudicator be apparent for all to see the office have few than staff all second from other public body and it be fund by a levy on supermarket to expect an operation of that size to take on some of the large retail business in the country be laughable it be hardly surprising then that business supply supermarket be reluctant to make complaint especially when the office have not issue a single fine in its entire existence case that be pursue end up with settlement and non disclosure agreement 
 since publicise my bill i have speak to a number of producer who have tell i about their experience at the hand of supermarket just yesterday i speak to a businessman who have be a supplier of brussels sprout to a large supermarket his company have on the basis of undertaking make to it by the retailer invest significantly borrow £ to build a state of the art packing facility in that supermarket account for of its business then in february the company be tell by the supermarket that its supply be no long want for that season for that business the news be a hammer blow and despite it be a prima facie breach of the grocery supply code of practice the gca initially decline to intervene 
 i would love to say that this be an isolated incident but the gca annual survey conduct by yougov suggest that it be not it find that of supplier would not raise issue because they believe the retailer would find out and that there would be consequence the experience they describe include de list without reasonable notice undisputed invoice not be pay accord to agree term retrospective change to supply agreement run a promotional activity at the supplier ’s expense and much more 
 practice among supermarket show a wide variety of behaviour of the retailer be judge to have improve or at least stay the same with sainsbury ’s come out on top with a net improvement score of unfortunately other home bargains asda tesco ocado iceland morrisons and amazon   be score as have worsen by vary degree with amazon ’s performance be judge to have worsen by a whopping amazon be also score as have comply with the code consistently or mostly only of the time 
 yesterday ’s daily telegraph report that asda be threaten a price war to regain the market share it have lose in recent year for farmer that be a chilling prospect if supermarket be about to embark on a race to the bottom we can be pretty sure that it will be farmer not company executive or shareholder who will be expect to take the hit 
 it be not for we in parliament to pick a winner in a fight between supermarket but they should know that we be watch any supermarket that think it can rebuild its balance sheet on the back of britain ’s farmer might find itself in front of the environment food and rural affairs committee and it well have some good answer when it get here 
 my bill have support from mps across political party it be sponsor by liberal democrat labour conservative plaid cymru snp green and democratic unionist members it also have wide geographical support with sponsor from shetland to cornwall and across the nation that make up the united kingdom i be grateful for the support i have receive from the farming union the country land and business association scottish land and estates the tenant farmers association and the countryside alliance that be a remarkable coalition of people who all understand that if we fail to act now before too long there may be no industry leave to protect 
 charles paterson ’s family in orkney still work the same land to this day if we want to keep farming community alive for generation to come however we need to act now to make it happen that be why the bill be necessary and why i seek the leave of the house today to introduce it 
 question put and agree to

 proceeding on any further message from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to a conclusion hour after their commencement.—(gen kitchen 
 question agree to 
 consideration of lords amendment 
 i can confirm that lords amendment to engage commons financial privilege have give careful consideration to lords amendment i be satisfied that it would impose a charge on the public revenue that be not authorise by the money resolution pass by this house on   december in accordance with   standing order no 78(3 that lords amendment will therefore be deem to be disagree to and be not available for debate 
 lords amendment deem to be disagree to standing order no 78(3 
 i beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment 
 with this it will be convenient to consider lords amendment to and and government motion to disagree 
 i welcome the opportunity to consider the lords amendment to the bill i thank members of both houses for their careful scrutiny and consideration of the bill and i place on record particular thank to the financial secretary to the treasury lord livermore for his invaluable support and for so expertly lead the bill through the other place 
 during consideration of the bill in the other place amendment be make of which we will address today but before i do so directly let i remind both houses of the context for the bill when we enter government we inherit a fiscal situation that be completely unsustainable we have have to take difficult but necessary decision to repair the public finance and rebuild our public service the measure in the bill represent some of the tough decision that we have have to take as a result to restore fiscal responsibility and get public service back on their foot we need to raise revenue include through the measure that the bill will introduce many of the amendment from the other place put at risk the funding that the bill seek to raise so let i be absolutely clear to support the amendment be also to support high borrowing low spending or other tax rise with that in mind i now turn to the group of lords amendment 
 the minister have talk about the growth mission which be the government ’s raison d’être but last week we find out that the economy have shrink have he do any work to find out how much that drop will cost the government it will have huge tax implication 
 as i have set out to the hon gentleman in a number of debate in recent week the government have have to take difficult but necessary decision to restore fiscal responsibility after the completely unsustainable situation that we inherit from the conservative party that fiscal responsibility and economic   stability be essential for great investment in the economy which be the bedrock of the growth that we be so determined to pursue 
 will the minister outline how many billion the government will spend this year what percentage £ represent in that amount and if i may be so greedy as to ask an additional question mr speaker how much the flatlining of the economy have cost the government compare with that £ i put it to the minister that the impact of the national insurance contribution rise have be much great than that of the mythical £ allege by the government 
 i be not clear from the right hon gentleman ’s intervention whether he finally accept that we inherit a £ black hole when we enter government i know that several of his colleague have seek to rewrite history but the fact be there we inherit a completely unsustainable fiscal situation with pressure and a £ black hole and we have to take difficult but necessary decision to remedy that it be important to do so because without the basic fiscal responsibility and economic stability that a government should deliver investment which be the basis for growth will not happen 
 the minister speak about fact be he aware of the fact that when the labour party win the election the economy be grow and be he aware of the fact that it be now shrink 
 i be very aware of the fact that we inherit an economy and a fiscal situation in a mess that be completely unsustainable and it be our duty as a government to address it no responsible government could have let thing carry on as they be with the fiscal situation the way it be that be why we take the action we do 
 will the minister give way 
 i will not as i have already give way several time and must make progress 
 we have to take those decision to put the fiscal responsibility back at the heart of government to return economic stability to the public finance and to have the basis for the investment on which we can grow the economy and put more money in people ’s pocket 
 lord amendment and relate to the nhs and social care provider the amendment seek to maintain the employer national insurance contribution rate and threshold at their current level for nhs commission service include gps dentist social care provider and pharmacist as well as those provide hospice care as member of both houses will know as a result of the measure in this bill and wide budget measure the nhs will receive an extra £ over year help to deliver an additional elective appointment every week 
 primary care provider general practice dentistry pharmacy and eye care be important independent contractor that provide nearly £ worth of nhs service every year the government consult the general practice and pharmacy sector 
 question raise regularly in my constituency relate to gp surgery the national insurance contribution will hit they immensely hard gps tell i that their only choice be to reduce staff and cut back appointment the minister mention £ extra for the nhs but if gp surgery and health clinic be reduce staff and reduce their capacity to deliver service be that not a step down in what be deliver in my constituency and beyond will he reconsider the measure give the impact on gp surgery 
 i thank the hon gentleman for raise the question of gps and the funding and support that the government be provide they we be invest an additional £ in general practice which bring the total spend on the gp contract to £ in that be the big increase in over a decade the change to the contract will improve service for patient and help to make progress towards the government ’s health mission shift from analogue to digital from sickness to prevention and from hospital to community care as set out in the prime minister ’s plan for change that support for gps be an essential part of what the budget include the national insurance measure we be debate deliver 
 age uk in my constituency have tell i that the employer nic rise will cost it £ a year do the minister agree that it be impossible to improve the public sector by tax the public sector 
 we inherit public service that be on their knee and need urgent support part of the reason why we take the difficult but necessary decision at the budget last october be of course to restore fiscal responsibility but it be also to get public service back on their foot that be not just about the public service that people across the uk enjoy it be also about ensure that we have the stability for economic growth if we do not have a health service that work well we do not have a healthy population who can go to work if we do not have a transport system that work well people can not get to work that investment to get public service back on their foot after year of conservative control be essential for the experience of people in the uk but it will also ensure that we have the economic growth that will enable we to put more money in people ’s pocket 
 will the hon gentleman give way 
 i will make a little progress i have speak about gps but the department of health and social care have enter into consultation with community pharmacy england regard the and community pharmacy contractual framework the final funding settlement will be announce in the usual way follow the consultation 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way yet again the national pharmacy association announce for the time ever in year that it be plan action by reduce service because of the implication of the budget of its request be the release of an independent report commission by nhs england on the future funding of pharmacy now that the government be in charge of nhs england will the minister ask his colleague in the department of health and social care to release that report before the consultation finish so that the public and the pharmacy can see exactly what the financial situation in that independent report will be 
 report on work that the department of health and social care be carry out be a subject for ministers in that department but on the funding that i be speak about the final funding settlement will be announce in the usual way follow the consultation that be under way 
 the nhs in england invest around £ every year on dentistry and nhs pharmaceutical ophthalmic and dental allocation for integrate care system for have be publish alongside nhs planning and guidance on social care the government have provide a cash increase in core local government spending power of in include £ of new grant funding provide to social care funding that can be use to address the range of pressure face the adult social care sector 
 the figure that the minister be present along with the answer that he give to   the hon member for strangford jim shannon and similar to the prime minister involve money go into sector that will not mitigate the national insurance rise will he confirm that sector such as hospice social care gps and pharmacy will have some support rather than tell we about money that be not go to help people with regard to the job tax that be come in 
 the various organisation or service that i be talk about whether gps pharmacy or organisation that provide social care receive money from government and the way that those discussion take place be by consider pressure on the provider of those service in the round that be the way the negotiation take place direct support for employer national insurance contribution obviously apply to central government local government and public corporation which be much the same way that the previous government approach thing under the health and social care levy pressure on social care or gps as i have be outline be consider in the round in term of their funding settlement and as i say the £ of new grant funding can be use to address a range of pressure face adult social care 
 the hon gentleman make an interesting point but let we look at child ’s hospice which will be down £ most funding for child ’s hospice do not come from the government it come from community and from people support they can the minister at the dispatch box assure child ’s hospice such as acorns in the west midland   that they will not be down the money that they will be lose through extra ni contribution and that that £ will be replace by the government for child ’s hospice 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for mention hospice and perhaps i may set out the government ’s position on hospice and some of today ’s amendment the government recognise the vital role that hospice play in support people at the end of life and their family and they also recognise the range of cost pressure that the hospice sector have be face over a number of year we be support the hospice sector with a £ increase for adult and child ’s hospice to ensure that they have the good physical environment for care and £ of revenue to support hospice for child and young people the £ will go towards help hospice to improve their building equipment and accommodation to ensure that patient continue to receive the good possible care 
 the point that opposition members be try to emphasise be that the government appear to be give with hand but take away with the other the hospice sector be just example of many sector that have be adversely affect by the government ’s cruel tax 
 as i say a few moment ago the way that the government support central government local government and public corporation that be departments and other public sector employer be the same way that the previous government respond to the health and social care levy that be a standard way in which the government offer support for employer national insurance cost 
 rise 
 i will make some progress 
 will the minister give way on that point 
 no i will make some progress the government want to shift healthcare out of hospital and into the community to ensure that patient and their family receive personalise care in the most appropriate setting 
 i thank the hon gentleman for give way southern area hospice which be locate just outside my constituency have to raise £ per year or £ per month it be not government fund as have be mention so what reassurance can the minister give to those currently use southern area hospice for end of life care that the government will do the right thing and support our hospice by not include they in the increase to national insurance contribution 
 i have explain how the government be approach employer national insurance contribution and the support that they offer for central government local government and public corporation that be an establish way of respond to change to employer national insurance contribution which the previous government do 
 rise 
 the right hon gentleman be be so persistent he must have an amazing point to make so i will give way to he i wait with bated breath 
 it be an amazing point and i hope that the hon gentleman will get it because it be clear that the prime minister do not get it at prime minister ’s question let ’s tell the real truth the money that be be give by the government taxpayer money to child ’s hospice such as shooting star and demelza hospice be for building the national insurance increase be directly hit the people who do the work on which very sick child depend why be that imposition be make 
 the £ that the right hon gentleman allude to be important funding to help hospice improve their building equipment and accommodation to ensure that patient receive the good care possible as i say a few moment ago there will be £ of revenue to support child and young people ’s hospice more widely the government provide for charity include hospice through the wide tax regime which be among the most generous in the world that include tax relief for charity and their donor worth just over £ for the tax year to april finally as the right hon gentleman will know all charity include hospice that be set up as charity can benefit from the employment allowance that the bill more than double from £ to £ that will benefit charity of all size particularly the small 
 the minister know that that be fund for year and mainly for building as he have admit this will be a cost on hospice every single year go forward it will be cumulative and mean that hospice have to ask their community for more and more just to give that basic help will he commit to funding child ’s hospice by the £ that the government be take off they every year or not yes or no 
 the point i be make before i give way to the right hon gentleman be recurrent feature of the tax system the support through the tax regime for charity and their donor which be worth more than £ in april be a feature of the system that happen every year the increase in the employment allowance from £ to £ which will benefit hospice that be set up as charity be a permanent change that we be make through the bill 
 as be evident to many hon member the minister have for the time find himself unable to answer some very straightforward question from opposition members about the difference between the allocation of funding for capital expenditure and for current expenditure and the impact that that difference will have on our hospice child ’s hospice gps and other affect by labour ’s job tax 
 i be sure member of the house of lords who bring these amendment back will also have notice that the minister have be unable to answer those question prior to the bill go back to the house of lords will the minister agree to speak to the chancellor or the chief secretary to the treasury to get a clear   answer to the question that have be raise today about which money will be available for capital and which money will be available to offset the national insurance charge increase 
 i be sorry that the hon gentleman feel that i be be unclear i think i be be perfectly clear on the government ’s position he may not agree with that position he be entitle not to but on the employer national insurance contribution change i have be very clear that the government will provide support directly to central government local government and public corporation such as departments and other public sector employer as be the case under his government with the health and social care levy that do not apply to gps dentist hospice and the other organisation that we have be discuss today 
 the important point that i be make which i hope be clear to he and his colleague on the conservative benches be about the wide support that the government be provide to hospice the funding that we be provide to gps and the discussion we be have with other primary care provider that be the context in which the bill have to be see we be able to take decision around funding for public service because of the difficult decision that we take at the budget last year and this bill implement of those decision 
 at prime minister ’s question early today it be noticeable that when the prime minister ask the leader of the opposition whether she would reverse the national insurance contribution rise that we be bring in through the bill she refuse to commit to that i be unclear exactly what the conservative position is—[interruption 
 rise 
 i think of the conservative members say that he will update i in his speech later i may have misheard he but i think i hear he say that he will confirm later whether the opposition will reverse the national insurance change we be make so i look forward to that update 
 will the minister explain to the house how it be right for the government to cover the extra national insurance contribution of those work in the public sector for example in hospital provision but it be not right to do that for those work in hospice in end of life care how can that circle be square why will they cover the national insurance contribution for those work in hospital that be treat people but not for those work in hospice that deliver end of life care 
 the fundamental principle be about which organisation the government will support in response to the change to national insurance contribution the approach the government be take which be in line with the approach take by the previous government in the health and social care levy be for the government to provide support for departments and other public sector employer for additional employer national insurance contribution as i say to   the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller that mean central government public corporation and local government primary care provider be independent contractor and will therefore not be exempt from the change 
 the minister make the point that this be secondary for primary care provider however he do not acknowledge that primary care provider still do not know how they will be compensate by the government as i hear from dentist community pharmacy and social care provider in my constituency we be very close to the start of the tax year and those small business be provide critical primary care service in our community how can they operate when the minister obfuscate and say other people might talk to they at a later stage about the money that they might receive would it not be easy for the minister to accept the liberal democrat amendment from the house of lords and clear up this matter today 
 for clarity primary care provider who be independent contractor will not receive the direct support that the government provide to departments and other public sector employer the pressure that those provider face be consider in the round before funding be provide to they so the solution be arrive at in a different way from the way suggest by the hon gentleman 
 as i set out early the revenue raise by the decision set out in the bill will help fund public service include those provide by the nhs and other social care provider the amendment would put much of that funding at risk so to support these amendment be to support high borrowing low spending or other tax rise 
 what advice can the minister give thames hospice and alexander devine child ’s hospice service in maidenhead which be look at a £ and £ increase in bill respectively be he say that they should cut service or be he expect resident in our constituency to raise more money for they for it to be give directly back to the chancellor 
 i do not know the situation of those hospice so i will not give they direct advice on manage their operation more generally i have set out the government ’s approach to provide direct support for departments and other public sector employer it depend how hospice care be provide in many case integrate care board be responsible for commission palliative and end of life care service to meet the need of local population where hospice be commission by the nhs contractual arrangement should be discuss with the integrate care board at local level 
 the minister have a capital budget and revenue budget we be talk about a small amount of money—£4 or £ so will he consider switch £ or £ from the capital budget to the revenue budget open up that opportunity would have merit and would help these very vulnerable organisation 
 i have set out the government ’s approach to support departments and other public sector employee when it come to the change to employer national insurance contribution as i say to the shadow chief secretary to the treasury the hon member for   north bedfordshire we be take the same approach that his government take to the health and social care levy we be talk about the wide pressure face by organisation be they gps or hospice and what we can do to support they and their process we be consider the pressure on they in the round i have make a considerable number of point about lords amendment and in the light of those point i urge the house to disagree with those amendment 
 i turn to the lords amendment relate to charity local government and special educational need transport lord amendment and seek to exempt charity from the change to employer national insurance contribution rate and threshold the government recognise the crucial role that charity play in our society we recognise the need to protect the small charity that be why we have more than double the employment allowance to £ pound mean that more than half of business include charity with national insurance liability either gain or will see no change next year 
 as i have note it be important to recognise that all charity can benefit from the employment allowance the government provide wide support for charity via the tax regime tax relief for charity and their donor be worth just over £ in the tax year to april again the amendment would put much of the funding that the bill seek to raise for public service at risk so support these amendment be support for high borrowing low spending or other tax rise 
 after yesterday ’s announcement about benefit change and benefit cut the government have say that they want more people to go into work a lot of help to get people into work be deliver by charity so we be expect a great need for such charity how will they cope if they be be tax through further nic they will have to reduce their service and their ability to provide support so there will be a gap in the market will the minister explain how the government intend to bridge that gap
