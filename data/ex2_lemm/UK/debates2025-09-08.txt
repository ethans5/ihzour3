 what step he be take to ensure that veteran receive adequate support after leave the armed force 
 what step he be take to help support veteran into employment 
 travel the country and speak to veteran our postcode lottery for veteran support across the nation be not lose on i veteran have to repeat their story between and time to land on the support that they deserve that be why the government have take the unprecedented step of invest £ over year to set up valour big chunk across the strategic regional and local level to redesign our support mechanism for veteran that will increase the headquarters   size it will allow liaison officer into our regional council and at the local level it will take the good hub to provide wraparound welfare and service for veteran it will give our veteran the deal that they deserve 
 for more than century gurkha veteran have serve our country with extraordinary loyalty and bravery many of they and their family have strong tie to my constituency in brecon yet to the shock of many thousand who retire before despite fight shoulder to shoulder with their british comrade often suffer injury and wound in the process remain on inferior pension leave too many in poverty do the minister agree that that injustice can not be allow to stand will he commit to ensure that all gurkha veteran receive fair and equal pension in recognition of their service 
 we have a proud and distinguished history of gurkha soldier serve in the british army and across defence i serve with they in afghanistan and across many other conflict the bilateral gurkha veteran welfare committee sit most recently in june of this year and it continue to ensure that the need of gurkha veteran be meet and understand fully it be also worth note that even among british service personnel from in and around that era some do not qualify for a pension so in some case there be parity across the board the gurkha welfare advice centre provide handle support for a wide variety of welfare relate inquiry alongside the gurkha brigade association i have also meet the nepalese ambassador and will do so again soon to discuss the issue 
 from my proud support of the national transition event hold annually at silverstone in my constituency i be aware of the work of mission community a service charity task with the delivery of the office for veterans affair veteran industry engagement programme which be design to advocate for our veteran by work with industry trade body what sector will the government focus on in their work so that veteran and their family feel the benefit as well as that have a positive impact on our economy 
 veteran not only defend the nation while in service but they go on to deliver the mission of government which be to help we prosper i have meet representative from mission community which do a fantastic job several time it be worth note that veteran who engage with our career transition pathway on transition to become civilian have an success rate in go straight into employment op ascend which we launch at the national transition event have see thousand of family and veteran connect up with industry to move that collaboration forward i will write the hon lady with detail about specific industry in due course 
 this government be reset the relationship between those who serve and those who serve the government ’s response to the defence committee ’s inquiry into the armed force covenant be positive will the minister provide an update on the work that be be to strengthen the covenant 
 when we come into government the covenant cover different department we have make a pledge to armed force service personnel those who have serve their family and indeed those who have be bereave that we will open that covenant that duty to different department over time that commitment will result in a step change in the government ’s relationship with those who have serve and it be a commitment that we will deliver 
 more than service family lose love one during the trouble in northern ireland will the minister set out how the forthcoming legislation will enable closure for those family who have have their wound continually reopen for too long 
 i thank my hon and gallant friend for his question it be not lose on i that during the trouble there be major explosion in key city all over the country from brighton to brimingham individual from both side of the house have to take the precaution of check under their bed and their car and ensure that the light be on before they go into certain room because the chance of close quarter assassination by terrorist be ever present some service personnel who be deploy to secure the peace pay the ultimate sacrifice and family lose love one that mean that mother father brother and sister have the truth deny to they as soon as the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act come into place as a service person i would always want my family to know what happen to i if i be to be kill in a conflict repeal and replace the legacy act will enable that but we must ensure that the process do not come with punishment for veteran we will ensure that protection be in place to allow we to get to the truth and to ensure that no can rewrite history or make veteran suffer any more 
 i call the shadow minister 
 nearly a of a people have now sign the parliamentary petition to protect northern ireland veteran from prosecution in opposition to labour ’s proposal for tier justice surely ministers must understand that facilitate lawfare against our army veteran none of whom receive letter of comfort after leave their service show that labour just do not have their back 
 i highlight to the right hon gentleman that families—200 mother father brother or sister of those that serve have their inqu inquiry insight and understanding close off when the legacy act come into place they be serve member of the security force and their family deserve truth however we must ensure that we also provide protection for veteran as we move forward so that they be not subject to lawfare as the right hon gentleman mention and that the process do not become the punishment for veteran as we move forward 
 labour ’s currently stall remedial order would specifically make it easy for gerry adams and his friend to sue the british taxpayer while throw our army veteran many of they recruit from red   wall seat to the wolf after everything the government put their back benchers through in recent month be no and ministers really intend to press ahead with this madness and do gerry adams a favour at the expense of the soldier who oppose he be they press ahead with the remedial order yes or no 
 the right hon gentleman be miss the point he be try to divide the house veteran and the armed force community and it have get to stop the reality be that we will produce legislation that will allow family to get to the truth he should put himself in the shoe of the family who have lose love one and then put himself in the shoe of veteran i be a northern ireland veteran and accept that if the protection be in place to ensure that the process do not become the punishment we have a good solution 
 what discussion he have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on meet the nato target of spend of gdp on defence 
 at the hague summit in june all nato nation agree to step up and increase spending on national security to by i be proud that this labour government play a leading part in the discussion that lead to that historic agreement 
 tomorrow we will vote on a bill that shamefully give up the sovereignty of our military base in diego garcia give the commitment to spend more on defence will the secretary of state confirm if the money spend on chagos will be include in our declare nato spend 
 the investment in diego garcia be a great investment in the defence and intelligence partnership with the united states together we do thing from diego garcia that can not be do elsewhere we do thing together that we do not do with other nation the deal be worth less than of the annual defence budget how be it that the conservatives have get themselves on the wrong side of this argument about national security when we stand alongside the us as our close ally 
 britain ’s commitment to the nato target clearly send a strong signal of our resolve but that pledge must command public confidence that the money will be spend wisely can the secretary of state provide more detail on how he be work with the treasury the cabinet office and other to ensure that every additional pound of public investment in defence deliver value for money for the taxpayer 
 my hon friend be right this be about not just how much the government spend but how well they spend mr speaker you will remember that under the previous government the public accounts committee brand our defence procurement system as break we be reform procurement and that will be part of the statement this afternoon on the defence industrial   strategy by my hon friend   the member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard at the heart of this we make a commitment to the british people at the last election that we would raise defence spending to of gdp and we be do that year early this be a government who be deliver for defence and for britain 
 the defence secretary say that the chagos giveaway will amount to no more than of our defence budget do that not suggest the cost of the chagos giveaway will in fact come out of the defence budget 
 on the contrary both the foreign secretary and i have be consistent that take across the range the cost of the settlement with mauritius for diego garcia be split between the ministry of defence and the foreign commonwealth and development office for defence our commitment be less than of the defence budget that be a good investment for this country and it give we a sovereign right to operate that base with the americans for the next year 
 i welcome the leadership display by the prime minister and defence secretary and our commitment to the historic pledge what step will nato take to far strengthen our response to grow russian aggression 
 the response of nato have produce result exactly to the contrary of those president putin would have want when he invade ukraine and a half year ago nato be now big it be nation strong the commitment that all nation make in the june summit to increase national security spending to by be a strong deterrent message to putin russia and other adversary and it will make nato big and strong in order to deter in the year ahead 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i congratulate   the hon and gallant member for north east derbyshire louise sandher jones   and   the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard   on their promotion i also send my good wish to   the right hon member for liverpool garston maria eagle it be always a pleasure to work with she 
 on defence spending can the secretary of state confirm what percentage of gdp will be use to set the cost envelope for the defence investment plan 
 when we settle our defence investment plan and produce our annual report and account the datum that the hon gentleman seek will be set out clearly and in the customary way to this house 
 interestingly the answer be not it be not and it be not even 2.6%—those be the figure we declare to nato they be not from the ministry of defence budget as the then armed force minister the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport confirm to i last week in a write answer the amount we will spend on the defence investment plan come entirely from the mod ’s departmental budget therefore the actual figure for fund our future defence equipment be just by with no fund plan to go any high give the threat we face be enough 
 it should come as no surprise to anyone that the defence investment plan will be fund from the defence budget that be exactly what will happen it will be fund and support by the record increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war by the £ extra in this year ’s budget with an aim to spend of gdp on defence during the next parliament these be commitment that the previous conservative government have year to make but never make this be a government who be deliver for defence and deliver for britain 
 whether he plan to implement the outstanding recommendation of the report of the defence committee of session protect those who protect we woman in the armed forces from recruitment to civilian life hc 
 defence as a whole have accept recommendation from the women in the armed forces report we have outstanding element still in train the result of an armed force sexual harassment survey and a veteran strategy with a specific female veteran section both will be release in the autumn on top of this we have a tri service complaint system which i personally bring in and the violence against woman and girl taskforce to make sure that any woman can serve with safety and pride 
 the atherton report publish in survey female service personnel and veteran it reveal that have be victim of bullying discrimination harassment or sexual assault during their service do the minister recognise that at a time when we be expand our armed force we must improve the overall experience of woman in the military protect female personnel and help servicewoman achieve their full potential 
 i could not agree more with the hon member obviously in our minister for the armed force my hon friend   the member for north east derbyshire louise sandher jones we have an individual who have live experience of be a female in the armed force it be really important to mention the individual who sit at the bottom of the command chain where do they go if they be experience a problem where do they seek help and who do they complain to in some case they can not do it within the chain of command it may not be appropriate or they may not want to which be why the violence against woman and girl taskforce be so important as well as the tri service complaint system it will allow people to come outside the command chain raise those issue and make sure they be deal with appropriately 
 whether he have have recent discussion with the secretary of state for the home department on the use of military asset to help prevent crossing by illegal migrant of the english channel 
 the prime minister have make tackle small boat and close every asylum hotel a priority last week i meet ministerial colleague from across government to discuss how defence will contribute to that work we have deploy a military planning team to assist the border security command and the home office look at military and non military site for temporary but adequate housing so that we can accelerate close asylum hotel 
 the safety and security of my constituent be my no priority give the national security risk pose by some of those who cross the english channel illegally i ask the minister to look again at use military asset to physically stop those small boat from land in the place will he do that today 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question and i share his passion for keep our country safe i refer he to the work of operation isotrope a military operation undertake by the last conservative government that put the navy in charge of secure the english channel that operation conclude that naval asset be not suitable for that task it be already a dangerous crossing and it conclude that military asset only make it more dangerous that be why the armed force be now assist the home office and the border security command look at how we can provide the accommodation that will enable we to close the asylum hotel as well as how we can speed up the processing of asylum application something the government that the hon gentleman back shamefully stop when they be in power there be a lot of work to do but we be make progress 
 i call the chair of the defence committee 
 the minister have comment that he and the government be consider use military barrack to house asylum seeker while i thank he for his effort to help address the small boat crisis by provide logistical planning support i personally do not feel that operational responsibility for that should fall to our armed force the experience of operation isotrope under the boris johnson government widely criticise by the previous defence committee for cause confusion and reputational risk and for strain our already pressured military serve as a clear warning can the minister therefore issue iron clothe assurance to the house that any future mod involvement within this field will be strictly limit clearly define and not strain our already pressured military 
 i thank the chair of the select committee for his question the ministry of defence be part of the cross government response to small boat we be step up our support to assist our colleague in the home office the home office remain the lead department but as every department can contribute something to this effort it be right that the ministry of defence do so we continue to protect the nation and deliver the change as lay out in the strategic defence review our no priority remain to keep this country safe 
 what step he be take to improve skill in the defence sector 
 as i will shortly outline to the house as part of the launch of the defence industrial strategy this government will set out an ambitious skill package that will grow retain and develop the well pay high skilled workforce that the uk require to boost job and make defence an engine for growth in every nation and region of the country 
 last week i visit raf wyton in huntingdonshire which employ many of my constituent under the new cyber and specialist operation command wyton provide a critical part of our defence intelligence and the plan to expand the work of the base will provide significant career opportunity for my constituent in northern huntingdonshire interruption yes   the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty   be there too 
 order i do not want cross party relationship break on account of whose constituency something be in 
 thank you mr speaker do the minister agree that develop the defence industry in huntingdonshire will unlock local growth and prosperity can he outline how we will support skill development to ensure my constituent can access these opportunity 
 my hon friend be a real champion of his constituent who work at raf wyton and all those who could work there through the expand opportunity which i have speak to   the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty   about i be glad that there be cross party support for the investment that this government could make there be a real opportunity to use defence as an engine for growth create more opportunity for our young people in particular i would be happy to meet my hon friend   the member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling   and the hon member for huntingdon to discuss how we can far develop the opportunity at hand in a spirit of cross party consensus 
 charles stewart parnell come to this place and use british institution against the british state now in scotland we have minister john swinney who be a kind of pound shop parnell although we be hear much about defence infrastructure across the uk the snp government have a presumption against support defence industry in scotland what be we go to do about it defence sit here not in holyrood 
 this government ’s approach be to create job and opportunity through the increase defence budget in every part of the united kingdom include scotland the norway frigate deal highlight how a uk government sell our ware and our expertise on the global stage can provide additional job with job from that deal across the uk include in scotland while the snp government have be dither on defence this labour government have be deliver 
 what step he be take to improve recruitment and retention in the armed force 
 minister welcome 
 it be a huge honour to be here and i be very honoured 
 we inherit a crisis in recruitment and retention this government be renew the contract with those who serve by give they the large pay rise in year allocate an extra £ to fix force housing and establish a new armed forces commissioner it be clear that our action be have an effect on recruitment inflow continue to improve and be up year on year and application to join the armed force and intake to basic training both remain high on retention morale have be fall year on year with more people leave than join but we have start to reverse that decline with an reduction in outflow year on year 
 i welcome the minister to her place over the past year i have have the privilege of take part in the armed force parliamentary scheme and have meet people across the united kingdom and beyond of the issue that arise when it come to retention be that of the family of overseas worker in the armed force they have no access to work opportunity and there be no specific visa or agreement with other country where our armed force be base which mean that they must often take pay cut or not relocate with their partner in the force will the minister think about what we can do to support armed force worker overseas 
 i have serve overseas and observe this issue at hand discussion with the cabinet office be ongoing and i hope to update the hon member in due course 
 the brave man and woman who serve in the armed force be the very good among we and i look forward to learn more about our royal air force personnel when the raf town show come to falkirk this week the cumulative pay increase for non officer since last july and the additional £ to be spend on service housing demonstrate the government ’s commitment to uphold the armed force covenant but what further action be minister consider to recognise and retain our armed force personnel 
 my hon friend have rightly mention the large pay rise in year i be particularly delighted that we can now say that no member of the armed force be pay less than the national living wage of course we have much more to do i look forward to get to work on it and i hope to have a meeting with my hon friend to discuss that 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i congratulate   the hon member for north east derbyshire louise sandher jones a fellow female veteran and   the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard   on their new appointment 
 reserve force be a vital component of the british army and i welcome the government ’s commitment to increase their number by at least but the lack of a clear timeline plan and funding be not good enough the public accounts committee agree with that in its report and reveal that many training site be in the wrong location and that their condition have decline good training site in the right location be vital to increase our reserve will the government today give a firm timeline for complete the estate optimisation programme and secure funding for the next stage 
 i thank the hon member for her congratulation and for her question she make a valid point and be absolutely right that we need to do more in this regard i be afraid i can not provide a specific timeline here but i will keep her question in mind and hope to update she in due course 
 what step he be take to increase the number of cadet 
 what recent step he have take to help increase the number of cadet 
 what step he be take to increase the number of cadet 
 the number of question on this issue demonstrate the importance that member in all part of the house ascribe to the subject of cadet as we say in the strategic defence review we will increase the number of exist cadet force by by with £ of funding but we be also consider area of social demographic requirement where new cadet force can be place that will give kid throughout the country fantastic opportunity to flourish and thrive both at school and as they move to the end of their education 
 as of the female cadet in scotland during the mid-1980 i know i do not look old enough i be aware of how transformative the cadet experience can be but now in girl make up only a of our cadet force what more can my hon friend do to ensure that join the cadet be see as an exciting opportunity for girl as well as boy and will he join i on a visit to the brilliant cadet unit in my constituency to see these brilliant young people in action 
 i thank my hon friend for make that important point the cadet force be an inclusive organisation and i have be delighted to be able to visit branch throughout the country for instance in cornwall a couple of week ago i visit a summer camp to observe the diversity of the cadet which in some case be far well than it be in the armed force currently of community base and of school base cadet be female that be a positive important and encouraging trend and i hope that it will continue over time 
 i be in the king edward ’s school raf combine cadet force and until recently i be on the board of the west midland reserve forces and cadet association i be pleased to learn of the government ’s lofty ambition to increase cadet size but i be worry by the comment of the public accounts committee which say recently that there be a distinct lack of detail and funding to achieve those number without the funding and without the detail these plan and number be meaningless be they not 
 there be different issue here the be about expand the cadet force by by there be £ behind that and the plan for how to deliver it be be develop the point on the public accounts committee be about the reserve forces and cadet associations and be primarily about infrastructure which we be work on now that be a legacy issue we be try to rejuvenate it and make sure that the accommodation and indeed the infrastructure be fit for purpose for the cadet and the reserve as we move forward 
 may i too welcome the under secretary of state for defence my hon and gallant friend   the member for north east derbyshire louise sandher jones to her place on the front bench

 eastbourne ’s mighty sea cadet celebrate their birthday this year but their future be be put under threat by rise energy bill which be make run the operation less and less sustainable it be the same with many other cadet across the country will the minister share how the government will support the like of the eastbourne sea cadet with energy bill so that they can continue have an incredible impact on local young people and our armed force more generally 
 the air cadet be fantastic the sea cadet be fantastic and the army cadet be amazing they be all amazing i would love to take on this issue if the hon gentleman write to i with the detail we will have a look at what we can do i have huge admiration for the sea cadet in his constituency at some point if my diary permit i would love to visit they all 
 what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the plan timetable for implement the recommendation of the strategic defence review 
 the government have accept all recommendation of the strategic defence review implementation of the review ’s recommendation be already well under way 
 with raf odiham celebrate its centenary this year i be proud of the many close military tie that we have in my constituency of north east hampshire of the recommendation of the strategic defence review be to improve accommodation where we be let our military personnel down give that there be widespread agreement with the liberal democrats on this issue include in the other place will the secretary of state support bring all military housing in line with the decent home standard in today ’s renters rights bill vote 
 in the last year we have take huge step to start to make good on decade of substandard housing for military personnel and their family we have bring military family home back into public ownership so that we can plan exactly the sort of upgrade that the hon lady talk about 
 on the rest of the sdr we have announce the purchase of f-35a aircraft which will join the dual capable aircraft mission of nato we have launch our new £ campaign on cadet and we have stand up the cyber and specialist operation command today we be publish the defence industrial strategy to make defence an engine for growth this government be deliver for defence and deliver for britain 
 the strategic defence review rightly highlight the need for a whole of society approach to defence include expand the cadet by by a key part of that have to include support more adult volunteer to give their time to the cadet what step be my right hon friend take to ensure that more adult volunteer be able to support our fantastic cadet 
 my hon friend be exactly right cadet force can not exist without the adult volunteer who support they and they be central to our ability to increase the number of cadet force across this country by by which will give so many young people opportunity in the future

 will the secretary of state confirm how this country and our ally will support ukraine to defend its airspace from russian aggression for example will we lend it our typhoons or will we participate in the cross national f-16 fighter programme despite the fact that we do not have f-16s 
 we have work closely with ukraine to develop new weapon system to supply the air defence missile it require while ever ukraine be fight putin ’s invasion we will stand alongside it and we will provide whatever military aid we can beyond that for when we can reach a negotiate peace we have be lead work to prepare a multinational force willing to stand with ukraine in the peace and to secure that peace for the long term so that russia never again invade that country

 of labour ’s key manifesto commitment be to give our armed force great representation through the creation of an armed forces commissioner a promise that we have make good on with the passing of the armed forces commissioner act last week how do the minister expect that to improve the life of our service personnel and their family 
 as my hon friend rightly note the armed forces commissioner act as i can now refer to it receive royal assent last week which be a fantastic step forward as she highlight there be more to do there be many aspect of service life where even small change could make a massive difference to the overall experience of service personnel 
 if he will make a statement on his departmental responsibility 
 i pay tribute to my right hon friend   the member for liverpool garston maria eagle she serve as a minister in both this and the previous labour government with great commitment and we thank she for her service hon member hear hear

 when i meet veteran across beverley and holderness particularly at withernsea or beverley veteran breakfast club the no issue they raise with i be homelessness among veteran an issue that the minister for veterans and people will recognise they ask what more we can do and i share that question with the secretary of state what more can we do to ensure that those who have put their life on the line to serve our country do not find themselves homeless in their later day 
 i share with the right hon gentleman and i think every member of this house the pleasure and honour of attend such breakfast club with veteran in my constituency he be right about the range of concern that veteran raise which include the pressure of homelessness recognise the force service in local authority housing priority be our step and the £ go into the op valour system to increase support for veteran will also play a part 
 the £ contract with norway will help to guarantee shipbuilding on the clyde for many decade to come will the minister join i in congratulate the worker at the shipyard in glasgow and will he assure i that the government intend to everything they can to promote glaswegian shipbuilding around the world 
 i thank my hon friend for his question and thank the worker on the clyde for their professionalism it make the collective ministerial effort across government much easier know that we have professional dedicated and excellent worker on the clyde who be able to build the type frigate and on the opposite side of scotland support the worker at rosyth to build the type frigate too there be a huge future on either side of scotland for british shipbuilding and hopefully more export order as well 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 do the secretary of state agree that recruitment to the armed force must be base solely on merit 
 we must recruit the absolute good to serve in the armed force as the hon gentleman will know an intelligent strategy for recruitment will seek to reach every single community across these british isle perpetuate a narrative that woman and those from ethnic minority many of whom have prove time and again on service that they absolutely deserve to be a part of our armed force be recruit because of some wake policy do they a huge disservice 
 i totally agree but be that not why we should be concern that the contract for the new armed force recruitment service 
 include annual mandate performance indicators focus on enhance equality and diversity within the workforce 
 those be to be annually mandate in the contract my concern be that hardwire the requirement into the contract risk distort recruitment if the target be not hit we see that with the raf would it not be well to simply scrap the red tape altogether and focus solely on get the good people into the armed force irrespective of their background 
 i think the hon member have answer his own question we be talk about indicator and indicator be very different from target an intelligent recruitment strategy seek to reach out to all community across these island and we need to monitor how well our narrative be succeed if we be to have a truly professional strategy we have to monitor its success in reach different community that be why we refer to an indicator 
 my question be a bit like the bus this morning i spend a lot of time knock on door and talk to resident in my constituency a couple of week ago resident speak with anguish about the challenge that his son who be former armed service personnel face in suffer from post traumatic stress disorder i have meet the veterans minister to discuss this on a number of occasion but can i ask he once again to emphasise the importance that this government put on support veteran who have ptsd this link in with work that i do in a previous role in which i support veteran out of homelessness 
 order that question be like the bus indeed some be quick than other and that should have be an express 
 this government take seriously both physical and mental injury from service op courage have already see referral it be a fantastic programme that run across the country and provide mental health service for veteran i encourage any veteran who think that they need help to shout and seek help it be the step to recovery 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 it be clear that vladimir putin remain hellbent on the conquest of ukraine while he drag trump along with false promise of peace it be right of the government to have take step such as put in place the recent price cap cut to hurt putin ’s oil profit but the government must go far analysis by the centre for research on energy and clean air think tank show that the uk have send over £ in tax receipt to the kremlin by continue to import petroleum product derive from russian oil from country will the government commit to finally close this loophole which be currently fill the kremlin ’s coffer 
 we be always ready to take further step on impose economic sanction and to close any loophole in those sanction we have a record under both the last government and this government of be at the forefront of impose these sort of economic measure on putin ’s regime 
 like several colleague across the house i grow up in the air cadet i leave as a cadet warrant officer have gain so much by fly aeroplane shoot rifle march in a band and crucially learn the self discipline and leadership that ultimately bring i to this house cadet and adult volunteer i have speak to recently be over the moon about our plan to increase the size of the cadet force by by however as we increase the size of the cadet force how can we ensure that every cadet will have the same access to opportunity as they currently do when resource for activity be limited 
 the expansion of the cadets—30 by be front and centre of my portfolio we will ensure that the £ be spend on expand the service as well as increase the standard of training insight and access that cadet have across the country 
 i congratulate the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard and for north east derbyshire louise sandher jones on their new ministerial position my constituent former senior aircraftsman mark shephard be subject to discriminatory dismissal from the raf deny he his whole future career in the raf could the minister explain why he have be accept for an impact payment but deny a discharge and dismissal payment with no explanation will the minister review the whole ddp so that it honour 
 order time limit apply to liberal democrats as well 
 if the hon member write to i with the detail of that case i will look into it there be a plethora of issue and complexity with some of these policy but i will take this case on and have a look 
 we have already highlight the welcome investment in shipbuilding on the clyde and the forth which clearly demonstrate the real benefit of be part of the union what assessment have the minister make of other potential export deal what step be he take to ensure that the ministry of defence take up those opportunity 
 the type deal with norway show what be possible when we have a determined export campaign we be look at work with a number of our european ally and ally far afield on export deal not just for our large platform such as warship but missile electronic system and a whole range of defence equipment to create more job here in britain i be happy to discuss that far with my hon friend 
 pension forfeiture for ex armed force personnel be rare it be usually reserve for case of serious criminal activity and those with serious criminal conviction but be it not time that the small number of ex force personnel from this country who be shamefully fight for the russian federation either directly in ukraine or through proxy in north africa and sub saharan africa have their pension cancel 
 the right hon member raise an interesting point please write to i in due course with example and we will look into that from a defence perspective 
 how will the defence industrial strategy which be most welcome ensure that more public money be spend with supply chain business in the uk particularly those in the teesside defence and innovation cluster in stockton billingham and norton 
 there be a real opportunity to grow far the directly support defence job in the north east i be happy to speak to my hon friend far about that may i encourage he to stay for the defence industrial strategy statement he will hear about the further investment and opportunity that the government hope to provide to every nation and region in the uk 
 an independent northern european nation of people norway have just sign an order for £ worth of the world ’s good anti submarine warfare frigate design and build in glasgow in scotland despite that despite scotland ’s long coastline and despite the ingenuity display in that product none of those type 26s unless i be wrong will be station in scotland would the minister like to tell i that i be wrong and that he be prepared to place type 26 on station in scotland in the future 
 the hon gentleman be a defence expert so he know well that the type 26 replace the anti submarine warfare type 23 in devonport where they will be base he also know that we have quick reaction fighter at lossiemouth and our royal navy submarine force base at faslane we have huge investment across scotland and we will do even more but while the government in holyrood which he back have dither on defence job this government have deliver extra defence job for scotland and will continue to do that 
 i recently meet my constituent lance corporal sarah bushbye who be only the ever woman to receive the military cross she share with i the difficulty of deal with the complex physical and psychological effect of her service and the transformative effect that the boulder crest foundation have on she in her recovery will the minister meet i and sarah to hear about the work of the foundation 
 i completely empathise with that veteran i be more than happy to sit down and talk through the pro of that treatment and to see if we can expand it far 
 fort blockhouse in gosport be due to have be sell by but the deadline keep move the defence infrastructure organisation have not be at all proactive   this giant site sit empty do nothing for the mod taxpayer or the local economy reform and then the government have suggest that site like blockhouse will be use for asylum accommodation gosport deserve so much well will the secretary of state meet i to discuss a much more innovative future for this important 
 order i have a lot of sympathy but please we have to be a bit quick otherwise nobody else will get in 
 i be happy to meet the hon member to discuss the opportunity to use the defence estate to contribute to growth in every part of the country include her 
 how will the government ensure that cammell laird ’s shipbuilding expertise and workforce be fully integrate into the defence industrial strategy in order to both strengthen sovereign capability and support skilled job in the north west 
 there be real expertise in and opportunity for our shipyard nationwide both those that support royal navy military vessel and those that spend much of their time work on royal fleet auxiliary vessel which be the backbone of the royal navy fleet there be a real opportunity in not just shipbuilde but ship repair i would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss those opportunity give that the labour conference will soon take place in liverpool perhaps i can pop over and see she 
 for many veteran hear loss be of the hide scar of service and in a number of case it have be link to defective m hearing equipment will the minister use their art of persuasion on the prime minister to ensure an independent inquiry so that we can find out the extent of this and see whether any other equipment be involve and how we can prevent it from happen again 
 anyone with hear loss from equipment can absolutely apply for compensation through the war pension scheme or the armed force compensation scheme broad work be happen on those specific bit of capability outside this place 
 i welcome the new defence technical excellence college just announce but we need a skill pathway right across the country i have be work with ads on a defence curriculum that could be deliver across college and university nationwide what plan do the minister have to support defence learning right across the country and will he meet i and ads to see if we can roll out a trial 
 my hon friend be simply prolific in the area in which she be seek to improve defence and i would be very happy to meet she to discuss this far there will be an announcement on skill in the defence industrial strategy that be come out this afternoon there be a real opportunity to expand this work not just in defence technical education college but in institution nationwide 
 will the secretary of state guarantee yes or no that no british serviceman or veteran will face prosecution for action take in northern ireland while serve their country 
 as have be mention as we go through the process we will ensure that protection be in place to look after our veteran the reality be i be be really honest that if people break the law they will be hold accountable but i assure the hon member that veteran who serve will be protect 
 young people in my constituency be cry out for decent well pay job especially in the defence sector so will the secretary of state agree to meet i to discuss the typhoon order that be desperately need not only for our country but for job across blackpool and lancashire 
 i will indeed and my hon friend will be encourage i hope by the visit i pay to turkey and the initial agreement that i have sign with turkey for a big new order of typhoons which will be build in lancashire 
 i look forward to the order 
 before we come to the urgent question i should remind hon member to avoid refer directly to criminal case that be currently before the court there be also an active application for judicial review relate to the proscription of palestine action i have decide to grant a waiver in relation to that case as it concern a matter of public order in which there be significant public interest member may therefore refer to that case 
 urgent question to ask if the home secretary will make a statement on the proscription of palestine action and public protest 
 anyone who wish to demonstrate about the humanitarian situation in gaza or the action of any government include our own have the absolute freedom to gather with other and voice their view provide that they do so within the law but support palestine and support a proscribe terrorist organisation be not the same thing the vitally important issue of palestinian right should not be co opt by organisation that have show that it be willing to use violence in pursuit of its cause the clear advice and intelligence give to the then home secretary early this year be that palestine action satisfy the relevant test in the terrorism act and should be proscribe 
 some of those hold placard in support of palestine action may not know the extent of its activity it have conduct an escalate campaign involve intimidation and sustained criminal damage include to britain ’s national security infrastructure some of its attack have involve the use of weapon result in alleged violence and serious injury to individual palestine action ’s member have be charge with violent disorder grievous bodily harm with intent actual bodily harm criminal damage and aggravate burglary charge that include in the assessment of the independent crown prosecution service a terrorism connection 
 these be not the action of a legitimate protest group and for a government to ignore expert security assessment advice and recommendation would be highly irresponsible be there to be far serious attack or injury question would rightly be ask about why action have not be take 
 the metropolitan police have confirm that a total of arrest be make at a demonstration in central london on saturday most of those be under section of the terrorism act for display article in support of palestine action people be arrest for other offence include assault on police officer as the metropolitan police have point out that be in stark contrast to the people who peacefully march and attend the palestine solidarity campaign demonstration 
 demonstration of this scale require a significant policing response the new home secretary join the commissioner of the metropolitan police on saturday to observe the force ’s operation and express her backing for the officer work tirelessly to enforce our law and to maintain order the fact that some officer be subject to violence and abuse be utterly shameful 
 it be completely understandable that people rightly feel very strongly about the situation in gaza but support or be a member of a proscribe terrorist organisation be a criminal offence and will never be acceptable regardless of the wide context we all want the suffering in gaza to end and the remain hostage to be return we all want to see peace i say to the house that we must keep our focus squarely on achieve those aim and not on harmful group that refuse to abide by our law and threaten our public safety 
 order i do not know who be do the speech but i be go to crack down on ministers and shadow ministers if they do not keep to minute i have to get back benchers in do the minister agree to stick to the time in the future 
 indicate assent 
 thank you i be glad that there be some acknowledgment 
 nearly people have now be arrest because of concern about proscription there be clearly a problem with violence and intimidation in our politic and we have to get this right because public confidence be fall too i be not here as a supporter or defender of palestine action and its tactic i condemn without hesitation abuse intimidation and attack on the police and any political opponent the case for act on the group itself be and be strong we have see a pattern of violence at its event and it have not dissociate itself from that violence but we also see police and refugee be target for violence alongside those who want to protest about immigration matter banner that say kill em all let god sort em out neo nazi group circle we can not ignore the impact on police on our street because of these incident but this be just not sustainable for our police or our criminal justice system 
 there be a difference between people protest use violence and people protest the use of proscription if we do not get the response right if we continue to arrest those in that secondary category the seriousness of the term terrorism risk lose its meaning and become dilute rather than strengthen proscription be suppose to be about stop those incite direct harm and violence go after somebody with a poster test the boundary of liberty many of whom be clear that they do not support palestine action but feel strongly about palestinian right or free speech confuse rather than clarify the government ’s intention people must be able to protest what be happen in gaza and the focus should be on what be happen in palestine not parliament square 
 i ask for this urgent question because i think it be for we to act legislation on public order focus on specific act proscription order target specific terrorist group nothing sit in between give that what discussion have the minister have with the police about distinguish between member of palestine action and people concern about proscription itself interruption the offence of recklessly encourage support of a proscribe group run counter to that focus on criminality if he will not abolish that offence will he at least set out guidance to the crown prosecution service and the police on any public interest test in use it the previous policing minister 
 order this be what happen i grant the urgent question because i think it be important to hear you and you be advise that it be minute i think you have now finish or be about to 
 i do apologise mr speaker i be advise that it be minute but that be my fault 
 terrorism be different from terrorise opponent but both should be criminal offence will the minister commit to a review of that section so that we can get it right for the sake of our democracy 
 order i believe the advice be correct to minute interruption that be correct i do not want my department to be blame 
 i be genuinely grateful to my hon friend for bring these issue to the house they be important and it be right that minister be hold accountable for they 
 i be sure that the whole house will agree with my hon friend ’s remark about violence and intimidation which have absolutely no place in our politic she will be aware that there be a significant body of work take place across government co ordinated by the defend democracy taskforce to ensure that all our elect representative be able to do their duty and represent their constituent without fear or favour the government take that very seriously indeed 
 my hon friend make a number of point and i will struggle to respond to all of they she will understand that the police be operationally independent of government but of course we remain in regular contact it be important to take this opportunity to thank the police for their important work they come under a huge amount of scrutiny rightly so but i think we see at the weekend an impeccable police operation in which brave officer stand and do their duty at least of whom be allegedly assault in the line of duty 
 the final thing to say to my hon friend relate to draw the distinction as she will well understand on the absolute right of anybody in our country to express their concern about the desperately difficult situation in the middle east and more specifically in gaza the ability to go to the street and join other in express individual or collective concern about unfold event be they in this country or far afield be a cornerstone of our democracy this government would never do anything to get in the way of that it be interesting that ten of thousand of people take to the street this weekend and be able to express their concern in an entirely lawful way 
 my hon friend ask about whether we be seek to review any element of the terrorism act it be worth point she to the recently publish article by jonathan hall kc the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation who say with regard to tackle palestine action that 
 there be no way ordinary criminal law would be effective against funding training and recruitment 
 the government must ensure public safety and that be what we will seek to do 
 i call the shadow home secretary 
 we in common i hope with everyone in this house fully and unequivocally support the right to peaceful protest include on issue in the middle east whether the hostage who remain captive or civilian in gaza whose plight concern we all however in exercise that right to protest violence be never acceptable palestine action have commit deliberate criminal damage against various premise use a sledgehammer to attack a police officer and deliberately sabotage raf plane no matter how strongly people feel about an issue and whatever the right and wrong of that issue use violence to advance a political agenda be never acceptable it be not how we do thing in this country we settle thing through debate and election 
 the security minister have give the house assurance about the necessity of this measure i have not be brief or be offer a briefing on that but the minister command widespread respect across the house and member will take his assurance seriously will he give an assurance that the police be take all possible preventive action against palestine action where it may be plan future attack against premise or future act of violence include use the offence of conspiracy to commit public nuisance under which the police have wide range power i join the minister in extend my thank to the police for the difficult work they do keep we safe 
 finally i will use this opportunity to express my support for a protest that take place on sunday in parliament square and the campaign against antisemitism march which i address it be regrettable that neither the home secretary nor a senior minister address that march so will the security minister take the opportunity to express the government ’s resolve to combat antisemitism wherever it be find 
 i be grateful to the shadow home secretary for his remark and the tone of they on his final point yes let i take the opportunity on behalf of his majesty ’s government to state our absolute abhorrence of antisemitism wherever it rear its ugly head i hope he know that the government will do everything we possibly can to stand against the force of racism wherever they seek to rear their ugly head 
 i completely agree with the right hon gentleman that violence be never acceptable in pursue a political agenda and i be pleased that we be able to establish a consensus across the house in that regard on his point about briefing we brief the shadow minister ahead of the proscription action back in july and as he know i would be happy to brief he on privy council term whenever he should wish i be also able to give he the assurance that he seek about the work the police be do as a former home office minister he know that the police be operationally independent but i assure he that the police will be take all necessary measure to guard against future attack i be happy to speak to he about those matter far and i be grateful for his support for these matter today 
 as i understand conviction simply for display the name of a proscribe group have be extremely rare unless there have be clear evidence of intent to promote   a group ’s more extreme action if that be the case and as it be clear that the act of protest and civil disobedience see in recent day be not act that would ordinarily form part of a case for proscription why do the police not simply stop the arrest 
 i take the opportunity to acknowledge the difficult job that the police do in my experience recently and over a long period the police have do an excellent job often under very difficult circumstance it be important that we consider proportionality these operational judgment have to be make by the police often on the ground and often under pressure or in difficult circumstance it be also important that we consider that we would not tolerate the kind of activity that we have see in recent day and week from an organisation that be motivate for example by islamist extremism or by an extreme right wing ideology similarly we can not tolerate that activity from palestine action and this government will support the police in do the difficult job that we have ask they to do 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 the right to peaceful protest be a cornerstone of a liberal democracy but event over the weekend have set a dangerous precedent and risk have a chilling impact on free speech and legitimate protest in the uk the arrest of protester under terror law follow hundred of arrest under the same power last month be deeply alarming the lib dems warn that that would be exactly what happen when the conservatives expand terrorism power in there be no doubt that those use violence antisemitic abuse or hate speech must face the consequence but those crime be already cover by exist law it can not be right that simply display a placard in support of a proscribe organisation while peacefully protest can result in a conviction and up to month in prison will the minister urgently review terrorism legislation specifically as it be impact the right to protest peacefully to ensure it be proportionate and contain the nuance that it so clearly need 
 i be grateful to the hon lady as always for the sensible and reasonable tone in which she make her remark but i have to say that i do not agree that the event of this weekend have have a chilling effect on our democracy i think it be quite the opposite ten of thousand of people come to london to exercise their absolute right to demonstrate on matter about which they be concern the overwhelming majority of people who come to london be able to do so in an entirely reasonable and lawful way only a very tiny minority be not able to do so in that way and deliberately seek to get arrest 
 the hon lady ask entirely reasonably about necessity and proportionality and about whether the government intend to review exist legislation she have raise that point previously we have discuss it and i know that the leader of her party   the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey raise it over the summer recess of course we look very carefully at legislation but the government do not currently have any plan to amend the exist legislation not least in the light of the ongoing criminal proceeding relate to palestine action and the ongoing judicial review it would not be appropriate to carry out a review at this time 
 we think that the uk ’s counter terrorism legislation strike the right balance between protect national security and individual freedom include the right to the freedom of expression under article of the european convention on human right the hon member for hazel grove know the high regard in which i hold jonathan hall the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation and she know that the legislative framework be subject to independent statutory oversight by the independent reviewer the government will of course consider any recommendation that he seek to make i have advise the hon lady previously to get in touch with he i think that she have and i know that she will want to look very carefully at what he say 
 those arrest be merely hold sign wear t shirt and display general support for a group that do not come close to the loose definition of terrorism meanwhile political pundit and columnist seem free to discuss palestine action without fear of criminal prosecution i do not think that anyone should face arrest for do that but it do not seem fair that people can get away with it as long as they be do it in front of a tv camera will the minister explain how the law be be apply whether it be be apply fairly and where people be allow to show support for palestine action it be clear that some people be be allow to do it but other be not 
 my hon friend have a long stand interest in and concern about these matter i give she an absolute assurance that the law be be apply fairly i say to she i know that she will agree with this that nobody be above the law it be important to think about how we collectively seek to respond to those who behave in a similar way but underpin by very different cause such as extreme islamist terrorism or an extreme right wing ideology if people be demonstrate on behalf of those organisation in the same way that we have see people demonstrate in support of palestine action i think people would absolutely want the police to act in the way that they see they act over the weekend i say again the law be be apply fairly nobody be above the law and the police need to be able to ensure that they be able to enforce it without fear or favour and that be what i think they do over the weekend 
 i call the chair of the home affairs committee 
 the burden of police these protest be fall on certain force more than other that be also the case during the disorder last summer can the minister give some reassurance that the home office be provide the support that be need to those force to ensure that they can manage the protest and so that their do so do not distract from day to day policing 
 the chair of the select committee make an important point yes i can give she the assurance that she seek the right hon lady be right that recent activity have provide particular burden on particular force the home secretary and i and of course the policing minister and colleague right across government work very closely with the police and we will ensure that they have the necessary resource for the important job that they have to do 
 last august a police officer be hospitalise after be hit with a sledgehammer while respond to a palestine action attack on a business near bristol a fact that be absent from our debate when we vote to proscribe that organisation recently the attacker have sledgehammer axis whip and other home make weapon do the minister agree that that cross the line of any legitimate protest into terrorism 
 yes i would 
 the minister have say that no be above the law and that violence be never the answer i agree with he and i know that he believe that the law should be wield with integrity so when be we go to see the proscription of violent settler group in the west bank many of whom be perpetrate a reign of terror on innocent palestinians in that part of the world but who may be garner support and raise fund in the united kingdom 
 the right hon gentleman be an experienced member of this house and have serve as a minister in the home office so i be sorry to have to put my response to he in this way but he will understand why i do so we never comment about matter relate to future proscription i know that his word will have be hear by colleague in other government departments as well as in my department he make his point with great consistency he have raise they with i previously but i know that he will understand that there be a long stand protocol across a number of government that we do not talk about future proscription activity 
 i thank the minister for his response to the urgent question but i concur with some of the comment from my hon friend   the member for walthamstow ms creasy   about people be arrest include my constituent some of whom be protest peacefully 
 i want to come back to the issue of the impact on frontline policing as a central london mp i be see resource be draw away from my local police to deal with the protest my constituent want those frontline police officer to be solve crime on their street the minister will understand the sheer scale of their concern about ensure the police can get to grip with that locally return to the point make by the chair of the home affairs committee will the minister assure i that those ongoing discussion with the police be happen include with the chair of the metropolitan police federation who say on the world at today that the protest be not sustainable 
 my hon friend raise a very important point as do the chair of the home affairs committee she will absolutely understand the importance that this government attach to the safe street agenda i can give she an assurance that we be work very closely with the metropolitan police and other police force around the country to ensure that they have the resource they need to police these kind of protest and activity alongside the other activity that they be require   to police the home secretary the policing minister and i take these matter very seriously we meet senior representative of the metropolitan police just last week but i give my hon friend an absolute assurance that we will ensure that the police have the necessary resource to do the job that we ask they to do 
 give the scale of arrest over the weekend and the minister state that he have no intention to review legislation will he commit instead to an independent review of the use of terrorism legislation against people peacefully protest to see if it be fit for purpose 
 i be grateful to the hon lady for her question i hope that she hear the response i give a moment ago that it would not be appropriate to get into a review process at this particular moment because of ongoing legal proceeding we be incredibly fortunate to have jonathan hall kc as the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation he bring a weight of authority and credibility to the process i know that he have particular view on the issue and i invite she and other member to look closely at what he have say about it 
 do the minister agree that the continue mass arrest of peaceful protester many of whom be protest about the proscription of palestine action but would not for a moment support the activity of palestine action be something that we should distinguish and that we should advise prosector and the police about not least because the furore around the arrest risk drown out the rightful protest about the difficult situation in palestine and gaza to which the minister have refer 
 my hon friend raise some really important point for clarity it be an offence to display support for palestine action but it be not an offence to criticise the government ’s decision to proscribe so difficult judgment often have to be make by the police on the ground let i give she a categorical assurance that this government will do nothing to get in the way of somebody ’s absolute right to protest about a matter about which they be concern in many respect it be incredibly heartening to see ten of thousand of people take to the street to express their concern in an entirely peaceful and lawful way and i hope that will long continue 
 as i have indicate previously i have my doubt about whether the terrorism label be most suited to a group that be certainly criminal certainly violent and arguably seditious in its attack on the asset of our military but i have a positive suggestion to make will the minister undertake fully to brief the chairman and member of the intelligence and security committee which i use to chair but on which i now no long serve if they be able to see information that the minister can not share publicly and say to we that they be satisfied with the terrorism designation i for would find that reassure 
 i be always very grateful to the right hon gentleman who speak with a real wisdom about these matter and i can give he those assurance we have be in contact with the committee which he use to chair it consist of some incredibly experienced and   wise parliamentarian and we seek to take their counsel at every opportunity so yes we have engage with they and will continue to do so on this matter and other 
 while palestine action wag its campaign of intimidation and go about damage military basis with very little impact in the middle east this week the government will host president abbas and president herzog for discussion on a more peaceful future for palestinians and israelis alike do the minister agree that unlike palestine action this government be actually take genuine and serious step to support peace in the middle east 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for his comment and i completely agree i think there be an absolute point of consensus in this place and i hope much far afield about the urgent need to secure peace in the middle east this government lead by the prime minister the foreign secretary and colleague in the foreign commonwealth and development office will do everything we possibly can to support that important process 
 the optic of octogenarian priest be arrest alongside hundred of peaceful protester be absolutely awful for this government we have only arrest over the weekend in scotland because police scotland seem to deploy a much more conciliatory and community base approach do the minister support operational independence across the uk if police force feel it be in their interest to have different policing arrangement from the metropolitan police will he support they and say that there will be no government interference in their operation 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his engagement over the course of the summer i can give he an absolute assurance yes of course we believe in the absolute importance of the operational independence of the police they have to make some very difficult judgment but i hope he agree that nobody should be above the law there be not an age limitation with regard to these offence the police have difficult judgment to make but in the main they have act proportionately and without fear or favour in the good tradition of british policing 
 this weekend alone almost people several of whom be from my constituency be arrest the terrorism act be not bring in to arrest vicar retired grandmother and nhs consultant for hold a placard yet the police be now in the position where that be exactly what they be do weekend after weekend will the minister consider the view of international human right expert like the un human rights commissioner who have describe the ban as disproportionate and unnecessary will he also acknowledge our concern that political decision must be open to political challenge otherwise we risk a massive loss of confidence in our democracy 
 i completely agree with the point about political challenge that be why we be here today to debate the decision and the policing around it i hope my hon friend will understand that the government   have act in good faith as we always seek to do the advice that the government receive be clear and unambiguous palestine action be concern in terrorism and its member have demonstrate a willingness or intention to conduct in pursuit of its cause serious violence against person under those particular circumstance the government have a responsibility and a duty to act 
 as i have mention previously and my hon friend will know the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation have be widely quote about his response to the action that the government have take he conclude in a recent article that there be no way that ordinary criminal law would have be effective against this organisation 
 do the minister agree that while in this case proscription may be a finely balanced decision the law must be uphold whether you like it or not whoever you be and wherever you be do he therefore share my concern that in this case there appear to be some regional disparity in the interpretation of the law as evidence by the different rate at which people be arrest across this country at the weekend 
 as always i be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question and i acknowledge his assessment of the decision as be finely balanced as i know he will understand should this or any government have take a different approach we would no doubt have be in this chamber debate why the government have decide to not proscribe these be difficult judgment but under the circumstance i have describe the then home secretary do exactly the right thing in take the decision she do
