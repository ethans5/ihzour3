 i thank my hon friend for raise that point and the connection to weston super mare there be a lot of work that we can do to support innovation across the whole country include through the business innovation grant that i mention which be especially for small and medium sized enterprise it offer grant of up to £ to enable those enterprise to come into the market 
 beyond its excellent university northern ireland be home to major innovative business such as wrightbus spirit aerosystems and harland wolff which specialise respectively in hydrogen vehicle composite wing and aerostructure manufacture and modular construction and shipping give the economic importance of those business can i ask the uk government to look again at the future of the whole site operation at spirit as well as at harland wolff to ensure that those investment and job stay in northern ireland 
 i thank my hon friend for raise the important aspect of business innovation and for mention those business which be important to northern ireland ’s economy we be work with the northern ireland executive to ensure the good outcome for short brothers and its staff in relation to spirit the department for business and trade remain in contact with spirit airbus boeing and other potential buyer we want to see an outcome that include a commitment to develop short brothers and its supply chain as part of any acquisition and that provide the good possible opportunity for growth in northern ireland the department for business and trade continue to provide over £ of support for short brothers research and development activity 
 across these island northern ireland be at the forefront for fibre broadband due to our confidence and supply deal with the previous government can the minister indicate what be be do to promote this golden innovative opportunity nationally which would help small business right across northern ireland 
 this government be work across the whole of the uk to promote those business and the industrial strategy provide an excellent opportunity to have this discussion the uk government be work with business trade union local and devolved leader expert and international partner to develop that international strategy which will cement this work and growth growth drive sector have be identify include some that my hon friend   the member for warwick and leamington matt western   have already identify advanced manufacturing clean energy industry creative industry and so on the transition to net also provide huge opportunity and we will make the most of they 
 have the minister yet study the national semiconductor strategy for ireland publish by the irish government if so can she say how northern ireland will be able to exploit that strategy and how the whole of the united kingdom will be able to compete with ireland which have plainly identify this as an important growth sector 
 i thank the right hon member for raise that issue this be an excellent opportunity to raise something that i have not yet look at i will go away and study it because it sound like a very important aspect of our joint working we have many international business opportunity to work with our counterpart in the republic of ireland and i will take it up with they as well 
 may i associate myself with the condolence to the widow and family of the late ken reid the family be constituent of mine in north antrim and ken be such a part of the political architecture 
 on innovation there be no great trailblazer in northern ireland than wrightbus in my constituency which have really set the pace on hydrogen how far have the government invest in advance that and in ensure that public fund when they be need be there to build the hydrogen infrastructure that be so key to advance that matter 
 i thank the hon and learn member for rightly sing the praise of wrightbus the transition to net present huge opportunity as he have identify for business like wrightbus in ballymena it be produce low carbon bus secure job in its factory and create additional job across the uk supply chain this show that northern ireland be lead the way and we will continue to work on such opportunity through our industrial strategy

 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue i would like to start by pay tribute to anna lo who pass away early this month as the ethnic minority politician elect to the assembly she be a trailblazer and i extend my sympathy to her family and friend 
 the northern ireland assembly currently have no member from ethnic minority or ethnic minority background i have meet many community group that have raise this matter with i the key to change it be the membership and selection process of the political party in northern ireland and we should think about what we can all do as member to speak with people from ethnic minority background and represent they 
 i wish the secretary of state a happy birthday for yesterday—[interruption and a happy lancashire day to you mr speaker 
 i join the minister in pay tribute to anna lo anna be the non white member of the assembly but she can not be the last i urge the minister to encourage all party in the assembly to redouble their effort to ensure that all the people of northern ireland can look to their assembly and see someone like they 
 i recently meet lilian seenoi barr the mayor in northern ireland from an ethnic minority background who be show the way for other i agree that people must see themselves represent so i join my hon friend in urge all party across northern ireland to look at their selection process and their invitation to meeting and to make sure that all party welcome everyone from every background 
 jay basra be a year old ulster unionist candidate who run in mid ulster at the last general election jay describe himself as punjabi british when he announce his candidacy he receive a torrent of online abuse which he describe as dehumanising and abhorrent he say 
 it reduce i down to my skin colour rather than myself as a person 
 however he have also say 
 if anything i ’m even more determined to run again and increase the ulster unionist vote like i do in the general election 
 what word of encouragement do the minister have for people such as jay 
 i be horrified to hear of that online abuse and i be horrified to hear of any abuse that any politician receive i commend jay for his courage in say actually this be not put i off i want to stand again the hon member be quite right to raise this matter as we would all want to do and to show support for jay and other who want to be able to say that they can stand and not receive such abuse we should call it out whenever we see it 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the autumn budget on northern ireland 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the autumn budget on northern ireland 
 what assessment he have make of the impact of the autumn budget on northern ireland 
 this government be provide the executive with an £ funding settlement for this represent a £ increase on this year and be the large settlement since devolution it be now for the executive to decide how the funding be spend 
 of the central aspect of the reconciliation process arise from the good friday agreement be the need to facilitate and encourage integrate education so will the secretary of state join i in welcome the continue support for integrated education in the autumn budget 
 i certainly will and i be grateful to my hon friend for raise that issue poll after poll in northern ireland show that there be strong support for integrated education from the public from memory about of pupil study in integrated school and i hope we would all like that number to increase last week my hon friend the under secretary of state for northern ireland and the education secretary visit an integrated school the education secretary be i think the minister apart from myself who have visit northern ireland since the election 
 do the secretary of state agree that the recent budget give the northern ireland executive the opportunity to really go for growth after many year of uncertainty 
 i do there be no doubt that the funding the northern ireland executive receive as a result of the budget be more than they have anticipate but all government be about make choice with the resource we have and the income we can raise and decide what our priority be the budget provide a sound foundation for the northern ireland executive to take the decision they need to take 
 do the secretary of state agree that to ensure sustainable finance the northern ireland executive need to set out clear step to reform both the nhs and broad public service 
 i do agree with that as my hon friend and the house will know the long waiting list in the health service in the united kingdom be to be find in northern ireland that be not acceptable above all for those people who be wait far too long there be a plan for reform which i welcome but the people of northern ireland want to see progress happen 
 just last week i attend and speak at a rally host by the ulster farmers union in response to the change to agricultural property relief it be attend by farmer with every political party in northern ireland stand together in opposition to the change when will the government acknowledge that their figure be not reflective of the average farm and that this death tax will result in the break up of family farm as we know they the selling of land to pay the tax and the purchasing of devalue land by big business that be not interested in use it to feed our nation will the secretary of state outline whether he have share the concern of northern ireland farmer with the chancellor 
 i have speak to the secretary of state for the environment food and rural affairs and a treasury minister about this i understand that the change be unwelcome and difficult but give the fiscal position the government be have to take difficult decision there be however a difference of view about how many farm will be affect and the treasury estimate be about claim a year we can not infer from land value an inheritance tax liability because it depend on the ownership structure of the farm 
 the secretary of state know that there be extra funding for the running of the police service of northern ireland and about the   issue with police recruitment but there be also the issue of not have a new police college will he give a commitment that he will speak to the minister the deputy minister and the justice minister to ensure that that police college be build at kinnegar 
 that be an issue for the executive but as the hon member allude to the position on police funding have be improve with additional money be give to the psni by the executive out of extra funding that the budget provide the uk government have also increase the additional security funding that be give in recognition of the security need in northern ireland 
 with mile between my constituency of dumfries and galloway and northern ireland i know how much we have in common unfortunately we also share the fact that hospitality business in northern ireland and much of scotland be not benefit from a discount on business rate bill that can not be call headwind to quote van morrison it be a full force gale do the secretary of state agree that by increase employer national insurance contribution rather than grow the economy on both side of the north channel we be threaten job stop investment jack up price and put business viability at risk 
 the business i meet in northern ireland be vibrant and look forward to the future of course the increase in employer national insurance contribution present challenge for some business but there be no get away from the fiscal inheritance that this government find when we arrive in office the foundation have to be fix and that be what we be do 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i associate conservative members with the remark that the under secretary of state make about ken reid he will be very much miss a belated happy birthday to the secretary of state for yesterday 
 last week the secretary of state suggest to the northern ireland affairs committee that the treasury have not yet conduct a detailed analysis of how the budget will affect farmer in northern ireland have he now ask it to do so 
 the treasury have conduct an analysis of the overall number of farm that it think will be affect it be important that people look at all the arrangement that we have put in place include how as the hon gentleman will know individual can pass £ on to family member and couple up to £ when all the allowance be add together as well as interest free payment over year of course land transfer year before death can go to child with no inheritance tax pay 
 i should have congratulate the hon gentleman on his double hatted appointment he be shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster as well as shadow secretary of state he will now have many a merry conversation with himself about the windsor framework 
 and i hope conversation with the secretary of state he will know that the make up of farming in northern ireland be slightly different from that in the rest of the uk there be a great density of farm in sole ownership and agricultural land be worth more that mean that farm in northern ireland be more expose to labour ’s family farm tax the farmer i have meet in northern ireland be deeply concerned about that 
 as the secretary of state say there be disagreement nationally about the figure on side we have the government who say that not many farm will be affect on the other side we have the expert who say that very many farm will be affect transparency will help everyone will the secretary of state commit to ask the chancellor to publish detailed treasury work on the budget ’s impact on farm in northern ireland so that independent expert can check their figure 
 to understand the impact we have to look at the ownership structure of each individual farm i be not entirely sure whether the hon gentleman be advocate that the government should do that for all farm right across the country it will be for farmer to look at the arrangement that will apply from and to take advice on how they can ensure that they can continue to pass their family farm to their child and grandchild 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 total income from farming in northern ireland fall by last year amid volatile market soar cost and decline output more than northern ireland farmer recently gather in the eikon exhibition centre to highlight the impact that the change to agricultural property relief will have on their sector with dairy farming face serious economic challenge and gross agricultural output decline can the secretary of state commit to publish a full impact assessment of apr removal for northern ireland ’s farming sector as well as its wide implication 
 as i indicate in answer to the same question a moment ago until we understand the ownership structure of each farm i do not see how an impact assessment that would answer the hon member ’s question could be do now that farmer know what the new arrangement be go to be i urge they to take advice there be a number of thing that they can do last week i meet the ulster farmers union and a number of young farmer and i be in no doubt about the concern that they have express it be really important that we discuss it on the basis of the fact and that people look at how they can plan for their future 
 what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on the future of city and growth deal in northern ireland 
 it be a pleasure to sign the head of term document for the mid south west growth deal alongside the minister deputy minister and minister for finance on   november these deal be a partnership   between the northern ireland executive the uk government local authority and business the aim of our joint investment in all deal be to encourage economic growth in northern ireland 
 as a member of the business and trade committee i be pleased that belfast have see a successful economic redevelopment partly drive by embrace its heritage which will now be far support by the belfast region city deal do the secretary of state agree that we must continue to support heritage as a regenerative tool in northern ireland and the wide uk with deal like this 
 i agree these deal be all about partnership and place include their heritage all those be an integral part of the approach in belfast the city deal be roar ahead with thing such as the advanced manufacturing centre and considerable investment in digital 
 i appreciate the government ’s focus on growth especially green light the city and growth deal and their transformative impact on our often overlook economy and infrastructure the forthcoming windsor framework review present an opportunity to look not just at east west trade which be important but at other overlook issue to allow we to realise the growth potential of our unique trading arrangement will the secretary of state consider ambitious term of reference for that review to allow we to maximise growth and innovation by explore issue such as dual market access and north south co operation 
 as set out in law whether there be an independent review depend on the outcome of the consent vote that will take place in the northern ireland assembly the government would be under a legal obligation to commission a review if it be not pass with cross community consent i would expect the review to focus on article to of the windsor framework but it would be for the reviewer to consider how they conduct it 
 i associate myself with the minister of state ’s remark about ken reid he be a colossus of northern ireland politic and journalism more broadly across the country i thank she for those comment 
 the secretary of state will know that get the city and growth deal back on track be good follow the disappointment of the pause that follow the incoming government he will also know that there be a commitment in the spring budget to support a skill and education centre at the crusaders football club for £ that remain paused i think the minister of state have take an interest in that project and i would be keen for the secretary of state to confirm that he will raise it with the deputy prime minister 
 i be aware of the pause that affect the particular project to which the right hon gentleman refer consideration will then have to be give to how that may or may not be take forward but i note his interest and i will follow development carefully 
 the secretary of state know that city and growth deal be about economic growth and ensure prosperity within northern ireland be he aware of the concern among business in england wales and scotland who be say that as a result of the general product safety standard emanating from the european union they can not send their product to northern ireland that be in stark contrast to the british government ’s position to maintain standard on ce marking with the european union what advice and support can he give those business in northern ireland who want to trade and to consumer who want to buy in their own country but be currently frustrated from do so 
 advice be be provide about the general product safety regulation many company already meet its term because they be export from the uk to the european union there be step that some business will have to take but i hope the impact will be very small because there be a way to get through it 
 what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on tackle violence against woman and girl

 what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on tackle violence against woman and girl 
 white ribbon day this week mark the start of day of activism against violence against woman and girl the scale of this violence in our country be unacceptable and this government be treat it as the national emergency that it be every woman and girl deserve to feel safe wherever she be that be why the labour government have set out our ambition to halve violence against woman and girl within a decade the government want to take a join up approach across the uk and i have discuss this issue with the and deputy ministers and the deputy prime minister we will continue to work collaboratively with the executive 
 order we want to get to pmq but we will not achieve it at this rate 
 accord to women ’s aid a of all crime in northern ireland be domestic abuse we know that paramilitary organisation make reporting confront or escape such abuse even more difficult how be the government work with the northern ireland executive to break down those coercive barrier to support for woman and girl

 the theme of this year ’s white ribbon day be it start with man do the minister agree that it be incumbent on we all especially man to play our part in stamp out violence against woman and girl wherever we find it how be she work with the executive in northern ireland to deliver on our share mission and do exactly that

 do the minister agree that the low number of police officer in northern ireland hinder the fight against violence against woman and girl will she work with the executive to ensure that the number of officer be increase to the recommend 
 action by police officer be fundamental and we be look at how we can change the justice system as we be do across the uk as our target to halve violence against woman and girl be essential it be however about much more than that it be about a whole of society change and tackle misogyny wherever we see it every organisation need to get involve in this action by the police be part of it but it be about so much more than that 
 i call the shadow minister

 yes we will do so i agree that the last government totally fail to tackle the unfairness of the leasehold system we will provide homeowner with more power protection and data right by bring that legislation forward 
 i call the leader of the opposition 
 at the cbi conference on monday the chancellor say 
 i ’m clear i’m not come back with more borrowing or more taxis 
 i know that tell the truth to the house be important to the prime minister so will he repeat his chancellor ’s pledge now 
 we set out our position at the budget that be just set out we be fix the foundation we be deal with the £ black hole that the conservatives leave i be not go to write the next year of budgets at the dispatch box we say that we would not hit the payslip of work people we pass the budget we invest in the future and we keep that promise 
 the prime minister be not fix any foundation he be make everything bad the whole house will have hear he refuse to repeat the chancellor ’s pledge a pledge as worthless as the manifesto promise that he be talk about if he be fix foundation why be it that the pmi index show that business confidence have crash since the budget 
 we be fix the foundation we get record investment into this country the right hon lady talk about tax rise week ago she stand there and say that she want all the investment and all the benefit of the budget but she do not know how she be go to pay for it i notice that have come here criticise the national insurance rise over and over again on monday she admit that she would not reverse the position meanwhile her shadow science minister be say energetically that he would do the opposite they have not get a clue what they be do 
 if the right hon and learn gentleman want to know what conservative would do he should resign and find out hon member more 
 i ’ll decide when there ’s more 
 until then i be the ask the question there be a petition out there with people ask the right hon and learn gentleman to go he be the who do not know how thing work it be not government who create growth it be business his minister for employment   the hon member for birkenhead alison mcgovern i do not see she here want more young people in work but business say that they be cut job because of the chancellor ’s   budget his deputy prime minister ’s employment rights bill she be not here will stop business hire that be what they say the cbi say on monday that the dot of the government ’s policy do not join up it be right be n’t it 
 on monday the right hon lady say that she would not reverse the increase in national insurance yesterday on their predecessor legacy legislation the opposition could not decide what their position be today they have launch a policy commission ask other people to give they some idea for government 
 the right hon lady talk about a petition we have a massive petition on   july   in this country we spend year take our party from a party of protest to a party of government they be hurtle in the opposite direction 
 what a load of nonsense we have a budget in march this year and tractor be not blockade the street of whitehall afterwards 
 let i give the prime minister another example of a real business follow his budget the head of mcvitie ’s say that it be hard to understand what the case for investment in the uk be while the prime minister have be hobnob in brazil business have be struggle to digest his budget be it not the case that the employment rights bill show that it be not only the ginger nut that be cause he problem 
 i be attend the g20 summit i suspect that on their current trajectory the opposition do not know whether they would attend the g20 perhaps the policy commission will come up with an answer on that 
 we have have record overseas investment in this country the right hon lady keep carp from the sideline she say at the dispatch box that she want all the benefit of the budget all the investment but she do not want to pay for any of it she have rack up £ of unfunded commitment in just week as leader of the opposition when it come to the economy we be the one who be grow the economy 
 the investment for which the prime minister be take the credit be our work when i be the business secretary we negotiate those deal that he announce the bottom line however be that in all that he have say he do not seem to care about the young people who will lose their job as a result of his budget perhaps he can show concern for the people who find out yesterday that they could lose their job at vauxhall ’s plant in luton while he fly around make unilateral commitment back at home the real world effect be business close in bedfordshire and basildon do he stand by his promise to ban the sale of petrol car by even if more job will be lose interruption 
 i would not normally invite a heckle but that be accurate 
 the question of the position of job in luton be a very serious family and worker will be very worried and we be engage with they but i remind the leader of the opposition that the electric vehicle mandate that be an issue in this particular case be   introduce by the last government i also remind she that she be the business secretary who introduce they we be get on with support those community while she be shout from the sideline 
 the prime minister clearly do not read his briefing about the ev mandate the fact be that we change the date and make it easy for people everything he have do have attack people the budget be an attack on farmer an attack on worker an attack on pensioner an attack on the young and an attack on thousand of charity and business across the country the whole system be break and the prime minister be make thing bad everyone be unhappy be it not a good thing that the chancellor be an expert on customer complaint 
 i think the right hon lady have just read out the charge sheet against the last government everything be break but the opposition come here every week with absolutely nothing to offer except complaint nothing constructive no new idea they do not know what they be do from day to the next they be live in a fantasy world in which everything be fine apparently for year well the country be feed up with those fantasy it have get rid of those fantasy we be go to take the hard decision the opposition be jump on every pass bandwagon while we be take the country forward 
 as we enter the last week of islamophobia awareness month the prime minister will know that this year have be extraordinarily difficult for british muslims on the receive end of society ’s most deplorable attitude they have be consider easy prey for the far right and scapegoate by politician endorse institutional islamophobia the reality be that the emboldening and normalisation of islamophobia as highlight in a number of report lead to the race riot that we see on the street of britain this summer when mosque and those who be visibly muslim be subject to despicable attack with many left fear for their life will the prime minister condemn those in public office and position of power who actively promote islamophobia will he commit to adopt a definition today and will he far outline what concrete step the government be take to rip out islamophobia at its root include in this place 
 my hon friend be right to raise islamophobia there have be a concern rise in islamophobia and antisemitism over recent month and we be commit to tackle all form of hatred we will work with other on an ongoing basis to make sure that we do 
 i call the leader of the liberal democrats 
 may i associate myself with the prime minister ’s remark about the terrible impact of storm bert and all the flooding our thought be with all those affect with thank to our amazing emergency service 
 christine ’s father be tell that he need end of life care but after a few day it be remove due to funding cut he be tell that he would not get it and he die a   few week later in excruciating pain christine say that it be terrible to watch he suffer do the prime minister agree that whatever the house decide on friday it be urgent that we improve access to high quality end of life care will he make that a key focus of the year nhs plan and will he now commit to protect hospice from the national insurance rise 
 i thank the right hon gentleman for raise that case and i be sure the thought of the whole house be with the family involve obviously there be a very important vote on friday but whichever way that vote go we must invest properly in care across our health service that be why in addition to put the nhs back on its foot we be put forward a year plan to make sure that the nhs can give the care that everybody would expect across the spectrum include end of life care 
 i thank the prime minister for his reply i hope that we will hear more from minister particularly on hospice and national insurance in the day to come 
 i turn to the cost of living crisis on friday ofgem say that energy bill will go up again in january after last month ’s rise million of people be really worried about how they will make end meet this winter not least hundred of thousand of pensioner who be in poverty but above the pension credit limit who will now lose winter fuel payment with energy bill go up again will the prime minister reconsider and restore winter fuel payment 
 obviously the whole house be concerned about energy bill which be actually low this year than they be last year the long term way to deal with this issue be to have clean power by to make sure that we drive energy bill down on a permanent basis and that be what we will do on the winter fuel allowance the right hon gentleman know very well what the government ’s position be indeed i have rehearse it with he many time 
 antisocial behaviour involve modify and off road bike be a menace and have a huge impact on community such as mine in sunderland although i welcome the work that northumbria police do in partnership with our council they need strong power and more resource can the prime minister outline how he will back the police to tackle the misery cause by intimidate and downright dangerous antisocial behaviour on bike 
 i thank my hon friend for raise this issue because antisocial behaviour affect so many people sometimes it be describe to i as low level but its impact be not particularly when it come to off road bike that be why we be implement tough new respect order which will give power to the police include power to seize off road bike and crucially a power of arrest for breach of order something that have be miss in recent year we will tackle this problem because it blight community across the country 
 as everyone in the house will be aware we be currently in the middle of the bbc ’s scam awareness week the advice in that context be always simple if you see a scam you should report it with that in mind can the prime   minister advise the house whether he be aware of anyone who have promise to reduce energy bill only for they to increase be he aware of anyone who promise to back business only to tax business and be he aware of anyone who promise to protect pensioner only to pick their pocket for their winter fuel allowance 
 it be very—[interruption 
 order those in the gallery will not clap or interrupt the proceeding 
 i be very glad to see the right hon gentleman in his seat in the house and i be sure that many of his colleague in scotland share that sentiment what i can point to be a government in scotland that promise to take scotland forward and take it backwards so i can identify the and it be right there 
 november mark islamophobia awareness month last year the united nations human rights council adopt a resolution condemn the desecration of religious text include the koran despite opposition from the previous government act of such mindless desecration only serve to fuel division and hatred within our society will the prime minister commit to introduce measure to prohibit the desecration of all religious text and the prophet of the abrahamic religion 
 i agree that desecration be awful and should be condemn across the house we be as i say before commit to tackle all form of hatred and division include islamophobia in all its form 
 sarah and her family have farm beef cattle in my constituency for over year and they have always plan for her sister to continue the family legacy early this year sarah ’s mother die suddenly and unexpectedly she be just sarah say to i that despite already have a tragic year it be make even bad after the budget she say

 my hon friend be right to say that the criminal justice system be break by the last government like everything else they touch in the past year we take the issue extremely seriously we have make a commitment to halve violence against woman and girl we be take a number of measure in relation to that for example pilot domestic abuse protection order and make it clear that we will introduce a stand alone offence of spike those be some of the measure that frankly we ought to be able to work on across the house because the issue be of such importance

 this be a very serious issue we have provide £ of support to the energy sector in ukraine which be be target by the russian strike i will ensure that my hon friend get a meeting with the relevant minister i be pleased that on this issue there be unity across the house in our defence of ukraine in the face of russia ’s aggression 
 after year of neglect under the previous conservative government gp surgery be at break point and across north east hampshire they be prepare now for huge bill to pay increase employer ’s national insurance contribution hart health partnership in fleet estimate that this will cost it nursing salary and it have already reduce staff hour by per week with more cut due in january can the prime minister please tell gps in my constituency which patient service they should cut in order to pay the bill

 we   recognise that labour be determined to defend the economically disastrous conservative policy of be   outside the custom union and single market however do the prime minister agree with the principle that where it be in our country ’s interest to maintain alignment with eu standard so that we can well sell our product internationally we align and where it be in our interest to diverge we diverge 
 i certainly agree that the deal we get under the last government be not the good deal that we can get that be why we be determined to reset the relationship and we have already begin that obviously there will be no return to freedom of movement the customs union or the single market but beyond that we can increase and improve the situation whether on trading security or other co operation and we be actively work on that

 i do agree with that and it be the rule rather than the exception when it come to the snp government the challenge for they now be that they have the power to act and they have now be give the money to act they have run out of excuse 
 that complete prime minister ’s question 
 with permission mr speaker i wish to make a statement on the announcement by stellantis yesterday on the future of its manufacturing site in the united kingdom 
 i know that yesterday be a dark day for luton this be an iconic plant power by a talented workforce there be very few people in the town who do not know someone who work at the site i wish to outline the step that the government have take to try to prevent this outcome and how we be go to support the industry and the area go forward 
 the transport secretary and i find out about the challenge of this site just day after the election the global chief executive officer tell we that he feel extremely frustrated by the lack of action from the previous government which mean that his desire be to close the luton plant since then we have be involve in intense negotiation with the company to try to find a way to keep the site open follow these initial meeting in july of this year the company announce its intention to conduct a review of its operation in response to the significant pressure that it be face in key market follow the review the company set out plan on tuesday which will see manufacturing at the current stellantis plant consolidate into a single location 
 we be and be aware that stellantis have significant excess capacity across europe the company ’s talk of efficiency and investment elsewhere will of course be positive for its bottom line but that will come as no comfort to the worker affect 
 for more than a century vauxhall as a brand have be synonymous with luton and we be bitterly disappointed to hear that this relationship look likely to end our no priority be the people of luton who will of course be devastate by this decision news such as this rip through the heart of community send shock wave beyond those immediately impact through their family their community and the business that they support i grow up in a car community and know what it be like when half the street work at the same site 
 we have ask the company to urgently share its full plan with we and to work with the government so that every single worker who be impact receive the support they deserve the department for work and pensions stand ready to help anyone affect with a rapid response service design exactly for these kind of scenario it provide vital support and advice to both employer and their employee face redundancy 
 i want the house to be aware that we have do everything we possibly can to prevent this closure my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport and i meet stellantis many time over the summer and again on tuesday morning to discuss the situation and the acute pressure that the company be face we have work hard to find a solution that would support the business and ensure that people keep their job and we confirm in write that we be willing to consider any solution put forward 
 however despite our good effort we have be force to accept that this be ultimately a commercial decision by stellantis as it respond to wide challenge within   the sector and i will be frank with hon member these challenge be not confine to any company car manufacturer around the world be battle with increase cost supply chain issue and change consumer demand in a highly competitive fast evolve market hon member will know that last week ford also announce job loss in the uk over the next year as part of a major restructure programme across the whole of europe many of the challenge face by our car manufacturer be global in nature and they can not be resolve by uk government intervention alone 
 although this announcement be not what we want or what we work towards we must not mischaracterise this it categorically do not signal a retreat by stellantis from the uk the plan announce by the company will also see it invest £ as it consolidate manufacture at its ellesmere port plant in cheshire hon member will know that ellesmere port be the uk ’s all battery electric vehicle plant and stellantis ’s decision to bring production of the vivaro electric van to there be welcome we will of course continue to work closely with the company on next step of the consolidation process include the proposal to offer affected worker a relocation package to take up role at ellesmere port the investment be make at ellesmere port and elsewhere demonstrate that there be real opportunity for uk manufacturing as part of the move to emission vehicle but the transition have to be properly manage that require a government who be on the pitch something that the car industry finally have in this government 
 the government be determined to support automotive company as they revamp their production line adjust their business plan and develop the technology need for the next generation of emission vehicle these car and van be greener clean and essential to our net ambition roughly of the uk ’s greenhouse gas emission come from car van and lorry to tackle that and wean our country off import fossil fuel we need emission vehicle but the government be resolute that the transition must be do in partnership between government industry and of course consumer that be why the secretary of state for transport and i be listen closely to the concern of the automotive industry and the wide sector about the transition to electric vehicle and about the conservative party ’s emission vehicle mandate 
 we hold a roundtable early this month to hear directly from major automotive company the society of motor manufacturers and traders and the charge sector and in response we will shortly fast track a consultation on our manifesto commitment to end the sale of new pure petrol and diesel car by we will use that consultation to engage with industry on the previous government ’s zev transition mandate and the flexibility in it and we will welcome the industry ’s feedback as we move forwards we want to do everything that we can together with industry to secure further investment in the british automotive sector now and over the long term that be why in the budget the chancellor commit £ to research and development and capital funding to support the emission vehicle manufacturing sector and supply chain 
 also our industrial strategy will give the automotive sector the certainty that it deserve and will send a clear signal to global boardroom that the government be in   this for the long term we want to invest alongside they create a policy environment that allow they to prosper and help they to do what they do well bring good job to every part of this country through the national wealth fund we be unlock billion in private investment in new green infrastructure include gigafactorie and support growth and job creation not just in the automotive sector but in the wide economy we be work with investor to build a globally competitive electric vehicle supply chain in the uk and so be lay the foundation for growth over the long term 
 the closure of the luton plant by stellantis be a bitter blow to our car industry to luton and to the worker who make vauxhall a world class brand produce world class car and van but we must not lose sight of the fact that those vehicle will continue to be design and build here in the uk at ellesmere port that matter to i and it matter to the government when i say that decarbonisation must not mean deindustrialisation i mean it win the race to net and have a world lead automotive sector must go hand in hand we must never undermine the transition as the previous government do but we will be pragmatic in ensure that regulation and incentive be work as they should contrived culture war be not what the industry need instead it need a partner in government ready to look at the practical solution that be necessary we stand ready to do that and i commend this statement to the house 
 i call the shadow secretary of state 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement this be a sad day for the worker at the luton vauxhall factory and our thought be and foremost with they and their family they be the most recent custodian in a long history that go back to when their factory open its door for the time luton build white van be icon of british business represent to many the hard graft and skill of million of trader the self employ and small business across this country 
 the opposition stand by those hard work people we be on the side of the plant worker because we know the value of skilled work and the transformative power of british business the closure of the luton plant i fear be just a down payment on the job that will be lose through this government ’s relentless attack on industry their neglect of the reality of business and their failure to meet their promise not to raise taxis the government owe it to the plant ’s worker to at least be honest this decision be the direct result of a government policy that be simply unworkable for industry stellantis tell we as much when it say that the decision be 
 make within the context of the zev mandate 
 the society of motor manufacturers and trader say 
 the uk situation be particularly acute with arguably the tough target and most accelerate timeline in the world 
 and that 
 unsustainable business cost undermine uk industry 
 the government ’s policy on emission vehicle be a job killer they say they have be talk since july so why this panic u turn today when it be already    too late the last government acknowledge that the previous vehicle mandate be too stringent we take the decision to push it back recognise the impact that it would have on industry we listen to unite the union on this the secretary of state ’s party unilaterally reverse those change and bring the deadline forward to instead of listen to unite he listen to   the member for climate central the right hon member for doncaster north ed miliband 
 even today the secretary of state speak of end the sale of new purely petrol and diesel car by he try to slip a subtle change in there the consequence of which be significant i welcome the fact that for once this government have listen to business but he appear to be mislead business at the same time can he explain exactly what his policy be as we see today there be real cost to these target instead of have the courage to recognise that he be wrong his solution appear to be yet another consultation which be yet to take place how many automotive business have the secretary of state speak to about the target in any of his conversation with stellantis do it ask he at any point to remove the fine have he meet the right hon member for doncaster north to entreat he to row back from his ideological pursuit of domestic target which ignore the fact british job be be export to more carbon intensive economy 
 most of all we must not ignore the elephant in the room the timing of the decision it follow a budget that declare war on business with a triple whammy of tax rise that remove incentive for growth and investment a £ job tax which have leave boardroom across the country put recruitment and pay rise on hold and an employment rights bill that the secretary of state write while hand in hand with his union paymaster which be already deter business from hire in britain 
 business be ring the alarm bell the cbi the british retail consortium ukhospitality and the society of motor manufacturers and traders have all say that the pressure on business be too much to swallow in open letter after open letter statement after statement they say that labour be not on their side it lie about its plan it be attack work people and now it be attack the van that they go to work in the businessman and woman who give labour the benefit of the doubt be regret it when will the secretary of state listen when will his government abandon their attack on british business will he lead the charge to change course why will he not suspend the fine and target that have lead to today ’s tragedy 
 that be the single most dishonest statement i have ever hear in my time in this house 
 order i be sure the right hon gentleman will withdraw that comment 
 mr speaker i would like to clarify some of the point that the hon gentleman raise the zev mandate policy is—[interruption 
 order we be on the same side we will be quiet will not we 
 the zev mandate policy that the shadow minister mention be a policy of the previous government as he be aware the change that the previous government make be not to the zev mandate   they be not pragmatic about it they change the destination and keep the fine the ramp up and the threshold exactly the same they allow no flexibility or pragmatism in how the policy operate but still undermine the transition lead to a massive reduction in consumer confidence he ask whether i have talk to industry i be the guest speaker at the smmt dinner last night people be there from every bit of the automotive sector they be absolutely clear they support the destination it be how the previous conservative government ’s policy operate that be cause they the problem as i say in the statement as he would know if he be listen or have read it in advance day into this government we be tell that the plant be likely to close 
 labour have act with pragmatism we have be willing to look at any part of the policy to prevent this outcome the simple truth be that it be too late after year of failure to put this right i say to the hon gentleman with all politeness that he be out of touch with industry with worker and even with what the previous conservative government do and that speak for itself 
 i call the chair of the select committee 
 this be indeed a hard day for luton i welcome what the secretary of state share with the house and the review of the emission mandate that he announce in that review i hope that he look again at the perversity of the regime that he inherit which could involve petrol engine maker in this country transfer credit to company like elon musk ’s tesla and to chinese ev maker if we really want to ensure a level playing field why do we not reverse the decision of the last secretary of state follow the eu commission and launch anti subsidy investigation into chinese ev maker the trade remedies authority be ready to go it just need the secretary of state to give the green light 
 i be grateful to the chair of the select committee include for the exchange that we have in the committee evidence session yesterday he be right that because of the position we inherit the issue with the flexibility in the policy and the fact that no domestic producer be on track the transfer he describe be effectively the problem that be why i say that decarbonisation can not mean deindustrialisation it be precisely what we inherit that we be critique we do not want to undermine the transition in the way the previous prime minister do anyone in industry in the sector could tell conservative member how disastrous that be but we need to give a breathing space and ensure that the policy have none of the perverse incentive that he describe 
 on subsidy the trade remedies authority and the potential response from the uk we have to bear in mind thing under the system that we inherit industry make the application i have power to do that as secretary of state but they have never be use to my knowledge secondly we must remember that the uk automotive sector be a world class export lead sector if we be to go down any kind of protectionist   route on principle we would have to bear in mind what it would mean for the market we sell vehicle into if we sell of our product abroad we have to consider the international export position alongside the domestic market position if industry make that request of course that request will be follow up in accordance with the way the system operate 
 i call the liberal democrat spokesperson 
 i thank the secretary of state for advance copy of his statement yesterday like the secretary of state i attend the society of motor manufacturers and traders annual dinner and i greatly appreciate the opportunity to hear directly from such an important sector for the british economy uk car manufacturing bring billion of pound into our economy it employ hundred of thousand of people directly and many more thousand across its supply chain it be at the forefront of the green transition and of make transport sustainable for the future via electric vehicle most importantly the industry be always willing to be frank with i and with other politician it reaffirm to i that it see major hurdle on the horizon and the closure of vauxhall ’s year old factory in luton be a sign of great trouble ahead 
 inevitably the conservatives will play politic with the announcement but there be still no apology from they for trash the economy there be not moment of reflection that the previous government ’s policy on electric vehicle be a disaster the policy simply do not do enough on infrastructure and incentive the government therefore need to fix the tories mess as a starting point the government urgently need to work with vauxhall to mitigate this major shock for the area the government have say that they will fast track a consultation but it need to be fast track today urgency be the key so when will that consultation start and when do the secretary of state expect it to report the previous government do not do enough to incentivise people to buy electric vehicle nor do they provide the right infrastructure what be the government do to increase sale of electric vehicle and increase the number of charge point in place such as my constituency 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question and observation and apologise that he have have to hear i speak twice on this topic in the short period of time between last night and today he have ask the conservative party to apologise for its economic record that case stand for itself but i would also like to know give how urgently this issue be present to we as a new government what the last government be do at the end of their time in office what do they know what conversation be they aware of certainly we inherit a position of extreme frustration from the company and i can not imagine that that frustration have not be convey in some way to our predecessor 
 turn to the hon gentleman ’s specific question there be policy in the budget relate to charge infrastructure which i recognise be a key part of this issue as well as £ for research and development through the automotive transformation fund and the partnership with business that we use that fund for obviously the consultation he ask about will come   from the department for transport the shadow secretary of state   the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith ask why that consultation be happen but the previous government set these policy out in primary legislation so he know that there be process to follow any conversation about the threshold in the exist policy would be for my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport to have but i refer back to my point about how the system work and the flexibility and allowance in and how we can make sure that we be give automotive manufacturer in the uk a system that let they get to the transition they and the consumer want but in a way that work with industry to enable that transition to happen for the benefit of the united kingdom 
 i call rachel hopkins 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as a trade union member as well as someone with friend who have hear that they have lose their job 
 close the luton site will damage our local economy with more job at risk in the supply chain and worker and family receive this devastating news just before christmas i welcome the comment of the secretary of state that decarbonisation must not mean deindustrialisation and the decimation of good skilled job will his announcement today move the dial in discussion with stellantis to help protect the luton site i also welcome his tone he be take this seriously compare with opposition member so will he join i in visit worker and their trade union representative at the luton site to listen to their concern 
 i be extremely grateful to my hon friend for her question i believe everyone in the house who care about the automotive sector and work people in this country will share the sentiment she have express about the scale of what this decision will mean for luton i can absolutely promise she that i will take up her invitation to come with she to the site i can also promise she the full deployment of my department and indeed all of my colleague across government to provide whatever help be require we be in conversation with stellantis as be the union i believe about the detail of the package that will be present to the workforce but of course i will engage closely with my hon friend and with my hon friend   the member for luton north sarah owen   to make sure that package be to the maximum benefit of her constituent and the wide area 
 as a bedfordshire mp i know how significant the vauxhall plant be to our local economy and as a local employer the secretary of state have explain how devastating this decision will be for family locally not just in luton but in my constituency unfortunately though he have say very little about how he be go to support the people who be lose their job be the secretary of state concern that this government ’s tax on job will make it much more difficult to replace these manufacturing job in bedfordshire 
 i be grateful to the hon gentleman for his sentiment but the straightforward answer to that question be no this be a skilled and talented workforce these worker have not lose their job because of any deficiency on their part rather they have be put in this position by a combination of factor include the overcapacity in europe to be frank from the minute we come into office i think the company already intend this closure it have nothing whatsoever to do with government policy i recognise the pressure arise from the exist policy we have inherit hence the pragmatism on our part as a government to make sure the policy be work for the transition but i have no doubt that whether these worker choose to take advantage of the relocation offer or of demand elsewhere they be brilliant talented people who will be in demand 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests before i start i want to put on record that the people who will be lose their job in luton today deserve much well than the response from the conservative front bench representative it be very far from factual and very far from serious 
 i thank the secretary of state for his statement and welcome any support for vauxhall worker and their family who be understandably devastate by stellantis ’s decision especially this close to christmas it follow the closure of the skf plant in luton north early this year after a century of manufacturing like skf vauxhall be or be synonymous with luton stellantis ’s callous decision will impact our whole town our whole region even so what support will be offer not just to the skilled and dedicated vauxhall worker who be lose their job but to our town as a whole to cope with the loss of this manufacture giant that luton help build 
 i be grateful to my hon friend for her question as well and echo the sentiment i express to her constituency neighbour my hon friend   the member for luton south and south bedfordshire rachel hopkins this whole decision be regrettable but its timing be particularly regrettable as i say in my statement since the new government come into power on   july we have do everything we can to try to avoid this decision i reiterate the offer i have make throughout the negotiating process both in policy flexibility and potential new government investment in the site but regrettably it be not possible to change the decision 
 i have make clear the support that be available and i reiterate that promise i do not want to minimise the impact of this decision in any way but i believe my hon friend ’s area be a place of considerable economic strength with firm in the engineering aerospace and air travel sector and in the creative industry there be a lot to be optimistic about for the future but i recognise that that do not take away the bitterness of this particular blow for luton at this time 
 i make it clear that conservative members regard this as a very grave matter we be take it seriously and we be also deal in fact turn to veracity then can we hear whether or not stellantis raise the question of the eye water zev mandate fine and ask for they to be lift 
 yes in the conversation we have with representative of stellantis they raise every aspect of the previous government ’s policy include the flexibility the ability to cap and trade and some of the allowance and what they would mean for the bottom line i take those concern seriously which be why i be willing in a way that do not undermine the destination to consult on how this policy work alongside my colleague the secretary of state for transport although i understand the previous government ’s aspiration and why they introduce this policy i do not think that when that decision be make they consider the kind of fall demand that we have see in europe we have to work pragmatically across all bit of government to make sure this policy do not lead to the kind of outcome that many of we who be aware of how exactly this sector work be concerned about 
 i refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests i welcome the secretary of state ’s statement and be greatly sadden by stellantis ’s decision may i suggest that plant and platform rationalisation would have be a major factor let we be honest the industry want certainty but automotive manufacturer face the challenge of meet the zev mandate introduce by the last government which be more stringent than that in europe and most other market put simply consumer uncertainty be introduce by the last government so i find the remark of the shadow secretary of state disingenuous 
 order disingenuous be aim at a particular person we do not do that you have be here long enough to know that and i be sure you want to withdraw that comment immediately 
 i withdraw it mr speaker thank you 
 i urge the government to introduce more flexibility in the annual target from to introduce consumer incentive and consider redirect any penalty towards ev charging infrastructure not to chinese government car company 
 my hon friend make some very good point about the fact that while nearly every major market have policy of this kind our operate in a different way from how the french for example proceed with theirs i agree that the major failing of the former prime minister ’s speech be to keep this policy in place but change the destination that make no coherent sense whatsoever logically he should have do or the other do both undermine confidence while still not provide the pragmatic flexibility we be talk about today the specific point that my hon friend have mention will all be part of the consultation that my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport will lead on 
 i assure the secretary of state that i would have put the question i be about to ask to a conservative minister equally if all british car manufacturer come together and tell the government that they could not possibly meet this goal would the government nevertheless persevere in maintain it as an immovable target 
 i would recognise the right hon gentleman ’s fairness and equity whichever side of the house he be sit on and i have no doubt about that 
 we do listen to those in industry and we have a very close relationship with they which be why we understand that the destination they want be the pressure on the system in the next few year be because of this situation but i say this in good faith to conservative member i do not believe that the ministers at the time consider the full set of european and global economic factor when make these decision that be why we have to get the balance right give that we be an export lead automotive producer we should also recognise that if we be not ambitious about the transition we would lose our export market we would not have anything to sell because other country have such policy and that be where the consumer be go this be about how we support the transition and we be work closely with they industry on that 
 i draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as a member of unite the union 
 i thank the secretary of state for come to the house on such a difficult day for the car industry and all our thought be with the worker in luton today i thank he for the work he be do in engage with the industry and with union on a well way forward on electric vehicle target this news be really disappointing but do he agree that we can and should be positive about the future of the automotive industry in this country it matter to i locally as the mp for many business in the automotive supply chain as i know it also matter to many member across the house 
 i thoroughly agree with the content and sentiment of my hon friend ’s question the support this government be commit to be about that transition but we should be excite by what british manufacturer such as jaguar land rover nissan and toyota be do and at the luxury end of the market about mclaren and rolls royce supercar i could mention all of our iconic brand and there be a lot of exciting thing go on if hon member be not aware of that all those manufacturer be more than happy to host member of parliament come to visit so i encourage people to do so however they will explain the pressure they be under in the short term and they will endorse the change of policy this government be put forward 
 the electric vehicle association say that non governmental organisation think tank and campaign group be advocate for uphold the zev mandate we have just see the most devastating storm which have be dangerously accelerate by climate change i know that the government know that net be not negotiable the previous government persistently undermine the motor manufacturing industry will this government listen to the electric vehicle association which after all be support this government in their ambition to get to net 
 i genuinely appreciate the question come from that perspective but this be not just about ngos we have be in close contact with big business about charge infrastructure and i understand the   importance of that i want to make it clear that that be why we be not undermine transition but be ambitious with the industry about where we will get to nothing we propose as a government will itself reduce or limit the deployment of electric vehicle what i be talk about and what we be talk about as a government be look at how for instance the flexibility in the system operate we be do everything we can alongside industry to get to that destination 
 i want nothing to do with the approach of the previous government which have a really detrimental effect on the industry as it will tell any hon member very clearly i be listen to what it mean to have this change in economic circumstance in relation to private demand for electric vehicle and i want to work with industry to get to the place or the destination that i think we both strongly support 
 the previous government be warn before the election include multiple time in this chamber about the damage they be do to the car industry the constant change of policy on net miss target on the roll out of charge point and the failure to even allocate the rapid charging fund have all undermine consumer confidence will my right hon friend make sure that as soon as possible after his review he balance the need of manufacturer of car and van with the need of consumer 
 i believe my hon friend ’s analysis be absolutely right and he and i be in the chamber on several occasion when that case be make to the previous government the intervention from the former prime minister be not base on any kind of business or economic logic but be an attempt to create some sort of wedge issue before the election frankly that do they absolutely no good because people see straight through it i say again that to change the deadline but keep the exist threshold in place up until be the bad of all world it really do have a negative impact on consumer confidence and we will never repeat those mistake 
 the secretary of state say in his statement that at the time of the election stellantis be minded to close the plant however since the election we have have the budget which have impose £ of increase taxis on business and the employment rights bill which will also increase cost on business enormously both have lead directly to a collapse in business confidence do the secretary of state think that those decision help stellantis to stay or go 
 i can tell the hon member categorically that those decision have no impact whatsoever this be the crucial point i hear conservative member say this but do they have any idea about employment condition in the automotive sector those condition be well above the floor that the employment rights bill will raise they to in the united kingdom they should get out and talk to industry and have such conversation please 
 to be clear on the wide point the hon member make about business confidence i recognise that the outrageous inheritance this government walk in on    with conservative ministers not even plan to say how they would pay for the promise they have make create speculation about where the revenue would come from i regret the fact that we have to make difficult decision ideally we would not have want to make those decision but we be the people fix the foundation and clear up the mess the conservative party leave behind there can be no long term prosperity unless we have a serious government willing to do that 
 i refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests 
 i be sure the whole house will want to join i in pay tribute to my good friend my hon friend   the member for luton south and south bedfordshire rachel hopkins who be a fierce champion for her constituent do the secretary of state agree that the news yesterday only highlight far the urgent need for a uk industrial strategy and demonstrate the challenge that uk industry face under the last government without such a strategy in place
